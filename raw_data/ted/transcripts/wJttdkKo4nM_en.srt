1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So it was about four years ago, five years ago,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with a bag similar to this.

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but your body knows it extremely well.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Actually our body doesn't hate these.

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Our body loves these. It eats them.

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on the cell, it means "that's food."

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
immune response to this ridiculous molecule

18
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.

19
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But I said we can't get rid of it,

20
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves

21
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
found out you can't get rid of that immunity.

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I said, why don't you use that?

23
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
What if I could stick this molecule,

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
slap it onto a bacteria

25
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?

26
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I mean I could immediately tap into

27
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
an immune response that was already there,

28
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it --

29
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.

30
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you,

31
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.,

32
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,

33
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and then charges you for possession of marijuana.

34
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.

35
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So you can take a bacteria

37
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that really doesn't make these things at all,

38
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and if you could clamp these on it really well

39
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you have it taken off the street.

40
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And for certain bacteria

41
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.

42
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Our antibiotics are running out.

43
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.

44
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now --

45
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant --

46
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because we won't be here. But if we are --

47
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.

49
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So I started working with this thing,

50
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
with a bunch of collaborators.

51
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And trying to attach this to things that were

52
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
themselves attached to certain specific target zones,

53
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
bacteria that we don't like.

54
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And I feel now like George Bush.

55
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's like "mission accomplished."

56
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.

57
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.

58
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.

59
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there,

60
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
sort of symbolizing this right now.

61
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.

62
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically

63
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to a target that you have selected for it.

64
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like,

65
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular,

66
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.

67
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.

68
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.

69
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body,

70
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and will alert your immune system to go after it.

71
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Here's what happened. See that line on the very top

72
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
with the little dots?

73
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned

74
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
by our scientist friends down in Texas,

75
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.

76
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made

77
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that would attack anthrax in particular,

78
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and direct your immune system to it.

79
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line --

80
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that's a 100 percent survival rate.

81
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And they actually lived another 14 days,

82
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or 28 when we finally killed them,

83
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.

84
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Why did they not die?

85
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.

86
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So we did it. Okay?

87
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Applause)

88
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Mission accomplished!

89
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Applause)

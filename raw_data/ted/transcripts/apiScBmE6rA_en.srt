1
0:00:15.17,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, stepping down out of the bus,

2
0:00:18.151,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I headed back to the corner

3
0:00:19.896,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to head west en route to a braille training session.

4
0:00:23.284,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It was the winter of 2009,

5
0:00:25.394,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I had been blind for about a year.

6
0:00:27.815,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Things were going pretty well.

7
0:00:29.948,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Safely reaching the other side,

8
0:00:31.855,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I turned to the left,

9
0:00:33.316,000 --> 0:00:35,000
pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal,

10
0:00:35.92,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and waited my turn.

11
0:00:37.844,000 --> 0:00:39,000
As it went off, I took off

12
0:00:39.933,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and safely got to the other side.

13
0:00:41.606,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Stepping onto the sidewalk,

14
0:00:43.702,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I then heard the sound of a steel chair

15
0:00:46.396,000 --> 0:00:5,000
slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.

16
0:00:50.552,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I know there's a cafe on the corner,

17
0:00:52.469,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and they have chairs out in front,

18
0:00:54.115,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so I just adjusted to the left

19
0:00:55.511,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to get closer to the street.

20
0:00:57.355,000 --> 0:01:,000
As I did, so slid the chair.

21
0:01:00.995,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I just figured I'd made a mistake,

22
0:01:03.076,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and went back to the right,

23
0:01:04.914,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.

24
0:01:08.409,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now I was getting a little anxious.

25
0:01:10.774,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I went back to the left,

26
0:01:12.387,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and so slid the chair,

27
0:01:13.676,000 --> 0:01:15,000
blocking my path of travel.

28
0:01:16.284,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now, I was officially freaking out.

29
0:01:19.286,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So I yelled,

30
0:01:20.871,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?"

31
0:01:24.132,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Just then, over my shout,

32
0:01:26.384,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I heard something else, a familiar rattle.

33
0:01:29.069,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It sounded familiar,

34
0:01:30.915,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I quickly considered another possibility,

35
0:01:32.778,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I reached out with my left hand,

36
0:01:34.709,000 --> 0:01:37,000
as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy,

37
0:01:38.113,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I came across an ear,

38
0:01:40.664,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.

39
0:01:44.926,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Its leash had been tied to the chair

40
0:01:46.915,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as her master went in for coffee,

41
0:01:48.652,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and she was just persistent in her efforts

42
0:01:50.444,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear.

43
0:01:53.782,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Who knows, maybe she was volunteering for service.

44
0:01:56.394,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

45
0:01:58.773,000 --> 0:02:,000
But that little story is really about

46
0:02:01.182,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the fears and misconceptions that come along

47
0:02:04.381,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with the idea of moving through the city

48
0:02:07.284,000 --> 0:02:08,000
without sight,

49
0:02:08.607,000 --> 0:02:1,000
seemingly oblivious to the environment

50
0:02:11.568,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and the people around you.

51
0:02:14.468,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So let me step back and set the stage a little bit.

52
0:02:18.369,000 --> 0:02:2,000
On St. Patrick's Day of 2008,

53
0:02:20.928,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I reported to the hospital for surgery

54
0:02:23.515,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to remove a brain tumor.

55
0:02:25.709,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The surgery was successful.

56
0:02:27.796,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Two days later, my sight started to fail.

57
0:02:30.965,000 --> 0:02:33,000
On the third day, it was gone.

58
0:02:34.487,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Immediately, I was struck by an incredible sense

59
0:02:36.584,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of fear, of confusion, of vulnerability,

60
0:02:40.473,000 --> 0:02:42,000
like anybody would.

61
0:02:42.922,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But as I had time to stop and think,

62
0:02:45.414,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I actually started to realize

63
0:02:47.165,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I had a lot to be grateful for.

64
0:02:50.089,000 --> 0:02:52,000
In particular, I thought about my dad,

65
0:02:53.085,000 --> 0:02:55,000
who had passed away from complications

66
0:02:55.282,000 --> 0:02:57,000
from brain surgery.

67
0:02:57.385,000 --> 0:03:02,000
He was 36. I was seven at the time.

68
0:03:02.476,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So although I had every reason

69
0:03:05.169,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to be fearful of what was ahead,

70
0:03:07.401,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and had no clue quite what was going to happen,

71
0:03:10.035,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I was alive.

72
0:03:11.793,000 --> 0:03:13,000
My son still had his dad.

73
0:03:14.505,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And besides, it's not like I was the first person

74
0:03:16.392,000 --> 0:03:17,000
ever to lose their sight.

75
0:03:18.005,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I knew there had to be all sorts of systems

76
0:03:20.154,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and techniques and training to have

77
0:03:22.471,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to live a full and meaningful, active life

78
0:03:25.033,000 --> 0:03:26,000
without sight.

79
0:03:26.635,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So by the time I was discharged from the hospital

80
0:03:28.782,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a few days later, I left with a mission,

81
0:03:31.486,000 --> 0:03:33,000
a mission to get out and get the best training

82
0:03:33.616,000 --> 0:03:38,000
as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life.

83
0:03:38.78,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Within six months, I had returned to work.

84
0:03:42.828,000 --> 0:03:43,000
My training had started.

85
0:03:44.43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I even started riding a tandem bike

86
0:03:46.09,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with my old cycling buddies,

87
0:03:47.715,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and was commuting to work on my own,

88
0:03:50.412,000 --> 0:03:52,000
walking through town and taking the bus.

89
0:03:52.887,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It was a lot of hard work.

90
0:03:55.65,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But what I didn't anticipate

91
0:03:57.917,000 --> 0:03:59,000
through that rapid transition

92
0:04:00.889,000 --> 0:04:03,000
was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition

93
0:04:04.637,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience

94
0:04:08.577,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of the same places and the same people

95
0:04:11.25,000 --> 0:04:14,000
within such a short period of time.

96
0:04:14.753,000 --> 0:04:15,000
From that came a lot of insights,

97
0:04:16.649,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or outsights, as I called them,

98
0:04:18.146,000 --> 0:04:21,000
things that I learned since losing my sight.

99
0:04:21.535,000 --> 0:04:23,000
These outsights ranged from the trival

100
0:04:24.502,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to the profound,

101
0:04:26.167,000 --> 0:04:28,000
from the mundane to the humorous.

102
0:04:28.735,000 --> 0:04:31,000
As an architect, that stark juxtaposition

103
0:04:31.752,000 --> 0:04:33,000
of my sighted and unsighted experience

104
0:04:34.266,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of the same places and the same cities

105
0:04:36.551,000 --> 0:04:38,000
within such a short period of time

106
0:04:38.564,000 --> 0:04:4,000
has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights

107
0:04:40.77,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of the city itself.

108
0:04:43.944,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Paramount amongst those

109
0:04:45.818,000 --> 0:04:46,000
was the realization that, actually,

110
0:04:47.812,000 --> 0:04:5,000
cities are fantastic places for the blind.

111
0:04:51.752,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And then I was also surprised

112
0:04:54.073,000 --> 0:04:57,000
by the city's propensity for kindness and care

113
0:04:57.441,000 --> 0:05:,000
as opposed to indifference or worse.

114
0:05:00.921,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And then I started to realize that

115
0:05:02.684,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it seemed like the blind seemed to have

116
0:05:04.673,000 --> 0:05:08,000
a positive influence on the city itself.

117
0:05:08.742,000 --> 0:05:11,000
That was a little curious to me.

118
0:05:11.996,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Let me step back and take a look

119
0:05:14.556,000 --> 0:05:19,000
at why the city is so good for the blind.

120
0:05:19.918,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss

121
0:05:23.54,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,

122
0:05:27.411,000 --> 0:05:3,000
things that you would otherwise maybe ignore.

123
0:05:30.637,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's like a whole new world of sensory information

124
0:05:33.182,000 --> 0:05:34,000
opens up to you.

125
0:05:34.631,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I was really struck by the symphony

126
0:05:36.159,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of subtle sounds all around me in the city

127
0:05:39.135,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that you can hear and work with

128
0:05:40.427,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to understand where you are,

129
0:05:42.309,000 --> 0:05:44,000
how you need to move, and where you need to go.

130
0:05:45.114,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Similarly, just through the grip of the cane,

131
0:05:47.838,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,

132
0:05:51.752,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and over time you build a pattern of where you are

133
0:05:54.186,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and where you're headed.

134
0:05:55.728,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Similarly, just the sun warming one side of your face

135
0:05:58.62,000 --> 0:06:,000
or the wind at your neck

136
0:06:01.449,000 --> 0:06:03,000
gives you clues about your alignment

137
0:06:03.649,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and your progression through a block

138
0:06:05.342,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and your movement through time and space.

139
0:06:08.847,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But also, the sense of smell.

140
0:06:11.28,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Some districts and cities have their own smell,

141
0:06:13.981,000 --> 0:06:16,000
as do places and things around you,

142
0:06:17.022,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose

143
0:06:18.814,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to that new bakery that you've been looking for.

144
0:06:22.243,000 --> 0:06:23,000
All this really surprised me,

145
0:06:23.952,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because I started to realize that

146
0:06:26.957,000 --> 0:06:28,000
my unsighted experienced

147
0:06:29.51,000 --> 0:06:31,000
was so far more multi-sensory

148
0:06:31.945,000 --> 0:06:34,000
than my sighted experience ever was.

149
0:06:34.97,000 --> 0:06:36,000
What struck me also was how much the city

150
0:06:37.71,000 --> 0:06:38,000
was changing around me.

151
0:06:39.342,000 --> 0:06:4,000
When you're sighted,

152
0:06:41.079,000 --> 0:06:43,000
everybody kind of sticks to themselves,

153
0:06:43.268,000 --> 0:06:44,000
you mind your own business.

154
0:06:45.081,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Lose your sight, though,

155
0:06:46.348,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and it's a whole other story.

156
0:06:49.147,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And I don't know who's watching who,

157
0:06:50.626,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me.

158
0:06:54.175,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,

159
0:06:56.323,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I'm getting all sorts of advice:

160
0:06:59.352,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Go here, move there, watch out for this.

161
0:07:01.672,000 --> 0:07:03,000
A lot of the information is good.

162
0:07:03.749,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.

163
0:07:06.235,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You've got to figure out what they actually meant.

164
0:07:09.804,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.

165
0:07:13.357,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But it's all good in the grand scheme of things.

166
0:07:16.368,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But one time I was in Oakland

167
0:07:17.904,000 --> 0:07:19,000
walking along Broadway, and came to a corner.

168
0:07:20.791,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,

169
0:07:23.598,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and as it went off, I was just about to step out into the street,

170
0:07:26.084,000 --> 0:07:28,000
when all of a sudden, my right hand

171
0:07:28.116,000 --> 0:07:29,000
was just gripped by this guy,

172
0:07:29.796,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk

173
0:07:32.208,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and was dragging me out across the street,

174
0:07:33.882,000 --> 0:07:35,000
speaking to me in Mandarin.

175
0:07:36.134,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:37.542,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's like, there was no escape from this man's death grip,

177
0:07:41.681,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but he got me safely there.

178
0:07:43.404,000 --> 0:07:45,000
What could I do?

179
0:07:45.754,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But believe me, there are more polite ways

180
0:07:47.55,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to offer assistance.

181
0:07:49.723,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We don't know you're there,

182
0:07:51.245,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so it's kind of nice to say "Hello" first.

183
0:07:53.225,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"Would you like some help?"

184
0:07:55.361,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But while in Oakland, I've really been struck by

185
0:07:58.412,000 --> 0:08:,000
how much the city of Oakland changed

186
0:08:01.03,000 --> 0:08:03,000
as I lost my sight.

187
0:08:03.532,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I liked it sighted. It was fine.

188
0:08:05.699,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's a perfectly great city.

189
0:08:08.275,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But once I lost my sight

190
0:08:09.544,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and was walking along Broadway,

191
0:08:11.859,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I was blessed every block of the way.

192
0:08:15.07,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"Bless you, man."

193
0:08:16.624,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"Go for it, brother."

194
0:08:18.887,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"God bless you."

195
0:08:20.637,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I didn't get that sighted.

196
0:08:22.497,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:23.833,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And even without sight, I don't get that in San Francisco.

198
0:08:30.158,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I know it bothers some of my blind friends,

199
0:08:33.15,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it's not just me.

200
0:08:34.743,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Often it's thought that

201
0:08:36.792,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that's an emotion that comes up out of pity.

202
0:08:39.936,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity,

203
0:08:43.049,000 --> 0:08:46,000
out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.

204
0:08:46.159,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In fact, if I'm feeling down,

205
0:08:48.019,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,

206
0:08:49.927,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I go for a walk, and I feel better like that,

207
0:08:52.586,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in no time at all.

208
0:08:55.857,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But also that it illustrates how

209
0:08:57.892,000 --> 0:08:58,000
disability and blindness

210
0:08:59.674,000 --> 0:09:01,000
sort of cuts across ethnic, social,

211
0:09:02.394,000 --> 0:09:04,000
racial, economic lines.

212
0:09:05.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Disability is an equal-opportunity provider.

213
0:09:08.955,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Everybody's welcome.

214
0:09:11.398,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community

215
0:09:13.959,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that there are really only two types of people:

216
0:09:16.461,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There are those with disabilities,

217
0:09:18.22,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet.

218
0:09:22.882,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It's a different way of thinking about it,

219
0:09:25.003,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but I think it's kind of beautiful,

220
0:09:27.252,000 --> 0:09:29,000
because it is certainly far more inclusive

221
0:09:29.428,000 --> 0:09:31,000
than the us-versus-them

222
0:09:31.533,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or the abled-versus-the-disabled,

223
0:09:34.101,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and it's a lot more honest and respectful

224
0:09:36.879,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of the fragility of life.

225
0:09:40.183,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So my final takeaway for you is

226
0:09:42.108,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that not only is the city good for the blind,

227
0:09:46.176,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but the city needs us.

228
0:09:49.355,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I'm so sure of that that

229
0:09:51.393,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I want to propose to you today

230
0:09:52.989,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers

231
0:09:56.429,000 --> 0:09:59,000
when imagining new and wonderful cities,

232
0:09:59.714,000 --> 0:10:,000
and not the people that are thought about

233
0:10:01.575,000 --> 0:10:03,000
after the mold has already been cast.

234
0:10:03.808,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It's too late then.

235
0:10:06.861,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So if you design a city with the blind in mind,

236
0:10:10.045,000 --> 0:10:14,000
you'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks

237
0:10:14.63,000 --> 0:10:16,000
with a dense array of options and choices

238
0:10:16.744,000 --> 0:10:19,000
all available at the street level.

239
0:10:20.176,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

240
0:10:22.498,000 --> 0:10:25,000
sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.

241
0:10:25.618,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The space between buildings will be well-balanced

242
0:10:27.971,000 --> 0:10:3,000
between people and cars.

243
0:10:31.41,000 --> 0:10:35,000
In fact, cars, who needs them?

244
0:10:35.467,000 --> 0:10:38,000
If you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter)

245
0:10:38.552,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They don't like it when you drive. (Laughter)

246
0:10:41.915,000 --> 0:10:43,000
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

247
0:10:44.625,000 --> 0:10:46,000
you design a city with a robust,

248
0:10:47.268,000 --> 0:10:5,000
accessible, well-connected mass transit system

249
0:10:50.96,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that connects all parts of the city

250
0:10:52.562,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and the region all around.

251
0:10:55.581,000 --> 0:10:57,000
If you design a city with the blind in mind,

252
0:10:57.647,000 --> 0:10:59,000
there'll be jobs, lots of jobs.

253
0:11:00.466,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Blind people want to work too.

254
0:11:01.796,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They want to earn a living.

255
0:11:04.235,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So, in designing a city for the blind,

256
0:11:06.991,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I hope you start to realize

257
0:11:09.06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that it actually would be a more inclusive,

258
0:11:11.938,000 --> 0:11:14,000
a more equitable, a more just city for all.

259
0:11:15.544,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And based on my prior sighted experience,

260
0:11:17.764,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it sounds like a pretty cool city,

261
0:11:19.742,000 --> 0:11:22,000
whether you're blind, whether you have a disability,

262
0:11:23.089,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or you haven't quite found yours yet.

263
0:11:25.573,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So thank you.

264
0:11:28.185,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Applause)

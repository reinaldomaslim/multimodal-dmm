1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You know, cadaver dissection

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is the traditional way of learning human anatomy.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
For students, it's quite an experience,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but for a school, it could be very difficult

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or expensive to maintain.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught,

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they do not have a cadaver dissection lab.

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are,

9
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
cadavers may not be easily available.

10
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So to address this, we developed

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
with a Dr. Brown in Stanford: virtual dissection table.

12
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So we call this Anatomage Table.

13
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
So with this Anatomage Table,

14
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
students can experience

15
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the dissection without a human cadaver.

16
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And the table form is important,

17
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and since it's touch-interactive,

18
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
just like the way they do dissections in the lab,

19
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient

20
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you can literally interact with your table.

21
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Our digital body is one-to-one life size,

22
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so this is exactly the way

23
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
students will see the real anatomy.

24
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm going to

25
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
do some demonstrations.

26
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
As you can see,

27
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I use my finger to interact with my digital body.

28
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I'm going to do some cuts.

29
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I can cut any way I want to, so I cut right here.

30
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Then it's going to show inside.

31
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I can change my cut

32
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to see different parts.

33
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Maybe I can cut there,

34
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
see the brain,

35
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I can change my cut.

36
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You can see some internal organs.

37
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So we call this

38
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the slicer mode.

39
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
OK, I'm going to do another cut.

40
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Right there.

41
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This shows a lot of internal structures.

42
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So if I want to see the back side,

43
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I can flip

44
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and see from behind.

45
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Like this.

46
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So if these images are

47
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you,

48
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that means we did the right job.

49
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So our doctors said

50
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
these are eye candies.

51
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So instead of just butchering the body,

52
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections.

53
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
What I'm going to do is

54
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones,

55
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
just to see a few internal organs.

56
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Right here.

57
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Let's say I'm going to cut

58
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the liver right here.

59
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
OK.

60
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart.

61
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'm going to do some surgery here.

62
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.

63
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Oops! ...

64
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You don't want to hear "oops" in real surgery.

65
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

66
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But fortunately, our digital man has "undo."

67
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

68
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Okay.

69
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
All right then.

70
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Let me zoom in.

71
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'm going to make a cut right there.

72
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And then you can see the inside of the heart.

73
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You can see the atrium and the ventricles,

74
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
how blood flows to our arteries and veins.

75
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Just like this,

76
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
students can isolate anybody

77
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and dissect any way you want to.

78
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It doesn't have to be always dissection.

79
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.

80
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So let me show you,

81
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I'm going to start with the skeletal structure,

82
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and I can add a few internal organs.

83
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Yep.

84
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Maybe I can add quickly this way.

85
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And I can build muscles

86
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
gradually,

87
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
just like that.

88
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We can see tendons and muscles.

89
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Wish I could build my muscle this fast.

90
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And this is another way to learn anatomy.

92
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Another thing I can show you is,

93
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
more often than not,

94
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
doctors get to meet patients

95
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in X-ray form.

96
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So,

97
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Anatomage Table shows

98
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray.

99
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You can also interact with your X-ray,

100
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and also if you want,

101
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
you can compare

102
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
with how anatomy would appear

103
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in X-ray, too.

104
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So when you are done,

105
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
just bring back the body

106
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and then it's ready for another session.

107
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It looks like our table

108
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
also can transform gender, too.

109
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's a female now.

110
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you.

111
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Applause)

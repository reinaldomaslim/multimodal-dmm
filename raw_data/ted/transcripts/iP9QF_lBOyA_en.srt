1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Believe me or not, I come offering a solution

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to a very important part of this larger problem,

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with the requisite focus on climate.

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And the solution I offer

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is to the biggest culprit

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in this massive mistreatment of the earth

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
by humankind,

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and the resulting decline of the biosphere.

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That culprit is business and industry,

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
As an industrial engineer,

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.

14
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
After founding my company, Interface, from scratch

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in 1973, 36 years ago,

16
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to produce carpet tiles in America

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
for the business and institution markets,

18
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and shepherding it through start-up and survival

19
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to prosperity and global dominance in its field,

20
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I read Paul Hawken's book,

21
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"The Ecology of Commerce,"

22
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the summer of 1994.

23
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
In his book, Paul charges business and industry

24
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as, one, the major culprit

25
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in causing the decline of the biosphere,

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and, two, the only institution that is large enough,

27
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and pervasive enough, and powerful enough,

28
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to really lead humankind out of this mess.

29
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And by the way he convicted me

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as a plunderer of the earth.

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company,

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability,

33
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which we defined as eventually operating

34
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
our petroleum-intensive company in such a way

35
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
as to take from the earth

36
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
only what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly --

37
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
not another fresh drop of oil --

38
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and to do no harm to the biosphere.

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Take nothing: do no harm.

40
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I simply said, "If Hawken is right

41
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and business and industry must lead,

42
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
who will lead business and industry?

43
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Unless somebody leads, nobody will."

44
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's axiomatic. Why not us?

45
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And thanks to the people of Interface,

46
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I have become a recovering plunderer.

47
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Applause)

49
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I once told a Fortune Magazine writer

50
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that someday people like me would go to jail.

51
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And that became the headline of a Fortune article.

52
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.

53
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
From plunderer to recovering plunderer,

54
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to America's greenest CEO in five years --

55
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that, frankly, was a pretty sad commentary

56
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
on American CEOs in 1999.

57
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation,"

58
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
what I meant by the "go to jail" remark,

59
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I offered that theft is a crime.

60
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.

61
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But I realized, for that to be true --

62
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
for theft of our children's future to be a crime --

63
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative

64
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to the take-make-waste industrial system

65
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that so dominates our civilization,

66
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,

67
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
by digging up the earth

68
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and converting it to products that quickly become waste

69
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in a landfill or an incinerator --

70
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.

71
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich

72
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and a well-known environmental impact equation,

73
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
impact -- a bad thing --

74
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is the product of population, affluence and technology.

75
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That is, impact is generated by people,

76
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
what they consume in their affluence,

77
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and how it is produced.

78
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And though the equation is largely subjective,

79
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence,

80
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.

81
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So the equation is conceptual.

82
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Still it works to help us understand the problem.

83
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So we set out at Interface, in 1994,

84
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to create an example:

85
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to transform the way we made carpet,

86
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy,

87
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and to transform our technologies

88
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so they diminished environmental impact,

89
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
rather than multiplied it.

90
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation:

91
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I is equal to P times A times T:

92
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
population, affluence and technology.

93
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read

94
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I equals P times A divided by T.

95
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediately

96
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing --

97
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but T in the denominator decreases impact.

98
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So I ask, "What would move T, technology,

99
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
from the numerator -- call it T1 --

100
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
where it increases impact,

101
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to the denominator -- call it T2 --

102
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where it reduces impact?

103
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I thought about the characteristics

104
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of first industrial revolution,

105
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
T1, as we practiced it at Interface,

106
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and it had the following characteristics.

107
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Extractive: taking raw materials from the earth.

108
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Linear: take, make, waste.

109
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy.

110
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Wasteful: abusive and focused on labor productivity.

111
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
More carpet per man-hour.

112
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Thinking it through, I realized that all those attributes

113
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
must be changed to move T to the denominator.

114
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable;

115
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
linear by cyclical;

116
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
fossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight;

117
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
wasteful by waste-free;

118
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and abusive by benign;

119
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and labor productivity by resource productivity.

120
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes,

121
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and get rid of T1 altogether,

122
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we could reduce our impact to zero,

123
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
including our impact on the climate.

124
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And that became the Interface plan in 1995,

125
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and has been the plan ever since.

126
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We have measured our progress very rigorously.

127
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.

128
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Net greenhouse gas emissions

129
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
down 82 percent in absolute tonnage.

130
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

131
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Over the same span of time

132
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.

133
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So an 82 percent absolute reduction

134
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
translates into a 90 percent reduction

135
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.

136
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This is the magnitude

137
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of the reduction the entire global technosphere

138
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
must realize by 2050

139
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to avoid catastrophic climate disruption --

140
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so the scientists are telling us.

141
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production,

142
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
due to efficiencies in renewables.

143
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The cheapest, most secure barrel of oil there is

144
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is the one not used through efficiencies.

145
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Water usage is down 75 percent

146
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in our worldwide carpet tile business.

147
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business,

148
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
which we acquired in 1993

149
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
right here in California, City of Industry,

150
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
where water is so precious.

151
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total, and growing rapidly.

152
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total,

153
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
going for 100 percent.

154
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
We have diverted 148 million pounds --

155
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that's 74,000 tons --

156
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of used carpet from landfills,

157
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
closing the loop on material flows

158
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
through reverse logistics

159
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and post-consumer recycling technologies

160
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that did not exist when we started 14 years ago.

161
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Those new cyclical technologies

162
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold

163
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet

164
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
since 2004,

165
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption

166
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain,

167
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation --

168
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
independent third-party certified.

169
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We call it Cool Carpet.

170
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator,

171
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
increasing sales and profits.

172
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home,

173
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
under the brand Flor,

174
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
misspelled F-L-O-R.

175
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You can point and click today at Flor.com

176
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.

177
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It is practical, and pretty too.

178
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Applause)

180
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We reckon that we are a bit over halfway

181
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to our goal: zero impact, zero footprint.

182
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We've set 2020 as our target year for zero,

183
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
for reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability.

184
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We call this Mission Zero.

185
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And this is perhaps the most important facet:

186
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business.

187
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
A better business model,

188
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
a better way to bigger profits.

189
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Here is the business case for sustainability.

190
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
From real life experience, costs are down, not up,

191
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
reflecting some 400 million dollars

192
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste --

193
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the first face of Mount Sustainability.

194
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface.

195
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And this dispels a myth too,

196
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
this false choice between the environment and the economy.

197
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Our products are the best they've ever been,

198
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
inspired by design for sustainability,

199
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
an unexpected wellspring of innovation.

200
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.

201
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people

202
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and bringing them together.

203
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.

204
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
No amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign,

205
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
at any price, could have produced or created

206
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
this much goodwill.

207
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Costs, products, people, marketplaces --

208
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
what else is there?

209
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It is a better business model.

210
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits.

211
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
There is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003:

212
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
a dip when our sales, over a three-year period,

213
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
were down 17 percent.

214
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But the marketplace was down 36 percent.

215
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
We literally gained market share.

216
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We might not have survived that recession

217
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but for the advantages of sustainability.

218
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
If every business were pursuing Interface plans,

219
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
would that solve all our problems?

220
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I don't think so.

221
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation,

222
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I equals P times A divided by T2.

223
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
That A is a capital A,

224
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
suggesting that affluence is an end in itself.

225
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further?

226
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And what if we made A a lowercase 'a,'

227
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
suggesting that it is a means to an end,

228
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and that end is happiness --

229
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
more happiness with less stuff.

230
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You know that would reframe civilization itself --

231
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Applause) --

232
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and our whole system of economics,

233
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
if not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us:

234
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the sustainable species, living on a finite earth,

235
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
ethically, happily and ecologically

236
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
in balance with nature

237
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and all her natural systems for a thousand generations,

238
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or 10,000 generations --

239
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that is to say, into the indefinite future.

240
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?

241
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Well maybe so. But I don't think so.

242
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical

243
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
sustainable, zero-footprint industrial company

244
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
fully into existence by 2020.

245
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We can see our way now,

246
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
clear to the top of that mountain.

247
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And now the challenge is in execution.

248
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says,

249
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"If something exists, it must be possible."

250
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

251
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
If we can actually do it, it must be possible.

252
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
If we, a petro-intensive company can do it, anybody can.

253
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And if anybody can, it follows that everybody can.

254
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Hawken fulfilled business and industry,

255
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
leading humankind away from the abyss

256
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
because, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere,

257
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a very dear person is at risk here --

258
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
frankly, an unacceptable risk.

259
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Who is that person?

260
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Not you. Not I.

261
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.

262
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb.

263
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996,

264
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I was talking to people, as I did at every opportunity back then,

265
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.

266
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But about five days later back in Atlanta,

267
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I received an email from Glenn Thomas,

268
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
one of my people in the California meeting.

269
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
He was sending me an original poem

270
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together.

271
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.

272
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Because it told me, by God, one person got it.

273
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.

274
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Please meet "Tomorrow's Child."

275
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
"Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place,

276
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Tomorrow's child, though yet unborn,

277
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I met you first last Tuesday morn.

278
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
A wise friend introduced us two.

279
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And through his sobering point of view

280
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I saw a day that you would see, a day for you but not for me.

281
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Knowing you has changed my thinking.

282
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
For I never had an inkling

283
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that perhaps the things I do might someday,

284
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
somehow threaten you.

285
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Tomorrow's child, my daughter, son,

286
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good,

287
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
though always having known I should.

288
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Begin, I will.

289
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The way the cost of what I squander, what is lost,

290
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
if ever I forget that you

291
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
will someday come and live here too."

292
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Well, every day of my life since,

293
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me

294
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
with one simple but profound message,

295
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
which I presume to share with you.

296
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We are, each and every one,

297
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
a part of the web of life.

298
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
The continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.

299
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And we have a choice to make

300
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
during our brief, brief visit

301
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to this beautiful blue and green living planet:

302
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to hurt it or to help it.

303
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
For you, it's your call.

304
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Thank you.

305
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Applause)

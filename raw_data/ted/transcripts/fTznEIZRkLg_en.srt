1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I still remember the day in school

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when our teacher told us

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that the world population had become

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
three billion people,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and that was in 1960.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm going to talk now about

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
how world population has changed from that year

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and into the future,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I will not use digital technology,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
as I've done during my first five TEDTalks.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Instead, I have progressed,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I am, today, launching

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a brand new analog teaching technology

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that I picked up from IKEA:

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
this box.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This box contains one billion people.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And our teacher told us

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that the industrialized world, 1960,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
had one billion people.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
In the developing world, she said,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they had two billion people.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And they lived away then.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There was a big gap between

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the one billion in the industrialized world

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the two billion in the developing world.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In the industrialized world,

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
people were healthy,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
educated, rich,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they had small families.

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And their aspiration

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
was to buy a car.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to try to buy a Volvo like this.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But in contrast to this,

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the developing world, far away,

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the aspiration of the average family there

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
was to have food for the day.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They were saving

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to be able to buy a pair of shoes.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
There was an enormous gap in the world

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when I grew up.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And this gap between the West and the rest

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
has created a mindset of the world,

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which we still use linguistically

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
when we talk about "the West"

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and "the Developing World."

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But the world has changed,

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And that's what I'm going to show you,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because since 1960

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
what has happened in the world up to 2010

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is that a staggering

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
four billion people

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
have been added to the world population.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Just look how many.

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The world population has doubled

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
since I went to school.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy,

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so the Western population moved over to here.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and they want to fly.

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So this is where they are today.

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the most successful of the developing countries,

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they have moved on, you know,

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and they have become emerging economies, we call them.

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They are now buying cars.

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And what happened a month ago

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
was that the Chinese company, Geely,

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they acquired the Volvo company,

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and then finally the Swedes understood that

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
something big had happened in the world.

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So there they are.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that is struggling for food and shoes,

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they are still almost as poor

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
as they were 50 years ago.

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The new thing is that

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which are also becoming emerging economies,

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated,

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and they already also have two to three children

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
per woman, as those [richer also] have.

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And their aspiration now

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is, of course, to buy a bicycle,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But this is the world

92
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we have today,

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
no longer any gap.

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest,

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to the very richest over here is wider than ever.

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But there is a continuous world

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
from walking, biking,

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
driving, flying --

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
there are people on all levels,

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This is the new world we have today

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in 2010.

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And what will happen in the future?

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Well, I'm going to project

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
into 2050.

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I was in Shanghai recently,

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I listened to what's happening in China,

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and it's pretty sure that they will catch up,

109
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
just as Japan did.

110
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
one to two or three percent.

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.

113
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They will start flying.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And these

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries,

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they will also forge forwards economically.

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And if,

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but only if,

119
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we invest in the right green technology --

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
so that we can avoid severe climate change,

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and energy can still be relatively cheap --

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
then they will move all the way up here.

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And they will start to buy

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
electric cars.

125
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is what we will find there.

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So what about the poorest two billion?

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
What about the poorest two billion here?

128
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Will they move on?

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Well, here population [growth] comes in

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman,

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
family planning is widely used,

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and population growth is coming to an end.

133
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades,

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
increase to three billion,

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and they will thereafter

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
increase to four billion.

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
There is nothing --

139
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen --

140
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that can stop this [growth] from happening.

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Because we already have this [growth] in process.

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But if, and only if,

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
[the poorest] get out of poverty,

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they get education, they get improved child survival,

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here,

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
then population growth

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
will stop in 2050.

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We cannot have people on this level

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
looking for food and shoes

150
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because then we get continued population growth.

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And let me show you why

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
by converting back to the old-time

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
digital technology.

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Here I have on the screen

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
my country bubbles.

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Every bubble is a country. The size is population.

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The colors show the continent.

158
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The yellow on there is the Americas;

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe;

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
green is the Middle East

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and this light blue is South Asia.

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That's India and this is China. Size is population.

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Here I have children per woman:

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
two children, four children, six children, eight children --

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
big families, small families.

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The year is 1960.

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And down here, child survival,

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the percentage of children surviving childhood

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
up to starting school:

170
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90,

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and almost 100 percent, as we have today

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960:

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
one billion Western world here --

175
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
high child-survival, small families --

176
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and all the rest,

177
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the rainbow of developing countries,

178
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
with very large families

179
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and poor child survival.

180
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
What has happened? I start the world. Here we go.

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?

182
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They get soap, hygiene, education,

183
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
vaccination, penicillin

184
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.

185
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease,

186
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East

187
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is falling down there [to small families].

188
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.

189
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The whole emerging world

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
joins the Western world

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with good child survival

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and small family size,

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but we still have the poorest billion.

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Can you see the poorest billion,

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
those [two] boxes I had over here?

196
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They are still up here.

197
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And they still have a child survival

198
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of only 70 to 80 percent,

199
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
meaning that if you have six children born,

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
there will be at least four who survive

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to the next generation.

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And the population will double in one generation.

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So the only way

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of really getting world population [growth] to stop

205
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is to continue to improve child survival

206
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to 90 percent.

207
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
That's why investments by Gates Foundation,

208
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
UNICEF and aid organizations,

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
together with national government in the poorest countries,

210
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
are so good;

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
because they are actually

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
helping us to reach

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
a sustainable population size of the world.

214
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.

215
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Child survival is the new green.

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's only by child survival

217
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that we will stop population growth.

218
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And will it happen?

219
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Well, I'm not an optimist,

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
neither am I a pessimist.

221
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm a very serious "possibilist."

222
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's a new category where we take emotion apart,

223
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and we just work analytically with the world.

224
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It can be done.

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We can have a much more just world.

226
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
With green technology

227
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and with investments to alleviate poverty,

228
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and global governance,

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the world can become like this.

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And look at the position of the old West.

231
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Remember when this blue box was all alone,

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
leading the world, living its own life.

233
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This will not happen [again].

234
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The role of the old West in the new world

235
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is to become the foundation

236
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
of the modern world --

237
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
nothing more, nothing less.

238
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But it's a very important role.

239
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Do it well and get used to it.

240
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Thank you very much.

241
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

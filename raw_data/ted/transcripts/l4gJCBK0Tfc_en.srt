1
0:00:14.44,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 2013,

2
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I had a life-changing epiphany.

3
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was a painter and decorator

4
0:00:23.2,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in Castlemaine, a small country town in central Victoria.

5
0:00:28.04,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'd gone to see Pete, who was renowned for his workmanship with steel.

6
0:00:33.56,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'd gone to his shed to get some steel edging for the garden.

7
0:00:38.48,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This day, with hindsight, which is a wonderful gift,

8
0:00:42.88,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Pete seemed happier than usual.

9
0:00:46.04,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Two weeks later,

10
0:00:48.2,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I was painting a house down the end of Pete's street

11
0:00:52.24,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when I heard the tragic news.

12
0:00:56.08,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Pete had suicided.

13
0:01:00.04,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Pete, like myself, was a tradie, or a tradesman.

14
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We do like to shorten things in the Australian vernacular.

15
0:01:08.08,000 --> 0:01:09,000
A tradie.

16
0:01:09.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
There was an expectation as a tradie.

17
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You're expected to be stoic.

18
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You're expected to be strong,

19
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:18,000
robust, macho.

20
0:01:19.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You're expected to be tough physically

21
0:01:22.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and silent in the face of adversity.

22
0:01:26.48,000 --> 0:01:28,000
There is a pronounced ripple effect

23
0:01:29.28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
when someone suicides in your community.

24
0:01:33.76,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Pete's funeral was in July. It was winter.

25
0:01:37.76,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The mood was bleak and somber

26
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in the packed community hall.

27
0:01:41.84,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It was a grieving community

28
0:01:44.4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
who had no answers

29
0:01:47.72,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to Pete's suicide,

30
0:01:50.76,000 --> 0:01:51,000
no answers at all.

31
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:56,000
As I wandered around between the tradies and the community members,

32
0:01:57.56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I started hearing some tones of another underlying tragic level.

33
0:02:03.52,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I heard people talking in that community hall

34
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
about the struggles other people were going through.

35
0:02:12.6,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The essence of the conversations was contained in two words

36
0:02:17.32,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that I heard several times:

37
0:02:21.4,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Who's next?

38
0:02:25.56,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Who's next?

39
0:02:27.96,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That was the epiphany.

40
0:02:29.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That was the moment where I was standing in a community hall

41
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in a place where this Castlemaine community

42
0:02:36.08,000 --> 0:02:39,000
had given me such support for 20 years,

43
0:02:39.24,000 --> 0:02:41,000
this community had backed my work, I'd played footy there,

44
0:02:42.2,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I'd done theater there,

45
0:02:43.6,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I was so grateful for what they'd given me.

46
0:02:46.2,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But I was standing there in that space,

47
0:02:48.96,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I was looking around that hall as well,

48
0:02:51.48,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and I could tell people in that hall

49
0:02:54.2,000 --> 0:02:58,000
who were struggling with alcohol, drugs, finance, gambling,

50
0:02:59.2,000 --> 0:03:02,000
domestic abuse, bullying and harassment.

51
0:03:02.8,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Yet because of my tradie culture

52
0:03:05.28,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and that ignorant attitude that we have in the tradie community,

53
0:03:09.64,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I didn't feel confident at all.

54
0:03:13.96,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I didn't have the tools. I lacked the experience.

55
0:03:16.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I didn't know what to do, but I wanted to do something.

56
0:03:22.28,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I left the wake.

57
0:03:23.84,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I hugged a few tradie mates and said,

58
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Please come and see me if you need to."

59
0:03:28.08,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But I didn't know what to say to them or what to tell them.

60
0:03:30.88,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I had no idea.

61
0:03:32.12,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I got a phone call two weeks later from Catherine Pilgrim, my cofounder,

62
0:03:35.72,000 --> 0:03:37,000
wanting to do something for the family.

63
0:03:37.92,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We talked for a while and I said,

64
0:03:39.56,000 --> 0:03:41,000
let's do something for the tradie community.

65
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We love our town, we're grateful,

66
0:03:44.12,000 --> 0:03:46,000
let's do something for the tradie community.

67
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So we talked a bit more.

68
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
What could we do?

69
0:03:48.8,000 --> 0:03:51,000
An awareness-raising event. Awesome.

70
0:03:53.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We're talking about tradies.

71
0:03:55.76,000 --> 0:03:57,000
How do you get tradies somewhere?

72
0:03:58.68,000 --> 0:04:,000
Can you get them to a hospital? No.

73
0:04:00.72,000 --> 0:04:01,000
To a community health center? No.

74
0:04:02.64,000 --> 0:04:04,000
There's an ingrained culture of being a tradie.

75
0:04:07.36,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I thought, where is the perfect place we can get the tradies together

76
0:04:12.32,000 --> 0:04:13,000
where they feel socially included

77
0:04:14.24,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and they feel comfortable

78
0:04:15.76,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and they can share, they can open up and talk about mental health

79
0:04:19.24,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in the building industry?

80
0:04:20.6,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Where can we have an event?

81
0:04:23.72,000 --> 0:04:24,000
A hardware store.

82
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:26.4,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Yeah, that's what I thought too. I thought it was very clever.

84
0:04:29.36,000 --> 0:04:31,000
More precisely, the timber yard of a hardware store.

85
0:04:32.36,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So there we were. OK, we've got the venue.

86
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:36,000
What else do we need?

87
0:04:36.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
What else do tradies love?

88
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Food.

89
0:04:42.12,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I know, we all do, but tradies love food.

90
0:04:44.12,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Tradies especially, and I'm a tradie myself,

91
0:04:46.6,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we love egg and bacon rolls.

92
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So we thought we'd supply the tradies with egg and bacon rolls,

93
0:04:52.48,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and there was the slogan:

94
0:04:54.72,000 --> 0:04:55,000
save your bacon.

95
0:04:56.88,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's a bit corny, but it sort of works.

96
0:04:59.64,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And we also came up with a logo.

97
0:05:03.44,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Hope Assistance Local Tradies."

98
0:05:05.4,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Keep in mind, "HALT," our charity, had no money to begin,

99
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
nothing, not a single cent.

100
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We had conversations.

101
0:05:15.12,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This is a community issue. It starts in community.

102
0:05:18.56,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So we went around to the butcher, we went around to the baker,

103
0:05:22.44,000 --> 0:05:23,000
there was no candlestick maker,

104
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:26,000
there was an egg place and there was some chocolate,

105
0:05:26.84,000 --> 0:05:27,000
there was coffee, there was fruit,

106
0:05:28.52,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but we went around and said,

107
0:05:29.92,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"Hey, we're doing this awareness-raising event.

108
0:05:32.135,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Do you want to contribute? Because we haven't got any money."

109
0:05:35.2,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Of course, nearly every person we initiated the conversation with

110
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:43,000
knew someone that had anxiety, depression or thoughts of suicide

111
0:05:44.24,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or had suicided.

112
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:46,000
There was that unity,

113
0:05:47.08,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that whole of community approach.

114
0:05:49.76,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So we thought, that's great, we've got some food.

115
0:05:52.2,000 --> 0:05:53,000
What else do we need?

116
0:05:53.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We need the support services there.

117
0:05:55.96,000 --> 0:05:57,000
A lot of tradies, and a lot of men in general,

118
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:06:,000
don't necessarily know where to go and get help.

119
0:06:02.32,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I myself was one of them,

120
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and this is what I talk about at the HALT events,

121
0:06:06.56,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that four years ago when I founded HALT,

122
0:06:08.92,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I didn't know I could go to the doctor about my mental health

123
0:06:13.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and get a mental health plan.

124
0:06:14.64,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I didn't know about community health.

125
0:06:16.64,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I certainly didn't know about Lifeline,

126
0:06:18.68,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and I've called Lifeline three times,

127
0:06:21.36,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and they've certainly potentially saved my life.

128
0:06:25.12,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I had to learn all these things.

129
0:06:26.72,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Tradies need to know them.

130
0:06:29.6,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We provided bags,

131
0:06:31.48,000 --> 0:06:32,000
bags of information,

132
0:06:32.96,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I had quite a few tradies say to me in the first year,

133
0:06:36.28,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"Aw, this is a load of you-know-what,"

134
0:06:38.36,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but those tradies I know still have those bags in their Ute

135
0:06:42.24,000 --> 0:06:43,000
or in their shed.

136
0:06:43.68,000 --> 0:06:46,000
On November 10, 2013,

137
0:06:46.76,000 --> 0:06:47,000
we had our event,

138
0:06:48.32,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and interestingly enough, when I talk about a whole of community approach,

139
0:06:52.72,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that was our first event in Castlemaine at Tonks Brothers,

140
0:06:55.8,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and there's a whole of community there.

141
0:06:58.04,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's counselors,

142
0:06:59.32,000 --> 0:07:01,000
there's people who have gone through mental health.

143
0:07:01.76,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That first event set the scene.

144
0:07:04.88,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Since then, we've had more events.

145
0:07:07.96,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Interestingly enough, it's not only tradies

146
0:07:10.32,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that are affected by mental health or anxiety or depression or suicide.

147
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We started working with TAFEs.

148
0:07:17.32,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We started working in the farming industry,

149
0:07:19.92,000 --> 0:07:21,000
at councils, at secondary colleges.

150
0:07:22.6,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We did events for the partners of tradies,

151
0:07:25.72,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because often the tradies would not go home to their partners

152
0:07:28.68,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and say, "Guess what, we talked about mental health,

153
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and we're going to do this, this and this now."

154
0:07:33.72,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So we're doing events for the partners,

155
0:07:35.64,000 --> 0:07:37,000
who themselves may need help.

156
0:07:38.12,000 --> 0:07:39,000
TAFEs are very popular.

157
0:07:40.12,000 --> 0:07:44,000
For me, it's really crucial to get to these young, vulnerable men and women.

158
0:07:44.44,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We've done events for men's sheds,

159
0:07:46.28,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so the high rate of suicide is really high for older men.

160
0:07:50.04,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We've done events for council depot workers and tradies.

161
0:07:54.28,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Interestingly enough,

162
0:07:55.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
nearly every single event --

163
0:07:57.32,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we've actually done now, with very little funding,

164
0:08:00.56,000 --> 0:08:03,000
150 events over four states.

165
0:08:04.56,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So -- oh please, thank you.

166
0:08:06.52,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Applause)

167
0:08:11.48,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And invariably at every single HALT event at a hardware store,

168
0:08:15.28,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I have one tradie come up to me,

169
0:08:17.08,000 --> 0:08:2,000
at least one come up and tell me about his suicide attempt.

170
0:08:21.44,000 --> 0:08:23,000
They're not suicidal there and then, they've worked through it,

171
0:08:24.44,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but these men have never felt they could share their vulnerabilities.

172
0:08:28.44,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They've never felt they can talk about their suicide attempt,

173
0:08:31.68,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but the HALT events,

174
0:08:32.96,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where there's no expectations for them to talk,

175
0:08:35.68,000 --> 0:08:39,000
makes them feel comfortable to start talking.

176
0:08:39.76,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And it's not just they talk to me and tell me their story,

177
0:08:42.72,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they actually now say,

178
0:08:44.28,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"We feel comfortable enough to talk with other men."

179
0:08:48.48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I've had men stand up and say,

180
0:08:49.96,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"I've never mentioned before that I've had depression, but I have,

181
0:08:53.32,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and if anyone else here wants to come and speak to me,

182
0:08:56.76,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I'm here to talk to you."

183
0:08:58.2,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's very empowering and cathartic to do that.

184
0:09:02.4,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We need a whole-of-community approach.

185
0:09:05.48,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We give the tradies bags of information from local and national support services.

186
0:09:10.72,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's one of thing to tell a tradie or someone at one of these events,

187
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"You should go here, here and here,"

188
0:09:15.76,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but we need the whole of community

189
0:09:17.44,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to wrap around the idea of suicide prevention.

190
0:09:20.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We need those services,

191
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and suicide doesn't discriminate at all.

192
0:09:25.64,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's not a 9-to-5 thing.

193
0:09:27.32,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We need to do events before 9am, which most of our brekkies are,

194
0:09:31.96,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and after 5 PM.

195
0:09:34.08,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That's what we need to do. It's a whole-of-community approach.

196
0:09:37.24,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We need to get into businesses.

197
0:09:39.08,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We need to get into sporting clubs, community clubs.

198
0:09:41.84,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We need to get in there and train people

199
0:09:45.4,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to understand about mental health.

200
0:09:47.88,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Here's some sobering statistics just to give you an idea.

201
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:52,000
In 2016,

202
0:09:52.96,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in Australia, 2,866 suicides,

203
0:09:58.28,000 --> 0:10:,000
very close to twice the road toll.

204
0:10:00.52,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Globally, 800,000 a year

205
0:10:05.48,000 --> 0:10:06,000
suicides in the world,

206
0:10:07.2,000 --> 0:10:08,000
one every 40 seconds.

207
0:10:11.36,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We need a whole-of-community approach.

208
0:10:13.96,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We need to feel comfortable in opening up the conversations.

209
0:10:18.76,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Men I know find it really difficult to open up conversations.

210
0:10:23.64,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They certainly do.

211
0:10:24.96,000 --> 0:10:26,000
If you're going to open up conversations, I tell the guys,

212
0:10:27.88,000 --> 0:10:31,000
you need to find a comfortable place to open up and have a conversation,

213
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
whether it's at the pub, it's going for a walk,

214
0:10:34.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
it's after footy.

215
0:10:35.68,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Find that really comfortable place to have the conversation.

216
0:10:40.32,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Part of the ability to have that conversation

217
0:10:42.48,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is to understand what to say.

218
0:10:44.8,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We've all heard about, "Are you OK?"

219
0:10:46.92,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And I've seen it. I've done this.

220
0:10:48.8,000 --> 0:10:5,000
"Are you OK?" "Yes." "Are you OK?" "Yes."

221
0:10:51.24,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"Are you OK?" "Yes." "Are you OK?" "No."

222
0:10:55.64,000 --> 0:10:56,000
What do I say now?

223
0:10:57.84,000 --> 0:10:58,000
What do I say?

224
0:10:59.08,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We need to equip every single person

225
0:11:01.72,000 --> 0:11:03,000
with the ability to come forth

226
0:11:03.8,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and be able to have that conversation.

227
0:11:06.76,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We need to be able to listen.

228
0:11:09.08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I don't know who out there is a good listener.

229
0:11:11.36,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I'm working on my listening abilities,

230
0:11:13.4,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but it's an art form to listen and not judge.

231
0:11:17.24,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Don't make fun. If someone's coming to talk to you about mental illness

232
0:11:20.76,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and anxiety and depression and thoughts of suicide,

233
0:11:24.44,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we need to respect that.

234
0:11:26.44,000 --> 0:11:3,000
They want to trust us that we're going to hold that in tight

235
0:11:30.68,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and not tell everyone.

236
0:11:32.2,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We need to do that.

237
0:11:34.84,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So we need to have conversations. We need to listen.

238
0:11:38.12,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And we need to start reducing the stigma associated with mental health.

239
0:11:44.12,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Companies are now starting to have mental health days.

240
0:11:47.04,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What a great idea.

241
0:11:48.32,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It's not just physical sick days, it's mental health days.

242
0:11:51.8,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Things are changing. We can add to that change.

243
0:11:55.72,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I'm a life preserver.

244
0:11:57.48,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I think we can all be life preservers.

245
0:12:02.68,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The pain of regret

246
0:12:05.2,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is far greater than the pain of hard work.

247
0:12:10.2,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Thank you.

248
0:12:11.44,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.626,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Now, people have a lot of misconceptions about science --

2
0:00:15.417,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about how it works and what it is.

3
0:00:17.792,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A big one is that science is just a big old pile of facts.

4
0:00:21.25,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But that's not true -- that's not even the goal of science.

5
0:00:25.208,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Science is a process.

6
0:00:27.417,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's a way of thinking.

7
0:00:29.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Gathering facts is just a piece of it, but it's not the goal.

8
0:00:32.542,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The ultimate goal of science is to understand objective reality

9
0:00:37.333,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the best way we know how,

10
0:00:38.792,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and that's based on evidence.

11
0:00:41.333,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The problem here is that people are flawed.

12
0:00:44.042,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We can be fooled --

13
0:00:45.375,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we're really good at fooling ourselves.

14
0:00:47.708,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And so baked into this process is a way of minimizing our own bias.

15
0:00:52.833,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So sort of boiled down more than is probably useful,

16
0:00:56.458,000 --> 0:00:57,000
here's how this works.

17
0:00:58.625,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If you want to do some science,

18
0:01:00.292,000 --> 0:01:02,000
what you want to do is you want to observe something ...

19
0:01:02.958,000 --> 0:01:05,000
say, "The sky is blue. Hey, I wonder why?"

20
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You question it.

21
0:01:07.417,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The next thing you do is you come up with an idea that may explain it:

22
0:01:10.75,000 --> 0:01:11,000
a hypothesis.

23
0:01:12.042,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Well, you know what? Oceans are blue.

24
0:01:13.958,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Maybe the sky is reflecting the colors from the ocean.

25
0:01:17.917,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Great, but now you have to test it

26
0:01:19.958,000 --> 0:01:21,000
so you predict what that might mean.

27
0:01:22.625,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Your prediction would be,

28
0:01:23.917,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Well, if the sky is reflecting the ocean color,

29
0:01:26.25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it will be bluer on the coasts

30
0:01:28.292,000 --> 0:01:3,000
than it will be in the middle of the country."

31
0:01:30.75,000 --> 0:01:31,000
OK, that's fair enough,

32
0:01:32.333,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but you've got to test that prediction

33
0:01:34.208,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so you get on a plane, you leave Denver on a nice gray day,

34
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:41,000
you fly to LA, you look up and the sky is gloriously blue.

35
0:01:41.625,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Hooray, your thesis is proven.

36
0:01:44.542,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But is it really? No.

37
0:01:46.458,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You've made one observation.

38
0:01:48.208,000 --> 0:01:51,000
You need to think about your hypothesis, think about how to test it

39
0:01:51.417,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and do more than just one.

40
0:01:53.083,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Maybe you could go to a different part of the country

41
0:01:55.667,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or a different part of the year

42
0:01:57.208,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and see what the weather's like then.

43
0:01:59.292,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Another good idea is to talk to other people.

44
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They have different ideas, different perspectives,

45
0:02:04.625,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they can help you.

46
0:02:05.875,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is what we call peer review.

47
0:02:08.292,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And in fact that will probably also save you a lot of money and a lot of time,

48
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
flying coast-to-coast just to check the weather.

49
0:02:15.542,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, what happens if your hypothesis does a decent job but not a perfect job?

50
0:02:21.833,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Well, that's OK,

51
0:02:23.125,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because what you can do is you can modify it a little bit

52
0:02:25.958,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and then go through this whole process again --

53
0:02:28.375,000 --> 0:02:29,000
make predictions, test them --

54
0:02:30.292,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and as you do that over and over again, you will hone this idea.

55
0:02:33.375,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And if it gets good enough,

56
0:02:34.792,000 --> 0:02:36,000
it may be accepted by the scientific community,

57
0:02:37.167,000 --> 0:02:38,000
at least provisionally,

58
0:02:38.458,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as a good explanation of what's going on,

59
0:02:41.417,000 --> 0:02:43,000
at least until a better idea

60
0:02:43.458,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or some contradictory evidence comes along.

61
0:02:47.292,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now, part of this process is admitting when you're wrong.

62
0:02:51.792,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And that can be really, really hard.

63
0:02:54.708,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Science has its strengths and weaknesses

64
0:02:56.917,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and they depend on this.

65
0:02:59.125,000 --> 0:03:02,000
One of the strengths of science is that it's done by people,

66
0:03:02.375,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and it's proven itself to do a really good job.

67
0:03:04.625,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We understand the universe pretty well because of science.

68
0:03:07.417,000 --> 0:03:1,000
One of science's weaknesses is that it's done by people,

69
0:03:10.958,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and we bring a lot of baggage along with us when we investigate things.

70
0:03:15.25,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We are egotistical,

71
0:03:17.292,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we are stubborn, we're superstitious,

72
0:03:19.833,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we're tribal, we're humans --

73
0:03:22.167,000 --> 0:03:25,000
these are all human traits and scientists are humans.

74
0:03:25.625,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And so we have to be aware of that when we're studying science

75
0:03:30.125,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and when we're trying to develop our theses.

76
0:03:33.333,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But part of this whole thing,

77
0:03:35.792,000 --> 0:03:36,000
part of this scientific process,

78
0:03:37.458,000 --> 0:03:39,000
part of the scientific method,

79
0:03:39.583,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is admitting when you're wrong.

80
0:03:42.458,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I know, I've been there.

81
0:03:44.5,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Many years ago I was working on Hubble Space Telescope,

82
0:03:47.167,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and a scientist I worked with came to me with some data,

83
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and he said, "I think there may be a picture

84
0:03:54.083,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of a planet orbiting another star in this data."

85
0:03:58.417,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We had not had any pictures taken of planets orbiting other stars yet,

86
0:04:02.625,000 --> 0:04:04,000
so if this were true,

87
0:04:04.833,000 --> 0:04:05,000
then this would be the first one

88
0:04:06.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and we would be the ones who found it.

89
0:04:08.583,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That's a big deal.

90
0:04:10.375,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I was very excited,

91
0:04:12.125,000 --> 0:04:14,000
so I just dug right into this data.

92
0:04:14.542,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I spent a long time trying to figure out if this thing were a planet or not.

93
0:04:19.125,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The problem is planets are faint and stars are bright,

94
0:04:22.583,000 --> 0:04:24,000
so trying to get the signal out of this data

95
0:04:24.708,000 --> 0:04:27,000
was like trying to hear a whisper in a heavy metal concert --

96
0:04:28.333,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it was really hard.

97
0:04:29.791,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I tried everything I could,

98
0:04:32.125,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but after a month of working on this,

99
0:04:34.792,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I came to a realization ... couldn't do it.

100
0:04:37.75,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I had to give up.

101
0:04:39.083,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And I had to tell this other scientist,

102
0:04:41.167,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"The data's too messy.

103
0:04:42.458,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We can't say whether this is a planet or not."

104
0:04:45.208,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And that was hard.

105
0:04:47.167,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Then later on we got follow-up observations with Hubble,

106
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and it showed that it wasn't a planet.

107
0:04:52.75,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It was a background star or galaxy, something like that.

108
0:04:56.375,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Well, not to get too technical, but that sucked.

109
0:04:59.125,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:00.167,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I was really unhappy about this.

111
0:05:03.917,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But that's part of it.

112
0:05:05.208,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You have to say, "Look, you know, we can't do this with the data we have."

113
0:05:09.208,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And then I had to face up to the fact

114
0:05:11.042,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that even the follow-up data showed we were wrong.

115
0:05:15.125,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Emotionally I was pretty unhappy.

116
0:05:18.958,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But if a scientist is doing their job correctly,

117
0:05:21.583,000 --> 0:05:23,000
being wrong is not so bad

118
0:05:24.292,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because that means there's still more stuff out there --

119
0:05:26.958,000 --> 0:05:27,000
more things to figure out.

120
0:05:28.5,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Scientists don't love being wrong but we love puzzles,

121
0:05:32.375,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and the universe is the biggest puzzle of them all.

122
0:05:36.042,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now having said that,

123
0:05:37.542,000 --> 0:05:4,000
if you have a piece and it doesn't fit no matter how you move it,

124
0:05:41.125,000 --> 0:05:44,000
jamming it in harder isn't going to help.

125
0:05:44.25,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There's going to be a time when you have to let go of your idea

126
0:05:47.5,000 --> 0:05:49,000
if you want to understand the bigger picture.

127
0:05:50.25,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The price of doing science is admitting when you're wrong,

128
0:05:53.708,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but the payoff is the best there is:

129
0:05:56.667,000 --> 0:05:58,000
knowledge and understanding.

130
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And I can give you a thousand examples of this in science,

131
0:06:01.833,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but there's one I really like.

132
0:06:03.333,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It has to do with astronomy,

133
0:06:04.75,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and it was a question that had been plaguing astronomers

134
0:06:07.417,000 --> 0:06:08,000
literally for centuries.

135
0:06:08.958,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When you look at the Sun, it seems special.

136
0:06:11.042,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It is the brightest object in the sky,

137
0:06:13.917,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but having studied astronomy, physics, chemistry, thermodynamics for centuries,

138
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we learned something very important about it.

139
0:06:21.167,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's not that special.

140
0:06:22.458,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's a star just like millions of other stars.

141
0:06:25.417,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But that raises an interesting question.

142
0:06:27.875,000 --> 0:06:28,000
If the Sun is a star

143
0:06:29.792,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and the Sun has planets,

144
0:06:32.042,000 --> 0:06:34,000
do these other stars have planets?

145
0:06:34.917,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, like I said with my own failure in the "planet" I was looking for,

146
0:06:38.417,000 --> 0:06:39,000
finding them is super hard,

147
0:06:40.208,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but scientists tend to be pretty clever people

148
0:06:43.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and they used a lot of different techniques

149
0:06:45.25,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and started observing stars.

150
0:06:46.667,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And over the decades

151
0:06:47.958,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they started finding some things that were pretty interesting,

152
0:06:50.917,000 --> 0:06:52,000
right on the thin, hairy edge of what they were able to detect.

153
0:06:53.935,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But time and again, it was shown to be wrong.

154
0:06:56.875,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That all changed in 1991.

155
0:06:59.167,000 --> 0:07:,000
A couple of astronomers --

156
0:07:01.167,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Alexander Lyne -- Andrew Lyne, pardon me --

157
0:07:03.333,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and Matthew Bailes,

158
0:07:04.625,000 --> 0:07:05,000
had a huge announcement.

159
0:07:06.125,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They had found a planet orbiting another star.

160
0:07:09.333,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And not just any star, but a pulsar,

161
0:07:12.167,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and this is the remnant of a star that has previously exploded.

162
0:07:16.375,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's blasting out radiation.

163
0:07:18.5,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This is the last place in the universe you would expect to find a planet,

164
0:07:23.083,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but they had very methodically looked at this pulsar,

165
0:07:25.583,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and they detected the gravitational tug of this planet as it orbited the pulsar.

166
0:07:30.458,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It looked really good.

167
0:07:32.042,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The first planet orbiting another star had been found ...

168
0:07:35.667,000 --> 0:07:37,000
except not so much.

169
0:07:38.125,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:39.167,000 --> 0:07:4,000
After they made the announcement,

171
0:07:40.792,000 --> 0:07:42,000
a bunch of other astronomers commented on it,

172
0:07:42.917,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and so they went back and looked at their data

173
0:07:45.167,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and realized they had made a very embarrassing mistake.

174
0:07:47.958,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They had not accounted for some very subtle characteristics

175
0:07:51.042,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of the Earth's motion around the Sun,

176
0:07:53.25,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which affected how they measured this planet going around the pulsar.

177
0:07:57.125,000 --> 0:08:,000
And it turns out that when they did account for it correctly,

178
0:08:00.375,000 --> 0:08:01,000
poof -- their planet disappeared.

179
0:08:02.375,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It wasn't real.

180
0:08:04.458,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So Andrew Lyne had a very formidable task.

181
0:08:07.333,000 --> 0:08:09,000
He had to admit this.

182
0:08:09.542,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So in 1992 at the American Astronomical Society meeting,

183
0:08:13.625,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which is one of the largest gatherings of astronomers on the planet,

184
0:08:16.875,000 --> 0:08:2,000
he stood up and announced that he had made a mistake

185
0:08:20.917,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and that the planet did not exist.

186
0:08:23.208,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And what happened next --

187
0:08:25.667,000 --> 0:08:26,000
oh, I love this --

188
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:28,000
what happened next was wonderful.

189
0:08:29.5,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He got an ovation.

190
0:08:31.458,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The astronomers weren't angry at him;

191
0:08:34.125,000 --> 0:08:35,000
they didn't want to chastise him.

192
0:08:35.75,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They praised him for his honesty and his integrity.

193
0:08:38.875,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I love that!

194
0:08:40.167,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Scientists are people.

195
0:08:41.458,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:42.5,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And it gets better!

197
0:08:43.833,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

198
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Lyne steps off the podium.

199
0:08:46.5,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The next guy to come up is a man named Aleksander Wolszczan

200
0:08:49.667,000 --> 0:08:5,000
He takes the microphone and says,

201
0:08:51.667,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"Yeah, so Lyne's team didn't find a pulsar planet,

202
0:08:55.167,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but my team found not just one

203
0:08:57.875,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but two planets orbiting a different pulsar.

204
0:09:00.667,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We knew about the problem that Lyne had,

205
0:09:02.75,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we checked for it, and yeah, ours are real."

206
0:09:06.208,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And it turns out he was right.

207
0:09:08.333,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And in fact, a few months later,

208
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
they found a third planet orbiting this pulsar

209
0:09:12.458,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and it was the first exoplanet system ever found --

210
0:09:16.875,000 --> 0:09:18,000
what we call alien worlds -- exoplanets.

211
0:09:20.375,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That to me is just wonderful.

212
0:09:23.375,000 --> 0:09:25,000
At that point the floodgates were opened.

213
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
In 1995 a planet was found around a star more like the Sun,

214
0:09:31.458,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and then we found another and another.

215
0:09:34.167,000 --> 0:09:37,000
This is an image of an actual planet orbiting an actual star.

216
0:09:39.042,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We kept getting better at it.

217
0:09:40.5,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We started finding them by the bucketload.

218
0:09:42.75,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We started finding thousands of them.

219
0:09:44.875,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We built observatories specifically designed to look for them.

220
0:09:48.375,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And now we know of thousands of them.

221
0:09:50.208,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We even know of planetary systems.

222
0:09:52.917,000 --> 0:09:56,000
That is actual data, animated, showing four planets orbiting another star.

223
0:09:58.375,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is incredible. Think about that.

224
0:10:00.625,000 --> 0:10:01,000
For all of human history,

225
0:10:02.5,000 --> 0:10:06,000
you could count all the known planets in the universe on two hands --

226
0:10:07.042,000 --> 0:10:08,000
nine -- eight?

227
0:10:08.583,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Nine? Eight -- eight.

228
0:10:09.917,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

229
0:10:13.167,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Eh.

230
0:10:14.458,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:15.542,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But now we know they're everywhere.

232
0:10:17.917,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Every star --

233
0:10:19.208,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for every star you see in the sky there could be three, five, ten planets.

234
0:10:22.792,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The sky is filled with them.

235
0:10:26.375,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We think that planets may outnumber stars in the galaxy.

236
0:10:29.375,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is a profound statement,

237
0:10:31.875,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and it was made because of science.

238
0:10:33.833,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it wasn't made just because of science and the observatories and the data;

239
0:10:37.542,000 --> 0:10:4,000
it was made because of the scientists who built the observatories,

240
0:10:40.708,000 --> 0:10:41,000
who took the data,

241
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who made the mistakes and admitted them

242
0:10:43.882,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and then let other scientists build on their mistakes

243
0:10:47.125,000 --> 0:10:48,000
so that they could do what they do

244
0:10:49.125,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and figure out where our place is in the universe.

245
0:10:53.542,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That is how you find the truth.

246
0:10:56.583,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Science is at its best when it dares to be human.

247
0:11:01.25,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Thank you.

248
0:11:02.542,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Applause and cheers)

1
0:00:13.197,000 --> 0:00:15,000
War has been a part of my life since I can remember.

2
0:00:16.811,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I was born in Afghanistan, just six months after the Soviets invaded,

3
0:00:21.526,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and even though I was too young to understand what was happening,

4
0:00:24.831,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me.

5
0:00:29.219,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Those early experiences had a major impact on how I now think about war and conflict.

6
0:00:35.049,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I learned that when people have a fundamental issue at stake,

7
0:00:38.511,000 --> 0:00:39,000
for most of them,

8
0:00:39.787,000 --> 0:00:4,000
giving in is not an option.

9
0:00:41.971,000 --> 0:00:42,000
For these types conflicts --

10
0:00:43.607,000 --> 0:00:44,000
when people's rights are violated,

11
0:00:45.416,000 --> 0:00:46,000
when their countries are occupied,

12
0:00:47.21,000 --> 0:00:49,000
when they're oppressed and humiliated --

13
0:00:49.452,000 --> 0:00:52,000
they need a powerful way to resist and to fight back.

14
0:00:53.308,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is,

15
0:00:57.595,000 --> 0:00:59,000
if people see it as their only choice,

16
0:01:00.043,000 --> 0:01:01,000
they will use it.

17
0:01:02.074,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world.

18
0:01:06.045,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But we're not going to end war

19
0:01:07.523,000 --> 0:01:09,000
by telling people that violence is morally wrong.

20
0:01:10.883,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Instead, we must offer them a tool

21
0:01:13.306,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that's at least as powerful and as effective as violence.

22
0:01:17.574,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is the work I do.

23
0:01:19.717,000 --> 0:01:2,000
For the past 13 years,

24
0:01:21.28,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I've been teaching people

25
0:01:22.589,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in some of the most difficult situations around the world

26
0:01:25.721,000 --> 0:01:28,000
how they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict.

27
0:01:30.113,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Most people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

28
0:01:35.589,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years.

29
0:01:39.831,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In fact, most of the rights that we have today in this country --

30
0:01:44.187,000 --> 0:01:45,000
as women,

31
0:01:45.362,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as minorities,

32
0:01:46.537,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as workers,

33
0:01:47.909,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as people of different sexual orientations

34
0:01:50.499,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and citizens concerned with the environment --

35
0:01:52.981,000 --> 0:01:53,000
these rights weren't handed to us.

36
0:01:55.226,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They were won by people who fought for them

37
0:01:57.41,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and who sacrificed for them.

38
0:01:59.256,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But because we haven't learned from this history,

39
0:02:01.8,000 --> 0:02:05,000
nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood.

40
0:02:06.488,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I met recently with a group of Ethiopian activists,

41
0:02:09.634,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and they told me something that I hear a lot.

42
0:02:12.808,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They said they'd already tried nonviolent action,

43
0:02:15.158,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and it hadn't worked.

44
0:02:16.6,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Years ago they held a protest.

45
0:02:18.96,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The government arrested everyone, and that was the end of that.

46
0:02:23.302,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests

47
0:02:27.286,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is a real problem.

48
0:02:29.204,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change,

49
0:02:33.628,000 --> 0:02:35,000
on their own, they don't actually create change --

50
0:02:36.522,000 --> 0:02:37,000
at least change that is fundamental.

51
0:02:38.514,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:39.726,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want

53
0:02:42.859,000 --> 0:02:43,000
just because they asked nicely ...

54
0:02:45.519,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or even not so nicely.

55
0:02:47.42,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:48.577,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Nonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent,

57
0:02:52.018,000 --> 0:02:53,000
not physically,

58
0:02:53.354,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive,

59
0:02:57.788,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and then denying them those sources of power.

60
0:03:00.47,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Nonviolent activists can neutralize the military

61
0:03:03.258,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by causing soldiers to defect.

62
0:03:05.506,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts.

63
0:03:09.19,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And they can challenge government propaganda

64
0:03:11.516,000 --> 0:03:12,000
by creating alternative media.

65
0:03:13.829,000 --> 0:03:15,000
There are a variety of methods that can be used to do this.

66
0:03:17.384,000 --> 0:03:19,000
My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,

67
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
has identified 198 methods of nonviolent action.

68
0:03:26.186,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And protest is only one.

69
0:03:28.376,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Let me give you a recent example.

70
0:03:30.885,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Until a few months ago,

71
0:03:32.378,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Guatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials

72
0:03:35.619,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with ties to organized crime.

73
0:03:38.071,000 --> 0:03:39,000
People were generally aware of this,

74
0:03:39.888,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it --

75
0:03:44.401,000 --> 0:03:48,000
until one group of citizens, just 12 regular people,

76
0:03:48.506,000 --> 0:03:5,000
put out a call on Facebook to their friends

77
0:03:51.272,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to meet in the central plaza, holding signs with a message:

78
0:03:55.046,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Renuncia YA" --

79
0:03:57.024,000 --> 0:03:58,000
resign already.

80
0:03:59.199,000 --> 0:04:,000
To their surprise,

81
0:04:00.632,000 --> 0:04:01,000
30,000 people showed up.

82
0:04:03.045,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country.

83
0:04:06.932,000 --> 0:04:07,000
At one point,

84
0:04:08.112,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings

85
0:04:12.324,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with a message:

86
0:04:13.96,000 --> 0:04:14,000
"If you don't have the huevos" --

87
0:04:15.87,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the balls --

88
0:04:17.1,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"to stop corrupt candidates from running for office,

89
0:04:20.178,000 --> 0:04:21,000
you can borrow ours."

90
0:04:21.66,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:23.343,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Applause)

92
0:04:28.469,000 --> 0:04:29,000
President Molina responded

93
0:04:30.012,000 --> 0:04:32,000
by vowing that he would never step down.

94
0:04:32.674,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And the activists realized that they couldn't just keep protesting

95
0:04:36.299,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and ask the president to resign.

96
0:04:38.337,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They needed to leave him no choice.

97
0:04:40.793,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So they organized a general strike,

98
0:04:42.748,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in which people throughout the country refused to work.

99
0:04:45.419,000 --> 0:04:46,000
In Guatemala City alone,

100
0:04:46.845,000 --> 0:04:48,000
over 400 businesses and schools shut their doors.

101
0:04:50.367,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Meanwhile,

102
0:04:51.572,000 --> 0:04:53,000
farmers throughout the country blocked major roads.

103
0:04:54.225,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Within five days,

104
0:04:55.727,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the president,

105
0:04:56.928,000 --> 0:04:58,000
along with dozens of other government officials,

106
0:04:59.675,000 --> 0:05:,000
resigned already.

107
0:05:01.168,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

108
0:05:05.475,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I've been greatly inspired

109
0:05:07.102,000 --> 0:05:1,000
by the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action

110
0:05:11.029,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in nearly every country in the world.

111
0:05:13.718,000 --> 0:05:14,000
For example,

112
0:05:14.893,000 --> 0:05:16,000
recently a group of activists in Uganda

113
0:05:17.474,000 --> 0:05:19,000
released a crate of pigs in the streets.

114
0:05:20.096,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them.

115
0:05:23.558,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:24.618,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The pigs were painted the color of the ruling party.

117
0:05:27.617,000 --> 0:05:29,000
One pig was even wearing a hat,

118
0:05:29.919,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a hat that people recognized.

119
0:05:32.321,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:34.264,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Activists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines,

121
0:05:37.657,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but these isolated actions do very little

122
0:05:40.344,000 --> 0:05:42,000
if they're not part of a larger strategy.

123
0:05:42.914,000 --> 0:05:44,000
A general wouldn't march his troops into battle

124
0:05:45.177,000 --> 0:05:47,000
unless he had a plan to win the war.

125
0:05:47.332,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Yet this is how most of the world's nonviolent movements operate.

126
0:05:50.896,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare,

127
0:05:55.24,000 --> 0:05:56,000
if not more.

128
0:05:56.462,000 --> 0:06:,000
Its participants must be well-trained and have clear objectives,

129
0:06:00.681,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objectives.

130
0:06:05.242,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The technique of war has been developed over thousands of years

131
0:06:08.532,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with massive resources

132
0:06:10.103,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding

133
0:06:13.373,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and improving how it works.

134
0:06:15.608,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied,

135
0:06:20.214,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and even though the number is growing,

136
0:06:22.248,000 --> 0:06:25,000
there are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it.

137
0:06:26.849,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This is dangerous,

138
0:06:28.166,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict

139
0:06:32.358,000 --> 0:06:35,000
are not adequate for the new challenges that we're facing.

140
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The US government recently admitted

141
0:06:37.907,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that it's in a stalemate in its war against ISIS.

142
0:06:41.318,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But what most people don't know

143
0:06:43.086,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is that people have stood up to ISIS using nonviolent action.

144
0:06:47.12,000 --> 0:06:5,000
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,

145
0:06:50.954,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum,

146
0:06:54.709,000 --> 0:06:56,000
based on their own extremist ideology.

147
0:06:57.556,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But on the first day of school,

148
0:06:59.672,000 --> 0:07:,000
not a single child showed up.

149
0:07:02.222,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Parents simply refused to send them.

150
0:07:05.068,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They told journalists they would rather homeschool their children

151
0:07:08.284,000 --> 0:07:09,000
than to have them brainwashed.

152
0:07:10.689,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is an example of just one act of defiance

153
0:07:13.722,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in just one city.

154
0:07:15.659,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But what if it was coordinated

155
0:07:17.128,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance

156
0:07:19.774,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that have taken place against ISIS?

157
0:07:21.853,000 --> 0:07:24,000
What if the parents' boycott was part of a larger strategy

158
0:07:25.312,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to identify and cut off the resources that ISIS needs to function;

159
0:07:30.157,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the skilled labor needed to produce food;

160
0:07:32.677,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the engineers needed to extract and refine oil;

161
0:07:36.29,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the media infrastructure and communications networks

162
0:07:38.907,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and transportation systems,

163
0:07:40.904,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and the local businesses that ISIS relies on?

164
0:07:43.911,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It may be difficult to imagine defeating ISIS

165
0:07:47.056,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with action that is nonviolent.

166
0:07:49.511,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But it's time we challenge the way we think about conflict

167
0:07:52.643,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the choices we have in facing it.

168
0:07:56.194,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Here's an idea worth spreading:

169
0:07:58.489,000 --> 0:08:01,000
let's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked

170
0:08:01.668,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and how we can make it more powerful,

171
0:08:04.209,000 --> 0:08:07,000
just like we do with other systems and technologies

172
0:08:07.277,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that are constantly being refined to better meet human needs.

173
0:08:11.446,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It may be that we can improve nonviolent action

174
0:08:14.929,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war.

175
0:08:18.838,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned

176
0:08:22.937,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in the same way that bows and arrows were,

177
0:08:25.368,000 --> 0:08:28,000
because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective.

178
0:08:29.427,000 --> 0:08:33,000
With human innovation, we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful

179
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
than the newest and latest technologies of war.

180
0:08:38.01,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence

181
0:08:42.497,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but in making violence obsolete.

182
0:08:46.365,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Thank you.

183
0:08:47.54,000 --> 0:08:55,000

1
0:00:12.694,000 --> 0:00:13,000
First of all, for those of you who

2
0:00:14.074,000 --> 0:00:16,000
are not familiar with my work,

3
0:00:16.413,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I create multicultural characters,

4
0:00:19.215,000 --> 0:00:21,000
so characters from lots of different backgrounds.

5
0:00:22.14,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So before the present is the new future,

6
0:00:24.397,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family

7
0:00:27.839,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that was multi-everything -- multi-racial, multi-cultural,

8
0:00:30.478,000 --> 0:00:32,000
black and white, Caribbean,

9
0:00:33.059,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Irish-American, German-American.

10
0:00:34.844,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There was Dominican music blasting from stereos.

11
0:00:39.028,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There were Christians and Jews.

12
0:00:41.91,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That's a long story filled with

13
0:00:43.73,000 --> 0:00:45,000
intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.

14
0:00:46.412,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But I was totally immersed in this world

15
0:00:50.9,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that was filled with everybody,

16
0:00:52.962,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and then I went on to the United Nations school,

17
0:00:56.002,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and that just completely —

18
0:00:57.688,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So I began sort of developing these voices

19
0:01:01.771,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and these people,

20
0:01:03.657,000 --> 0:01:05,000
all of whom were loosely based on people I really know,

21
0:01:06.027,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and so, for example, in performing them,

22
0:01:10.21,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I would really try to inhabit them.

23
0:01:12.168,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And for example,

24
0:01:13.525,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I don't really talk like that,

25
0:01:15.7,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but that was one of my people,

26
0:01:18.494,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I'm going to bring a few of my friends --

27
0:01:21.578,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I think of them as my friends —

28
0:01:23.13,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to this stage, in this spirit of the idea

29
0:01:25.612,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that the present is the new future,

30
0:01:28.004,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in sort of a meta way,

31
0:01:29.96,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because I thought about it, and the future, for me,

32
0:01:31.95,000 --> 0:01:32,000
what can be so frightening

33
0:01:33.428,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is that I don't know what's coming.

34
0:01:35.394,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I don't know if that's true for other people,

35
0:01:36.856,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but that notion of thinking about

36
0:01:39.144,000 --> 0:01:42,000
how we can understand the future

37
0:01:42.327,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and predict outcomes,

38
0:01:43.998,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for me, it's terrifying to not know what might be coming.

39
0:01:48.392,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so the idea that there are questions

40
0:01:50.85,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that I've never seen

41
0:01:52.37,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that my people are going to answer,

42
0:01:54.846,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and some of these characters have been with me for ages,

43
0:01:56.586,000 --> 0:01:57,000
some of them don't even have names,

44
0:01:58.34,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

45
0:01:59.91,000 --> 0:02:,000
I don't know what's coming,

46
0:02:01.608,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and all I can do is remind myself

47
0:02:04.403,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,

48
0:02:06.734,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like

49
0:02:08.608,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that dream where you don't have any pants on,

50
0:02:11.308,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and so I suppose I'm going to be

51
0:02:13.08,000 --> 0:02:16,000
flying by the seat of my ass.

52
0:02:16.507,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That said, let's just see who comes out.

53
0:02:18.405,000 --> 0:02:19,000
May we have the first question:

54
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"Do you ever get headaches

55
0:02:21.024,000 --> 0:02:23,000
from the microchips implanted in your brain?"

56
0:02:23.582,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Right.

57
0:02:26.86,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Okay.

58
0:02:28.46,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well first of all, I'll just say

59
0:02:31.46,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that I hope you can hear me okay.

60
0:02:33.976,000 --> 0:02:35,000
My name is Lorraine Levine,

61
0:02:36.116,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain,

62
0:02:42.09,000 --> 0:02:47,000
frankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me

63
0:02:47.41,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses.

64
0:02:50.14,000 --> 0:02:53,000
No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them,

65
0:02:53.328,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but at my age,

66
0:02:54.904,000 --> 0:02:56,000
just putting on the regular ones I have

67
0:02:57.118,000 --> 0:02:59,000
already gives me too much information.

68
0:02:59.724,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

69
0:03:01.95,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I don't need to know more. I don't want to know.

70
0:03:04.89,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That's it. That's enough.

71
0:03:06.54,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I love you all. You're wonderful.

72
0:03:08.649,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's fabulous to be here with such big machers

73
0:03:11.402,000 --> 0:03:13,000
again this year. Mwah!

74
0:03:14.393,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Okay, next question. (Applause)

75
0:03:17.919,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Next, please.

76
0:03:19.896,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Is dating boring,

77
0:03:20.992,000 --> 0:03:22,000
now that humans reproduce asexually?"

78
0:03:23.576,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Who do we got?

79
0:03:27.436,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Hi, um, okay, hi everybody.

80
0:03:30.276,000 --> 0:03:31,000
My name is Nereida.

81
0:03:31.82,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I just want to say first of all

82
0:03:33.148,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that dating is never boring under any circumstance.

83
0:03:35.67,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But I am very excited to be here right now,

84
0:03:37.39,000 --> 0:03:39,000
so I am just trying to remind myself that,

85
0:03:39.804,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you know, like, the purpose of being here and everything,

86
0:03:41.589,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I mean, trying to answer these questions, it is very exciting.

87
0:03:44.294,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But I also, I just need to acknowledge

88
0:03:46.19,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that TED is an incredible experience right now

89
0:03:48.782,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in the present, like, I just need to say, like,

90
0:03:50.732,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende!

91
0:03:52.972,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Okay, maybe it doesn't mean,

92
0:03:54.544,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of course it means something to you,

93
0:03:55.84,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but to me, it's like, another level, okay?

94
0:03:57.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact

95
0:03:59.459,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that there are role models here that I can really,

96
0:04:02.317,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I don't know, I just need to say that.

97
0:04:03.815,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That's incredible to me, and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that,

98
0:04:06.593,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I just need to, like, say some affirmations

99
0:04:08.933,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that can help me.

100
0:04:11.337,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I usually just try to use, like, the three little words

101
0:04:13.395,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that always make me feel better:

102
0:04:15.879,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)

103
0:04:18.86,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Just, it really helps me to get grounded.

104
0:04:20.617,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,

105
0:04:22.914,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and, you know, I just need to say it, like,

106
0:04:24.48,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it's so incredible to be here, and I knew that we were going to have these questions.

107
0:04:26.914,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I was so nervous and I was thinking just, like, oh my God, oh my God,

108
0:04:29.167,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and reminding me, because I've had, like, some very,

109
0:04:31.144,000 --> 0:04:32,000
especially since the last time we were here at TED,

110
0:04:32.737,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it was, like, unbelievable,

111
0:04:34.063,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and then right after that, like,

112
0:04:35.267,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so many crazy things happened, like,

113
0:04:36.221,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we ended up going to the White House to perform.

114
0:04:37.965,000 --> 0:04:38,000
That was, like, amazing,

115
0:04:39.189,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and I'm standing there,

116
0:04:40.209,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and I was just like, please don't say, "Oh my God."

117
0:04:41.719,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Don't say, "Oh my God."

118
0:04:42.473,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I just kept saying it: "Oh my God. Oh my God."

119
0:04:44.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,

120
0:04:46.416,000 --> 0:04:48,000
President Obama has to come up here at the same podium,

121
0:04:49.171,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and I'm standing here saying, "Oh my God."

122
0:04:50.511,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's like, the separation of church and state.

123
0:04:51.864,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.

124
0:04:53.781,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It was really too much.

125
0:04:54.946,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I think I've lost my way.

126
0:04:56.9,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,

127
0:04:59.675,000 --> 0:05:,000
you know, as far as I'm concerned,

128
0:05:01.421,000 --> 0:05:03,000
however you reproduce, as long as you're enjoying yourself

129
0:05:04.04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and it's with another consenting asexual -- I don't know.

130
0:05:08.11,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You know where I'm going with that.

131
0:05:09.43,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Okay, ciao, gracias.

132
0:05:11.501,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Okay, next question. (Applause)

133
0:05:14.023,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What are your top five favorite songs right now?

134
0:05:22.472,000 --> 0:05:24,000
All right, well first of all, I'mma say,

135
0:05:24.5,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you know what I'm saying, I'm the only dude up here right now.

136
0:05:27.84,000 --> 0:05:28,000
My name is Rashid,

137
0:05:29.479,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I never been at TED before,

138
0:05:31.902,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you know what I'm saying.

139
0:05:32.737,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I think, Sarah Jones, maybe she didn't want me to come out last time.

140
0:05:36.029,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I don't know why. You know what I'm saying.

141
0:05:38.012,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.

142
0:05:40.566,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You know what I'm saying.

143
0:05:42.898,000 --> 0:05:44,000
First of all, that I'm in hip hop, you know what I'm saying.

144
0:05:45.235,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I know some of y'all may be not really

145
0:05:47.071,000 --> 0:05:48,000
as much into the music,

146
0:05:48.255,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but the first way y'all can always know,

147
0:05:50.253,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you know what I'm saying, that I'm in hip hop,

148
0:05:52.257,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is 'cos I hold the microphone

149
0:05:54.735,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in an official emcee posture.

150
0:05:56.487,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Y'all can see that right there.

151
0:05:57.615,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's how you hold it.

152
0:05:59.193,000 --> 0:06:01,000
All right, so you get your little tutorial right there.

153
0:06:01.261,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here,

154
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I was like, betch, you know what I'm saying,

155
0:06:05.737,000 --> 0:06:07,000
TED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope,

156
0:06:07.993,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you know what I'm saying, shit going on and everything,

157
0:06:10.217,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but she was like, yeah,

158
0:06:11.189,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we're going to have to answer, like, some random questions,

159
0:06:14.147,000 --> 0:06:15,000
just like, and I was like, what the hell is that?

160
0:06:15.805,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You know what I'm saying, just stand up there

161
0:06:17.135,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and answer some random questions?

162
0:06:18.64,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I don't want to,

163
0:06:19.675,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.

164
0:06:21.733,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You know what I'm saying? (Laughter)

165
0:06:22.909,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I don't want to be standing up there just

166
0:06:24.615,000 --> 0:06:25,000
all getting interrogated and whatnot.

167
0:06:26.539,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That's what I'm trying to leave behind

168
0:06:27.607,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in New York. You know what I'm saying?

169
0:06:29.215,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So anyway, I would have to say my top five songs right now

170
0:06:32.687,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is all out of my own personal catalogue,

171
0:06:35.201,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you know what I mean?

172
0:06:36.678,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So if you want to know more about that,

173
0:06:38.155,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you know what I'm saying,

174
0:06:39.059,000 --> 0:06:41,000
we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,

175
0:06:41.526,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but as far as I'm concerned,

176
0:06:43.051,000 --> 0:06:44,000
you know, I believe in creative commons,

177
0:06:44.867,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I think it's really important that, you know,

178
0:06:47.597,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that needs to be sustainable and everything,

179
0:06:49.933,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

180
0:06:52.617,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I mean, this right here,

181
0:06:53.883,000 --> 0:06:54,000
this environment, I would like to sustain.

182
0:06:55.717,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You know what I mean?

183
0:06:57.101,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But I'm just saying, if y'all are interested

184
0:06:59.565,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in the top five songs, you need to holler at me.

185
0:07:01.593,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You know what I'm saying?

186
0:07:03.161,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Aight? In the future or the present. Yeah.

187
0:07:05.483,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Enjoy the rest of it.

188
0:07:07.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Okay, next question.

189
0:07:09.231,000 --> 0:07:1,000
What do you got?

190
0:07:10.893,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"

191
0:07:12.821,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

192
0:07:16.851,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Well I have to say that I don't know about

193
0:07:18.969,000 --> 0:07:19,000
how many of my organs

194
0:07:20.256,000 --> 0:07:22,000
have been 3-D printed as such,

195
0:07:22.835,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,

196
0:07:25.99,000 --> 0:07:27,000
kind of thinking about this concept of the future

197
0:07:28.334,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and that, you know, all around the world

198
0:07:31.007,000 --> 0:07:35,000
parents are kind of telling their small children,

199
0:07:35.07,000 --> 0:07:36,000
please, you have to eat that, you know,

200
0:07:36.547,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day

201
0:07:39.271,000 --> 0:07:4,000
so that you can have this meal.

202
0:07:40.91,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You know, that kind of thing.

203
0:07:43.515,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And of course now that we have changed, you know,

204
0:07:46.375,000 --> 0:07:47,000
from the global South, there is this total

205
0:07:48.303,000 --> 0:07:51,000
kind of perspective shift that is happening around the --

206
0:07:51.967,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You can't just say to them,

207
0:07:53.213,000 --> 0:07:54,000
well, there are starving children.

208
0:07:55.04,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Well, it is the future.

209
0:07:55.991,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Nobody is starving anymore, thank God.

210
0:07:59.091,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism,

211
0:08:03.164,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and I do hope that we can continue

212
0:08:05.428,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to kind of 3D print,

213
0:08:07.221,000 --> 0:08:09,000
well, let us just say I like to think that

214
0:08:09.695,000 --> 0:08:11,000
even in the future we will have the publication,

215
0:08:12.109,000 --> 0:08:15,000
kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.

216
0:08:15.955,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But everybody, please do enjoy that,

217
0:08:18.227,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and again, I think that you do throw

218
0:08:20.27,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a cracking good party here at TED.

219
0:08:22.107,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Thank you.

220
0:08:24.037,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Next question. (Applause)

221
0:08:28.327,000 --> 0:08:35,000
What has changed? Okay, it's like,

222
0:08:35.421,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I have to think about that.

223
0:08:37.743,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"What has changed now that women run the world?"

224
0:08:42.444,000 --> 0:08:43,000
First of all,

225
0:08:44.388,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I really, like, I just want to say,

226
0:08:46.271,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and my name is Bella,

227
0:08:47.733,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I just want to, like, identify myself,

228
0:08:50.155,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that, like, as a feminist,

229
0:08:53.825,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I, like, I really find that, like,

230
0:08:58.657,000 --> 0:09:,000
because I was born in the '90s,

231
0:09:01.13,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and, like, there were a lot of women who were

232
0:09:06.439,000 --> 0:09:08,000
as far as feminism was concerned,

233
0:09:08.62,000 --> 0:09:1,000
like, maybe they didn't understand that, like,

234
0:09:11.306,000 --> 0:09:14,000
a feminist like me, like,

235
0:09:14.706,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I don't think it's required that you have to have

236
0:09:17.354,000 --> 0:09:19,000
a certain kind of voice,

237
0:09:19.384,000 --> 0:09:21,000
or, like, a certain way of presenting yourself

238
0:09:22.027,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to be feminist, because I think that, like,

239
0:09:23.62,000 --> 0:09:25,000
feminism can be really hot,

240
0:09:26.37,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and I think actually that it's really vital and important.

241
0:09:29.764,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Like, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like,

242
0:09:32.17,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Gloria Steinem,

243
0:09:33.674,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,

244
0:09:37.51,000 --> 0:09:41,000
who's, like, obviously, like, a really important feminist from, like, history,

245
0:09:41.512,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and like, I just think that those women, like,

246
0:09:45.07,000 --> 0:09:47,000
really represent, like, that you can, like,

247
0:09:47.86,000 --> 0:09:49,000
be vital and, like, amazing,

248
0:09:50.486,000 --> 0:09:51,000
like, a-mazing,

249
0:09:52.273,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and you don't have to wear, like,

250
0:09:53.83,000 --> 0:09:55,000
an Eileen Fisher caftan,

251
0:09:56.565,000 --> 0:09:58,000
just to, like, prove that you are a feminist.

252
0:09:59.36,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Like, not that there's anything wrong with that,

253
0:10:02.193,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but my mom, she's like, like,

254
0:10:05.031,000 --> 0:10:09,000
why do you have to wear pants that, like,

255
0:10:09.17,000 --> 0:10:12,000
objectify your body? I like my pants.

256
0:10:12.625,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Like, I like my voice.

257
0:10:15.626,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Like, she's like, why do you have to talk like —

258
0:10:17.857,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Talk like what? Like, I'm expressing myself,

259
0:10:21.321,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and I think that we have to, like,

260
0:10:22.993,000 --> 0:10:24,000
reach out, like, not only across, like,

261
0:10:25.87,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the different generations of feminists,

262
0:10:29.161,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but also across the, like, vocal ranges,

263
0:10:34.496,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so that, like, we,

264
0:10:37.537,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because otherwise it's just, like,

265
0:10:39.948,000 --> 0:10:41,000
restriculous within feminism,

266
0:10:42.417,000 --> 0:10:45,000
which is just, like, a word that I created

267
0:10:45.789,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that means, like, so strict it's ridiculous.

268
0:10:48.961,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So that's my feeling about that.

269
0:10:50.993,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You guys are a-mazing, by the way.

270
0:10:53.873,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Okay. Next question.

271
0:10:56.983,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Applause)

272
0:10:58.601,000 --> 0:11:01,000
["They've discovered a cure for cancer, but not baldness? What's up with that?"]

273
0:11:03.749,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Yeah, you know what,

274
0:11:05.215,000 --> 0:11:07,000
so my name is Joseph Mancuso.

275
0:11:07.439,000 --> 0:11:1,000
First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate

276
0:11:10.743,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,

277
0:11:13.693,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a pretty orderly group.

278
0:11:17.123,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And, you know, I just have to say,

279
0:11:19.632,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the whole thing with baldness,

280
0:11:21.932,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and, you know, here's the thing.

281
0:11:26.733,000 --> 0:11:29,000
As long as the woman, in my case --

282
0:11:30.288,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because it's a modern world,

283
0:11:31.425,000 --> 0:11:33,000
do whatever you want to do, I don't have any problem with anybody,

284
0:11:34.328,000 --> 0:11:38,000
enjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?

285
0:11:39.195,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But as far as I'm concerned,

286
0:11:42.182,000 --> 0:11:43,000
attractiveness,

287
0:11:43.595,000 --> 0:11:45,000
women don't really care

288
0:11:45.745,000 --> 0:11:47,000
as much as you think they do

289
0:11:47.848,000 --> 0:11:48,000
about the, you know.

290
0:11:49.242,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I mean, I remember hearing this woman.

291
0:11:50.617,000 --> 0:11:52,000
She loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.

292
0:11:53.459,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It's a pretty young girl, you know?

293
0:11:55.304,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And this guy's older.

294
0:11:56.845,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And, you know, she said she would love him

295
0:12:00.05,000 --> 0:12:02,000
even if he had snow on the roof

296
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
or even if melted and disappeared altogether.

297
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
As far as I'm concerned, it's about the love.

298
0:12:08.88,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Am I right, or am I right?

299
0:12:10.542,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So that's it. That's it. That's it.

300
0:12:12.528,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I don't got nothing more to say.

301
0:12:13.304,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Keep your noses clean.

302
0:12:15.022,000 --> 0:12:19,000
All right, next question.

303
0:12:19.476,000 --> 0:12:23,000
"Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown?"

304
0:12:26.057,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Um, well, I,

305
0:12:30.61,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I want to start by saying

306
0:12:32.73,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that this is a very difficult experience

307
0:12:37.248,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for a Chinese-American.

308
0:12:42.564,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I don't know what to call myself now,

309
0:12:45.637,000 --> 0:12:49,000
because I have really my Chinese identity,

310
0:12:49.951,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but my kids, they are American-Chinese,

311
0:12:56.112,000 --> 0:13:,000
but it's difficult to try to express myself

312
0:13:00.503,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in front of audience of people like this.

313
0:13:06.295,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But if had to give my opinion about meat,

314
0:13:13.657,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I think first, the most important thing is to say

315
0:13:18.621,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that we don't have to have perfect food,

316
0:13:24.369,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but maybe it can also not be poison.

317
0:13:29.299,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Maybe we can have some middle ground for that.

318
0:13:34.395,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But I will continue to consider this idea,

319
0:13:38.113,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and I will report back maybe next year.

320
0:13:42.879,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Next.

321
0:13:44.129,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Next. Next. (Applause)

322
0:13:47.197,000 --> 0:13:52,000
"Will there ever be a post-racial world?"

323
0:13:54.387,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Thank you for having me.

324
0:13:56.771,000 --> 0:14:01,000
My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.

325
0:14:01.791,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation.

326
0:14:04.111,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I'm also half Lakota, but that is my given name,

327
0:14:08.122,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and no, even though it would have seemed

328
0:14:11.411,000 --> 0:14:12,000
like an obvious choice,

329
0:14:12.987,000 --> 0:14:15,000
no, I did not go into politics.

330
0:14:18.058,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Tough crowd.

331
0:14:19.302,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Laughter)

332
0:14:20.312,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But I always like to just let people know

333
0:14:23.575,000 --> 0:14:26,000
when they ask about race or those kinds of things,

334
0:14:27.432,000 --> 0:14:31,000
you know, as a member of the First Nations community,

335
0:14:32.168,000 --> 0:14:35,000
you know, I'm probably

336
0:14:36.048,000 --> 0:14:37,000
not your typical guy.

337
0:14:37.8,000 --> 0:14:39,000
For example, in addition to being an activist,

338
0:14:40.773,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I'm also a professional stand-up comedian.

339
0:14:44.908,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Laughter)

340
0:14:48.348,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And, you know, I'm most popular

341
0:14:53.764,000 --> 0:14:55,000
on college and university campuses.

342
0:14:55.787,000 --> 0:14:59,000
You know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,

343
0:15:00.424,000 --> 0:15:05,000
or hey-we're-not-all-white week,

344
0:15:06.31,000 --> 0:15:08,000
then I'm there. (Laughter)

345
0:15:08.418,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world?

346
0:15:12.1,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I think, really, I can't talk about race

347
0:15:15.121,000 --> 0:15:18,000
without remembering that it is a construct

348
0:15:18.19,000 --> 0:15:2,000
in certain respects,

349
0:15:20.381,000 --> 0:15:22,000
but also that, you know,

350
0:15:22.907,000 --> 0:15:25,000
until we redress the wrongs of the past,

351
0:15:26.493,000 --> 0:15:27,000
we're going to be turned around.

352
0:15:28.041,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I don't care if the present is the new future.

353
0:15:32.01,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I think there's a lot of great people here at TED

354
0:15:33.716,000 --> 0:15:35,000
who are working to address that,

355
0:15:35.822,000 --> 0:15:38,000
so with that, if anything I've said today

356
0:15:39.06,000 --> 0:15:42,000
makes you feel uncomfortable, you're welcome.

357
0:15:42.468,000 --> 0:15:44,000
(Applause)

358
0:15:45.355,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I think we have time for one more.

359
0:15:49.162,000 --> 0:15:52,000
"What's the most popular diet these days?"

360
0:15:52.637,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Who's here?

361
0:15:54.445,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Okay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast,

362
0:15:56.497,000 --> 0:15:57,000
as, like, three or four different people.

363
0:15:58.223,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I mean really fast.

364
0:15:59.32,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I'm just gonna let y'all know that, as far as diet is concerned,

365
0:16:02.305,000 --> 0:16:04,000
if you don't love yourself inside,

366
0:16:04.99,000 --> 0:16:06,000
there is no diet on this Earth

367
0:16:07.289,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that is going to make your behind small enough

368
0:16:10.28,000 --> 0:16:11,000
for you to feel good,

369
0:16:11.65,000 --> 0:16:14,000
so just stop wasting your time.

370
0:16:15.29,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I would just like to say as an African woman

371
0:16:17.02,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that I believe the diet that we need

372
0:16:20.12,000 --> 0:16:24,000
is really to remove the crazy belief

373
0:16:24.39,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that there is anything wrong

374
0:16:26.406,000 --> 0:16:27,000
with a nice backside.

375
0:16:27.66,000 --> 0:16:28,000
No, I am teasing about that.

376
0:16:29.539,000 --> 0:16:31,000
There is nothing wrong with a woman of size.

377
0:16:31.834,000 --> 0:16:33,000
That is what I am trying to say.

378
0:16:33.859,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Women, celebrate your body, for God's sake.

379
0:16:36.915,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Stop running around starving.

380
0:16:38.792,000 --> 0:16:41,000
You are making yourselves and other people miserable.

381
0:16:42.653,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Last answer.

382
0:16:46.273,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So we're talking about what's the most popular diet?

383
0:16:50.765,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that

384
0:16:54.521,000 --> 0:16:58,000
this is my first time here at TED.

385
0:16:58.922,000 --> 0:17:,000
I might not be your typical person

386
0:17:01.515,000 --> 0:17:03,000
you find on this stage.

387
0:17:03.84,000 --> 0:17:06,000
My dental work not as nice as some people.

388
0:17:07.103,000 --> 0:17:09,000
But I made Sarah Jones promise

389
0:17:09.162,000 --> 0:17:11,000
she gonna bring me this time,

390
0:17:11.318,000 --> 0:17:16,000
'cause she didn't bring me before,

391
0:17:16.318,000 --> 0:17:17,000
but you know, I just want to say,

392
0:17:18.21,000 --> 0:17:19,000
there's a lot of things more important

393
0:17:19.67,000 --> 0:17:21,000
than counting calories,

394
0:17:22.57,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and as somebody living on the streets in New York,

395
0:17:25.898,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and getting to come here, hear y'all ideas worth spreading,

396
0:17:30.217,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea

397
0:17:32.584,000 --> 0:17:34,000
that the present is the new future,

398
0:17:34.7,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that where you sit, you create everything

399
0:17:37.896,000 --> 0:17:4,000
that's gonna come, for better or worse.

400
0:17:40.91,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And for me, I think homeless

401
0:17:43.53,000 --> 0:17:45,000
is the wrong word for it anyway.

402
0:17:45.642,000 --> 0:17:46,000
You know, I might not have me no place

403
0:17:47.509,000 --> 0:17:48,000
to lay my head at night,

404
0:17:49.208,000 --> 0:17:52,000
but that just makes me houseless.

405
0:17:52.509,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I have me a home. You do too.

406
0:17:54.85,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Find it and try to find yourself in there.

407
0:17:59.073,000 --> 0:18:,000
Make sure you know,

408
0:18:00.602,000 --> 0:18:04,000
it's not just about virtual reality in space.

409
0:18:05.19,000 --> 0:18:06,000
That's wonderful, but it's also about

410
0:18:06.832,000 --> 0:18:08,000
the actual reality here on Earth.

411
0:18:09.526,000 --> 0:18:1,000
How are people living today?

412
0:18:10.998,000 --> 0:18:12,000
How can you be part of the solution?

413
0:18:13.368,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Thank y'all for thinking about that

414
0:18:15.217,000 --> 0:18:16,000
right now in the present moment

415
0:18:16.796,000 --> 0:18:17,000
to influence the future.

416
0:18:18.529,000 --> 0:18:2,000
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.

417
0:18:20.584,000 --> 0:18:22,000
(Applause)

418
0:18:23.102,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Thank you all very, very much.

419
0:18:26.474,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Thank you for trusting me, Chris.

420
0:18:28.642,000 --> 0:18:3,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.948,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.

2
0:00:22.069,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They go to see Michelangelo's "David,"

3
0:00:24.018,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and when they finally come face-to-face with the statue,

4
0:00:26.672,000 --> 0:00:27,000
they both freeze dead in their tracks.

5
0:00:28.524,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The first guy -- we'll call him Adam --

6
0:00:30.415,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form.

7
0:00:33.785,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The second guy -- we'll call him Bill --

8
0:00:35.734,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center.

9
0:00:40.998,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So here's my question for you:

10
0:00:42.925,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush,

11
0:00:46.566,000 --> 0:00:47,000
which for Al Gore?

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I don't need a show of hands,

13
0:00:49.738,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because we all have the same political stereotypes.

14
0:00:52.151,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We all know that it's Bill.

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality.

16
0:00:57.783,000 --> 0:01:,000
It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives

17
0:01:01.181,000 --> 0:01:04,000
on a major personality trait called openness to experience.

18
0:01:04.813,000 --> 0:01:06,000
People who are high in openness to experience

19
0:01:06.948,000 --> 0:01:09,000
just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel.

20
0:01:10.416,000 --> 0:01:12,000
People low on it like things that are familiar,

21
0:01:12.677,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that are safe and dependable.

22
0:01:16.282,000 --> 0:01:17,000
If you know about this trait,

23
0:01:17.689,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior,

24
0:01:20.384,000 --> 0:01:22,000
like why artists are so different from accountants.

25
0:01:22.796,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You can predict what kinds of books they like to read,

26
0:01:25.353,000 --> 0:01:27,000
what kinds of places they like to travel to

27
0:01:27.392,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and what kinds of food they like to eat.

28
0:01:29.333,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Once you understand this trait,

29
0:01:30.849,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's,

30
0:01:33.478,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but not anybody that you know.

31
0:01:34.98,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:40.9,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This trait also tells us a lot about politics.

33
0:01:43.266,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae,

34
0:01:45.679,000 --> 0:01:47,000
says that "Open individuals have an affinity

35
0:01:48.05,000 --> 0:01:5,000
for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views ..."

36
0:01:50.809,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They like a society which is open and changing,

37
0:01:53.323,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"... whereas closed individuals prefer

38
0:01:55.223,000 --> 0:01:57,000
conservative, traditional, right-wing views."

39
0:01:57.956,000 --> 0:02:,000
This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join.

40
0:02:01.226,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Here's the description of a group I found on the web.

41
0:02:03.739,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What kinds of people would join

42
0:02:05.241,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"a global community ... welcoming people from every discipline and culture,

43
0:02:09.017,000 --> 0:02:11,000
who seek a deeper understanding of the world,

44
0:02:11.138,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all"?

45
0:02:14.592,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is from some guy named Ted.

46
0:02:16.145,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Well, let's see now.

47
0:02:17.321,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If openness predicts who becomes liberal,

48
0:02:20.179,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster,

49
0:02:22.932,000 --> 0:02:24,000
then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal?

50
0:02:25.964,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Let's find out.

51
0:02:27.139,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'll ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center --

52
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:31,000
on social issues, primarily --

53
0:02:32.2,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or conservative.

54
0:02:33.375,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And I'll give a third option,

55
0:02:34.793,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because I know there are libertarians in the audience.

56
0:02:37.362,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So please raise your hand -- in the simulcast rooms too.

57
0:02:40.062,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Let's let everybody see who's here.

58
0:02:41.769,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Please raise your hand if you'd say that you're liberal or left of center.

59
0:02:45.303,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Please raise your hand high right now. OK.

60
0:02:47.833,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.

61
0:02:50.914,000 --> 0:02:51,000
OK. About two dozen.

62
0:02:53.234,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.

63
0:02:57.359,000 --> 0:03:01,000
One, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10.

64
0:03:01.982,000 --> 0:03:02,000
OK.

65
0:03:03.745,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This is a bit of a problem.

66
0:03:06.346,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Because if our goal is to seek a deeper understanding of the world,

67
0:03:09.896,000 --> 0:03:12,000
our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.

68
0:03:13.631,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Because when people all share values, when people all share morals,

69
0:03:17.136,000 --> 0:03:18,000
they become a team.

70
0:03:18.402,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And once you engage the psychology of teams,

71
0:03:20.651,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it shuts down open-minded thinking.

72
0:03:25.131,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When the liberal team loses,

[United States of Canada / Jesusland]

74
0:03:29.272,000 --> 0:03:31,000
as it did in 2004, and as it almost did in 2000,

75
0:03:31.952,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we comfort ourselves.

76
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:34.529,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.

78
0:03:38.801,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We think they must be blinded by religion

79
0:03:41.742,000 --> 0:03:43,000
[Post-election US map: America / Dumbf*ckistan]

80
0:03:44.005,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or by simple stupidity.

81
0:03:45.358,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:47.177,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

83
0:03:50.025,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:56.534,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So if you think that half of America votes Republican

85
0:04:01.691,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because they are blinded in this way,

86
0:04:04.153,000 --> 0:04:07,000
then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral Matrix,

87
0:04:07.402,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in a particular moral Matrix.

88
0:04:08.828,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And by "the Matrix," I mean literally the Matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."

89
0:04:12.527,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But I'm here today to give you a choice.

90
0:04:14.536,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions,

91
0:04:19.015,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or you can take the red pill,

92
0:04:20.452,000 --> 0:04:21,000
learn some moral psychology

93
0:04:21.777,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and step outside the moral Matrix.

94
0:04:23.609,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now, because I know --

95
0:04:24.839,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

96
0:04:28.543,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I assume that answers my question.

97
0:04:30.291,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I was going to ask which one you picked, but no need.

98
0:04:32.808,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You're all high in openness to experience,

99
0:04:34.848,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and it looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures.

100
0:04:38.072,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Anyway, let's go with the red pill, study some moral psychology

101
0:04:41.059,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and see where it takes us.

102
0:04:42.331,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Let's start at the beginning: What is morality, where does it come from?

103
0:04:45.749,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The worst idea in all of psychology

104
0:04:47.475,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.

105
0:04:50.023,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world

106
0:04:53.071,000 --> 0:04:55,000
already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds

107
0:04:56.036,000 --> 0:05:,000
and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things

108
0:05:00.248,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and hard to learn others.

109
0:05:01.7,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The best definition of innateness I've seen,

110
0:05:03.895,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which clarifies so many things for me,

111
0:05:05.736,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.

112
0:05:07.675,000 --> 0:05:09,000
He says, "The initial organization of the brain

113
0:05:09.909,000 --> 0:05:1,000
does not depend that much on experience.

114
0:05:11.902,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.

115
0:05:15.285,000 --> 0:05:16,000
'Built-in' doesn't mean unmalleable;

116
0:05:17.053,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it means organized in advance of experience."

117
0:05:20.087,000 --> 0:05:22,000
OK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind?

118
0:05:22.988,000 --> 0:05:25,000
To find out, my colleague Craig Joseph and I read through the literature

119
0:05:26.699,000 --> 0:05:28,000
on anthropology, on culture variation in morality

120
0:05:29.025,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and also on evolutionary psychology,

121
0:05:30.827,000 --> 0:05:31,000
looking for matches:

122
0:05:32.008,000 --> 0:05:34,000
What sorts of things do people talk about across disciplines

123
0:05:34.948,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that you find across cultures and even species?

124
0:05:37.181,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We found five best matches, which we call the five foundations of morality.

125
0:05:40.865,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The first one is harm/care.

126
0:05:42.464,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming

127
0:05:46.079,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that makes us really bond with others, care for others,

128
0:05:48.699,000 --> 0:05:51,000
feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.

129
0:05:51.724,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.

130
0:05:55.197,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent

131
0:05:57.51,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.

132
0:05:59.747,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.

133
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There's actually ambiguous evidence

134
0:06:04.103,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,

135
0:06:06.564,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but the evidence for people could not be clearer.

136
0:06:08.89,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This Norman Rockwell painting is called "The Golden Rule" --

137
0:06:11.724,000 --> 0:06:14,000
as we heard from Karen Armstrong, it's the foundation of many religions.

138
0:06:15.249,000 --> 0:06:17,000
That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent

139
0:06:17.752,000 --> 0:06:19,000
of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.

140
0:06:19.974,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.

141
0:06:21.978,000 --> 0:06:23,000
You do find cooperative groups in the animal kingdom,

142
0:06:24.936,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.

143
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people

144
0:06:31.402,000 --> 0:06:33,000
who are able to cooperate and join together into groups,

145
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.

146
0:06:37.927,000 --> 0:06:4,000
This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.

147
0:06:41.801,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable

148
0:06:44.808,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that even when we don't have tribes, we go ahead and make them,

149
0:06:47.835,000 --> 0:06:48,000
because it's fun.

150
0:06:49.094,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:52.503,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Sports is to war as pornography is to sex.

152
0:06:55.394,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We get to exercise some ancient drives.

153
0:06:59.139,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The fourth foundation is authority/respect.

154
0:07:01.178,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Here you see submissive gestures

155
0:07:02.739,000 --> 0:07:04,000
from two members of very closely related species.

156
0:07:05.052,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality

157
0:07:08.791,000 --> 0:07:09,000
as it is in other primates.

158
0:07:10.176,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's based on more voluntary deference and even elements of love, at times.

159
0:07:14.541,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.

160
0:07:16.625,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity,"

161
0:07:19.17,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but purity is not just about suppressing female sexuality.

162
0:07:22.186,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea

163
0:07:25.154,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body

164
0:07:29.159,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and what you put into your body.

165
0:07:30.742,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And while the political right may moralize sex much more,

166
0:07:34.047,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the political left is doing a lot of it with food.

167
0:07:36.42,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays.

168
0:07:38.596,000 --> 0:07:39,000
A lot of it is ideas about purity,

169
0:07:40.251,000 --> 0:07:42,000
about what you're willing to touch or put into your body.

170
0:07:43.061,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I believe these are the five best candidates

171
0:07:45.976,000 --> 0:07:47,000
for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.

172
0:07:48.634,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I think this is what we come with, a preparedness to learn all these things.

173
0:07:52.315,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But as my son Max grows up in a liberal college town,

174
0:07:55.625,000 --> 0:07:57,000
how is this first draft going to get revised?

175
0:07:58.052,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And how will it end up being different

176
0:07:59.906,000 --> 0:08:02,000
from a kid born 60 miles south of us, in Lynchburg, Virginia?

177
0:08:02.986,000 --> 0:08:05,000
To think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.

178
0:08:06.079,000 --> 0:08:08,000
If there really are five systems at work in the mind,

179
0:08:08.585,000 --> 0:08:09,000
five sources of intuitions and emotions,

180
0:08:10.519,000 --> 0:08:13,000
then we can think of the moral mind as one of those audio equalizers

181
0:08:13.741,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that has five channels,

182
0:08:14.916,000 --> 0:08:16,000
where you can set it to a different setting on every channel.

183
0:08:17.817,000 --> 0:08:19,000
My colleagues Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham and I

184
0:08:20.096,000 --> 0:08:24,000
made a questionnaire, which we put up on the web at www.YourMorals.org.

185
0:08:25.004,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can, too.

186
0:08:29.009,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.

187
0:08:33.235,000 --> 0:08:34,000
On the left are the scores for liberals;

188
0:08:35.174,000 --> 0:08:37,000
on the right, conservatives; in the middle, moderates.

189
0:08:37.735,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The blue line shows people's responses on the average of all the harm questions.

190
0:08:41.554,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So as you see, people care about harm and care issues.

191
0:08:44.171,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They highly endorse these sorts of statements all across the board,

192
0:08:47.358,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but as you also see,

193
0:08:48.533,000 --> 0:08:51,000
liberals care about it a little more than conservatives; the line slopes down.

194
0:08:52.285,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Same story for fairness.

195
0:08:53.684,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But look at the other three lines.

196
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
For liberals, the scores are very low.

197
0:08:57.177,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They're basically saying, "This is not morality.

198
0:08:59.441,000 --> 0:09:02,000
In-group, authority, purity -- this has nothing to do with morality. I reject it."

199
0:09:03.325,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But as people get more conservative, the values rise.

200
0:09:05.834,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We can say liberals have a two-channel or two-foundation morality.

201
0:09:08.971,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Conservatives have more of a five-foundation,

202
0:09:11.094,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or five-channel morality.

203
0:09:12.311,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We find this in every country we look at.

204
0:09:14.293,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians. I'll flip through a few other slides.

205
0:09:17.812,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The UK, Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,

206
0:09:20.793,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.

207
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Notice also that on all of these graphs,

208
0:09:26.266,000 --> 0:09:28,000
the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity,

209
0:09:29.093,000 --> 0:09:31,000
which shows that, within any country,

210
0:09:31.829,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.

211
0:09:33.999,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I mean, we debate over what's fair,

212
0:09:35.734,000 --> 0:09:38,000
but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.

213
0:09:39.028,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Moral arguments within cultures

214
0:09:41.188,000 --> 0:09:44,000
are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.

215
0:09:44.39,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This effect is so robust, we find it no matter how we ask the question.

216
0:09:47.825,000 --> 0:09:48,000
In a recent study, we asked people,

217
0:09:49.522,000 --> 0:09:5,000
suppose you're about to get a dog,

218
0:09:51.171,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you picked a particular breed, learned about the breed.

219
0:09:53.789,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded

220
0:09:56.923,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal.

221
0:09:59.296,000 --> 0:10:01,000
If you're a liberal, you say, "That's great!"

222
0:10:01.424,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because liberals like to say, "Fetch! Please."

223
0:10:03.602,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

224
0:10:08.235,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But if you're a conservative, that's not so attractive.

225
0:10:11.273,000 --> 0:10:13,000
If you're conservative and learn that a dog's extremely loyal

226
0:10:14.156,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to its home and family

227
0:10:15.331,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and doesn't warm up to strangers,

228
0:10:16.931,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for conservatives, loyalty is good; dogs ought to be loyal.

229
0:10:19.726,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But to a liberal,

230
0:10:20.902,000 --> 0:10:23,000
it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination.

231
0:10:23.985,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:25.011,000 --> 0:10:28,000
You might say, OK, there are differences between liberals and conservatives,

233
0:10:28.621,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but what makes the three other foundations moral?

234
0:10:30.933,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Aren't they the foundations of xenophobia, authoritarianism and puritanism?

235
0:10:34.487,000 --> 0:10:35,000
What makes them moral?

236
0:10:35.666,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,

237
0:10:39.657,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"The Garden of Earthly Delights."

238
0:10:41.261,000 --> 0:10:43,000
In the first panel, we see the moment of creation.

239
0:10:43.914,000 --> 0:10:44,000
All is ordered, all is beautiful,

240
0:10:45.855,000 --> 0:10:48,000
all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing,

241
0:10:49.221,000 --> 0:10:5,000
are where they're supposed to be.

242
0:10:50.831,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But then, given the way of the world, things change.

243
0:10:53.287,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We get every person doing whatever he wants,

244
0:10:55.374,000 --> 0:10:58,000
with every aperture of every other person and every other animal.

245
0:10:58.45,000 --> 0:11:,000
Some of you might recognize this as the '60s.

246
0:11:00.573,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Laughter)

247
0:11:02.009,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s,

248
0:11:05.461,000 --> 0:11:08,000
where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.

249
0:11:08.9,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Of course, Bosch called this hell.

250
0:11:11.078,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So this triptych, these three panels,

251
0:11:15.231,000 --> 0:11:19,000
portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.

252
0:11:19.544,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The truth of social entropy.

253
0:11:21.373,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination

254
0:11:24.688,000 --> 0:11:26,000
where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,

255
0:11:27.296,000 --> 0:11:29,000
here's the same story, the same progression,

256
0:11:29.382,000 --> 0:11:31,000
told in a paper that was published in "Nature" a few years ago,

257
0:11:32.375,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gächter had people play a commons dilemma,

258
0:11:36.396,000 --> 0:11:37,000
a game in which you give people money,

259
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and then, on each round of the game,

260
0:11:40.072,000 --> 0:11:42,000
they can put money into a common pot,

261
0:11:42.129,000 --> 0:11:44,000
then the experimenter doubles what's there,

262
0:11:44.161,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and then it's all divided among the players.

263
0:11:46.237,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So it's a nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,

264
0:11:49.158,000 --> 0:11:51,000
where we're asking people to make a sacrifice

265
0:11:51.28,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and they don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.

266
0:11:53.883,000 --> 0:11:55,000
You really want everybody else to sacrifice,

267
0:11:55.968,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but everybody has a temptation to free ride.

268
0:11:58.048,000 --> 0:12:01,000
What happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative.

269
0:12:01.464,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This is all played anonymously.

270
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
On the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.

271
0:12:06.904,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But they quickly see other people aren't doing so much.

272
0:12:09.598,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"I don't want to be a sucker. I won't cooperate."

273
0:12:11.934,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So cooperation quickly decays

274
0:12:13.4,000 --> 0:12:15,000
from reasonably good down to close to zero.

275
0:12:15.989,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But then -- and here's the trick --

276
0:12:17.693,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Fehr and Gächter, on the seventh round, told people,

277
0:12:20.149,000 --> 0:12:21,000
"You know what? New rule.

278
0:12:21.381,000 --> 0:12:23,000
If you want to give some of your own money

279
0:12:23.54,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to punish people who aren't contributing,

280
0:12:26.073,000 --> 0:12:27,000
you can do that."

281
0:12:27.452,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,

282
0:12:30.886,000 --> 0:12:31,000
cooperation shoots up.

283
0:12:32.136,000 --> 0:12:33,000
It shoots up and it keeps going up.

284
0:12:33.849,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Lots of research shows that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.

285
0:12:37.408,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It's not enough to appeal to people's good motives.

286
0:12:39.837,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It helps to have some sort of punishment.

287
0:12:41.838,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip,

288
0:12:44.253,000 --> 0:12:45,000
you need some sort of punishment

289
0:12:45.817,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to bring people, when they're in large groups, to cooperate.

290
0:12:48.654,000 --> 0:12:5,000
There's even some recent research suggesting that religion --

291
0:12:51.618,000 --> 0:12:53,000
priming God, making people think about God --

292
0:12:53.786,000 --> 0:12:57,000
often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.

293
0:12:58.574,000 --> 0:13:,000
Some people think that religion is an adaptation

294
0:13:00.838,000 --> 0:13:02,000
evolved both by cultural and biological evolution

295
0:13:03.154,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to make groups to cohere,

296
0:13:04.904,000 --> 0:13:06,000
in part for the purpose of trusting each other

297
0:13:07.126,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and being more effective at competing with other groups.

298
0:13:09.782,000 --> 0:13:11,000
That's probably right, although this is a controversial issue.

299
0:13:12.718,000 --> 0:13:15,000
But I'm particularly interested in religion and the origin of religion

300
0:13:16.099,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and in what it does to us and for us,

301
0:13:18.209,000 --> 0:13:21,000
because I think the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.

302
0:13:21.68,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The Grand Canyon is really simple --

303
0:13:23.532,000 --> 0:13:26,000
a lot of rock and a lot of water and wind and a lot of time,

304
0:13:26.727,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and you get the Grand Canyon.

305
0:13:28.144,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's not that complicated.

306
0:13:29.409,000 --> 0:13:3,000
This is what's complicated:

307
0:13:30.723,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that people lived in places like the Grand Canyon, cooperating with each other,

308
0:13:34.596,000 --> 0:13:36,000
or on the savannahs of Africa or the frozen shores of Alaska.

309
0:13:37.497,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon

310
0:13:40.872,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and Rome and Tenochtitlan.

311
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
How did this happen?

312
0:13:43.505,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It's an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.

313
0:13:46.892,000 --> 0:13:49,000
The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.

314
0:13:50.009,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups.

315
0:13:53.385,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Yes, you need to be concerned about harm, you need a psychology of justice.

316
0:13:56.981,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But it helps to organize a group if you have subgroups,

317
0:13:59.609,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and if those subgroups have some internal structure,

318
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and if you have some ideology that tells people

319
0:14:04.593,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to suppress their carnality -- to pursue higher, nobler ends.

320
0:14:09.118,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives:

321
0:14:12.848,000 --> 0:14:14,000
liberals reject three of these foundations.

322
0:14:15.117,000 --> 0:14:18,000
They say, "Let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership,"

323
0:14:18.481,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and, "Let's question authority," and, "Keep your laws off my body."

324
0:14:21.719,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Liberals have very noble motives for doing this.

325
0:14:23.992,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Traditional authority and morality can be quite repressive and restrictive

326
0:14:27.566,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to those at the bottom, to women, to people who don't fit in.

327
0:14:30.457,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.

328
0:14:32.493,000 --> 0:14:34,000
They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.

329
0:14:35.144,000 --> 0:14:37,000
This shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution."

330
0:14:37.662,000 --> 0:14:4,000
If you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good; it's change, it's fun.

331
0:14:41.664,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.

332
0:14:45.074,000 --> 0:14:47,000
They want order, even at some cost, to those at the bottom.

333
0:14:47.885,000 --> 0:14:5,000
The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.

334
0:14:51.257,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It's precious, and it's really easy to lose.

335
0:14:53.564,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men,

336
0:14:55.847,000 --> 0:14:58,000
as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."

337
0:14:59.024,000 --> 0:15:01,000
This was after the chaos of the French Revolution.

338
0:15:01.39,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Once you see that liberals and conservatives

339
0:15:03.538,000 --> 0:15:04,000
both have something to contribute,

340
0:15:05.228,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that they form a balance on change versus stability,

341
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
then I think the way is open to step outside the moral Matrix.

342
0:15:11.979,000 --> 0:15:12,000
This is the great insight

343
0:15:13.439,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that all the Asian religions have attained.

344
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Think about yin and yang.

345
0:15:17.596,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Yin and yang aren't enemies; they don't hate each other.

346
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Yin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,

347
0:15:22.873,000 --> 0:15:23,000
for the functioning of the world.

348
0:15:24.49,000 --> 0:15:25,000
You find the same thing in Hinduism.

349
0:15:26.24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There are many high gods in Hinduism.

350
0:15:28.038,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.

351
0:15:31.077,000 --> 0:15:33,000
This image, actually, is both of those gods

352
0:15:33.154,000 --> 0:15:34,000
sharing the same body.

353
0:15:34.403,000 --> 0:15:36,000
You have the markings of Vishnu on the left,

354
0:15:36.866,000 --> 0:15:38,000
so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.

355
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
You have the markings of Shiva on the right -- Shiva's the liberal god.

356
0:15:42.72,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And they work together.

357
0:15:43.903,000 --> 0:15:44,000
You find the same thing in Buddhism.

358
0:15:45.653,000 --> 0:15:47,000
These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights

359
0:15:48.302,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that have ever been attained into moral psychology.

360
0:15:50.716,000 --> 0:15:52,000

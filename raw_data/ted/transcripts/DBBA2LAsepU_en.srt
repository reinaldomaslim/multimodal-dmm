1
0:00:13.375,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So what if there were a highly obvious problem

2
0:00:17.375,000 --> 0:00:18,000
right in front of you?

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:22,000
One that everyone was talking about,

4
0:00:22.167,000 --> 0:00:24,000
one that affected you directly.

5
0:00:25.542,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Would you do everything within your power to fix things

6
0:00:29.875,000 --> 0:00:3,000
before they got worse?

7
0:00:32.667,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Don't be so sure.

8
0:00:34.417,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We are all much more likely than any of us would like to admit

9
0:00:38.875,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to miss what's right in front of our eyes.

10
0:00:41.875,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And in fact,

11
0:00:43.333,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we're sometimes most likely to turn away from things

12
0:00:47.083,000 --> 0:00:51,000
precisely because of the threat that they represent to us,

13
0:00:51.75,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in business, life and the world.

14
0:00:55.125,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So I want to give you an example from my world, economic policy.

15
0:01:00.708,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So when Alan Greenspan was head of the Federal Reserve,

16
0:01:04.042,000 --> 0:01:09,000
his entire job was to watch out for problems in the US economy

17
0:01:09.542,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and to make sure that they didn't spin out of control.

18
0:01:12.292,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So, after 2006,

19
0:01:14.25,000 --> 0:01:16,000
when real estate prices peaked,

20
0:01:16.833,000 --> 0:01:2,000
more and more and more respected leaders and institutions

21
0:01:21.458,000 --> 0:01:23,000
started to sound the alarm bells

22
0:01:24.083,000 --> 0:01:28,000
about risky lending and dangerous market bubbles.

23
0:01:29.25,000 --> 0:01:32,000
As you know, in 2008 it all came tumbling down.

24
0:01:33.083,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Banks collapsed,

25
0:01:34.667,000 --> 0:01:37,000
global stock markets lost nearly half their value,

26
0:01:37.917,000 --> 0:01:41,000
millions and millions of people lost their homes to foreclosure.

27
0:01:42.542,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And at the bottom,

28
0:01:43.833,000 --> 0:01:46,000
nearly one in 10 Americans was out of work.

29
0:01:48.875,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So after things calmed down a little bit,

30
0:01:51.25,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Greenspan and many others came out with a postmortem and said,

31
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"Nobody could have predicted that crisis."

32
0:01:58.792,000 --> 0:02:,000
They called it "a black swan."

33
0:02:01.292,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Something that was unimaginable,

34
0:02:04.125,000 --> 0:02:08,000
unforeseeable and completely improbable.

35
0:02:09.5,000 --> 0:02:11,000
A total surprise.

36
0:02:11.542,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Except it wasn't always such a surprise.

37
0:02:15.458,000 --> 0:02:19,000
For example, my Manhattan apartment nearly doubled in value

38
0:02:19.875,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in less than four years.

39
0:02:21.958,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I saw the writing on the wall and I sold it.

40
0:02:25.25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:27.875,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Applause)

42
0:02:31.792,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, a lot of other people also saw the warning,

43
0:02:34.042,000 --> 0:02:35,000
spoke out publicly

44
0:02:36.958,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and they were ignored.

45
0:02:38.958,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So we didn't know exactly what the crisis was going to look like,

46
0:02:43.208,000 --> 0:02:45,000
not the exact parameters,

47
0:02:45.25,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but we could all tell

48
0:02:47.125,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that the thing coming at us was as dangerous, visible and predictable

49
0:02:53.5,000 --> 0:02:56,000
as a giant gray rhino charging right at us.

50
0:02:57.792,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The black swan lends itself

51
0:02:59.833,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to the idea that we don't have power over our futures.

52
0:03:04.75,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And unfortunately, the less control that we think we have,

53
0:03:09.583,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the more likely we are to downplay it

54
0:03:12.708,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or ignore it entirely.

55
0:03:16.458,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And this dangerous dynamic masks another problem:

56
0:03:20.333,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that most of the problems that we're facing

57
0:03:22.542,000 --> 0:03:24,000
are so probable and obvious,

58
0:03:25.167,000 --> 0:03:28,000
they're things that we can see, but we still don't do anything about.

59
0:03:29.792,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So I created the gray rhino metaphor

60
0:03:32.292,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to meet what I felt was an urgent need.

61
0:03:35.375,000 --> 0:03:37,000
To help us to take a fresh look,

62
0:03:37.917,000 --> 0:03:39,000
with the same passion that people had for the black swan,

63
0:03:40.625,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but this time, for the things that were highly obvious,

64
0:03:44.5,000 --> 0:03:47,000
highly probable, but still neglected.

65
0:03:50.542,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Those are the gray rhinos.

66
0:03:53.375,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Once you start looking for gray rhinos,

67
0:03:55.708,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you see them in the headlines every day.

68
0:03:59.25,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And so what I see in the headlines is another big gray rhino,

69
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:07,000
a new highly probable financial crisis.

70
0:04:08.458,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I wonder if we've learned anything in the last 10 years.

71
0:04:12.333,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So if you listen to Washington or Wall Street,

72
0:04:15.75,000 --> 0:04:21,000
you could almost be forgiven for thinking that only smooth sailing laid ahead.

73
0:04:23.375,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But in China, where I spend a lot of time,

74
0:04:26.5,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the conversation is totally different.

75
0:04:29.416,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The entire economic team,

76
0:04:31.666,000 --> 0:04:33,000
all the way up to president Xi Jinping himself,

77
0:04:34.667,000 --> 0:04:36,000
talk very specifically and clearly

78
0:04:37.417,000 --> 0:04:4,000
about financial risks as gray rhinos,

79
0:04:41.292,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and how they can tame them.

80
0:04:43.542,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now, to be sure, China and the US

81
0:04:45.167,000 --> 0:04:47,000
have very, very different systems of government,

82
0:04:47.458,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which affects what they're able to do or not.

83
0:04:49.792,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And many of the root causes for their economic problems

84
0:04:52.625,000 --> 0:04:53,000
are totally different.

85
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But it's no secret that both countries have problems

86
0:04:57.625,000 --> 0:05:,000
with debt, with inequality and with economic productivity.

87
0:05:03.042,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So how come the conversations are so different?

88
0:05:06.167,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You could actually ask this question,

89
0:05:08.042,000 --> 0:05:1,000
not just about countries,

90
0:05:10.375,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but about just about everyone.

91
0:05:12.708,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The auto companies that put safety first

92
0:05:16.625,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the ones that don't bother to recall their shoddy cars

93
0:05:19.417,000 --> 0:05:21,000
until after people die.

94
0:05:24.417,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The grandparents who, in preparing for the inevitable --

95
0:05:29.917,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the ones who have the eulogy written,

96
0:05:33.125,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the menu for the funeral lunch.

97
0:05:35.042,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:36.542,000 --> 0:05:37,000
My grandparents did.

99
0:05:37.875,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:39.375,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And everything but the final date chiseled into the gravestone.

101
0:05:44.5,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But then you have the grandparents on the other side,

102
0:05:47.001,000 --> 0:05:49,000
who don't put their final affairs in order,

103
0:05:49.542,000 --> 0:05:5,000
who don't get rid of all the junk

104
0:05:51.167,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they've been hoarding for decades and decades

105
0:05:53.292,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and leave their kids to deal with it.

106
0:05:56.208,000 --> 0:06:,000
So what makes the difference between one side and the other?

107
0:06:00.292,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Why do some people see things and deal with them,

108
0:06:02.917,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and the other ones just look away?

109
0:06:06.958,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So the first one has to do with culture, society,

110
0:06:10.292,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the people around you.

111
0:06:12.917,000 --> 0:06:14,000
If you think that someone around you

112
0:06:15.625,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is going to help pick you up when you fall,

113
0:06:18.417,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you're much more likely to see a danger as being smaller.

114
0:06:22.542,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And that allows us to take good chances, not just the bad ones.

115
0:06:27.25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
For example, like risking criticism

116
0:06:29.667,000 --> 0:06:32,000
when you talk about the danger that nobody wants you to talk about.

117
0:06:33.208,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Or taking the opportunities that are kind of scary,

118
0:06:36.125,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so in their own way are gray rhinos.

119
0:06:39.417,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So the US has a very individualist culture -- go it alone.

120
0:06:44.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And paradoxically,

121
0:06:45.75,000 --> 0:06:48,000
this makes many Americans much less open to change

122
0:06:49.5,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and taking good risks.

123
0:06:51.083,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In China, by contrast,

124
0:06:53.042,000 --> 0:06:56,000
people believe that the government is going to keep problems from happening,

125
0:06:56.792,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which might not always be what happens, but people believe it.

126
0:07:00.25,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They believe they can rely on their families,

127
0:07:02.375,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so that makes them more likely to take certain risks.

128
0:07:05.417,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Like buying Beijing real estate,

129
0:07:07.042,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or like being more open about the fact that they need to change direction,

130
0:07:10.958,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and in fact, the pace of change in China is absolutely amazing.

131
0:07:15.958,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Second of all,

132
0:07:17.833,000 --> 0:07:19,000
how much do you know about a situation,

133
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:21,000
how much are you willing to learn?

134
0:07:22.958,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And are you willing to see things even when it's not what you want?

135
0:07:26.708,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So many of us are so unlikely

136
0:07:29.625,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to pay attention to the things that we just want to black out,

137
0:07:32.917,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we don't like them.

138
0:07:34.208,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We pay attention to what we want to see, what we like, what we agree with.

139
0:07:39.125,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But we have the opportunity and the ability

140
0:07:41.583,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to correct those blind spots.

141
0:07:44.208,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I spend a lot of time talking with people of all walks of life

142
0:07:47.5,000 --> 0:07:5,000
about the gray rhinos in their life and their attitudes.

143
0:07:50.542,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And you might think

144
0:07:52.125,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that the people who are more afraid of risk,

145
0:07:54.625,000 --> 0:07:55,000
who are more sensitive to them,

146
0:07:56.333,000 --> 0:07:59,000
would be the ones who would be less open to change.

147
0:07:59.792,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But the opposite is actually true.

148
0:08:01.833,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I've found that the people

149
0:08:03.167,000 --> 0:08:05,000
who are wiling to recognize the problems around them

150
0:08:05.667,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and make plans

151
0:08:07.042,000 --> 0:08:1,000
are the ones who are able to tolerate more risk, good risk,

152
0:08:10.625,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and deal with the bad risk.

153
0:08:13.292,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And it's because as we seek information,

154
0:08:16.292,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we increase our power to do something about the things that we're afraid of.

155
0:08:21.708,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And that brings me to my third point.

156
0:08:23.833,000 --> 0:08:26,000
How much control do you feel that you have

157
0:08:27.25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
over the gray rhinos in your life?

158
0:08:30.167,000 --> 0:08:32,000
One of the reasons we don't act

159
0:08:32.333,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is that we often feel too helpless.

160
0:08:35.125,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Think of climate change, it can feel so big,

161
0:08:38.083,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that not a single one of us could make a difference.

162
0:08:42.125,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So some people go about life denying it.

163
0:08:44.792,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Other people blame everyone except themselves.

164
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Like my friend who says he's not ever going to give up his SUV

165
0:08:50.957,000 --> 0:08:52,000
until they stop building coal plants in China.

166
0:08:53.167,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But we have an opportunity to change.

167
0:08:56.583,000 --> 0:08:58,000
No two of us are the same.

168
0:08:58.75,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Every single one of us has the opportunity to change our attitudes,

169
0:09:03.667,000 --> 0:09:05,000
our own and those of people around us.

170
0:09:06.417,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So today, I want to invite all of you

171
0:09:09.667,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to join me in helping to spark an open and honest conversation

172
0:09:14.375,000 --> 0:09:15,000
with the people around you,

173
0:09:15.875,000 --> 0:09:18,000
about the gray rhinos in our world,

174
0:09:19.25,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and be brutally honest about how well we're dealing with them.

175
0:09:23.208,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I hear so many times in the States,

176
0:09:25.875,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"Well, of course we should deal with obvious problems,

177
0:09:28.583,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but if you don't see what's in front of you,

178
0:09:30.667,000 --> 0:09:32,000
you're either dumb or ignorant."

179
0:09:32.833,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That's what they say, and I could not disagree more.

180
0:09:36.625,000 --> 0:09:38,000
If you don't see what's in front of you,

181
0:09:39.333,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you're not dumb, you're not ignorant,

182
0:09:42.625,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you're human.

183
0:09:44.333,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And once we all recognize that shared vulnerability,

184
0:09:49.583,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that gives us the power to open our eyes,

185
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to see what's in front of us

186
0:09:55.958,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and to act before we get trampled.

187
0:10:01.208,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Applause)

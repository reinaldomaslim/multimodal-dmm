1
0:00:18.917,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm sure that,

2
0:00:20.484,000 --> 0:00:25,000
throughout the 100,000-odd years of our species' existence

3
0:00:26.789,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and even before,

4
0:00:29.234,000 --> 0:00:33,000
our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are --

5
0:00:34.471,000 --> 0:00:35,000
wondering, therefore,

6
0:00:37.253,000 --> 0:00:4,000
how to explain what they saw

7
0:00:40.941,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in terms of things unseen.

8
0:00:47.184,000 --> 0:00:52,000
OK, so, most people only wondered that occasionally, like today,

9
0:00:52.454,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them.

10
0:00:56.954,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know.

11
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They wished they knew

12
0:01:06.004,000 --> 0:01:1,000
how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing,

13
0:01:10.697,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and how they could rest when they were tired

14
0:01:13.541,000 --> 0:01:15,000
without risking starvation,

15
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
be warmer, cooler, safer,

16
0:01:21.547,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in less pain.

17
0:01:23.227,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know

18
0:01:28.506,000 --> 0:01:29,000
how to draw better.

19
0:01:31.015,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:32.295,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In every aspect of their lives,

21
0:01:35.486,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they wished for progress, just as we do.

22
0:01:40.469,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But they failed, almost completely, to make any.

23
0:01:46.812,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They didn't know how to.

24
0:01:49.511,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Discoveries like fire happened so rarely

25
0:01:55.29,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that, from an individual's point of view,

26
0:01:57.656,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the world never improved.

27
0:02:00.495,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Nothing new was learned.

28
0:02:04.259,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The first clue to the origin of starlight

29
0:02:07.961,000 --> 0:02:11,000
happened as recently as 1899:

30
0:02:12.439,000 --> 0:02:13,000
radioactivity.

31
0:02:14.426,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And within 40 years,

32
0:02:16.514,000 --> 0:02:19,000
physicists discovered the whole explanation,

33
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.

34
0:02:25.212,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But never mind the symbols.

35
0:02:27.669,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Think how many discoveries they represent.

36
0:02:33.03,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.

37
0:02:36.365,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But isotopes,

38
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
particles of electricity,

39
0:02:43.554,000 --> 0:02:44,000
antimatter,

40
0:02:47.25,000 --> 0:02:48,000
neutrinos,

41
0:02:49.095,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc2 --

42
0:02:53.514,000 --> 0:02:54,000
gamma rays,

43
0:02:55.98,000 --> 0:02:56,000
transmutation.

44
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists

45
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
was achieved through these same theories

46
0:03:06.608,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries

47
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and new, unexpected phenomena.

48
0:03:14.702,000 --> 0:03:17,000
That all that, discovered in 40 years,

49
0:03:18.699,000 --> 0:03:21,000
had not been in the previous hundred thousand

50
0:03:21.931,000 --> 0:03:24,000
was not for lack of thinking

51
0:03:25.262,000 --> 0:03:29,000
about stars and all those other urgent problems they had.

52
0:03:30.093,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They even arrived at answers, such as myths,

53
0:03:34.411,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that dominated their lives,

54
0:03:36.587,000 --> 0:03:4,000
yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth.

55
0:03:42.514,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation

56
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.

57
0:03:49.819,000 --> 0:03:53,000
These were people with brains of essentially the same design

58
0:03:54.08,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that eventually did discover all those things.

59
0:03:59.1,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But that ability to make progress

60
0:04:03.101,000 --> 0:04:06,000
remained almost unused,

61
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
until the event that revolutionized the human condition

62
0:04:12.077,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and changed the universe.

63
0:04:13.727,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Or so we should hope,

64
0:04:15.084,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because that event was the scientific revolution,

65
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
ever since which our knowledge of the physical world

66
0:04:23.219,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and of how to adapt it to our wishes

67
0:04:27.098,000 --> 0:04:28,000
has been growing relentlessly.

68
0:04:29.584,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, what had changed?

69
0:04:32.208,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What were people now doing for the first time

70
0:04:34.497,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that made that difference between stagnation

71
0:04:38.531,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and rapid, open-ended discovery?

72
0:04:42.639,000 --> 0:04:44,000
How to make that difference

73
0:04:44.672,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is surely the most important universal truth

74
0:04:48.153,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that it's possible to know.

75
0:04:50.781,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And worryingly, there's no consensus about what it is.

76
0:04:55.562,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, I'll tell you.

77
0:04:57.029,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:58.084,000 --> 0:05:,000
But I'll have to backtrack a little first.

79
0:05:01.376,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Before the scientific revolution,

80
0:05:04.447,000 --> 0:05:07,000
they believed that everything important, knowable,

81
0:05:07.483,000 --> 0:05:08,000
was already known,

82
0:05:09.001,000 --> 0:05:12,000
enshrined in ancient writings, institutions

83
0:05:12.708,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb --

84
0:05:15.768,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which were, however, entrenched as dogmas,

85
0:05:19.034,000 --> 0:05:21,000
along with many falsehoods.

86
0:05:21.945,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So, they believed that knowledge came from authorities

87
0:05:25.697,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that actually knew very little.

88
0:05:28.178,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And therefore,

89
0:05:30.15,000 --> 0:05:34,000
progress depended on learning how to reject

90
0:05:34.808,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the authority of learned men, the priests, traditions and rulers,

91
0:05:41.592,000 --> 0:05:45,000
which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context:

92
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the Enlightenment, a revolution in how people sought knowledge,

93
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
trying not to rely on authority.

94
0:05:56.882,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"Take no one's word for it."

95
0:05:58.621,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But that can't be what made the difference.

96
0:06:02.008,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Authorities had been rejected before, many times.

97
0:06:04.985,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And that rarely, if ever,

98
0:06:07.033,000 --> 0:06:1,000
caused anything like the scientific revolution.

99
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
At the time, what they thought distinguished science

100
0:06:14.364,000 --> 0:06:18,000
was a radical idea about things unseen,

101
0:06:18.82,000 --> 0:06:2,000
known as empiricism --

102
0:06:21.457,000 --> 0:06:24,000
all knowledge derives from the senses.

103
0:06:26.484,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Well, we've seen that that can't be true.

104
0:06:29.715,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It did help by promoting observation and experiment.

105
0:06:35.439,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But, from the outset,

106
0:06:36.722,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it.

107
0:06:40.445,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Knowledge comes from the senses?

108
0:06:42.424,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In what language?

109
0:06:43.606,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Certainly not the language of mathematics, in which, Galileo rightly said,

110
0:06:48.176,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the book of nature is written.

111
0:06:51.553,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Look at the world.

112
0:06:52.734,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You don't see equations carved on the mountainsides.

113
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If you did, it would be because people had carved them.

114
0:07:00.98,000 --> 0:07:02,000
By the way, why don't we do that?

115
0:07:03.086,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:04.186,000 --> 0:07:05,000
What's wrong with us?

117
0:07:05.719,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

118
0:07:07.187,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Empiricism is inadequate

119
0:07:09.85,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because, well, scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.

120
0:07:16.137,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And the unseen, you have to admit,

121
0:07:18.746,000 --> 0:07:19,000
doesn't come to us through the senses.

122
0:07:20.692,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.

123
0:07:24.459,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We don't see the origin of species.

124
0:07:27.925,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We don't see the curvature of space-time,

125
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and other universes.

126
0:07:33.273,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But we know about those things.

127
0:07:36.02,000 --> 0:07:37,000
How?

128
0:07:38.131,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction --

129
0:07:43.971,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the unseen resembles the seen.

130
0:07:47.763,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But it doesn't.

131
0:07:49.414,000 --> 0:07:53,000
You know what the clinching evidence was that space-time is curved?

132
0:07:54.426,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It was a photograph -- not of space-time,

133
0:07:57.606,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.

134
0:08:01.767,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And the evidence for evolution?

135
0:08:03.622,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Some rocks and some finches.

136
0:08:06.912,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And parallel universes?

137
0:08:08.114,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Again: dots there rather than there, on a screen.

138
0:08:11.794,000 --> 0:08:13,000
What we see in all these cases

139
0:08:14.428,000 --> 0:08:2,000
bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible --

140
0:08:21.026,000 --> 0:08:27,000
only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.

141
0:08:27.054,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Ah!" say creationists.

142
0:08:29.387,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"So you admit it's all interpretation.

143
0:08:31.811,000 --> 0:08:33,000
No one's ever seen evolution.

144
0:08:34.294,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We see rocks.

145
0:08:36.824,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You have your interpretation. We have ours.

146
0:08:39.277,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Yours comes from guesswork; ours, from the Bible."

147
0:08:43.432,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But what creationist and empiricists both ignore

148
0:08:49.667,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is that, in that sense,

149
0:08:51.129,000 --> 0:08:53,000
no one's ever seen a Bible either,

150
0:08:54.964,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.

151
0:08:58.573,000 --> 0:09:,000
Brains only detect nerve impulses.

152
0:09:01.78,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And they don't perceive even those as what they really are,

153
0:09:04.895,000 --> 0:09:06,000
namely electrical crackles.

154
0:09:07.119,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So we perceive nothing as what it really is.

155
0:09:11.886,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Our connection to reality is never just perception.

156
0:09:16.823,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It's always, as Karl Popper put it,

157
0:09:20.497,000 --> 0:09:21,000
theory-laden.

158
0:09:23.076,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.

159
0:09:25.992,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Like all knowledge, it's conjectural, guesswork,

160
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
tested by observation,

161
0:09:33.594,000 --> 0:09:35,000
not derived from it.

162
0:09:37.423,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So, were testable conjectures the great innovation

163
0:09:40.473,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that opened the intellectual prison gates?

164
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
No, contrary to what's usually said, testability is common

165
0:09:49.44,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.

166
0:09:53.807,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday

167
0:09:57.475,000 --> 0:09:59,000
has got a testable prediction.

168
0:10:00.784,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons.

169
0:10:06.685,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Hades, god of the underworld,

170
0:10:09.015,000 --> 0:10:11,000
kidnaps Persephone, the goddess of spring,

171
0:10:11.403,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and negotiates a forced marriage contract, requiring her to return regularly,

172
0:10:17.286,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and lets her go.

173
0:10:18.681,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And each year,

174
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
she is magically compelled to return.

175
0:10:23.283,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And her mother, Demeter,

176
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
goddess of the earth,

177
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is sad, and makes it cold and barren.

178
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
That myth is testable.

179
0:10:35.279,000 --> 0:10:38,000
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,

180
0:10:39.294,000 --> 0:10:43,000
then it must happen everywhere on earth simultaneously.

181
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So if the ancient Greeks had only known

182
0:10:45.431,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest ...

183
0:10:49.835,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Laughter)

184
0:10:50.874,000 --> 0:10:52,000
they'd have known that their theory is false.

185
0:10:53.075,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter)

186
0:10:54.131,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So, what was wrong with that myth

187
0:10:56.775,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and with all prescientific thinking?

188
0:10:59.524,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And what, then, made that momentous difference?

189
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I think there's one thing you have to care about

190
0:11:09.042,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and that implies testability, the scientific method,

191
0:11:13.129,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the Enlightenment and everything.

192
0:11:15.04,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And here's the crucial thing:

193
0:11:17.207,000 --> 0:11:19,000
there is such a thing as a defect in a story.

194
0:11:20.144,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I don't just mean a logical defect.

195
0:11:21.952,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I mean a bad explanation.

196
0:11:25.207,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What does that mean?

197
0:11:26.633,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Well, an explanation is an assertion about what's there, unseen,

198
0:11:31.531,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that accounts for what's seen;

199
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract

200
0:11:39.824,000 --> 0:11:4,000
could be played equally well

201
0:11:41.227,000 --> 0:11:45,000
by infinitely many other ad hoc entities.

202
0:11:45.304,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Why a marriage contract and not any other reason

203
0:11:48.899,000 --> 0:11:51,000
for regular annual action?

204
0:11:52.114,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Here's one: Persephone wasn't released.

205
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
She escaped, and returns every spring to take revenge on Hades,

206
0:12:01.655,000 --> 0:12:02,000
with her spring powers.

207
0:12:03.799,000 --> 0:12:07,000
She cools his domain with spring air,

208
0:12:08.181,000 --> 0:12:12,000
venting heat up to the surface, creating summer.

209
0:12:12.718,000 --> 0:12:16,000
That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.

210
0:12:16.827,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It's equally testable.

211
0:12:19.282,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Yet what it asserts about reality is, in many ways, the opposite.

212
0:12:24.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And that's possible

213
0:12:26.247,000 --> 0:12:3,000
because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons,

214
0:12:31.267,000 --> 0:12:33,000
except via the myth itself.

215
0:12:35.083,000 --> 0:12:38,000
This easy variability

216
0:12:38.226,000 --> 0:12:41,000
is the sign of a bad explanation,

217
0:12:42.194,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because, without a functional reason

218
0:12:45.893,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to prefer one of countless variants,

219
0:12:51.372,000 --> 0:12:53,000
advocating one of them in preference to the others

220
0:12:53.831,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is irrational.

221
0:12:55.429,000 --> 0:13:,000
So, for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress,

222
0:13:00.594,000 --> 0:13:02,000
seek good explanations,

223
0:13:02.953,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the ones that can't be easily varied,

224
0:13:05.426,000 --> 0:13:08,000
while still explaining the phenomena.

225
0:13:10.076,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Now our current explanation of seasons

226
0:13:13.693,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,

227
0:13:17.057,000 --> 0:13:2,000
so each hemisphere tilts towards the sun for half the year,

228
0:13:20.715,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and away for the other half.

229
0:13:23.06,000 --> 0:13:24,000
[Not to scale!]

230
0:13:24.238,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Better put that up.

231
0:13:25.428,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Laughter)

232
0:13:26.738,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That's a good explanation:

233
0:13:30.002,000 --> 0:13:31,000
hard to vary,

234
0:13:31.448,000 --> 0:13:34,000
because every detail plays a functional role.

235
0:13:34.562,000 --> 0:13:36,000
For instance, we know, independently of seasons,

236
0:13:37.438,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less,

237
0:13:42.514,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and that a spinning sphere, in space,

238
0:13:45.504,000 --> 0:13:47,000
points in a constant direction.

239
0:13:48.25,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And the tilt also explains

240
0:13:51.656,000 --> 0:13:54,000
the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,

241
0:13:55.109,000 --> 0:14:,000
and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres.

242
0:14:00.149,000 --> 0:14:02,000
If they'd been observed in phase,

243
0:14:02.489,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the theory would have been refuted.

244
0:14:04.499,000 --> 0:14:1,000
But now, the fact that it's also a good explanation, hard to vary,

245
0:14:10.752,000 --> 0:14:12,000
makes the crucial difference.

246
0:14:14.067,000 --> 0:14:19,000
If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia,

247
0:14:19.487,000 --> 0:14:22,000
they could have easily varied their myth to predict that.

248
0:14:23.411,000 --> 0:14:25,000
For instance, when Demeter's upset,

249
0:14:25.596,000 --> 0:14:29,000
she banishes heat from her vicinity into the other hemisphere,

250
0:14:30.064,000 --> 0:14:31,000
where it makes summer.

251
0:14:31.471,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So, being proved wrong by observation

252
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and changing their theory accordingly

253
0:14:36.897,000 --> 0:14:41,000
still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons,

254
0:14:42.115,000 --> 0:14:45,000
because their explanation was bad -- easy to vary.

255
0:14:45.905,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And it's only when an explanation is good

256
0:14:48.743,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that it even matters whether it's testable.

257
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,

258
0:14:53.515,000 --> 0:14:55,000
its defenders would have had nowhere to go.

259
0:14:55.895,000 --> 0:14:57,000
No easily implemented change

260
0:14:58.645,000 --> 0:15:03,000
could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres.

261
0:15:05.21,000 --> 0:15:11,000
The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress.

262
0:15:11.515,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment.

263
0:15:16.052,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So, in science, two false approaches blight progress.

264
0:15:20.442,000 --> 0:15:22,000
One's well-known: untestable theories.

265
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But the more important one is explanationless theories.

266
0:15:27.256,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue

267
0:15:31.836,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but you aren't given a hard-to-vary account of what causes that trend,

268
0:15:37.1,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you're being told a wizard did it.

269
0:15:39.241,000 --> 0:15:41,000
When you are told that carrots have human rights

270
0:15:42.085,000 --> 0:15:44,000
because they share half our genes,

271
0:15:44.207,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but not how gene percentages confer rights -- wizard.

272
0:15:50.023,000 --> 0:15:54,000
When someone announces that the nature-nurture debate

273
0:15:54.382,000 --> 0:15:55,000
has been settled

274
0:15:55.619,000 --> 0:15:59,000
because there's evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions

275
0:16:00.128,000 --> 0:16:02,000
are genetically inherited,

276
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
but they don't explain how genes cause opinions,

277
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
they've settled nothing.

278
0:16:07.524,000 --> 0:16:1,000
They're saying that our opinions are caused by wizards,

279
0:16:11.039,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and presumably, so are their own.

280
0:16:12.787,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Laughter)

281
0:16:13.961,000 --> 0:16:19,000
That the truth consists of hard-to-vary assertions about reality

282
0:16:20.886,000 --> 0:16:23,000
is the most important fact about the physical world.

283
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
It's a fact that is itself unseen,

284
0:16:28.994,000 --> 0:16:3,000
yet impossible to vary.

285
0:16:31.712,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Thank you.

286
0:16:32.925,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Applause)

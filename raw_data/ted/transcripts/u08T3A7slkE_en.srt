1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The Silicon Valley and the internet gave me superpowers,

2
0:00:17.833,000 --> 0:00:19,000
tools to go to battle with,

3
0:00:20.667,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a suit to take bullets with

4
0:00:23.667,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and a giant signal in the sky that told me when it was time to fight.

5
0:00:29.125,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, I can't actually prove any of this.

6
0:00:32.708,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I am not a "scientist,"

7
0:00:34.75,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I don't have "facts."

8
0:00:37.042,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In fact, my Rotten Tomato score is running around 50 percent right now,

9
0:00:40.458,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so I'm not sure why they let me in.

10
0:00:42.25,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But if we're talking about colliding with a power

12
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that's bigger than us,

13
0:00:48.625,000 --> 0:00:49,000
then I'm in the right place,

14
0:00:50.25,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because this last year,

15
0:00:51.667,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I had an interesting year with a movie called "Crazy Rich Asians" that I did --

16
0:00:55.5,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Applause and cheers)

17
0:00:56.542,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Thank you, thank you.

18
0:00:58.542,000 --> 0:01:,000
And if we're talking about connection specifically today,

19
0:01:01.458,000 --> 0:01:03,000
then I know my story is only possible

20
0:01:04.083,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because of a collection of connections that happened throughout my life,

21
0:01:08.042,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and so hopefully by telling a little bit of my story,

22
0:01:10.75,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it will help someone else find their path a little sooner than I did.

23
0:01:14.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My story begins when I opened the holy book for the first time ...

24
0:01:20.208,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The holy book of gadgets, of course, "Sharper Image."

25
0:01:22.958,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:24.208,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Yes, those who know.

27
0:01:25.542,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It was a magical magazine of dreams

28
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and had things in there that you knew could not possibly exist,

29
0:01:32.875,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but it was right there.

30
0:01:34.167,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You could order it -- come in the mail.

31
0:01:36.049,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And some things that probably should have never existed,

32
0:01:38.708,000 --> 0:01:41,000
like "Gregory," a lifelike, portable mannequin

33
0:01:41.958,000 --> 0:01:43,000
who deters crime by his strong, masculine appearance.

34
0:01:44.875,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This is a real --

35
0:01:46.167,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:47.208,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is a real thing, by the way.

37
0:01:48.833,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:49.875,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But my eyes were set on the Sima Video Ed/it 2.

39
0:01:53.625,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This thing was so cool at the age of 10.

40
0:01:56.5,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You could connect all your VHS players together

41
0:01:59.333,000 --> 0:02:,000
and cut something together,

42
0:02:00.708,000 --> 0:02:02,000
so I called my parents and convinced them to buy this for me.

43
0:02:03.625,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But before I get into that,

44
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
let me give you a little rundown about my parents.

45
0:02:07.375,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They came to the United States when they were young,

46
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:11,000
they're from Taiwan and China

47
0:02:11.708,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and they settled in Los Altos, California --

48
0:02:14.625,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the Silicon Valley before the Silicon Valley --

49
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and they started a restaurant called Chef Chu's.

50
0:02:20.625,000 --> 0:02:22,000
50 years later, today, they still work at the restaurant,

51
0:02:23.375,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they're still there,

52
0:02:24.667,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and I grew up there, so it was great.

53
0:02:26.542,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Talk about connection -- this place was a hub of connection.

54
0:02:29.458,000 --> 0:02:33,000
People coming there to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, business deals,

55
0:02:33.917,000 --> 0:02:34,000
eating, drinking --

56
0:02:35.208,000 --> 0:02:36,000
connection.

57
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I got to grow up in that environment.

58
0:02:38.5,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And my parents always said America is the greatest place in the world.

59
0:02:41.875,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You can --

60
0:02:43.167,000 --> 0:02:46,000
if you love anything, you can work hard and you can accomplish anything you want.

61
0:02:47.042,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So, they raised five all-American kids.

62
0:02:50.583,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I am the youngest --

63
0:02:51.917,000 --> 0:02:54,000
you can see I'm the one with the eyes closed there --

64
0:02:55.333,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and they named actually my sister and I, Jennifer and Jonathan,

65
0:02:58.417,000 --> 0:03:01,000
after Jennifer and Jonathan Hart from that TV show "Hart to Hart."

66
0:03:01.708,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:03.917,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So that's how much they loved America, apparently.

68
0:03:07.042,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And they thought that we were The Kennedys --

69
0:03:09.458,000 --> 0:03:1,000
my mom specifically --

70
0:03:10.75,000 --> 0:03:12,000
so she dressed us up all the time like each other

71
0:03:13.125,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and she put us in etiquette classes and ballroom dance classes,

72
0:03:16.667,000 --> 0:03:19,000
made sure that we had the right dental plan --

73
0:03:20.583,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:21.917,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is a real picture of me. That is not fake.

75
0:03:24.25,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Thank God for that one.

76
0:03:26.5,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And I was in charge of the video camera every time we went on vacations,

77
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so I would collect all these videos and had nothing to do with it.

78
0:03:33.167,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Thus, the Sima Video Ed/it 2.

79
0:03:36.417,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I convinced them to get it for me,

80
0:03:38.125,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I spent all night trying to wrangle all the VCRs

81
0:03:41.417,000 --> 0:03:43,000
from my brother's and sister's room, tangled in wires,

82
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and now I had something to show them.

83
0:03:45.833,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So I brought them into the living room one night,

84
0:03:48.167,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it was probably 1991, somewhere around there,

85
0:03:50.333,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I sit them down in the living room --

86
0:03:52.375,000 --> 0:03:54,000
my heart was pounding, my breaths were deep --

87
0:03:54.75,000 --> 0:03:55,000
sort of like right now --

88
0:03:56.292,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I pressed play

89
0:03:57.792,000 --> 0:04:,000
and something extraordinary happened actually.

90
0:04:01.708,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They cried.

91
0:04:03.583,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And cried.

92
0:04:04.875,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They cried not because it was the most amazing home video edit ever --

93
0:04:08.25,000 --> 0:04:09,000
although it was pretty good --

94
0:04:09.792,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:10.792,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but because they saw our family as a normal family that fit in

96
0:04:16.25,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and belonged on the screen in front of them,

97
0:04:18.417,000 --> 0:04:22,000
just like the movies that they worshipped and the TV shows that they named us after.

98
0:04:23.375,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I remember as the youngest of these five kids

99
0:04:25.75,000 --> 0:04:26,000
feeling heard for the first time.

100
0:04:27.75,000 --> 0:04:29,000
There was this place where all these things in my head

101
0:04:30.375,000 --> 0:04:33,000
could go into the great, electric somewhere-out-there and exist and escape,

102
0:04:33.958,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and I knew from this moment on,

103
0:04:35.542,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I wanted to do this for the rest of my life,

104
0:04:37.708,000 --> 0:04:39,000
whether I was going to get paid for it or not.

105
0:04:39.917,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I had this passion and now I needed some tools,

106
0:04:42.333,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and my dad went to work.

107
0:04:43.625,000 --> 0:04:46,000
He continued to brag about my home video editing skills

108
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to the customers at Chef Chu's,

109
0:04:48.958,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and luckily this is the Silicon Valley,

110
0:04:51.125,000 --> 0:04:53,000
so they're working on stuff, hardware and software --

111
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:55,000
these are all engineers.

112
0:04:55.375,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And they offered to give me things for digital video editing.

113
0:04:59.292,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is like the mid-'90s, early '90's,

114
0:05:01.958,000 --> 0:05:03,000
where this stuff didn't exist for kids like me.

115
0:05:04.792,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I'd get this beta software and hardware from places like HP and Sun

116
0:05:09.125,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and Russell Brown at Adobe.

117
0:05:12.042,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I had no manual,

118
0:05:13.75,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so I'd figure it out and I fell in love with it even more.

119
0:05:16.583,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I went to USC School of Cinematic Arts and started to go there,

120
0:05:20.292,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and my mom and dad would always call me randomly and remind me

121
0:05:24.5,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that I've got to do movies about my Chinese heritage.

122
0:05:28.667,000 --> 0:05:31,000
That China was going to be a huge market for movies one day.

123
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I was like, "Yeah right, guys".

124
0:05:33.708,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:35.167,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Always listen to your parents.

126
0:05:36.708,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:39.958,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I wanted to be Zemeckis, Lucas and Spielberg.

128
0:05:42.792,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The last thing I wanted to talk about was my own cultural identity,

129
0:05:46.042,000 --> 0:05:47,000
my ethnicity.

130
0:05:47.708,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And honestly, I had no one else to talk --

131
0:05:49.75,000 --> 0:05:51,000
there was no one at school that I could really open up to,

132
0:05:52.583,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and even if I did, like, what would I say?

133
0:05:54.607,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So I ignored it and I moved on with my life.

134
0:05:56.875,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Cut to 15 years later,

135
0:05:58.917,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I made it in Hollywood.

136
0:06:00.208,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I got discovered by Spielberg,

137
0:06:01.875,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I worked with The Rock and Bruce Willis and Justin Bieber.

138
0:06:05.542,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I even came to the TED stage to present my dance company LXD,

139
0:06:10.042,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and it was great.

140
0:06:11.542,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And then a couple years ago,

141
0:06:12.958,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I felt a little bit lost, creatively.

142
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The engine was going down a little bit,

143
0:06:17.917,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I got a sign ...

144
0:06:20.417,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I heard from voices from the sky ...

145
0:06:23.417,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or more it was like, birds.

146
0:06:25.292,000 --> 0:06:26,000
OK, fine, it was Twitter.

147
0:06:26.625,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And Twitter --

148
0:06:27.917,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:29.208,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It was Constance Wu on Twitter,

150
0:06:30.709,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it was Daniel Dae Kim,

151
0:06:32.667,000 --> 0:06:34,000
it was Jenny Yang, who's here today,

152
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it was Alan Yang --

153
0:06:36.292,000 --> 0:06:39,000
all of these people who were writing their frustrations

154
0:06:39.625,000 --> 0:06:41,000
with representation in Hollywood.

155
0:06:42.375,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And it really hit me.

156
0:06:43.75,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I thought these things but never really registered --

157
0:06:46.333,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I was really focused on --

158
0:06:47.667,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I felt lucky to be working,

159
0:06:49.25,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and so then I realized --

160
0:06:50.667,000 --> 0:06:51,000
yeah, what is wrong with Hollywood?

161
0:06:52.417,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Why aren't they doing this?

162
0:06:53.792,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I am Hollywood.

163
0:06:57.75,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I literally --

164
0:06:59.042,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I popped my collar before I came out here,

165
0:07:01.125,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that's how Hollywood I am.

166
0:07:02.458,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:03.5,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Is it still up? OK, good.

168
0:07:05.5,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

169
0:07:08.292,000 --> 0:07:1,000
For all these years I felt I had been given so much,

170
0:07:11.125,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and what was I giving back to the film business that I loved?

171
0:07:15.417,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I felt lucky to be here,

172
0:07:16.75,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but at this moment, I realized that I was not just lucky to be here,

173
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I had the right to be here.

174
0:07:21.625,000 --> 0:07:22,000
No, I earned the right to be here.

175
0:07:23.333,000 --> 0:07:26,000
All those sleepless nights, all those parties I missed on Fridays,

176
0:07:26.542,000 --> 0:07:29,000
every friend and girlfriend I lost because I was editing --

177
0:07:30.083,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I earned the right to be here not just to have a voice but to say something,

178
0:07:33.958,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and say something important,

179
0:07:35.375,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I had, actually, the power --

180
0:07:37.417,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the superpower to change things if I really, really wanted to.

181
0:07:42.375,000 --> 0:07:45,000
When you try to tell stories about yourself

182
0:07:45.458,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and people who look like you and look like your family,

183
0:07:48.167,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it can be scary,

184
0:07:49.458,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and all those feelings of being alone came back.

185
0:07:51.833,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But the internet is what told me --

186
0:07:53.583,000 --> 0:07:56,000
sent the sign that there was going to be a whole army waiting for me

187
0:07:56.875,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to support me and to love me for it.

188
0:07:58.958,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And so I found Kevin Kwan's amazing novel "Crazy Rich Asians,"

189
0:08:03.25,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and we went to work.

190
0:08:04.542,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We put this movie together.

191
0:08:06.75,000 --> 0:08:07,000
All-Asian cast --

192
0:08:08.042,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the first all-Asian cast in 25 years with a contemporary story --

193
0:08:11.125,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Applause and cheers)

194
0:08:14.292,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But when we started it was not a guarantee at all.

195
0:08:19.167,000 --> 0:08:21,000
There was no comp for this kind of movie.

196
0:08:22.167,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Every time we did surveys and stuff,

197
0:08:23.958,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the audiences weren't going to show up.

198
0:08:25.875,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In fact, even in our test screenings

199
0:08:27.667,000 --> 0:08:3,000
where you give free tickets to people to watch your movie,

200
0:08:30.833,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we had a one to 25 ratio,

201
0:08:32.875,000 --> 0:08:34,000
meaning after 25 asks, only one person said yes,

202
0:08:35.25,000 --> 0:08:37,000
which is super low for these types of things.

203
0:08:37.417,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Asian people who knew the book didn't trust Hollywood at all,

204
0:08:40.417,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Asian people who didn't know the book thought the title was offensive

205
0:08:43.958,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and other people who weren't Asian just didn't think it was for them.

206
0:08:48.292,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So we were pretty screwed.

207
0:08:50.833,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Luckily, Warner Brothers didn't turn away from us.

208
0:08:53.375,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But then the electric somewhere struck again,

209
0:08:55.917,000 --> 0:09:,000
and this army of Asian-American writers, reporters, bloggers,

210
0:09:01.667,000 --> 0:09:06,000
who over the years had worked their way up through their respective publications,

211
0:09:06.792,000 --> 0:09:08,000
went to work, unbeknownst to me.

212
0:09:08.875,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And they started to post things.

213
0:09:10.5,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Also, some tech founders out here started to post stuff on social media,

214
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
write stuff about us in articles in the "LA Times,"

215
0:09:17.792,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in "The Hollywood Reporter" and "Entertainment Weekly."

216
0:09:20.542,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It was like this grassroots uprising of making ourselves news.

217
0:09:26.625,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What an amazing thing to witness.

218
0:09:29.25,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And the swell of support turned into this conversation online

219
0:09:35.25,000 --> 0:09:36,000
between all these Asian Americans

220
0:09:37.167,000 --> 0:09:39,000
where we could actually debate and discuss

221
0:09:39.333,000 --> 0:09:4,000
what stories we wanted to tell,

222
0:09:40.834,000 --> 0:09:41,000
what stories should be told or not,

223
0:09:42.583,000 --> 0:09:43,000
what kind of --

224
0:09:43.875,000 --> 0:09:44,000
are we allowed to make fun of ourselves?

225
0:09:45.833,000 --> 0:09:47,000
What about casting? What are we allowed to do?

226
0:09:48.083,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And we didn't agree -- and we still don't,

227
0:09:50.833,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but that wasn't the point.

228
0:09:52.417,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The point was the conversation was happening.

229
0:09:55.167,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And this conversation stream became an infrastructure.

230
0:09:59.042,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It took all these different groups that were trying to achieve the same thing

231
0:10:02.75,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and put us all together in this connective tissue.

232
0:10:06.792,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And again, not perfect,

233
0:10:08.125,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but the start of how we determine our own representation on the big screen.

234
0:10:13.667,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It became more physical when I went to the movie theater.

235
0:10:16.792,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I'll never forget going -- opening weekend,

236
0:10:19.5,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and I went into the theater, and it's not just Asians --

237
0:10:22.167,000 --> 0:10:23,000
all types of people --

238
0:10:23.458,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and I go in and sit down,

239
0:10:24.792,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and people laughed, people cried,

240
0:10:28.333,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and when I went into the lobby,

241
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:32,000
people stayed.

242
0:10:32.75,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's like they didn't want to leave.

243
0:10:34.667,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They just hugged each other,

244
0:10:36.5,000 --> 0:10:37,000
high-fived each other, took selfies,

245
0:10:38.25,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they debated it, they laughed about it.

246
0:10:40.375,000 --> 0:10:41,000
All these different things.

247
0:10:42.292,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I had such an intimate relationship with this movie,

248
0:10:45.625,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but I didn't understand when we were making it

249
0:10:48.75,000 --> 0:10:51,000
what we were making until it was happening --

250
0:10:51.792,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that it was the same thing that my parents felt when they watched our family videos

251
0:10:56.792,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in that living room that day.

252
0:10:58.667,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Seeing us on the screen has a power to it,

253
0:11:02.083,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and the only way I can describe it is pride.

254
0:11:04.917,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I have always understood this word intellectually --

255
0:11:08.375,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I've probably talked about this word,

256
0:11:10.667,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but to actually feel pride --

257
0:11:12.5,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and those of you who have felt it know --

258
0:11:14.542,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it's like you just want to like, touch everybody and grab and run around.

259
0:11:18.875,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's like a very --

260
0:11:20.375,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I can't explain --

261
0:11:21.667,000 --> 0:11:22,000
it's just a very physical feeling,

262
0:11:23.375,000 --> 0:11:26,000
all because of a long pattern of connection.

263
0:11:28.5,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Film was a gift given to me,

264
0:11:30.75,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and through the years I've learned a lot of things.

265
0:11:33.458,000 --> 0:11:36,000
You can plan, you can write scripts, you can do your storyboards,

266
0:11:36.625,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but at a certain point,

267
0:11:38.875,000 --> 0:11:4,000
your movie will speak back to you,

268
0:11:41.042,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and it's your job to listen.

269
0:11:43.667,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It's this living organism and it sort of presents itself,

270
0:11:46.417,000 --> 0:11:48,000
so you better catch it before it slips through your hands,

271
0:11:49.208,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and that's the most exciting part about making movies.

272
0:11:51.792,000 --> 0:11:53,000
When I look at life, it's not that different actually.

273
0:11:54.375,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I've been led through these sort of breadcrumbs of connections

274
0:11:58.375,000 --> 0:12:,000
through people, through circumstances,

275
0:12:00.833,000 --> 0:12:01,000
through luck.

276
0:12:02.417,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And it changed when I realized that once you start listening

277
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to the silent beats and the messy noises around you,

278
0:12:09.542,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you realize that there's this beautiful symphony already written for you.

279
0:12:13.792,000 --> 0:12:15,000
A direct line to your destiny.

280
0:12:16.667,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Your superpower.

281
0:12:18.25,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Now, film was a gift given to me,

282
0:12:22.417,000 --> 0:12:27,000
sort of spurred on by my parents and supported by my community.

283
0:12:27.458,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I got to be who I wanted to be when I needed to be it.

284
0:12:31.625,000 --> 0:12:33,000
My mom posted something on Facebook the other day,

285
0:12:34.042,000 --> 0:12:36,000
which is usually a really bad thing to say out loud --

286
0:12:37.958,000 --> 0:12:39,000
scary, she should not have a Facebook, but --

287
0:12:40.167,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

288
0:12:41.542,000 --> 0:12:42,000
She posted this thing, and it was a meme,

289
0:12:43.542,000 --> 0:12:44,000
you know, one of those funny things,

290
0:12:45.333,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and it said, "You can't change someone who doesn't want to change,

291
0:12:48.542,000 --> 0:12:5,000
but never underestimate the power of planting a seed."

292
0:12:51.167,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And as I was doing the finishing touches on this talk,

293
0:12:53.792,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I realized that all the powerful connections in my life

294
0:12:56.583,000 --> 0:13:02,000
were through generosity and kindness and love and hope.

295
0:13:03.042,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So when I think about my movies "Crazy Rich Asians" and "In the Heights"

296
0:13:06.458,000 --> 0:13:07,000
which I'm working on right now --

297
0:13:08.125,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Applause and cheers)

298
0:13:09.458,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Yes, it's a good one.

299
0:13:11.375,000 --> 0:13:15,000
All I want to do is show joy and hope in them,

300
0:13:15.833,000 --> 0:13:18,000
because I refuse to believe that our best days are behind us,

301
0:13:19.5,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but in fact, around the corner.

302
0:13:21.917,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Because you see love --

303
0:13:23.208,000 --> 0:13:25,000
love is the superpower that was given to me.

304
0:13:26.167,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Love is the superpower that was passed onto me.

305
0:13:30.917,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Love is the only thing that can stop a speeding bullet

306
0:13:35.167,000 --> 0:13:36,000
before it even exits the chamber.

307
0:13:36.833,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Love is the only thing that can leap over a building

308
0:13:39.375,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and have a whole community look up into the sky,

309
0:13:42.958,000 --> 0:13:43,000
join hands,

310
0:13:44.333,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and have the courage to face something that's impossibly bigger than themselves.

311
0:13:48.792,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So I have a challenge for myself and for anyone here.

312
0:13:51.75,000 --> 0:13:53,000
As you're working on your thing,

313
0:13:54.208,000 --> 0:13:55,000
on your company,

314
0:13:55.542,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and you're forging this thing to life, and you're making the impossible possible,

315
0:13:59.875,000 --> 0:14:02,000
let's just not forget to be kind to each other,

316
0:14:03.75,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because I believe that is the most powerful form of connection

317
0:14:07.083,000 --> 0:14:08,000
we can give to this planet.

318
0:14:08.625,000 --> 0:14:11,000
In fact, our future depends on it.

319
0:14:11.917,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Thank you.

320
0:14:13.208,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Applause and cheers)

321
0:14:15.542,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Thank you.

322
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000

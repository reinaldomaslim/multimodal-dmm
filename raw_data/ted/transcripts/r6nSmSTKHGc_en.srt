2
0:00:16.103,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'd like to show you a video of some of the models

3
0:00:18.148,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I work with.

4
0:00:19.737,000 --> 0:00:22,000
They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.

5
0:00:23.275,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Did I mention they're gorgeous?

6
0:00:25.813,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And they're scientific models? (Laughs)

7
0:00:28.943,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,

8
0:00:31.286,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and this is a video of some of the beating heart

9
0:00:33.735,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that I've engineered in the lab.

10
0:00:35.951,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And one day we hope that these tissues

11
0:00:37.833,000 --> 0:00:39,000
can serve as replacement parts for the human body.

12
0:00:40.777,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But what I'm going to tell you about today

13
0:00:43.057,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is how these tissues make awesome models.

14
0:00:47.504,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.

15
0:00:50.231,000 --> 0:00:52,000
You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing,

16
0:00:53.209,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing,

17
0:00:55.712,000 --> 0:00:57,000
before the drugs get to market.

18
0:00:57.977,000 --> 0:01:,000
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time,

19
0:01:01.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market,

20
0:01:03.93,000 --> 0:01:06,000
it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.

21
0:01:07.865,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.

22
0:01:11.952,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats,

23
0:01:16.136,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and two, despite our incredible similarities to one another,

24
0:01:20.224,000 --> 0:01:22,000
actually those tiny differences between you and I

25
0:01:22.665,000 --> 0:01:24,000
have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs

26
0:01:25.174,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and how those drugs affect us.

27
0:01:27.043,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So what if we had better models in the lab

28
0:01:29.875,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that could not only mimic us better than rats

29
0:01:33.145,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but also reflect our diversity?

30
0:01:37.065,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.

31
0:01:40.992,000 --> 0:01:42,000
One of the key technologies that's really important

32
0:01:43.521,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.

33
0:01:46.713,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They were developed in Japan pretty recently.

34
0:01:49.231,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.

35
0:01:51.678,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They're a lot like embryonic stem cells

36
0:01:53.791,000 --> 0:01:55,000
except without the controversy.

37
0:01:56.008,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We induce cells, okay, say, skin cells,

38
0:01:58.907,000 --> 0:02:,000
by adding a few genes to them, culturing them,

39
0:02:01.414,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and then harvesting them.

40
0:02:03.035,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So they're skin cells that can be tricked,

41
0:02:05.742,000 --> 0:02:07,000
kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.

42
0:02:08.526,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.

43
0:02:11.238,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Cool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue

44
0:02:13.787,000 --> 0:02:15,000
out of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture,

45
0:02:16.342,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but out of your cells.

46
0:02:18.865,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So we can make a model of your heart, your brain

47
0:02:22.43,000 --> 0:02:24,000
on a chip.

48
0:02:25.062,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior

49
0:02:27.918,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is the second piece, and will be really key towards

50
0:02:30.75,000 --> 0:02:32,000
getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.

51
0:02:33.422,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab

52
0:02:36.534,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.

53
0:02:39.982,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Going forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this

54
0:02:43.381,000 --> 0:02:45,000
with thousands of pieces of human tissue.

55
0:02:45.718,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.

56
0:02:49.766,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells

57
0:02:53.561,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is that if we take some skin cells, let's say,

58
0:02:56.11,000 --> 0:02:58,000
from people with a genetic disease

59
0:02:58.286,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we engineer tissues out of them,

60
0:03:00.542,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques

61
0:03:02.51,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to generate models of those diseases in the lab.

62
0:03:05.911,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.

63
0:03:09.495,000 --> 0:03:11,000
He generated neurons

64
0:03:11.785,000 --> 0:03:13,000
from these induced pluripotent stem cells

65
0:03:14.5,000 --> 0:03:16,000
from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease,

66
0:03:17.129,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing

67
0:03:19.572,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.

68
0:03:22.724,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So with disease models like these, we can fight back

69
0:03:24.823,000 --> 0:03:26,000
faster than ever before and understand the disease better

70
0:03:27.405,000 --> 0:03:3,000
than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.

71
0:03:31.368,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is another example of patient-specific stem cells

72
0:03:34.748,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.

73
0:03:38.757,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is a degeneration of the retina.

74
0:03:40.511,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope

75
0:03:43.268,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that cells like these will help us find a cure.

76
0:03:45.492,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So some people think that these models sound well and good,

77
0:03:48.3,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but ask, "Well, are these really as good as the rat?"

78
0:03:51.741,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The rat is an entire organism, after all,

79
0:03:54.729,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with interacting networks of organs.

80
0:03:56.435,000 --> 0:03:59,000
A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver,

81
0:04:00.356,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.

82
0:04:03.196,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?

83
0:04:07.723,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Well, this is another trend in the field.

84
0:04:09.837,000 --> 0:04:11,000
By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics,

85
0:04:12.704,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the field is actually evolving towards just that,

86
0:04:14.868,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a model of the entire ecosystem of the body,

87
0:04:17.374,000 --> 0:04:19,000
complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test

88
0:04:19.774,000 --> 0:04:2,000
how a drug you might take for your blood pressure

89
0:04:21.377,000 --> 0:04:24,000
might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.

90
0:04:24.644,000 --> 0:04:28,000
These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there,

91
0:04:28.716,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and so, watch out.

92
0:04:32.02,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved,

93
0:04:34.652,000 --> 0:04:37,000
tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.

94
0:04:38.334,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is an example that you might care about someday,

95
0:04:42.076,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I hope you never do,

96
0:04:44.196,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because imagine if you ever get that call

97
0:04:46.716,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.

98
0:04:49.924,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs

99
0:04:52.46,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you're going to take are going to work on your cancer?

100
0:04:55.22,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're

101
0:04:57.642,000 --> 0:04:59,000
using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells

102
0:05:00.548,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and study its progressions and treatments.

103
0:05:03.019,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models

104
0:05:05.572,000 --> 0:05:08,000
like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer

105
0:05:08.66,000 --> 0:05:1,000
might spread from one part of the body to the next,

106
0:05:11.38,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips

107
0:05:13.764,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.

108
0:05:16.749,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed,

109
0:05:19.171,000 --> 0:05:2,000
you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering

110
0:05:21.084,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening

111
0:05:23.54,000 --> 0:05:25,000
at every single step of the path:

112
0:05:26.318,000 --> 0:05:28,000
disease models making for better drug formulations,

113
0:05:28.892,000 --> 0:05:31,000
massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing,

114
0:05:32.763,000 --> 0:05:36,000
reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials,

115
0:05:36.988,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and individualized therapies that disrupt

116
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
what we even consider to be a market at all.

117
0:05:42.268,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback

118
0:05:44.812,000 --> 0:05:46,000
between developing a molecule and learning about

119
0:05:47.135,000 --> 0:05:49,000
how it acts in the human body.

120
0:05:49.484,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Our process for doing this is essentially transforming

121
0:05:51.812,000 --> 0:05:55,000
biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology,

122
0:05:56.673,000 --> 0:05:58,000
helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster,

123
0:05:59.652,000 --> 0:06:02,000
more cheaply and more effectively.

124
0:06:02.868,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?

125
0:06:06.948,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Thank you. (Applause)

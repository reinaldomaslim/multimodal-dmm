1
0:00:13.917,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Ever since computers were invented,

2
0:00:15.708,000 --> 0:00:18,000
we've been trying to make them smarter and more powerful.

3
0:00:19.333,000 --> 0:00:21,000
From the abacus, to room-sized machines,

4
0:00:22.125,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to desktops, to computers in our pockets.

5
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And are now designing artificial intelligence to automate tasks

6
0:00:28.458,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that would require human intelligence.

7
0:00:31.542,000 --> 0:00:32,000
If you look at the history of computing,

8
0:00:33.5,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we've always treated computers as external devices

9
0:00:36.75,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that compute and act on our behalf.

10
0:00:40.167,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What I want to do is I want to weave computing, AI and internet as part of us.

11
0:00:46.083,000 --> 0:00:48,000
As part of human cognition,

12
0:00:48.667,000 --> 0:00:5,000
freeing us to interact with the world around us.

13
0:00:51.833,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Integrate human and machine intelligence

14
0:00:54.5,000 --> 0:00:58,000
right inside our own bodies to augment us, instead of diminishing us or replacing us.

15
0:01:00.583,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Could we combine what people do best, such as creative and intuitive thinking,

16
0:01:04.792,000 --> 0:01:05,000
with what computers do best,

17
0:01:06.208,000 --> 0:01:09,000
such as processing information and perfectly memorizing stuff?

18
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Could this whole be better than the sum of its parts?

19
0:01:14.167,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We have a device that could make that possible.

20
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's called AlterEgo, and it's a wearable device

21
0:01:19.667,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that gives you the experience of a conversational AI

22
0:01:22.708,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that lives inside your head,

23
0:01:24.333,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself internally.

24
0:01:29.279,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We have a new prototype that we're showing here,

25
0:01:31.542,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for the first time at TED, and here's how it works.

26
0:01:36.292,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Normally, when we speak,

27
0:01:37.583,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the brain sends neurosignals through the nerves

28
0:01:40.417,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to your internal speech systems,

29
0:01:42.583,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to activate them and your vocal cords to produce speech.

30
0:01:47.107,000 --> 0:01:49,000
One of the most complex cognitive and motor tasks

31
0:01:49.417,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that we do as human beings.

32
0:01:52.125,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, imagine talking to yourself

33
0:01:54.208,000 --> 0:01:56,000
without vocalizing, without moving your mouth,

34
0:01:56.833,000 --> 0:01:57,000
without moving your jaw,

35
0:01:58.458,000 --> 0:02:,000
but by simply articulating those words internally.

36
0:02:02.208,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Thereby very subtly engaging your internal speech systems,

37
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
such as your tongue and back of your palate.

38
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:12,000
When that happens,

39
0:02:12.792,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the brain sends extremely weak signals to these internal speech systems.

40
0:02:17.208,000 --> 0:02:18,000
AlterEgo has sensors,

41
0:02:18.958,000 --> 0:02:22,000
embedded in a thin plastic, flexible and transparent device

42
0:02:23.208,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that sits on your neck just like a sticker.

43
0:02:27.542,000 --> 0:02:29,000
These sensors pick up on these internal signals

44
0:02:30.208,000 --> 0:02:31,000
sourced deep within the mouth cavity,

45
0:02:32.125,000 --> 0:02:33,000
right from the surface of the skin.

46
0:02:35.91,000 --> 0:02:36,000
An AI program running in the background

47
0:02:37.792,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then tries to figure out what the user's trying to say.

48
0:02:41.125,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It then feeds back an answer to the user

49
0:02:44.542,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by means of bone conduction,

50
0:02:46.333,000 --> 0:02:49,000
audio conducted through the skull into the user's inner ear,

51
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that the user hears,

52
0:02:51.292,000 --> 0:02:54,000
overlaid on top of the user's natural hearing of the environment,

53
0:02:54.417,000 --> 0:02:55,000
without blocking it.

54
0:02:58.542,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The combination of all these parts, the input, the output and the AI,

55
0:03:02.375,000 --> 0:03:05,000
gives a net subjective experience of an interface inside your head

56
0:03:06.208,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that you could talk to in likeness to talking to yourself.

57
0:03:11.75,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Just to be very clear, the device does not record or read your thoughts.

58
0:03:15.75,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It records deliberate information that you want to communicate

59
0:03:18.708,000 --> 0:03:21,000
through deliberate engagement of your internal speech systems.

60
0:03:21.792,000 --> 0:03:23,000
People don't want to be read, they want to write.

61
0:03:24.542,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Which is why we designed the system

62
0:03:26.5,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to deliberately record from the peripheral nervous system.

63
0:03:31.75,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Which is why the control in all situations resides with the user.

64
0:03:37.042,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I want to stop here for a second and show you a live demo.

65
0:03:40.875,000 --> 0:03:42,000
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to ask Eric a question.

66
0:03:43.708,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And he's going to search for that information

67
0:03:45.833,000 --> 0:03:48,000
without vocalizing, without typing, without moving his fingers,

68
0:03:49.75,000 --> 0:03:5,000
without moving his mouth.

69
0:03:51.042,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Simply by internally asking that question.

70
0:03:53.958,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The AI will then figure out the answer and feed it back to Eric,

71
0:03:57.167,000 --> 0:03:58,000
through audio, through the device.

72
0:03:59.917,000 --> 0:04:02,000
While you see a laptop in front of him, he's not using it.

73
0:04:03.042,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Everything lives on the device.

74
0:04:05.417,000 --> 0:04:08,000
All he needs is that sticker device to interface with the AI and the internet.

75
0:04:11.458,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So, Eric, what's the weather in Vancouver like, right now?

76
0:04:22.917,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What you see on the screen

77
0:04:24.625,000 --> 0:04:28,000
are the words that Eric is speaking to himself right now.

78
0:04:29.166,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is happening in real time.

79
0:04:31.875,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Eric: It's 50 degrees and rainy here in Vancouver.

80
0:04:35.292,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Arnav Kapur: What happened is that the AI sent the answer

81
0:04:38.042,000 --> 0:04:4,000
through audio, through the device, back to Eric.

82
0:04:41.125,000 --> 0:04:43,000
What could the implications of something like this be?

83
0:04:44.542,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Imagine perfectly memorizing things,

84
0:04:47.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
where you perfectly record information that you silently speak,

85
0:04:50.894,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and then hear them later when you want to,

86
0:04:52.958,000 --> 0:04:54,000
internally searching for information,

87
0:04:55.375,000 --> 0:04:57,000
crunching numbers at speeds computers do,

88
0:04:58,000 --> 0:04:59,000
silently texting other people.

89
0:05:00.917,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Suddenly becoming multilingual,

90
0:05:03.25,000 --> 0:05:05,000
so that you internally speak in one language,

91
0:05:05.542,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and hear the translation in your head in another.

92
0:05:09.125,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The potential could be far-reaching.

93
0:05:12.708,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There are millions of people around the world

94
0:05:14.833,000 --> 0:05:16,000
who struggle with using natural speech.

95
0:05:17.333,000 --> 0:05:2,000
People with conditions such as ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease,

96
0:05:20.667,000 --> 0:05:21,000
stroke and oral cancer,

97
0:05:22.375,000 --> 0:05:23,000
amongst many other conditions.

98
0:05:25.917,000 --> 0:05:28,000
For them, communicating is a painstakingly slow and tiring process.

99
0:05:30.667,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is Doug.

100
0:05:32.292,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Doug was diagnosed with ALS about 12 years ago

101
0:05:34.625,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and has since lost the ability to speak.

102
0:05:37.292,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Today, he uses an on-screen keyboard

103
0:05:39.292,000 --> 0:05:42,000
where he types in individual letters using his head movements.

104
0:05:42.667,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And it takes several minutes to communicate a single sentence.

105
0:05:46.583,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So we went to Doug and asked him

106
0:05:48.458,000 --> 0:05:52,000
what were the first words he'd like to use or say, using our system.

107
0:05:54.292,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Perhaps a greeting, like, "Hello, how are you?"

108
0:05:57.167,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Or indicate that he needed help with something.

109
0:06:01.125,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What Doug said that he wanted to use our system for

110
0:06:03.583,000 --> 0:06:06,000
is to reboot the old system he had, because that old system kept on crashing.

111
0:06:07.25,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:10.083,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We never could have predicted that.

113
0:06:12.917,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I'm going to show you a short clip of Doug using our system for the first time.

114
0:06:22.417,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Voice) Reboot computer.

115
0:06:26.375,000 --> 0:06:27,000
AK: What you just saw there

116
0:06:27.708,000 --> 0:06:3,000
was Doug communicating or speaking in real time for the first time

117
0:06:31.333,000 --> 0:06:32,000
since he lost the ability to speak.

118
0:06:34.125,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There are millions of people

119
0:06:35.708,000 --> 0:06:38,000
who might be able to communicate in real time like Doug,

120
0:06:39.125,000 --> 0:06:42,000
with other people, with their friends and with their families.

121
0:06:43.125,000 --> 0:06:46,000
My hope is to be able to help them express their thoughts and ideas.

122
0:06:48.875,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I believe computing, AI and the internet

123
0:06:51.125,000 --> 0:06:54,000
would disappear into us as extensions of our cognition,

124
0:06:54.875,000 --> 0:06:57,000
instead of being external entities or adversaries,

125
0:06:58.5,000 --> 0:07:,000
amplifying human ingenuity,

126
0:07:00.833,000 --> 0:07:03,000
giving us unimaginable abilities and unlocking our true potential.

127
0:07:05.833,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And perhaps even freeing us to becoming better at being human.

128
0:07:10.5,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Thank you so much.

129
0:07:11.792,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Applause)

130
0:07:17.583,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Shoham Arad: Come over here.

131
0:07:23.083,000 --> 0:07:24,000
OK.

132
0:07:25.917,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I want to ask you a couple of questions, they're going to clear the stage.

133
0:07:29.458,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I feel like this is amazing, it's innovative,

134
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it's creepy, it's terrifying.

135
0:07:36.5,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Can you tell us what I think ...

136
0:07:38.583,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I think there are some uncomfortable feelings around this.

137
0:07:41.333,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Tell us, is this reading your thoughts,

138
0:07:43.667,000 --> 0:07:44,000
will it in five years,

139
0:07:44.958,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is there a weaponized version of this, what does it look like?

140
0:07:48.833,000 --> 0:07:51,000
AK: So our first design principle, before we started working on this,

141
0:07:52.125,000 --> 0:07:55,000
was to not render ethics as an afterthought.

142
0:07:55.667,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So we wanted to bake ethics right into the design.

143
0:07:59.125,000 --> 0:08:,000
We flipped the design.

144
0:08:00.417,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Instead of reading from the brain directly,

145
0:08:02.5,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we're reading from the voluntary nervous system

146
0:08:04.75,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that you deliberately have to engage to communicate with the device,

147
0:08:07.965,000 --> 0:08:1,000
while still bringing the benefits of a thinking or a thought device.

148
0:08:11.183,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The best of both worlds in a way.

149
0:08:12.833,000 --> 0:08:15,000
SA: OK, I think people are going to have a lot more questions for you.

150
0:08:16.458,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Also, you said that it's a sticker.

151
0:08:18.167,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So right now it sits just right here?

152
0:08:20.167,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Is that the final iteration,

153
0:08:21.875,000 --> 0:08:24,000
what the final design you hope looks like?

154
0:08:26.167,000 --> 0:08:3,000
AK: Our goal is for the technology to disappear completely.

155
0:08:30.917,000 --> 0:08:31,000
SA: What does that mean?

156
0:08:32.208,000 --> 0:08:34,000
AK: If you're wearing it, I shouldn't be able to see it.

157
0:08:34.875,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You don't want technology on your face, you want it in the background,

158
0:08:38.25,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to augment you in the background.

159
0:08:39.917,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So we have a sticker version that conforms to the skin,

160
0:08:42.542,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that looks like the skin,

161
0:08:43.833,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but we're trying to make an even smaller version

162
0:08:46.125,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that would sit right here.

163
0:08:49.167,000 --> 0:08:5,000
SA: OK.

164
0:08:50.457,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I feel like if anyone has any questions they want to ask Arnav,

165
0:08:53.457,000 --> 0:08:54,000
he'll be here all week.

166
0:08:54.75,000 --> 0:08:55,000
OK, thank you so much, Arnav.

167
0:08:56.207,000 --> 0:08:57,000
AK: Thanks, Shoham.

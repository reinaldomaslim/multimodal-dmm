1
0:00:12.936,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It was October 13, 2012,

2
0:00:16.375,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a day that I will never forget.

3
0:00:18.892,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was on my bike, pushing up what seemed like a never-ending barren hill.

4
0:00:24.432,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And it wasn't just any hill:

5
0:00:26.27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
it was a 15-mile climb up to a town called Hawi

6
0:00:30.024,000 --> 0:00:32,000
on the Big Island of Hawaii.

7
0:00:32.776,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it wasn't just any ride:

8
0:00:34.745,000 --> 0:00:36,000
it was at the Ironman World Championship.

9
0:00:37.926,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I can still feel my muscles burning.

10
0:00:40.886,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was struggling, tired and dehydrated,

11
0:00:43.458,000 --> 0:00:44,000
as I could feel the heat

12
0:00:45.108,000 --> 0:00:48,000
emanating from the asphalt, measuring almost 98 degrees.

13
0:00:49.727,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I was near the halfway point of the bike portion

14
0:00:52.069,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of one of the most prestigious, longest,

15
0:00:55.052,000 --> 0:00:57,000
single-day endurance race events in the world.

16
0:00:59.346,000 --> 0:01:,000
Every year, during my childhood,

17
0:01:01.124,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I watched this very race on TV in our family living room.

18
0:01:04.68,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I sat next to my dad on our 1970s-style orange and brown sofa,

19
0:01:09.578,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and I remember being in utter awe

20
0:01:11.484,000 --> 0:01:14,000
at how these athletes pushed themselves to their limit

21
0:01:14.532,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in this grueling race.

22
0:01:15.887,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And just so you don't get the wrong idea,

23
0:01:17.88,000 --> 0:01:19,000
my family members weren't just spectators.

24
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They were incredibly athletic,

25
0:01:22.505,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I always participated from the sidelines,

26
0:01:25.527,000 --> 0:01:29,000
cheering on my three siblings or handing out water at local races.

27
0:01:29.987,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I remember wanting so badly to be able to compete, but I couldn't.

28
0:01:35.475,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Even though I couldn't play sports,

29
0:01:37.293,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I decided to be active in my community.

30
0:01:39.531,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I volunteered at the local hospital in high school.

31
0:01:42.418,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In college, I interned at the White House,

32
0:01:45.593,000 --> 0:01:46,000
studied abroad in Spain

33
0:01:46.943,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and backpacked through Europe all by myself

34
0:01:49.474,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with my leg braces and crutches.

35
0:01:51.807,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Upon graduating, I moved to New York City for a job in management consulting,

36
0:01:56.256,000 --> 0:01:57,000
earned an MBA, got married

37
0:01:58.233,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and now have a daughter.

38
0:02:00.457,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Applause)

39
0:02:03.835,000 --> 0:02:07,000
At age 28, I was introduced to the sport of hand-cycling,

40
0:02:08.225,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and then triathlon,

41
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and by luck, I met Jason Fowler, an Ironman World Champion,

42
0:02:14.323,000 --> 0:02:16,000
at a camp for athletes with disabilities.

43
0:02:17.08,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And like me, he competed in a wheelchair.

44
0:02:19.898,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And with his encouragement, at age 34,

45
0:02:23.138,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I decided to go after Kona.

46
0:02:26.291,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The Kona, or Hawaii Ironman

47
0:02:28.191,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is the oldest Iron-distance race in the sport,

48
0:02:31.583,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and if you're not familiar, it's like the Super Bowl of triathlon.

49
0:02:35.733,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the Ironman, for a wheelchair athlete like me,

50
0:02:38.115,000 --> 0:02:42,000
consists of a 2.4-mile open-water swim in the Pacific Ocean,

51
0:02:42.325,000 --> 0:02:45,000
a 112-mile hand cycle ride in lava fields --

52
0:02:45.976,000 --> 0:02:46,000
now, that sounds exotic,

53
0:02:47.405,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but it's not as scenic as it sounds, and it's pretty desolate --

54
0:02:50.588,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and then you top it off with a marathon,

55
0:02:53.66,000 --> 0:02:56,000
or a 26.2-mile run in 90-degree heat

56
0:02:57.305,000 --> 0:02:59,000
using a racing wheelchair.

57
0:02:59.462,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That's right, it's a total distance of 140.6 miles using just your arms

58
0:03:06.057,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in less than 17 hours.

59
0:03:08.596,000 --> 0:03:11,000
No female wheelchair athlete had ever completed the race

60
0:03:12.526,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because of the strict, seemingly impossible cutoff times.

61
0:03:17.034,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And so there I was,

62
0:03:19.102,000 --> 0:03:21,000
putting it all out on the line.

63
0:03:21.967,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And when I finally reached the top of that 15-mile climb,

64
0:03:25.536,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was discouraged.

65
0:03:27.17,000 --> 0:03:3,000
There was no way I was going to make that swim in my time limit

66
0:03:31.075,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of 10 and a half hours,

67
0:03:32.25,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because I was almost two hours off pace.

68
0:03:36.365,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I had to make the agonizing decision

69
0:03:39.737,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to quit.

70
0:03:41.3,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I removed my timing chip, and I handed it over to a race official.

71
0:03:45.49,000 --> 0:03:46,000
My day was done.

72
0:03:48.377,000 --> 0:03:5,000
My best friend Shannon and my husband Shawn

73
0:03:51.257,000 --> 0:03:54,000
were waiting at the top of Hawi to drive me back to town.

74
0:03:54.836,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And on my way back to town, I began to cry.

75
0:03:58.191,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I had failed.

76
0:04:00.111,000 --> 0:04:03,000
My dream of completing the Ironman World Championship

77
0:04:03.889,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was crushed.

78
0:04:05.612,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was embarrassed.

79
0:04:07.05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I felt like I'd messed up.

80
0:04:09.454,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I worried about what my friends, my family and people at work

81
0:04:12.979,000 --> 0:04:13,000
would think of me.

82
0:04:14.225,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What was I going to put on Facebook?

83
0:04:16.884,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:18.058,000 --> 0:04:19,000
How was I going to explain to everyone

85
0:04:20.05,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that things didn't go the way I had assumed or planned?

86
0:04:23.796,000 --> 0:04:27,000
A few weeks later I was talking to Shannon about the Kona "disaster,"

87
0:04:28.399,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and she said this to me:

88
0:04:30.546,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"Minda, big dreams and goals can only be realized when you're ready to fail."

89
0:04:36.033,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I knew I had to put that failure behind me in order to move forward,

90
0:04:39.97,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and it wouldn't be the first time that I had faced insurmountable odds.

91
0:04:44.752,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I was born in Bombay, India,

92
0:04:46.717,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and just before my first birthday, I contracted polio,

93
0:04:50.503,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which left me paralyzed from the hips down.

94
0:04:53.97,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Unable to care for me, my birth mother left me at an orphanage.

95
0:04:58.538,000 --> 0:05:,000
Fortunately, I was adopted by an American family,

96
0:05:01.292,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I moved to Spokane, Washington

97
0:05:03.289,000 --> 0:05:04,000
just shortly after my third birthday.

98
0:05:05.753,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Over the next few years, I underwent a series of surgeries

99
0:05:08.825,000 --> 0:05:1,000
on my hips, my legs and my back

100
0:05:11.658,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that allowed me to walk with leg braces and crutches.

101
0:05:15.432,000 --> 0:05:18,000
As a child, I struggled with my disability.

102
0:05:19.196,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I felt like I didn't fit in.

103
0:05:21.788,000 --> 0:05:23,000
People stared at me all the time,

104
0:05:24.046,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and I was embarrassed about wearing a back brace and leg braces,

105
0:05:27.547,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I always hid my chicken legs under my pants.

106
0:05:30.977,000 --> 0:05:33,000
As a young girl, I thought thick, heavy braces on my legs

107
0:05:34.431,000 --> 0:05:35,000
did not look pretty or feminine.

108
0:05:37.465,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Among my generation, I am one of the very few individuals in the US

109
0:05:42.663,000 --> 0:05:44,000
who are living with paralysis by polio today.

110
0:05:45.69,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Many people who contract polio in developing countries

111
0:05:48.825,000 --> 0:05:51,000
do not have access to the same medical care, education,

112
0:05:52.397,000 --> 0:05:54,000
or opportunities like I have had in America.

113
0:05:55.88,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Many do not even live to reach adulthood.

114
0:05:59.362,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I have the humbling knowledge that, had I not been adopted,

115
0:06:02.942,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I most certainly wouldn't be in front of you today.

116
0:06:05.565,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I may not even be alive.

117
0:06:09.541,000 --> 0:06:11,000
All of us, in our own lives,

118
0:06:11.825,000 --> 0:06:13,000
may face seemingly insurmountable goals.

119
0:06:14.81,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I want to share with you what I learned

120
0:06:16.984,000 --> 0:06:17,000
when I tried again.

121
0:06:19.851,000 --> 0:06:21,000
One year after my first attempt,

122
0:06:22.677,000 --> 0:06:24,000
on a sunny Saturday morning,

123
0:06:25.281,000 --> 0:06:26,000
my husband Shawn

124
0:06:26.54,000 --> 0:06:28,000
dumped me into the ocean at the Kona Pier

125
0:06:28.839,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and, with 2,500 of my closest friends and competitors,

126
0:06:32.401,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we started swimming as that cannon went off promptly at 7am.

127
0:06:35.887,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I focused on one stroke at a time, staying in between bodies,

128
0:06:39.156,000 --> 0:06:4,000
counting my strokes --

129
0:06:40.394,000 --> 0:06:42,000
one, two, three, four --

130
0:06:43.362,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and lifting my head to sight every so often

131
0:06:45.419,000 --> 0:06:46,000
just so I wouldn't get too off track.

132
0:06:47.428,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And when I finally reached the shoreline,

133
0:06:49.406,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Shawn picked me up, and he carried me out of the water.

134
0:06:52.75,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I was so stunned and thrilled when Shawn had told me I had managed

135
0:06:56.885,000 --> 0:06:59,000
a one-hour-and-43-minute swim time.

136
0:07:00.722,000 --> 0:07:02,000
On to the bike segment.

137
0:07:03.554,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I had eight hours and 45 minutes to complete the 112-mile bike course.

138
0:07:09.968,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I broke up the course in seven- to 10-mile segments in my mind

139
0:07:13.666,000 --> 0:07:15,000
just to reduce the enormity of the race.

140
0:07:15.993,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The first 40 miles, they clipped by as we benefited from a little tail wind.

141
0:07:20.612,000 --> 0:07:24,000
By 4pm, I had made it to mile 94,

142
0:07:24.795,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I did the math and I realized I was in serious time jeopardy

143
0:07:28.793,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because I had 18 miles to go and less than 90 minutes,

144
0:07:32.087,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and that included a few sizable hill climbs.

145
0:07:35.357,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I was stressed out, and I was scared

146
0:07:37.116,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that I wasn't going to make that time cutoff again.

147
0:07:39.747,000 --> 0:07:42,000
At this point, I pushed my internal voice aside that said,

148
0:07:43.572,000 --> 0:07:45,000
"This hurts. Quit."

149
0:07:45.793,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And I told myself, "Minda, you better focus.

150
0:07:48.457,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Focus on what you can control,

151
0:07:50.103,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and that is your attitude and your effort."

152
0:07:52.718,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I resolved to be OK being uncomfortable,

153
0:07:56.346,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I told myself, "Push harder,

154
0:07:57.95,000 --> 0:07:58,000
forget about the pain,

155
0:07:59.283,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and keep that laser focus."

156
0:08:01.993,000 --> 0:08:07,000
For the next 90 minutes, I cranked as though my life depended on it.

157
0:08:08.971,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And when I rolled into town,

158
0:08:10.718,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I heard on the loudspeaker,

159
0:08:12.416,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"Minda Dentler is one of the last competitors to make the bike cutoff."

160
0:08:17.701,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I did it!

161
0:08:19.289,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Applause)

162
0:08:24.17,000 --> 0:08:25,000
By only three minutes.

163
0:08:25.972,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:27.397,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It was 5:27pm,

165
0:08:30.62,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and I had been racing for 10-and-a-half hours.

166
0:08:34.696,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The first 10 miles of the run went pretty quickly,

167
0:08:37.348,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as I was so excited to finally pass people

168
0:08:40.753,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with my three wheels to their two feet.

169
0:08:43.762,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The sun quickly went down,

170
0:08:45.119,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and I found myself pulling up to the bottom of Palani hill,

171
0:08:48.903,000 --> 0:08:51,000
looking straight into a half-mile hill that looked like Mt. Everest

172
0:08:52.197,000 --> 0:08:54,000
at mile 124 of the race.

173
0:08:54.626,000 --> 0:08:56,000
My friends and family were ready at their stations

174
0:08:57.071,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to talk me up that hill.

175
0:08:59.452,000 --> 0:09:,000
I was struggling, tired,

176
0:09:00.984,000 --> 0:09:03,000
desperately gripping those rims just so I wouldn't tip backwards.

177
0:09:04.469,000 --> 0:09:06,000
When I finally reached the top of that hill,

178
0:09:07.167,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I turned left onto a very lonely 15-mile stretch onto the Queen K Highway,

179
0:09:13.174,000 --> 0:09:14,000
totally exhausted.

180
0:09:14.763,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I pressed on, focusing on one push at a time.

181
0:09:20.386,000 --> 0:09:21,000
By 9:30pm,

182
0:09:22.307,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I made that final right-hand turn onto Ali'i Drive.

183
0:09:26.403,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I heard the crowd's roar, and I was overcome with emotion.

184
0:09:30.075,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I crossed that finish line.

185
0:09:33.211,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Applause)

186
0:09:43.037,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause ends)

187
0:09:44.276,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And my final time was 14 hours and 39 minutes.

188
0:09:49.823,000 --> 0:09:52,000
For the first time in the 35-year history,

189
0:09:53.173,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a female wheelchair athlete

190
0:09:55.158,000 --> 0:09:57,000
completed the Ironman World Championship.

191
0:09:57.746,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

192
0:10:05.879,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Applause ends)

193
0:10:07.053,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And it wasn't just any female athlete.

194
0:10:09.536,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It was me.

195
0:10:10.711,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

196
0:10:12.068,000 --> 0:10:15,000
A paralyzed orphan from India.

197
0:10:17.297,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Against all odds, I achieved my dream,

198
0:10:21.015,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and through this very personal commitment to myself,

199
0:10:24.396,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I slowly realized that completing the Ironman

200
0:10:27.738,000 --> 0:10:29,000
was about more than conquering Kona.

201
0:10:30.588,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It was about conquering polio

202
0:10:32.665,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and other disabling but preventable diseases,

203
0:10:36.62,000 --> 0:10:37,000
not only for myself,

204
0:10:38.181,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but for the millions of children

205
0:10:39.785,000 --> 0:10:44,000
who have been and still will be afflicted by vaccine-preventable diseases.

206
0:10:45.539,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Today, we are closer than ever to eliminating one of those diseases

207
0:10:50.31,000 --> 0:10:51,000
everywhere in the world.

208
0:10:52.286,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In the mid-1980s, polio once paralyzed more than 350,000 children a year

209
0:10:59.015,000 --> 0:11:01,000
in more than 125 countries.

210
0:11:01.688,000 --> 0:11:04,000
That amounted to a staggering 40 cases an hour.

211
0:11:05.57,000 --> 0:11:07,000
By contrast, so far this year,

212
0:11:07.861,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the last endemic countries have reported a total of only 12 cases.

213
0:11:12.997,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Since 1988, more than 2.5 billion children have been immunized against polio,

214
0:11:19.03,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and an estimated 16 million children,

215
0:11:21.41,000 --> 0:11:23,000
who otherwise would have been paralyzed like me,

216
0:11:24.09,000 --> 0:11:25,000
are walking.

217
0:11:25.875,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Despite this incredible progress,

218
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we know that until it's eradicated,

219
0:11:30.476,000 --> 0:11:32,000
polio remains a very real threat,

220
0:11:33.044,000 --> 0:11:36,000
especially to children in the poorest communities of the world.

221
0:11:36.907,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It can reemerge in some of the most remote and dangerous places,

222
0:11:40.908,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and from there, it can spread.

223
0:11:43.987,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And so this is my new Ironman:

224
0:11:47.448,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to end polio.

225
0:11:50.005,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And I am reminded every day,

226
0:11:52.322,000 --> 0:11:55,000
when I look at my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Maya.

227
0:11:56.093,000 --> 0:11:58,000
She is able to climb a ladder in the park,

228
0:11:58.625,000 --> 0:12:01,000
push her scooter or kick a ball across the grass.

229
0:12:01.776,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Almost everything that I see her do at her age

230
0:12:05.096,000 --> 0:12:08,000
reminds me of what I could not do at that age.

231
0:12:08.642,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And when she was two months old,

232
0:12:10.778,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I took her to get her first polio vaccine.

233
0:12:15.791,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And when the doctor came in the room to prepare the shot,

234
0:12:19.339,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I asked him if I could take a picture to document the moment.

235
0:12:24.879,000 --> 0:12:25,000
When we left the room,

236
0:12:26.366,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I could feel my eyes welling up with tears.

237
0:12:29.599,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I cried the entire way home.

238
0:12:33.774,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It was in that moment that I realized

239
0:12:36.322,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that my daughter's life would be very different from mine.

240
0:12:39.417,000 --> 0:12:42,000
She will never be faced with the crippling disability of polio,

241
0:12:42.505,000 --> 0:12:46,000
because a vaccine was available, and I chose to get her immunized.

242
0:12:47.134,000 --> 0:12:49,000
She can do anything she wants,

243
0:12:51.066,000 --> 0:12:53,000
as can each of you.

244
0:12:53.397,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:54.495,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now I'd like to leave you all with one question:

246
0:12:57.95,000 --> 0:12:59,000
what is your Ironman?

247
0:13:01.874,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Thank you.

248
0:13:03.049,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Applause)

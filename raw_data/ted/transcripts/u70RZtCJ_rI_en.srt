1
0:00:12.847,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about 500 years ago,

2
0:00:17.818,000 --> 0:00:2,000
they obviously found this amazing tropical forest.

3
0:00:20.928,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before,

4
0:00:25.165,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they found one species that caught their attention very quickly.

5
0:00:29.335,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This species, when you cut the bark, you find a very dark red resin

6
0:00:35.58,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes.

7
0:00:41.354,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The indigenous people called this species pau brasil,

8
0:00:45.799,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that's the reason why this land became "land of Brasil," and later on, Brazil.

9
0:00:51.82,000 --> 0:00:55,000
That's the only country in the world that has the name of a tree.

10
0:00:56.356,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil,

11
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:02,000
among other reasons.

12
0:01:03.507,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Forest products are all around us.

13
0:01:06.393,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Apart from all those products,

14
0:01:08.326,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the forest is very important for climate regulation.

15
0:01:12.219,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In Brazil, almost 70 percent of the evaporation that makes rain

16
0:01:17.453,000 --> 0:01:19,000
actually comes from the forest.

17
0:01:19.894,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere 20 billion tons of water every day.

18
0:01:28.984,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This is more than what the Amazon River, which is the largest river in the world,

19
0:01:33.456,000 --> 0:01:37,000
puts in the sea per day, which is 17 billion tons.

20
0:01:38.116,000 --> 0:01:43,000
If we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration,

21
0:01:43.215,000 --> 0:01:48,000
we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world.

22
0:01:49.722,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So it's a hell of a service for all of us.

23
0:01:52.98,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We have in the world about four billion hectares of forests.

24
0:01:56.595,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This is more or less China, U.S., Canada and Brazil all together,

25
0:02:02.232,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in terms of size, to have an idea.

26
0:02:04.536,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Three quarters of that is in the temperate zone,

27
0:02:08.646,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and just one quarter is in the tropics,

28
0:02:12.009,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but this one quarter, one billion hectares, holds most of the biodiversity,

29
0:02:18.023,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and very importantly, 50 percent of the living biomass, the carbon.

30
0:02:24.193,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, we used to have six billion hectares of forest --

31
0:02:28.229,000 --> 0:02:31,000
50 percent more than what we have -- 2,000 years ago.

32
0:02:32.072,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We've actually lost two billion hectares in the last 2,000 years.

33
0:02:35.638,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But in the last 100 years, we lost half of that.

34
0:02:39.915,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests

35
0:02:44.614,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to deforestation of tropical forests.

36
0:02:48.067,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So think of this: In 100 years,

37
0:02:51.439,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we lost the same amount of forest in the tropics

38
0:02:55.275,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that we lost in 2,000 years in temperate forests.

39
0:02:58.916,000 --> 0:03:,000
That's the speed of the destruction that we are having.

40
0:03:02.819,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle.

41
0:03:06.895,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We have the second largest forest in the world, just after Russia.

42
0:03:10.655,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It means 12 percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil,

43
0:03:14.341,000 --> 0:03:15,000
most of that in the Amazon.

44
0:03:16.153,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's the largest piece of forest we have. It's a very big, large area.

45
0:03:19.597,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You can see that you could fit many of the European countries there.

46
0:03:22.979,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We still have 80 percent of the forest cover.

47
0:03:26.482,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That's the good news.

48
0:03:28.111,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years.

49
0:03:32.818,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So if you go with that speed,

50
0:03:34.706,000 --> 0:03:39,000
very soon, we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon

51
0:03:39.745,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that regulates our climate.

52
0:03:42.01,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Deforestation was growing fast and accelerating

53
0:03:44.873,000 --> 0:03:46,000
at the end of the '90s and the beginning of the 2000s.

54
0:03:47.714,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Chainsaw sound)

55
0:03:51.641,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Sound of falling tree)

56
0:03:55.598,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Twenty-seven thousand square kilometers in one year.

57
0:03:59.947,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This is 2.7 million hectares.

58
0:04:03.602,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's almost like half of Costa Rica every year.

59
0:04:09.654,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So at this moment -- this is 2003, 2004 --

60
0:04:13.639,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I happened to be coming to work in the government.

61
0:04:18.116,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And together with other teammates in the National Forest Department,

62
0:04:22.566,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation,

63
0:04:28.293,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and make a plan to combat that at a national level,

64
0:04:31.005,000 --> 0:04:34,000
involving the local governments, the civil society,

65
0:04:34.341,000 --> 0:04:35,000
business, local communities,

66
0:04:36.184,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in an effort that could tackle those causes.

67
0:04:39.217,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So we came up with this plan with 144 actions in different areas.

68
0:04:45.019,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now I will go through all of them one by one --

69
0:04:47.366,000 --> 0:04:53,000
no, just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years.

70
0:04:54.17,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So the first thing, we set up a system with the national space agency

71
0:04:59.896,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that could actually see where deforestation is happening,

72
0:05:02.903,000 --> 0:05:03,000
almost in real time.

73
0:05:04.404,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So now in Brazil, we have this system, DETER,

74
0:05:06.788,000 --> 0:05:09,000
where every month, or every two months,

75
0:05:10.083,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we get information on where deforestation is happening

76
0:05:12.867,000 --> 0:05:14,000
so we can actually act when it's happening.

77
0:05:15.735,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And all the information is fully transparent

78
0:05:17.878,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so others can replicate that in independent systems.

79
0:05:20.862,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This allows us, among other things,

80
0:05:22.841,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to apprehend 1.4 million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken.

81
0:05:29.452,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Part of that we saw and sell, and all the revenue becomes a fund

82
0:05:35.067,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund.

83
0:05:40.755,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This also allows us to make a big operation

84
0:05:43.189,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to seize corruption and illegal activities

85
0:05:45.914,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that ended up having 700 people in prison, including a lot of public servants.

86
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Then we made the connection that areas that have been doing

87
0:05:56.172,000 --> 0:06:,000
illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance.

88
0:06:00.525,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users.

89
0:06:05.037,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, and so on

90
0:06:07.442,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that buy products from illegal clear-cut areas,

91
0:06:10.868,000 --> 0:06:13,000
they also can be liable for the deforestation.

92
0:06:14.526,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So making all these connections to help to push the problem down.

93
0:06:18.11,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And also we work a lot on land tenure issues.

94
0:06:21.503,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's very important for conflicts.

95
0:06:23.701,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Fifty million hectares of protected areas were created,

96
0:06:26.707,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which is an area the size of Spain.

97
0:06:32.496,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And of those, eight million were indigenous lands.

98
0:06:36.743,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now we start to see results.

99
0:06:40.429,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So in the last 10 years,

100
0:06:42.928,000 --> 0:06:45,000
deforestation came down in Brazil 75 percent.

101
0:06:46.532,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Applause)

102
0:06:52.143,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So if we compare it with the average deforestation

103
0:06:55.915,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that we had in the last decade,

104
0:06:58.177,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we saved 8.7 million hectares, which is the size of Austria.

105
0:07:03.181,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But more importantly, it avoided the emission

106
0:07:05.694,000 --> 0:07:07,000
of three billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere.

107
0:07:08.579,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

108
0:07:13.653,000 --> 0:07:15,000
until today, as a positive action.

109
0:07:17.727,000 --> 0:07:2,000
One may think that when you do these kinds of actions

110
0:07:20.908,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to decrease, to push down deforestation,

111
0:07:24.037,000 --> 0:07:26,000
you will have an economic impact

112
0:07:26.135,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because you will not have economic activity or something like that.

113
0:07:30.297,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite.

114
0:07:33.084,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In fact, in the period when we have the deepest decline of deforestation,

115
0:07:37.959,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the economy grew, on average, double from the previous decade,

116
0:07:42.108,000 --> 0:07:44,000
when deforestation was actually going up.

117
0:07:44.697,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So it's a good lesson for us.

118
0:07:46.752,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Maybe this is completely disconnected,

119
0:07:49.1,000 --> 0:07:51,000
as we just learned by having deforestation come down.

120
0:07:53.167,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now this is all good news, and it's quite an achievement,

121
0:07:57.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we obviously should be very proud about that.

122
0:08:00.448,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But it's not even close to sufficient.

123
0:08:03.219,000 --> 0:08:07,000
In fact, if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013,

124
0:08:08.109,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that was over half a million hectares,

125
0:08:11.748,000 --> 0:08:13,000
which means that every minute,

126
0:08:14.412,000 --> 0:08:17,000
an area the size of two soccer fields

127
0:08:17.785,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is being cut in the Amazon last year, just last year.

128
0:08:21.665,000 --> 0:08:25,000
If we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in Brazil,

129
0:08:25.748,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world.

130
0:08:31.114,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's more or less like we are forest heroes,

131
0:08:34.459,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but still deforestation champions.

132
0:08:37.629,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So we can't be satisfied, not even close to satisfied.

133
0:08:42.327,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So the next step, I think,

134
0:08:44.136,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil

135
0:08:48.687,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and to have that as a goal for 2020.

136
0:08:52.062,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That's our next step.

137
0:08:53.422,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now I've always been interested in the relationship

138
0:08:56.407,000 --> 0:08:58,000
between climate change and forests.

139
0:08:58.431,000 --> 0:09:03,000
First, because 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation,

140
0:09:04.182,000 --> 0:09:06,000
so it's a big part of the problem.

141
0:09:06.454,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But also, forests can be a big part of the solution

142
0:09:09.57,000 --> 0:09:16,000
since that's the best way we know to sink, capture and store carbon.

143
0:09:16.694,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now, there is another relationship of climate and forests

144
0:09:19.487,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that really stuck me in 2008 and made me change my career

145
0:09:23.553,000 --> 0:09:26,000
from forests to working with climate change.

146
0:09:27.039,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I went to visit Canada, in British Columbia,

147
0:09:29.724,000 --> 0:09:34,000
together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries

148
0:09:34.738,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that we have a kind of alliance of them, like Canada, Russia, India, China, U.S.

149
0:09:41.143,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And when we were there we learned about this pine beetle

150
0:09:46.257,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that is literally eating the forests in Canada.

151
0:09:49.547,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What we see here, those brown trees, these are really dead trees.

152
0:09:55.819,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle.

153
0:10:00.384,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What happens is that this beetle

154
0:10:03.429,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is controlled by the cold weather in the winter.

155
0:10:06.229,000 --> 0:10:09,000
For many years now, they don't have the sufficient cold weather

156
0:10:09.98,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to actually control the population of this beetle.

157
0:10:13.042,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And it became a disease that is really killing billions of trees.

158
0:10:20.284,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So I came back with this notion that the forest is actually

159
0:10:24.574,000 --> 0:10:29,000
one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change.

160
0:10:29.843,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So I was thinking,

161
0:10:31.503,000 --> 0:10:35,000
if I succeed in working with all my colleagues

162
0:10:35.967,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to actually help to stop deforestation,

163
0:10:38.443,000 --> 0:10:42,000
maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change

164
0:10:42.69,000 --> 0:10:45,000
by floods, heat, fires and so on.

165
0:10:46.63,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So I decided to leave the forest service

166
0:10:50.011,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and start to work directly on climate change,

167
0:10:53.415,000 --> 0:10:57,000
find a way to think and understand the challenge, and go from there.

168
0:10:57.463,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now, the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward.

169
0:11:02.051,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The goal is very clear.

170
0:11:03.819,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We want to limit the increase of the average temperature

171
0:11:07.428,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of the planet to two degrees.

172
0:11:10.001,000 --> 0:11:11,000
There are several reasons for that.

173
0:11:11.737,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I will not get into that now.

174
0:11:13.984,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But in order to get to this limit of two degrees,

175
0:11:17.441,000 --> 0:11:2,000
which is possible for us to survive,

176
0:11:21.254,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,

177
0:11:26.317,000 --> 0:11:32,000
defines that we have a budget of emissions of 1,000 billion tons of CO2

178
0:11:33.337,000 --> 0:11:36,000
from now until the end of the century.

179
0:11:36.579,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So if we divide this by the number of years,

180
0:11:39.243,000 --> 0:11:45,000
what we have is an average budget of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.

181
0:11:45.91,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now what is one ton of CO2?

182
0:11:48.118,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's more or less what one small car, running 20 kilometers a day,

183
0:11:54.107,000 --> 0:11:56,000
will emit in one year.

184
0:11:56.644,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Or it's one flight, one way,

185
0:11:58.705,000 --> 0:12:01,000
from São Paulo to Johannesburg or to London, one way.

186
0:12:02.089,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Two ways, two tons.

187
0:12:03.928,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So 11 billion tons is twice that.

188
0:12:07.402,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now the emissions today are 50 billion tons, and it's growing.

189
0:12:14.467,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's growing and maybe it will be 61 by 2020.

190
0:12:18.895,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now we need to go down to 10 by 2050.

191
0:12:23.592,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And while this happens,

192
0:12:25.367,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the population will grow from seven to nine billion people,

193
0:12:28.514,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the economy will grow from 60 trillion dollars in 2010

194
0:12:31.412,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to 200 trillion dollars.

195
0:12:33.474,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And so what we need to do is to be much more efficient

196
0:12:37.484,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita

197
0:12:42.425,000 --> 0:12:46,000
per person, per year, into something like one.

198
0:12:47.307,000 --> 0:12:5,000
You have to choose. You take the airplane or you have a car.

199
0:12:52.338,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So the question is, can we make it?

200
0:12:54.986,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And that's the exactly the same question

201
0:12:56.903,000 --> 0:13:,000
I got when I was developing a plan to combat deforestation.

202
0:13:01.048,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's such a big problem, so complex. Can we really do it?

203
0:13:05.677,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I think so. Think of this:

204
0:13:08.366,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Deforestation means 60 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions

205
0:13:13.677,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in Brazil in the last decade.

206
0:13:15.516,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Now it's a little bit less than 30 percent.

207
0:13:17.587,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In the world, 60 percent is energy.

208
0:13:21.487,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So if we can tackle directly the energy,

209
0:13:25.026,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the same way we could tackle deforestation,

210
0:13:27.714,000 --> 0:13:29,000
maybe we can have a chance.

211
0:13:29.89,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So there are five things that I think we should do.

212
0:13:33.547,000 --> 0:13:37,000
First, we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions.

213
0:13:37.893,000 --> 0:13:43,000
We don't need to clear-cut all the forests to actually get more jobs

214
0:13:43.982,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and agriculture and have more economy.

215
0:13:45.795,000 --> 0:13:47,000
That's what we proved when we decreased deforestation

216
0:13:48.297,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and the economy continued to grow.

217
0:13:50.113,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Same thing could happen in the energy sector.

218
0:13:54.51,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Second, we have to move the incentives to the right place.

219
0:13:57.793,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Today, 500 billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels.

220
0:14:03.05,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Why don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy?

221
0:14:08.204,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Third, we need to measure and make it transparent

222
0:14:11.638,000 --> 0:14:14,000
where, when and who is emitting greenhouse gases

223
0:14:14.932,000 --> 0:14:18,000
so we can have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities.

224
0:14:19.128,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Fourth, we need to leapfrog the routes of development,

225
0:14:23.914,000 --> 0:14:25,000
which means, you don't need to go to the landline telephone

226
0:14:26.71,000 --> 0:14:28,000
before you get to the mobile phones.

227
0:14:29.044,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Same way we don't need to go to fossil fuels

228
0:14:31.182,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to the one billion people who don't have access to energy

229
0:14:33.89,000 --> 0:14:35,000
before we get to the clean energy.

230
0:14:36.084,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And fifth and last,

231
0:14:37.97,000 --> 0:14:39,000
we need to share responsibility between governments,

232
0:14:40.668,000 --> 0:14:42,000
business and civil society.

233
0:14:43.39,000 --> 0:14:46,000
There is work to do for everybody, and we need to have everybody on board.

234
0:14:48.309,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So to finalize,

235
0:14:49.651,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I think the future is not like a fate

236
0:14:53.371,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that you have to just go as business as usual goes.

237
0:14:56.109,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We need to have the courage to actually change the route,

238
0:14:59.911,000 --> 0:15:,000
invest in something new,

239
0:15:01.314,000 --> 0:15:04,000
think that we can actually change the route.

240
0:15:04.432,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil,

241
0:15:07.454,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world.

242
0:15:10.585,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Thank you.

243
0:15:11.691,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

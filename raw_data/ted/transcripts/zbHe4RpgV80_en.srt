1
0:00:12.685,000 --> 0:00:15,000
All right, let's get ready for the worst TED Talk ever.

2
0:00:15.842,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:20.111,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I mean it. We prepared 30 minutes ago.

4
0:00:23.357,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I want to have it clear -- I love to be here with you all,

5
0:00:26.175,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but I wanted to be here not to tell my story

6
0:00:28.897,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but to tell the story of the amazing people of Puerto Rico

7
0:00:34.325,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that came together to feed the people of Puerto Rico.

8
0:00:39.08,000 --> 0:00:41,000
My name is José Andrés, and you know I love to feed the few,

9
0:00:41.99,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but even more, I love to feed the many.

10
0:00:44.802,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Here, right after the hurricane,

11
0:00:47.459,000 --> 0:00:51,000
like we'd done many times before after an earthquake in Haiti

12
0:00:51.925,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or Sandy or others,

13
0:00:55.318,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I had this sense of urgency to be there

14
0:00:58.49,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and to try to feed one person,

15
0:01:00.287,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and always, you have crazy friends that want to join you

16
0:01:03.042,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in those impossible endeavors.

17
0:01:04.803,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I'm always surrounded by amazing friends that only help me to be better.

18
0:01:08.993,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Nate came next to me.

19
0:01:11.637,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This was a Monday, and this is what we found.

20
0:01:15.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The destruction you saw on TV, one more hurricane,

21
0:01:19.002,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but this destruction was real.

22
0:01:21.494,000 --> 0:01:25,000
More than 95 percent of the electricity in the island was gone.

23
0:01:26.005,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Every single electric post was gone.

24
0:01:28.884,000 --> 0:01:3,000
All the cell towers were gone.

25
0:01:30.958,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You couldn't communicate with anybody.

26
0:01:33.827,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You couldn't find anybody the moment you moved away from San Juan.

27
0:01:37.09,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Even in San Juan, we had issues trying to use our cell phones.

28
0:01:42.765,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And what I found was that the island was hungry,

29
0:01:49.232,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the people didn't have money, because ATMs were not working,

30
0:01:54.128,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or their cards, which are electronic, for food stamps,

31
0:01:57.628,000 --> 0:01:59,000
they couldn't use it in their supermarkets,

32
0:02:00.408,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or there was no food or gas or clean water to cook.

33
0:02:05.263,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The need and the urgency of now was real,

34
0:02:09.86,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I was just able to get into a meeting at FEMA,

35
0:02:14.725,000 --> 0:02:19,000
where many of the main NGO partners were having a conversation

36
0:02:20.096,000 --> 0:02:23,000
about how to feed the island in the weeks to come,

37
0:02:23.821,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but the urgency was right now, in this minute, in this second,

38
0:02:28.137,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and we almost had three million people that needed to be fed.

39
0:02:32.149,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So we began doing what we do best.

40
0:02:34.887,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We went to see the sources of food,

41
0:02:36.607,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and I was able to see that the private industry actually was ready

42
0:02:39.773,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and prepared and thriving,

43
0:02:41.055,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but somebody at FEMA was not able even to be aware of that.

44
0:02:44.594,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And what we did was use fine kitchens.

45
0:02:46.481,000 --> 0:02:48,000
José Enrique, one of my favorite men in the whole world,

46
0:02:49.125,000 --> 0:02:51,000
one of the great restaurants in San Juan,

47
0:02:51.209,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where before landing, I began calling all the chefs of Puerto Rico,

48
0:02:55.9,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and everybody was like, "Let's not plan, let's not meet,

49
0:03:00.713,000 --> 0:03:01,000
let's start cooking."

50
0:03:02.213,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

51
0:03:03.269,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And that's what we did.

52
0:03:05.399,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We began feeding the people of Puerto Rico, on a Monday.

53
0:03:08.611,000 --> 0:03:12,000
On a Monday, we did a thousand meals, sancocho, an amazing stew

54
0:03:12.969,000 --> 0:03:13,000
with corn and yucca and pork.

55
0:03:15.311,000 --> 0:03:18,000
By Sunday, we were doing 25,000.

56
0:03:18.595,000 --> 0:03:2,000
By Sunday, we already didn't only use the restaurant,

57
0:03:21.235,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but we rented the parking lot right across.

58
0:03:25.777,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We began bringing food trucks,

59
0:03:27.921,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and a rice and chicken paella operation, and refrigerators,

60
0:03:31.395,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and volunteers began coming.

61
0:03:32.901,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Why? Because everybody wants to find a place to help,

62
0:03:36.477,000 --> 0:03:38,000
a place to do something.

63
0:03:39.245,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is how we began our first delivery.

64
0:03:42.037,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The hospitals -- nobody was feeding the nurses and the doctors,

65
0:03:45.959,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and we began feeding our first project,

66
0:03:48.87,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Hospital Carolina.

67
0:03:50.442,000 --> 0:03:52,000
All of a sudden, every single hospital was calling us.

68
0:03:53.281,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"We need food so we can feed our 24/7 employees

69
0:03:58.719,000 --> 0:04:01,000
taking care of the sick and the elderly and the people in need."

70
0:04:03.447,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then the place was too small. We were receiving orders.

71
0:04:08.103,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Every time we got one guest, one customer,

72
0:04:11.008,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we never stopped serving them,

73
0:04:12.683,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because we wanted to make sure that we were able to be stabilizing

74
0:04:15.978,000 --> 0:04:17,000
any place we were joining,

75
0:04:18.446,000 --> 0:04:21,000
any city, any hospital, any elderly home.

76
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Every time we made contact with them, we kept serving them food, day after day,

77
0:04:26.19,000 --> 0:04:27,000
so we needed to grow.

78
0:04:27.547,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We moved into the big coliseum.

79
0:04:29.61,000 --> 0:04:32,000
25,000 meals became 50,000 meals,

80
0:04:33.436,000 --> 0:04:36,000
became, all of a sudden, the biggest restaurant in the world.

81
0:04:36.998,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We were making close to 70,000 meals a day

82
0:04:42.515,000 --> 0:04:43,000
from one location alone.

83
0:04:44.196,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause)

84
0:04:49.324,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Volunteers began showing up by the hundreds.

85
0:04:52.709,000 --> 0:04:55,000
At one point, we got more than 7,000 volunteers

86
0:04:56.075,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that were at least one hour or more with us,

87
0:04:58.543,000 --> 0:05:02,000
at any given moment, more than 700 people at once.

88
0:05:02.833,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You saw that we began creating a movement,

89
0:05:04.944,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a movement that had a very simple idea everybody could rally behind:

90
0:05:08.762,000 --> 0:05:09,000
let's feed the hungry.

91
0:05:11.393,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And we began making food that people could recognize,

92
0:05:14.646,000 --> 0:05:16,000
not things that come from a faraway place

93
0:05:17.116,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in plastic bags that you open and you cannot even smell.

94
0:05:21.751,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:22.885,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We began making the foods that people feel home.

96
0:05:26.033,000 --> 0:05:3,000
People in these moments, they had this urgency of feeling they are alive,

97
0:05:31.048,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that somebody cares.

98
0:05:32.494,000 --> 0:05:33,000
One meal at a time,

99
0:05:34.059,000 --> 0:05:38,000
it didn't only become something used to bring calories to their bodies,

100
0:05:38.226,000 --> 0:05:39,000
calories that they needed,

101
0:05:39.51,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but they needed something else.

102
0:05:41.042,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They wanted to make sure that you and you and you and you,

103
0:05:43.781,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that you were caring,

104
0:05:45.038,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that we were sending the message that we are with you.

105
0:05:47.731,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Give us time, we are trying to fix this.

106
0:05:50.542,000 --> 0:05:53,000
That's what we found every time we began joining the communities.

107
0:05:53.977,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Fresh fruit began coming,

108
0:05:55.66,000 --> 0:05:56,000
even when in FEMA, they were asking me,

109
0:05:57.646,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"José, how are you able to get the food?"

110
0:06:00.059,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Simple: by calling and paying and getting.

111
0:06:02.623,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:05.337,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Applause)

113
0:06:10.067,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We began feeding people in San Juan.

114
0:06:12.121,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Before you knew, we were feeding the 78 municipalities all across the island.

115
0:06:17.725,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We needed a plan. One kitchen alone was not going to feed the island.

116
0:06:21.296,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I went to FEMA. They kicked me out with eight armored guards and AK-47s.

117
0:06:26.54,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I told them, "I want 18 kitchens around the island."

118
0:06:30.493,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Guess what? Three days ago, we reached our 18th kitchen

119
0:06:34.872,000 --> 0:06:35,000
around Puerto Rico.

120
0:06:36.047,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

121
0:06:40.151,000 --> 0:06:41,000
People began being fed.

122
0:06:41.921,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Volunteers kept showing up.

123
0:06:43.744,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We never had any system to deliver the food, people would tell me.

124
0:06:47.934,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Sure, we had the system.

125
0:06:49.585,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The entire island of Puerto Rico was the perfect delivery system.

126
0:06:53.974,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Anybody with a truck wanted to help.

127
0:06:56.125,000 --> 0:07:,000
Anybody going from A to B was for us the way to be bringing hope

128
0:07:00.518,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and a plate and a whole meal to anybody.

129
0:07:03.121,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We began finding amazing systems to do these food trucks,

130
0:07:06.907,000 --> 0:07:07,000
10 amazing food trucks.

131
0:07:08.637,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We began learning not to use the place that needed the food,

132
0:07:12.908,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but the number,

133
0:07:14.185,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the number of the apartment:

134
0:07:16.685,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Lolo, a 92-year-old veteran that was surrounded by water.

135
0:07:21.109,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We began giving not only hope to people,

136
0:07:24.436,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but knowing their names,

137
0:07:26.419,000 --> 0:07:28,000
checking day after day,

138
0:07:28.539,000 --> 0:07:31,000
making sure that those elderly people will never, ever again feel alone

139
0:07:32.536,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in a moment of disrepair.

140
0:07:34.15,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And we began going to the deeper areas,

141
0:07:36.595,000 --> 0:07:4,000
places that all of a sudden, the bridges were broken,

142
0:07:40.849,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but we had to go, because it was easy to stay in San Juan.

143
0:07:43.874,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We had to go to those places that actually, they really needed us.

144
0:07:47.634,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And we kept going, and people kept waiting for us,

145
0:07:50.173,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because they knew that we will always show up,

146
0:07:52.7,000 --> 0:07:55,000
because we will never leave them alone.

147
0:07:55.951,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Applause)

148
0:08:00.621,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The food trucks became our angels,

149
0:08:03.558,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and the food trucks kept sending hope,

150
0:08:06.772,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but we saw we needed more:

151
0:08:08.146,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Vieques and Culebra, two islands far away from the island --

152
0:08:12.265,000 --> 0:08:14,000
somebody had to be feeding them.

153
0:08:14.313,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We didn't only bring food and make a hotel kitchen operation in Vieques

154
0:08:17.897,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and bring daily food to Culebra.

155
0:08:19.688,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We brought the first water purification system

156
0:08:22.731,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to the island of Vieques,

157
0:08:24.016,000 --> 0:08:26,000
where we could be filtering one gallon per minute.

158
0:08:26.961,000 --> 0:08:28,000
All of a sudden, big problems become very simple,

159
0:08:29.272,000 --> 0:08:31,000
low-hanging fruit solutions,

160
0:08:31.296,000 --> 0:08:35,000
only by doing, not planning and meeting in a very big building.

161
0:08:35.669,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:37.233,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And then we found creative ways.

163
0:08:38.956,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We needed helicopters. We asked. We got.

164
0:08:41.606,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We needed planes. We asked, we paid, and we got.

165
0:08:44.463,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We kept sending food to those places that really were in need.

166
0:08:48.645,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And the simple ideas just become powerful.

167
0:08:52.713,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Volunteers will go to the edges of the island.

168
0:08:56.069,000 --> 0:08:58,000
All of a sudden, it was a movement.

169
0:08:58.501,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The teams of World Central Kitchen

170
0:09:00.145,000 --> 0:09:05,000
will be received with prayers, with songs, with claps, with hugs,

171
0:09:05.75,000 --> 0:09:06,000
with smiles.

172
0:09:07.272,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We were able to connect in so many corners.

173
0:09:10.789,000 --> 0:09:13,000
When I tell you that even the National Guard began calling us

174
0:09:14.74,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because our national poor guy's guards,

175
0:09:18.368,000 --> 0:09:2,000
big heroes in a moment of chaos,

176
0:09:20.63,000 --> 0:09:24,000
they couldn't get a simple humble plate of hot food.

177
0:09:26.882,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And partnerships show up.

178
0:09:28.457,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Mercy Corps,

179
0:09:30.069,000 --> 0:09:32,000
HSI from Homeland Security,

180
0:09:33.068,000 --> 0:09:36,000
partnerships that they didn't happen calling the top.

181
0:09:36.223,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They happened in the hotel room, in the middle of the street,

182
0:09:39.254,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in the middle of the mountains.

183
0:09:41.374,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We saw that by working together, we can even reach more people.

184
0:09:45.374,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Partnerships that happen by logic,

185
0:09:49.077,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the urgency of now is put to the service of the people.

186
0:09:53.088,000 --> 0:09:56,000
When we have emergency relief organizations,

187
0:09:56.736,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we cannot be planning about how to give aid a month from now.

188
0:10:00.728,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We have to be ready to start giving help

189
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the second after something happens.

190
0:10:08.133,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And children were fed,

191
0:10:10.464,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and all of a sudden, the island,

192
0:10:13.1,000 --> 0:10:18,000
while still in a very special moment

193
0:10:18.165,000 --> 0:10:2,000
where everything is fragile,

194
0:10:20.775,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we saw that an NGO like ours --

195
0:10:22.964,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we didn't want to break the private sector --

196
0:10:26.434,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that already, small restaurants were being opened,

197
0:10:29.887,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that somehow, normalcy,

198
0:10:32.649,000 --> 0:10:35,000
whatever normalcy means today in Puerto Rico, was happening.

199
0:10:36.593,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We began trying to be sending the message:

200
0:10:38.716,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we need to start moving away from the places

201
0:10:40.852,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that are already stabilized

202
0:10:43.066,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and keep concentrating in the areas that really need help.

203
0:10:47.234,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Video): People of Puerto Rico, two million meals!

204
0:10:53.829,000 --> 0:10:55,000
José Andrés OK, let me translate this to you.

205
0:10:55.973,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:59.5,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Almost 28 days later,

207
0:11:04.357,000 --> 0:11:05,000
more than 10 food trucks,

208
0:11:06.072,000 --> 0:11:08,000
more than 7,000 volunteers,

209
0:11:08.393,000 --> 0:11:09,000
18 kitchens ...

210
0:11:11.282,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we served more than two million meals.

211
0:11:15.497,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Applause)

212
0:11:25.254,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Applause ends)

213
0:11:26.428,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And you guys coming here to TED, you should be proud,

214
0:11:29.007,000 --> 0:11:33,000
because we know many of you, you are part of the change.

215
0:11:33.135,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But the change is only going to happen if after we leave this amazing conference,

216
0:11:37.563,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we put the amazing ideas and inspiration that we get,

217
0:11:41.488,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and we believe that nothing is impossible,

218
0:11:44.453,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and we put our know-how to the service of those in need.

219
0:11:48.449,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I arrived to an island trying to feed a few people,

220
0:11:51.997,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and I saw a big problem,

221
0:11:54.068,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and all of a sudden, the people of Puerto Rico saw the same problem as me,

222
0:11:59.493,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and only we did one thing:

223
0:12:01.607,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we began cooking.

224
0:12:03.266,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And so the people of Puerto Rico

225
0:12:05.965,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and the chefs of Puerto Rico, in a moment of disrepair,

226
0:12:09.695,000 --> 0:12:1,000
began bringing hope,

227
0:12:12.042,000 --> 0:12:13,000
not by meeting,

228
0:12:13.98,000 --> 0:12:15,000
not by planning,

229
0:12:16.155,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but with only one simple idea:

230
0:12:19.011,000 --> 0:12:22,000
let's start cooking and let's start feeding

231
0:12:22.036,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the people of Puerto Rico.

232
0:12:23.909,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thank you.

233
0:12:25.083,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Applause)

234
0:12:27.23,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Dave Troy: Go back out.

235
0:12:28.532,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Laughter)

236
0:12:29.556,000 --> 0:12:3,000
DT: The public loves you.

237
0:12:30.842,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Applause)

238
0:12:37.543,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Nate Mook: A couple of quick questions,

239
0:12:39.511,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because I think some folks would be interested to hear.

240
0:12:42.257,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So as you said, you came the first time,

241
0:12:45.638,000 --> 0:12:47,000
got on the ground,

242
0:12:47.964,000 --> 0:12:49,000
went to the government command center,

243
0:12:50.338,000 --> 0:12:52,000
started to have some meetings with people,

244
0:12:52.385,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and they weren't very receptive.

245
0:12:55.703,000 --> 0:12:57,000
José Andrés: This is great. This is how good my talk was.

246
0:12:58.64,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Laughter)

247
0:13:00.108,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It's the first talk with a follow-up in the history of TED.

248
0:13:03.148,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I feel so good.

249
0:13:05.133,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

250
0:13:06.482,000 --> 0:13:08,000
NM: So tell us why, what were some of the challenges,

251
0:13:08.999,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and then when you noticed, they started coming to you to ask you.

252
0:13:13.063,000 --> 0:13:16,000
JA: We cannot be asking everything from Red Cross or Salvation Army.

253
0:13:16.639,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But the idea is, I donated before to those organizations,

254
0:13:20.725,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and they are the big organizations,

255
0:13:22.703,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and maybe the problem is that we're expecting too much from them.

256
0:13:26.706,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It's not like they didn't do what they were supposed to do.

257
0:13:31.307,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It's that the perception is that that's what they do.

258
0:13:35.981,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But all of a sudden, you cannot get into a moment like this and wash your hands,

259
0:13:40.839,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and you say somebody else is going to be picking it up.

260
0:13:45.619,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We had a simple problem that had a very simple solution.

261
0:13:50.465,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This was not a faraway country

262
0:13:53.157,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or the Green Zone in Baghdad.

263
0:13:55.448,000 --> 0:13:56,000
This was American soil,

264
0:13:57.363,000 --> 0:13:59,000
a beautiful place called Puerto Rico,

265
0:13:59.982,000 --> 0:14:04,000
with hundreds, thousands of restaurants and people willing to help,

266
0:14:05.045,000 --> 0:14:07,000
but all of a sudden, we had people hungry,

267
0:14:07.308,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and we didn't have a plan how to feed them in the short term.

268
0:14:12.305,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So yes, FEMA, to a degree, was thinking about how to feed the people.

269
0:14:18.099,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Red Cross didn't have the right answers,

270
0:14:20.195,000 --> 0:14:24,000
because Southern Baptist Church, the biggest food organization in America,

271
0:14:24.941,000 --> 0:14:28,000
my heroes, they were never called to Puerto Rico.

272
0:14:29.275,000 --> 0:14:32,000
When you see the Red Cross delivering food in America after a hurricane,

273
0:14:32.681,000 --> 0:14:34,000
it's Southern Baptist Church doing it.

274
0:14:35.79,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We didn't have that in Puerto Rico.

275
0:14:38.053,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Salvation Army came and asked me for 420 meals on a Wednesday rainy night

276
0:14:42.763,000 --> 0:14:44,000
for a local elderly shop.

277
0:14:44.887,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I love to help the Salvation Army,

278
0:14:47.892,000 --> 0:14:52,000
but in my world, they are the ones who are supposed to be helping us

279
0:14:53.198,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to answer those calls of help.

280
0:14:56.353,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Thursday morning is when I wake up super worried

281
0:14:59.749,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that actually we didn't have the plan to feed the island.

282
0:15:03.4,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And some people will say maybe you are making the problem

283
0:15:06.575,000 --> 0:15:08,000
bigger than it was.

284
0:15:08.638,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Well, we had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of organizations

285
0:15:12.283,000 --> 0:15:15,000
knocking on our door, asking for a tray of food,

286
0:15:16.123,000 --> 0:15:19,000
so if that's not proof that the need was real ...

287
0:15:19.184,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We cannot be feeding people in America anymore with MREs

288
0:15:23.123,000 --> 0:15:25,000
or something like you open and, you know,

289
0:15:25.686,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I was giving to this little cat a little bit of those same foods --

290
0:15:30.186,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

291
0:15:31.233,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and then I gave them the chicken and rice we made,

292
0:15:34.241,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and they went for the chicken and rice.

293
0:15:36.21,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Laughter)

294
0:15:37.591,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Applause)

295
0:15:39.547,000 --> 0:15:4,000
They don't even eat that themselves.

296
0:15:41.302,000 --> 0:15:45,000
We can feed humanity for a day or two or five,

297
0:15:45.805,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but those MREs cost, like, 12, 14, 15, 20 dollars to the American taxpayer.

298
0:15:51.147,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It's OK for certain moments,

299
0:15:52.884,000 --> 0:15:53,000
during battle,

300
0:15:54.266,000 --> 0:15:57,000
but not to be feeding Americans for weeks and weeks and weeks,

301
0:15:58.195,000 --> 0:16:03,000
when actually, you can be hiring the local private business community

302
0:16:03.517,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to do the same job better, creating local jobs,

303
0:16:07.406,000 --> 0:16:09,000
helping the local economy to come back,

304
0:16:09.708,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and in the process making sure that everything was going to go back

305
0:16:13.342,000 --> 0:16:15,000
as normal as quick as possible.

306
0:16:15.999,000 --> 0:16:16,000
That's where we began cooking.

307
0:16:17.484,000 --> 0:16:18,000
You were there with me,

308
0:16:19.347,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and that's why we spent every single dollar we had in our credit cards.

309
0:16:23.968,000 --> 0:16:26,000
If AmEx is listening to this, please, a discount would be appreciated.

310
0:16:27.473,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Laughter)

311
0:16:29.989,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Or Visa.

312
0:16:31.196,000 --> 0:16:34,000
NM: So what's the situation now?

313
0:16:34.815,000 --> 0:16:35,000
You know, it's been a month.

314
0:16:36.609,000 --> 0:16:38,000
You said there's been some improvements in San Juan

315
0:16:39.363,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and focus on the areas outside,

316
0:16:41.386,000 --> 0:16:45,000
but obviously there are still major challenges, and what's next?

317
0:16:45.497,000 --> 0:16:49,000
JA: There are. So what's next is we slowly began going down

318
0:16:50.155,000 --> 0:16:52,000
after, more or less, FEMA let us know

319
0:16:52.442,000 --> 0:16:54,000
that they thought they had everything under control

320
0:16:54.933,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and we were no longer needed,

321
0:16:57.664,000 --> 0:17:,000
but you only believe everything so much.

322
0:17:01.679,000 --> 0:17:05,000
We moved from the big place you saw, 60,000 meals a day,

323
0:17:06.305,000 --> 0:17:09,000
to another one, as big, but more strategically located,

324
0:17:09.909,000 --> 0:17:11,000
also cheaper,

325
0:17:12.218,000 --> 0:17:14,000
where we are going to be making 20-25,000 meals a day,

326
0:17:14.815,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and then we are leaving four, five, six kitchens

327
0:17:17.83,000 --> 0:17:19,000
strategically located around the island,

328
0:17:20.482,000 --> 0:17:23,000
very high up in the mountains, in the poor areas.

329
0:17:23.935,000 --> 0:17:24,000
We got a lot of data.

330
0:17:25.848,000 --> 0:17:28,000
We know who is using SNAPs, who is using food stamps,

331
0:17:28.88,000 --> 0:17:3,000
the cards.

332
0:17:31.468,000 --> 0:17:34,000
We know who has them and we know who is using them.

333
0:17:34.952,000 --> 0:17:37,000
So in the parts of the island where nobody is using them,

334
0:17:38.077,000 --> 0:17:41,000
those are the parts of the island where we are going to be focusing our efforts.

335
0:17:41.864,000 --> 0:17:44,000
So it's amazing how sometimes simple data can give you a clue

336
0:17:44.997,000 --> 0:17:46,000
of who are the people in need.

337
0:17:47.805,000 --> 0:17:5,000
So we went to a town called Morovis.

338
0:17:51.175,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Beautiful.

339
0:17:52.351,000 --> 0:17:54,000
The best chicken restaurant in the history of mankind.

340
0:17:55.027,000 --> 0:17:57,000
You should all travel to Morovis.

341
0:17:57.067,000 --> 0:17:58,000
DT: Sounds good.

342
0:17:58.333,000 --> 0:18:,000
JA: So I saw the chicken. We were bringing sandwiches.

343
0:18:00.881,000 --> 0:18:02,000
I stopped. I was with these Homeland Security officers.

344
0:18:03.53,000 --> 0:18:04,000
We ate the chicken.

345
0:18:04.723,000 --> 0:18:08,000
I left to drop these sandwiches in this other place called San Lorenzo.

346
0:18:09.422,000 --> 0:18:11,000
San Lorenzo was critical, because the bridge was broken,

347
0:18:12.127,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and so it was an island inside the island,

348
0:18:14.209,000 --> 0:18:16,000
a little community surrounded by water.

349
0:18:16.369,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Everybody told us, "It's a disaster down there."

350
0:18:19.608,000 --> 0:18:2,000
We dropped the sandwiches.

351
0:18:20.972,000 --> 0:18:21,000
I went back to Morovis, and I thought,

352
0:18:22.876,000 --> 0:18:24,000
you know, if it's a disaster, sandwiches is not enough.

353
0:18:25.572,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I brought 120 chickens,

354
0:18:27.488,000 --> 0:18:29,000
with yucca and with rice,

355
0:18:30.281,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and we went back to that broken bridge,

356
0:18:32.648,000 --> 0:18:34,000
we crossed the river,

357
0:18:35.115,000 --> 0:18:36,000
water up to everywhere.

358
0:18:37.131,000 --> 0:18:4,000
We arrived with the 120 chickens,

359
0:18:40.544,000 --> 0:18:41,000
we dropped the food,

360
0:18:41.822,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and the community were very thankful, but they told us,

361
0:18:45.401,000 --> 0:18:46,000
"We're OK, we don't need more food.

362
0:18:47.377,000 --> 0:18:49,000
We have gas, we have money,

363
0:18:49.853,000 --> 0:18:51,000
we have good food and our water is clean.

364
0:18:52.147,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Take care of the other communities around us that are in more need."

365
0:18:55.797,000 --> 0:18:58,000
You see, communication is key.

366
0:18:58.913,000 --> 0:19:01,000
In these scenarios, we can be relying on fake news

367
0:19:02.897,000 --> 0:19:06,000
or we can be having the real information that we can make smart decisions

368
0:19:07.342,000 --> 0:19:09,000
to really take care of the true issues.

369
0:19:09.928,000 --> 0:19:1,000
That's what we are doing.

370
0:19:11.293,000 --> 0:19:15,000
(Applause)

371
0:19:16.103,000 --> 0:19:19,000
NM: It was an amazing operation,

372
0:19:19.507,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and to witness it firsthand and to play a small role --

373
0:19:22.92,000 --> 0:19:23,000
JA: You made it happen.

374
0:19:24.269,000 --> 0:19:27,000
NM: At its peak, I think you were up to about 150,000 meals

375
0:19:28.142,000 --> 0:19:3,000
per day, across the island,

376
0:19:30.379,000 --> 0:19:31,000
which is pretty incredible.

377
0:19:32.332,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And I think, at the same time, really sort of setting a model

378
0:19:35.92,000 --> 0:19:37,000
for how this can be done, hopefully, moving forward.

379
0:19:38.51,000 --> 0:19:4,000
I mean, I think that's one of the big learnings out of this --

380
0:19:41.467,000 --> 0:19:44,000
DT: This is possible. You know, people can replicate this.

381
0:19:44.534,000 --> 0:19:46,000
JA: But I'm going to stop coming to watch TED Talks,

382
0:19:47.446,000 --> 0:19:49,000
because you've got ideas that anything can happen.

383
0:19:49.89,000 --> 0:19:5,000
(Laughter)

384
0:19:51.891,000 --> 0:19:53,000
And then my wife told me,

385
0:19:54.783,000 --> 0:19:57,000
"Man, you told me you were going to cook a thousand meals a day.

386
0:19:57.808,000 --> 0:19:58,000
I cannot leave you alone for a day."

387
0:19:59.596,000 --> 0:20:01,000
(Laughter)

388
0:20:02.327,000 --> 0:20:05,000
But I hope that World Central Kitchen --

389
0:20:05.487,000 --> 0:20:07,000
you know, one thing we did I didn't say:

390
0:20:07.533,000 --> 0:20:09,000
I picked up the phone and I began calling people,

391
0:20:09.964,000 --> 0:20:12,000
people that I thought had expertise that could help us.

392
0:20:13.908,000 --> 0:20:16,000
So I picked up the phone and I called a company called Bon Appétit, Fedele.

393
0:20:17.672,000 --> 0:20:19,000
Bon Appétit's one of the big catering companies.

394
0:20:19.936,000 --> 0:20:22,000
They do food for Google and for arenas.

395
0:20:23.518,000 --> 0:20:24,000
They're out of California.

396
0:20:24.957,000 --> 0:20:26,000
They belong to a bigger group called Compass.

397
0:20:27.409,000 --> 0:20:29,000
And I told them, "You know what?

398
0:20:29.98,000 --> 0:20:33,000
I need cooks, and I need cooks that can do volume

399
0:20:34.17,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and that can do good, quality volume."

400
0:20:37.021,000 --> 0:20:4,000
In less than 24 hours, I began getting people and chefs.

401
0:20:40.238,000 --> 0:20:44,000
At one point, we got 16 of the best chefs that America can offer.

402
0:20:44.316,000 --> 0:20:48,000
You see, America is an amazing heart country

403
0:20:48.471,000 --> 0:20:49,000
that always is sending their best.

404
0:20:50.48,000 --> 0:20:51,000
What we've been learning over the years

405
0:20:52.432,000 --> 0:20:55,000
is that those chefs of America are going to be playing a role

406
0:20:56.376,000 --> 0:20:59,000
in how we are going to be feeding America and maybe other parts of the world

407
0:20:59.982,000 --> 0:21:,000
in times of need.

408
0:21:01.514,000 --> 0:21:02,000
What we need to start

409
0:21:02.78,000 --> 0:21:05,000
is bringing the right expertise where the expertise is needed.

410
0:21:06.491,000 --> 0:21:08,000
Sometimes I have a feeling, like with FEMA,

411
0:21:09.181,000 --> 0:21:13,000
we are bringing the wrong expertise in the areas that it's not even needed.

412
0:21:13.388,000 --> 0:21:15,000
The people of FEMA are great people.

413
0:21:15.611,000 --> 0:21:16,000
The men and women are smart,

414
0:21:17.38,000 --> 0:21:18,000
they are prepared,

415
0:21:18.555,000 --> 0:21:23,000
but they live under this amazing hierarchy pyramidal organizational chart

416
0:21:23.872,000 --> 0:21:25,000
that everybody falls out of their own weight.

417
0:21:26.749,000 --> 0:21:28,000
We need to be empowering people to be successful.

418
0:21:29.397,000 --> 0:21:31,000
What we did was a flatter organizational chart

419
0:21:32.293,000 --> 0:21:34,000
where everybody was owning the situation

420
0:21:35.024,000 --> 0:21:38,000
and we all made quick decisions to solve the problems on the spot.

421
0:21:38.843,000 --> 0:21:4,000
(Applause)

422
0:21:41.137,000 --> 0:21:42,000
DT: Absolutely.

423
0:21:42.327,000 --> 0:21:43,000
(Applause)

424
0:21:43.43,000 --> 0:21:45,000
Another round of applause for José Andrés.

425
0:21:45.469,000 --> 0:21:51,000
(Applause) (Cheering)

1
0:00:13.992,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A confession:

2
0:00:15.834,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I am an archaeologist and a museum curator,

3
0:00:18.831,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but a paradoxical one.

4
0:00:21.637,000 --> 0:00:23,000
For my museum, I collect things,

5
0:00:24.292,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but I also return things back to where they came from.

6
0:00:28.815,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I love museums because they're social and educational,

7
0:00:33.395,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but I'm most drawn to them because of the magic of objects:

8
0:00:37.814,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a one-million-year-old hand axe,

9
0:00:40.316,000 --> 0:00:42,000
a totem pole, an impressionist painting

10
0:00:43.294,000 --> 0:00:45,000
all take us beyond our own imaginations.

11
0:00:47.228,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In museums, we pause to muse, to gaze upon our human empire of things

12
0:00:53.682,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in meditation and wonder.

13
0:00:57.315,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I understand why US museums alone

14
0:00:59.573,000 --> 0:01:03,000
host more than 850 million visits each year.

15
0:01:05.39,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Yet, in recent years, museums have become a battleground.

16
0:01:09.564,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Communities around the world don't want to see their culture

17
0:01:12.452,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in distant institutions which they have no control over.

18
0:01:16.783,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They want to see their cultural treasures

19
0:01:18.948,000 --> 0:01:21,000
repatriated, returned to their places of origin.

20
0:01:23.679,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Greece seeks the return of the Parthenon Marbles,

21
0:01:26.489,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a collection of classical sculptures held by the British Museum.

22
0:01:31.425,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Egypt demands antiquities from Germany.

23
0:01:35.187,000 --> 0:01:37,000
New Zealand's Maori want to see returned

24
0:01:38.007,000 --> 0:01:42,000
ancestral tattooed heads from museums everywhere.

25
0:01:43.197,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Yet these claims pale in comparison to those made by Native Americans.

26
0:01:48.857,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Already, US museums have returned more than one million artifacts

27
0:01:52.794,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and 50,000 sets of Native American skeletons.

28
0:01:58.891,000 --> 0:02:01,000
To illustrate what's at stake, let's start with the War Gods.

29
0:02:03.461,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is a wood carving

30
0:02:05.335,000 --> 0:02:08,000
made by members of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico.

31
0:02:09.399,000 --> 0:02:12,000
In the 1880s, anthropologists began to collect them

32
0:02:12.622,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as evidence of American Indian religion.

33
0:02:16.04,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They came to be seen as beautiful,

34
0:02:19.123,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the precursor to the stark sculptures of Picasso and Paul Klee,

35
0:02:24.12,000 --> 0:02:27,000
helping to usher in the modern art movement.

36
0:02:28.559,000 --> 0:02:32,000
From one viewpoint, the museum did exactly as it's supposed to

37
0:02:32.83,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with the War God.

38
0:02:34.274,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It helped introduce a little-known art form

39
0:02:36.717,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for the world to appreciate.

40
0:02:40.2,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But from another point of view,

41
0:02:41.741,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the museum had committed a terrible crime of cultural violence.

42
0:02:47.589,000 --> 0:02:51,000
For Zunis, the War God is not a piece of art,

43
0:02:51.644,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it is not even a thing.

44
0:02:53.637,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It is a being.

45
0:02:57.521,000 --> 0:02:59,000
For Zunis, every year,

46
0:03:00.221,000 --> 0:03:02,000
priests ritually carve new War Gods,

47
0:03:02.467,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the Ahayu:da,

48
0:03:03.983,000 --> 0:03:05,000
breathing life into them in a long ceremony.

49
0:03:07.408,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They are placed on sacred shrines

50
0:03:09.404,000 --> 0:03:12,000
where they live to protect the Zuni people

51
0:03:12.669,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and keep the universe in balance.

52
0:03:15.856,000 --> 0:03:17,000
No one can own or sell a War God.

53
0:03:18.182,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They belong only to the earth.

54
0:03:21.443,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And so Zunis want them back from museums

55
0:03:24.634,000 --> 0:03:26,000
so they can go to their shrine homes

56
0:03:28.531,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to fulfill their spiritual purpose.

57
0:03:32.451,000 --> 0:03:34,000
What is a curator to do?

58
0:03:35.461,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I believe that the War Gods should be returned.

59
0:03:40.694,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This might be a startling answer.

60
0:03:42.345,000 --> 0:03:44,000
After all, my conclusion contradicts the refrain

61
0:03:44.948,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of the world's most famous archaeologist:

62
0:03:48.174,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"That belongs in a museum!"

63
0:03:49.752,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:52.712,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is what Indiana Jones said, not just to drive movie plots,

65
0:03:56.76,000 --> 0:04:,000
but to drive home the unquestionable good of museums for society.

66
0:04:03.052,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I did not come to my view easily.

67
0:04:05.926,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I grew up in Tucson, Arizona,

68
0:04:08.401,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and fell in love with the Sonoran Desert's past.

69
0:04:12.037,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I was amazed that beneath the city's bland strip malls

70
0:04:16.042,000 --> 0:04:19,000
was 12,000 years of history just waiting to be discovered.

71
0:04:20.983,000 --> 0:04:23,000
When I was 16 years old, I started taking archaeology classes

72
0:04:24.274,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and going out on digs.

73
0:04:26.896,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A high school teacher of mine even helped me set up my own laboratory

74
0:04:30.192,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to study animal bones.

75
0:04:33.061,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But in college,

76
0:04:35.125,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I came to learn that my future career had a dark history.

77
0:04:40.372,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Starting in the 1860s,

78
0:04:43.127,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Native American skeletons became a tool for science,

79
0:04:47.278,000 --> 0:04:48,000
collected in the thousands

80
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to prove new theories of social and racial hierarchies.

81
0:04:54.735,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Native American human remains were plundered from graves,

82
0:04:59.267,000 --> 0:05:01,000
even taken fresh from battlefields.

83
0:05:04.37,000 --> 0:05:06,000
When archaeologists came across white graves,

84
0:05:06.847,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the skeleton was often quickly reburied,

85
0:05:09.307,000 --> 0:05:14,000
while Native bones were deposited as specimens on museum shelves.

86
0:05:15.38,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In the wake of war, stolen land, boarding schools,

87
0:05:18.729,000 --> 0:05:19,000
laws banning religion,

88
0:05:20.54,000 --> 0:05:22,000
anthropologists collected sacred objects

89
0:05:22.666,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in the belief that Native peoples were on the cusp of extinction.

90
0:05:28.162,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You can call it racism or colonialism, but the labels don't matter

91
0:05:32.569,000 --> 0:05:34,000
as much as the fact that over the last century,

92
0:05:35.401,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Native American rights and culture were taken from them.

93
0:05:40.039,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In 1990, after years of Native protests,

94
0:05:43.274,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the US government, through the US Congress,

95
0:05:45.731,000 --> 0:05:49,000
finally passed a law that allowed Native Americans to reclaim

96
0:05:50.105,000 --> 0:05:53,000
cultural items, sacred objects and human remains from museums.

97
0:05:54.854,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Many archaeologists were panicked.

98
0:05:58.713,000 --> 0:05:59,000
For scientists,

99
0:05:59.911,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it can be hard to fully grasp how a piece of wood can be a living god

100
0:06:06.175,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or how spirits surround bones.

101
0:06:08.427,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And they knew that modern science, especially with DNA,

102
0:06:12.253,000 --> 0:06:15,000
can provide luminous insights into the past.

103
0:06:17.155,000 --> 0:06:19,000
As the anthropologist Frank Norwick declared,

104
0:06:19.738,000 --> 0:06:23,000
"We are doing important work that benefits all of mankind.

105
0:06:23.893,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We are not returning anything to anyone."

106
0:06:29.381,000 --> 0:06:31,000
As a college student, all of this was an enigma

107
0:06:32.382,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that was hard to decipher.

108
0:06:35.409,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Why did Native Americans want their heritage back

109
0:06:38.426,000 --> 0:06:4,000
from the very places preserving it?

110
0:06:41.849,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And how could scientists spend their entire lives

111
0:06:45.095,000 --> 0:06:46,000
studying dead Indians

112
0:06:46.61,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but seem to care so little about living ones?

113
0:06:52.221,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I graduated but wasn't sure what to do next,

114
0:06:55.436,000 --> 0:06:56,000
so I traveled.

115
0:06:58.897,000 --> 0:06:59,000
One day, in South Africa,

116
0:07:00.62,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I visited Nelson Mandela's former prison cell on Robben Island.

117
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I had an epiphany.

118
0:07:07.59,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Here was a man who helped a country bridge vast divides

119
0:07:11.798,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to seek, however imperfectly, reconciliation.

120
0:07:16.12,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I'm no Mandela, but I ask myself:

121
0:07:18.853,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Could I, too, plant seeds of hope in the ruins of the past?

122
0:07:23.586,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In 2007, I was hired as a curator

123
0:07:25.979,000 --> 0:07:27,000
at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.

124
0:07:28.801,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Our team agreed that unlike many other institutions,

125
0:07:32.037,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we needed to proactively confront the legacy of museum collecting.

126
0:07:37.85,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We started with the skeletons in our closet,

127
0:07:41.089,000 --> 0:07:42,000
100 of them.

128
0:07:43.035,000 --> 0:07:45,000
After months and then years, we met with dozens of tribes

129
0:07:45.806,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to figure out how to get these remains home.

130
0:07:48.84,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And this is hard work.

131
0:07:50.222,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It involves negotiating who will receive the remains,

132
0:07:54.325,000 --> 0:07:55,000
how to respectfully transfer them,

133
0:07:56.277,000 --> 0:07:57,000
where will they go.

134
0:07:58.734,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Native American leaders become undertakers,

135
0:08:02.365,000 --> 0:08:06,000
planning funerals for dead relatives they had never wanted unearthed.

136
0:08:09.106,000 --> 0:08:11,000
A decade later, the Denver Museum and our Native partners

137
0:08:11.84,000 --> 0:08:14,000
have reburied nearly all of the human remains in the collection.

138
0:08:16.098,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We have returned hundreds of sacred objects.

139
0:08:19.6,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But I've come to see that these battles are endless.

140
0:08:23.837,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Repatriation is now a permanent feature of the museum world.

141
0:08:29.31,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Hundreds of tribes are waiting their turn.

142
0:08:32.668,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There are always more museums with more stuff.

143
0:08:36.766,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Every catalogued War God in an American public museum

144
0:08:39.703,000 --> 0:08:43,000
has now been returned -- 106, so far --

145
0:08:43.957,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but there are more beyond the reach of US law,

146
0:08:47.021,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in private collections and outside our borders.

147
0:08:51.225,000 --> 0:08:56,000
In 2014, I had the chance to travel with a respected religious leader

148
0:08:56.353,000 --> 0:08:59,000
from the Zuni tribe named Octavius Seowtewa

149
0:09:00.219,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to visit five museums in Europe with War Gods.

150
0:09:03.68,000 --> 0:09:05,000
At the Ethnological Museum of Berlin,

151
0:09:06.363,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we saw a War God with a history of dubious care.

152
0:09:10.443,000 --> 0:09:13,000
An overly enthusiastic curator had added chicken feathers to it.

153
0:09:14.922,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Its necklace had once been stolen.

154
0:09:18.267,000 --> 0:09:2,000
At the Musée du quai Branly in Paris,

155
0:09:20.34,000 --> 0:09:23,000
an official told us that the War God there is now state property

156
0:09:23.697,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with no provisions for repatriation.

157
0:09:26.554,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He insisted that the War God no longer served Zunis

158
0:09:29.49,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but museum visitors.

159
0:09:31.238,000 --> 0:09:34,000
He said, "We give all of the objects to the world."

160
0:09:35.487,000 --> 0:09:36,000
At the British Museum,

161
0:09:36.963,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we were warned that the Zuni case would establish a dangerous precedent

162
0:09:40.995,000 --> 0:09:41,000
for bigger disputes,

163
0:09:42.464,000 --> 0:09:45,000
such as the Parthenon Marbles, claimed by Greece.

164
0:09:46.574,000 --> 0:09:48,000
After visiting the five museums,

165
0:09:49.067,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Octavius returned home to his people empty-handed.

166
0:09:54.284,000 --> 0:09:55,000
He later told me,

167
0:09:55.618,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"It hurts my heart to see the Ahayu:da so far away.

168
0:09:58.943,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They all belong together.

169
0:10:01.066,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It's like a family member that's missing from a family dinner.

170
0:10:06.292,000 --> 0:10:09,000
When one is gone, their strength is broken."

171
0:10:10.848,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I wish that my colleagues in Europe and beyond

172
0:10:13.686,000 --> 0:10:16,000
could see that the War Gods do not represent the end of museums

173
0:10:17.187,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but the chance for a new beginning.

174
0:10:20.861,000 --> 0:10:22,000
When you walk the halls of a museum,

175
0:10:23.481,000 --> 0:10:25,000
you're likely just seeing about one percent

176
0:10:26.274,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of the total collections.

177
0:10:27.517,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The rest is in storage.

178
0:10:29.535,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Even after returning 500 cultural items and skeletons,

179
0:10:33.346,000 --> 0:10:38,000
my museum still retains 99.999 percent of its total collections.

180
0:10:39.987,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Though we no longer have War Gods,

181
0:10:41.671,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we have Zuni traditional pottery,

182
0:10:44.075,000 --> 0:10:47,000
jewelry, tools, clothing and arts.

183
0:10:48.461,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And even more precious than these objects

184
0:10:51.312,000 --> 0:10:54,000
are the relationships that we formed with Native Americans

185
0:10:54.669,000 --> 0:10:56,000
through the process of repatriation.

186
0:10:58.673,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Now, we can ask Zunis to share their culture with us.

187
0:11:04.81,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Not long ago, I had the chance to visit the returned War Gods.

188
0:11:09.263,000 --> 0:11:14,000
A shrine sits up high atop a mesa overlooking beautiful Zuni homeland.

189
0:11:16.466,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The shrine is enclosed by a roofless stone building

190
0:11:20.705,000 --> 0:11:22,000
threaded at the top with barbed wire

191
0:11:23.157,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to ensure that they're not stolen again.

192
0:11:26.553,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And there they are, inside,

193
0:11:28.918,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the Ahayu:da,

194
0:11:30.146,000 --> 0:11:35,000
106 War Gods amid offerings of turquoise, cornmeal, shell,

195
0:11:35.581,000 --> 0:11:36,000
even T-shirts ...

196
0:11:38.149,000 --> 0:11:39,000
a modern gift to ancient beings.

197
0:11:41.306,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And standing there,

198
0:11:43.045,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I got a glimpse at the War Gods' true purpose in the world.

199
0:11:47.518,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And it occurred to me then

200
0:11:49.185,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that we do not get to choose the histories that we inherit.

201
0:11:54.043,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Museum curators today did not pillage ancient graves

202
0:11:57.202,000 --> 0:11:58,000
or steal spiritual objects,

203
0:11:59.012,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but we can accept responsibility for correcting past mistakes.

204
0:12:04.232,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We can help restore dignity,

205
0:12:06.496,000 --> 0:12:09,000
hope and humanity to Native Americans,

206
0:12:09.957,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the very people who were once the voiceless objects of our curiosity.

207
0:12:14.4,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And this doesn't even require us to fully understand others' beliefs,

208
0:12:19.505,000 --> 0:12:21,000
only that we respect them.

209
0:12:22.732,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Museums are temples to things past.

210
0:12:26.406,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now they must also become places for living cultures.

211
0:12:32.466,000 --> 0:12:34,000
As I turned to walk away from the shrine,

212
0:12:34.76,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I drank in the warm summer air,

213
0:12:37.158,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and I watched an eagle turn lazy circles high above.

214
0:12:41.483,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I thought of the Zunis,

215
0:12:42.96,000 --> 0:12:46,000
whose offerings ensure that their culture is not dead and gone

216
0:12:47.179,000 --> 0:12:48,000
but alive and well,

217
0:12:49.97,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and I could think of no better place for the War Gods to be.

218
0:12:54.069,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Thank you.

219
0:12:55.244,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.7,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I just want to share with you

2
0:00:14.18,000 --> 0:00:16,000
what I have been experiencing over the last five years

3
0:00:16.78,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in having the great privilege of traveling

4
0:00:19.1,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to many of the poorest countries in the world.

5
0:00:21.34,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This scene is one I see all the time everywhere,

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and these young children are looking at a smartphone,

7
0:00:28.42,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and the smartphone is having a huge impact in even the poorest countries.

8
0:00:32.94,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I said to my team, you know,

9
0:00:34.58,000 --> 0:00:37,000
what I see is a rise in aspirations all over the world.

10
0:00:38.34,000 --> 0:00:41,000
In fact, it seems to me that there's a convergence of aspirations.

11
0:00:42.54,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I asked a team of economists to actually look into this.

12
0:00:46.18,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Is this true?

13
0:00:47.42,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Are aspirations converging all around the world?

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So they looked at things like Gallup polls about satisfaction in life

15
0:00:54.54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and what they learned was that if you have access to the internet,

16
0:00:59.02,000 --> 0:01:01,000
your satisfaction goes up.

17
0:01:01.14,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But another thing happens that's very important:

18
0:01:04.02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
your reference income,

19
0:01:05.94,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the income to which you compare your own,

20
0:01:08.62,000 --> 0:01:09,000
also goes up.

21
0:01:10.1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, if the reference income of a nation, for example,

22
0:01:13.54,000 --> 0:01:14,000
goes up 10 percent

23
0:01:14.94,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by comparing themselves to the outside,

24
0:01:17.18,000 --> 0:01:19,000
then on average,

25
0:01:19.46,000 --> 0:01:22,000
people's own incomes have to go up at least five percent

26
0:01:22.54,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to maintain the same level of satisfaction.

27
0:01:25.1,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But when you get down into the lower percentiles of income,

28
0:01:29.1,000 --> 0:01:31,000
your income has to go up much more

29
0:01:31.34,000 --> 0:01:33,000
if the reference income goes up 10 percent,

30
0:01:33.42,000 --> 0:01:34,000
something like 20 percent.

31
0:01:35.02,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And so with this rise of aspirations,

32
0:01:37.54,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the fundamental question is:

33
0:01:39.38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Are we going to have a situation

34
0:01:40.98,000 --> 0:01:43,000
where aspirations are linked to opportunity

35
0:01:44.18,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and you get dynamism and economic growth,

36
0:01:46.94,000 --> 0:01:49,000
like that which happened in the country I was born in, in Korea?

37
0:01:50.7,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Or are aspirations going to meet frustration?

38
0:01:55.74,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is a real concern, because between 2012 and 2015,

39
0:02:00.22,000 --> 0:02:02,000
terrorism incidents increased by 74 percent.

40
0:02:03.18,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The number of deaths from terrorism went up 150 percent.

41
0:02:07.46,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Right now, two billion people

42
0:02:09.34,000 --> 0:02:11,000
live in conditions of fragility, conflict, violence,

43
0:02:11.94,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and by 2030, more than 60 percent of the world's poor

44
0:02:17.42,000 --> 0:02:2,000
will live in these situations of fragility, conflict and violence.

45
0:02:21.38,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And so what do we do about meeting these aspirations?

46
0:02:24.34,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Are there new ways of thinking

47
0:02:26.06,000 --> 0:02:29,000
about how we can rise to meet these aspirations?

48
0:02:29.1,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Because if we don't, I'm extremely worried.

49
0:02:32.14,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Aspirations are rising as never before because of access to the internet.

50
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Everyone knows how everyone else lives.

51
0:02:39.02,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Has our ability to meet those aspirations

52
0:02:41.94,000 --> 0:02:42,000
risen as well?

53
0:02:43.38,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And just to get at the details of this,

54
0:02:45.34,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I want to share with you my own personal story.

55
0:02:47.78,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This is not my mother,

56
0:02:49.82,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but during the Korean War,

57
0:02:51.54,000 --> 0:02:53,000
my mother literally took her own sister,

58
0:02:54.02,000 --> 0:02:55,000
her younger sister, on her back,

59
0:02:55.94,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and walked at least part of the way

60
0:02:58.38,000 --> 0:03:,000
to escape Seoul during the Korean War.

61
0:03:02.1,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, through a series of miracles,

62
0:03:05.02,000 --> 0:03:09,000
my mother and father both got scholarships to go to New York City.

63
0:03:09.14,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They actually met in New York City and got married in New York City.

64
0:03:13.78,000 --> 0:03:15,000
My father, too, was a refugee.

65
0:03:16.02,000 --> 0:03:2,000
At the age of 19, he left his family in the northern part of the country,

66
0:03:20.42,000 --> 0:03:21,000
escaped through the border

67
0:03:22.1,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and never saw his family again.

68
0:03:24.46,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now, when they were married and living in New York,

69
0:03:27.62,000 --> 0:03:29,000
my father was a waiter at Patricia Murphy's restaurant.

70
0:03:30.58,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Their aspirations went up.

71
0:03:32.74,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They understood what it was like to live in a place like New York City

72
0:03:36.7,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in the 1950s.

73
0:03:38.58,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Well, my brother was born and they came back to Korea,

74
0:03:42.66,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we had what I remember as kind of an idyllic life,

75
0:03:46.7,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but what was happening in Korea at that time

76
0:03:49.18,000 --> 0:03:52,000
was the country was one of the poorest in the world

77
0:03:52.38,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and there was political upheaval.

78
0:03:54.02,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There were demonstrations just down the street from our house all the time,

79
0:03:57.58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
students protesting against the military government.

80
0:04:02.46,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And at the time,

81
0:04:04.5,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the aspirations of the World Bank Group, the organization I lead now,

82
0:04:07.98,000 --> 0:04:09,000
were extremely low for Korea.

83
0:04:10.86,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Their idea was that Korea would find it difficult without foreign aid

84
0:04:14.9,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to provide its people with more than the bare necessities of life.

85
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So the situation is Korea is in a tough position,

86
0:04:22.78,000 --> 0:04:24,000
my parents have seen what life is like in the United States.

87
0:04:25.66,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They got married there. My brother was born there.

88
0:04:28.06,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And they felt that in order to give us an opportunity

89
0:04:31.42,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to reach their aspirations for us,

90
0:04:34.02,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we had to go and come back to the United States.

91
0:04:36.38,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now, we came back.

92
0:04:38.7,000 --> 0:04:39,000
First we went to Dallas.

93
0:04:39.98,000 --> 0:04:41,000
My father did his dental degree all over again.

94
0:04:42.7,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And then we ended up moving to Iowa, of all places.

95
0:04:46.02,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We grew up in Iowa.

96
0:04:47.78,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And in Iowa, we went through the whole course.

97
0:04:50.18,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I went to high school, I went to college.

98
0:04:52.66,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And then one day, something that I'll never forget,

99
0:04:57.74,000 --> 0:05:01,000
my father picked me up after my sophomore year in college,

100
0:05:02.5,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and he was driving me home,

101
0:05:03.86,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and he said, "Jim, what are your aspirations?

102
0:05:06.02,000 --> 0:05:08,000
What do you want to study? What do you want to do?"

103
0:05:08.46,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I said, "Dad," --

104
0:05:09.7,000 --> 0:05:12,000
My mother actually was a philosopher, and had filled us with ideas

105
0:05:12.98,000 --> 0:05:14,000
about protest and social justice,

106
0:05:15.34,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I said, "Dad, I'm going to study political science and philosophy,

107
0:05:19.02,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and I'm going to become part of a political movement."

108
0:05:22.14,000 --> 0:05:23,000
My father, the Korean dentist,

109
0:05:23.82,000 --> 0:05:25,000
slowly pulled the car over to the side of the road --

110
0:05:26.34,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:28.02,000 --> 0:05:29,000
He looked back at me, and he said,

112
0:05:29.74,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"Jim, you finish your medical residency, you can study anything you want."

113
0:05:33.241,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:34.82,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now, I've told this story to a mostly Asian audience before.

115
0:05:39.78,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Nobody laughs. They just shake their head.

116
0:05:42.34,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Of course.

117
0:05:43.58,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:45.46,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Applause)

119
0:05:47.02,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So, tragically, my father died at a young age,

120
0:05:52.06,000 --> 0:05:54,000
30 years ago at the age of 57,

121
0:05:54.54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
what happens to be how old I am right now,

122
0:05:57.06,000 --> 0:06:,000
and when he died in the middle of my medical and graduate studies --

123
0:06:00.3,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You see, I actually got around it by doing medicine and anthropology.

124
0:06:03.74,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I studied both of them in graduate school.

125
0:06:08.7,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But then right about that time, I met these two people,

126
0:06:11.66,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.

127
0:06:13.78,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And Paul and I were in the same program.

128
0:06:15.82,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We were studying medicine

129
0:06:17.42,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and at the same time getting our PhD's in anthropology.

130
0:06:20.18,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And we began to ask some pretty fundamental questions.

131
0:06:23.02,000 --> 0:06:27,000
For people who have the great privilege of studying medicine and anthropology --

132
0:06:27.94,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I had come from parents who were refugees.

133
0:06:30.1,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Paul grew up literally in a bus in a swamp in Florida.

134
0:06:34.58,000 --> 0:06:36,000
He liked to call himself "white trash."

135
0:06:37.18,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And so we had this opportunity

136
0:06:40.1,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and we said,

137
0:06:41.34,000 --> 0:06:42,000
what is it that we need to do?

138
0:06:42.82,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Given our ridiculously elaborate educations,

139
0:06:45.58,000 --> 0:06:48,000
what is the nature of our responsibility to the world?

140
0:06:48.94,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And we decided that we needed to start an organization.

141
0:06:52.22,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's called Partners in Health.

142
0:06:53.74,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And by the way, there's a movie made about that.

143
0:06:56.02,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Applause)

144
0:06:58.9,000 --> 0:07:,000
There's a movie that was just a brilliant movie

145
0:07:01.14,000 --> 0:07:03,000
they made about it called "Bending the Arc."

146
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It launched at Sundance this past January.

147
0:07:05.7,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Jeff Skoll is here.

148
0:07:06.94,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Jeff is one of the ones who made it happen.

149
0:07:09.9,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And we began to think about what it would take for us

150
0:07:14.74,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to actually have our aspirations reach the level

151
0:07:18.34,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of some of the poorest communities in the world.

152
0:07:20.62,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is my very first visit to Haiti in 1988,

153
0:07:23.82,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and in 1988, we elaborated a sort of mission statement,

154
0:07:29.18,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which is we are going to make a preferential option for the poor

155
0:07:33.06,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in health.

156
0:07:34.3,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Now, it took us a long time, and we were graduate students in anthropology.

157
0:07:37.86,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We were reading up one side of Marx and down the other.

158
0:07:40.5,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Habermas. Fernand Braudel.

159
0:07:42.98,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We were reading everything

160
0:07:44.66,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and we had to come to a conclusion of how are we going to structure our work?

161
0:07:48.74,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So "O for the P," we called it,

162
0:07:50.62,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a preferential option for the poor.

163
0:07:53.38,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The most important thing about a preferential option for the poor

164
0:07:56.46,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is what it's not.

165
0:07:58.18,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's not a preferential option for your own sense of heroism.

166
0:08:02.46,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It's not a preferential option

167
0:08:03.94,000 --> 0:08:06,000
for your own idea about how to lift the poor out of poverty.

168
0:08:07.54,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's not a preferential option for your own organization.

169
0:08:10.46,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And the hardest of all,

170
0:08:12.38,000 --> 0:08:14,000
it's not a preferential option for your poor.

171
0:08:15.66,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's a preferential option for the poor.

172
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So what do you do?

173
0:08:19.7,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well, Haiti, we started building --

174
0:08:23.58,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing

175
0:08:25.86,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is just focus on vaccination and maybe a feeding program.

176
0:08:29.02,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But what the Haitians wanted was a hospital.

177
0:08:32.82,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They wanted schools.

178
0:08:34.1,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They wanted to provide their children with the opportunities

179
0:08:36.98,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that they'd been hearing about from others, relatives, for example,

180
0:08:41.02,000 --> 0:08:42,000
who had gone to the United States.

181
0:08:42.94,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They wanted the same kinds of opportunities as my parents did.

182
0:08:47.979,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I recognized them.

183
0:08:49.979,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And so that's what we did. We built hospitals.

184
0:08:52.18,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We provided education.

185
0:08:54.02,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And we did everything we could to try to give them opportunities.

186
0:08:57.46,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, my experience really became intense

187
0:09:00.14,000 --> 0:09:03,000
at Partners in Health in this community, Carabayllo,

188
0:09:03.42,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in the northern slums of Lima, Peru.

189
0:09:08.02,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And in this community,

190
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we started out by really just going to people's homes and talking to people,

191
0:09:12.9,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

192
0:09:18.18,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This is Melquiades.

193
0:09:19.46,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Melquiades was a patient at that time, he was about 18 years old,

194
0:09:24.3,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and he had a very difficult form of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

195
0:09:29.1,000 --> 0:09:31,000
All of the gurus in the world, the global health gurus,

196
0:09:31.9,000 --> 0:09:35,000
said it is not cost-effective to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.

197
0:09:36.74,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It's too complicated. It's too expensive.

198
0:09:38.717,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You just can't do it. It can't be done.

199
0:09:41.58,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And in addition, they were getting angry at us,

200
0:09:44.78,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because the implication was

201
0:09:46.34,000 --> 0:09:48,000
if it could be done, we would have done it.

202
0:09:48.74,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Who do you think you are?

203
0:09:50.46,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And the people that we fought with were the World Health Organization

204
0:09:53.74,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and probably the organization we fought with most

205
0:09:56.9,000 --> 0:09:57,000
was the World Bank Group.

206
0:09:58.46,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now, we did everything we could

207
0:10:02.7,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to convince Melquiades to take his medicines,

208
0:10:05.14,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because it's really hard,

209
0:10:06.66,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and not once during the time of treatment did Melquiades's family ever say,

210
0:10:10.54,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"Hey, you know, Melquiades is just not cost-effective.

211
0:10:13.78,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Why don't you go on and treat somebody else?"

212
0:10:15.94,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I hadn't seen Melquiades for about 10 years

214
0:10:19.54,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and when we had our annual meetings in Lima, Peru

215
0:10:22.66,000 --> 0:10:23,000
a couple of years ago,

216
0:10:24.22,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the filmmakers found him

217
0:10:26.46,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and here is us getting together.

218
0:10:28.42,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Applause)

219
0:10:35.38,000 --> 0:10:38,000
He has become a bit of a media star because he goes to the film openings,

220
0:10:38.9,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and he knows how to work an audience now.

221
0:10:41.22,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

222
0:10:43.1,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But as soon as we won --

223
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We did win. We won the argument.

224
0:10:47.1,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You should treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis --

225
0:10:49.98,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we heard the same arguments in the early 2000s about HIV.

226
0:10:53.94,000 --> 0:10:55,000
All of the leading global health people in the world said

227
0:10:56.86,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it is impossible to treat HIV in poor countries.

228
0:11:00.14,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Too expensive, too complicated, you can't do it.

229
0:11:02.62,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment,

230
0:11:04.58,000 --> 0:11:05,000
it's actually easier.

231
0:11:06.54,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And we were seeing patients like this.

232
0:11:09.5,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Joseph Jeune.

233
0:11:10.74,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Joseph Jeune also never mentioned that he was not cost-effective.

234
0:11:14.18,000 --> 0:11:16,000
A few months of medicines, and this is what he looked like.

235
0:11:17.02,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Applause)

236
0:11:19.46,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We call that the Lazarus Effect of HIV treatment.

237
0:11:21.98,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Joseline came to us looking like this.

238
0:11:24.3,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This is what she looked like a few months later.

239
0:11:26.58,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Applause)

240
0:11:29.3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Now, our argument, our battle, we thought,

241
0:11:32.9,000 --> 0:11:35,000
was with the organizations that kept saying it's not cost-effective.

242
0:11:36.9,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We were saying, no,

243
0:11:38.34,000 --> 0:11:41,000
preferential option for the poor requires us to raise our aspirations

244
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to meet those of the poor for themselves.

245
0:11:44.237,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And they said, well, that's a nice thought but it's just not cost-effective.

246
0:11:47.9,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So in the nerdy way that we have operated Partners in Health,

247
0:11:54.46,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we wrote a book against, basically, the World Bank.

248
0:11:57.18,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It says that because the World Bank

249
0:11:59.82,000 --> 0:12:02,000
has focused so much on just economic growth

250
0:12:03.7,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and said that governments have to shrink their budgets

251
0:12:07.5,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and reduce expenditures in health, education and social welfare --

252
0:12:11.58,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we thought that was fundamentally wrong.

253
0:12:13.58,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And we argued with the World Bank.

254
0:12:15.46,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And then a crazy thing happened.

255
0:12:17.78,000 --> 0:12:19,000
President Obama nominated me to be President of the World Bank.

256
0:12:20.78,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Applause)

257
0:12:26.78,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Now, when I went to do the vetting process with President Obama's team,

258
0:12:31.62,000 --> 0:12:34,000
they had a copy of "Dying For Growth," and they had read every page.

259
0:12:35.14,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And I said, "OK, that's it, right?

260
0:12:36.9,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You guys are going to drop me?"

261
0:12:38.46,000 --> 0:12:4,000
He goes, "Oh, no, no, it's OK."

262
0:12:40.9,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And I was nominated,

263
0:12:42.3,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and I walked through the door of the World Bank Group in July of 2012,

264
0:12:46.94,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and that statement on the wall, "Our dream is a world free of poverty."

265
0:12:50.34,000 --> 0:12:52,000
A few months after that, we actually turned it into a goal:

266
0:12:53.34,000 --> 0:12:55,000
end extreme poverty by 2030,

267
0:12:55.98,000 --> 0:12:56,000
boost shared prosperity.

268
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
That's what we do now at the World Bank Group.

269
0:12:59.46,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I feel like I have brought the preferential option for the poor

270
0:13:03.46,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to the World Bank Group.

271
0:13:04.86,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

272
0:13:10.3,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But this is TED,

273
0:13:11.58,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and so I want to share with you some concerns,

274
0:13:14.18,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and then make a proposal.

275
0:13:16.86,000 --> 0:13:17,000
The Fourth Industrial Revolution,

276
0:13:18.5,000 --> 0:13:2,000
now, you guys know so much better than I do,

277
0:13:20.62,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but here's the thing that concerns me.

278
0:13:22.5,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What we hear about is job loss. You've all heard that.

279
0:13:25.06,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Our own data suggest to us that two thirds of all jobs,

280
0:13:27.7,000 --> 0:13:29,000
currently existing jobs in developing countries,

281
0:13:29.963,000 --> 0:13:3,000
will be lost because of automation.

282
0:13:31.7,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.

283
0:13:33.86,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Now, one of the ways to make up for those jobs

284
0:13:36.06,000 --> 0:13:39,000
is to turn community health workers into a formal labor force.

285
0:13:39.74,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That's what we want to do.

286
0:13:41.02,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Applause)

287
0:13:42.3,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We think the numbers will work out,

288
0:13:44.66,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that as health outcomes get better and as people have formal work,

289
0:13:48.46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
we're going to be able to train them

290
0:13:50.22,000 --> 0:13:52,000
with the soft-skills training that you add to it

291
0:13:52.5,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to become workers that will have a huge impact,

292
0:13:56.06,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and that may be the one area that grows the most.

293
0:13:59.46,000 --> 0:14:01,000
But here's the other thing that bothers me:

294
0:14:02.06,000 --> 0:14:05,000
right now it seems pretty clear to me that the jobs of the future

295
0:14:05.98,000 --> 0:14:06,000
will be more digitally demanding,

296
0:14:07.86,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and there is a crisis in childhood stunting.

297
0:14:11.82,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So these are photos from Charles Nelson, who shared these with us

298
0:14:15.42,000 --> 0:14:16,000
from Harvard Medical School.

299
0:14:16.9,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And what these photos show on the one side, on the left side,

300
0:14:21.7,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is a three-month-old who has been stunted:

301
0:14:26.14,000 --> 0:14:28,000
not adequate nutrition, not adequate stimulation.

302
0:14:28.7,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And on the other side, of course, is a normal child,

303
0:14:31.3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and the normal child has all of these neuronal connections.

304
0:14:34.18,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Now, the neuronal connections are important,

305
0:14:36.66,000 --> 0:14:39,000
because that is the definition of human capital.

306
0:14:39.9,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Now, we know that we can reduce these rates.

307
0:14:43.62,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We can reduce these rates of childhood stunting quickly,

308
0:14:47.02,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but if we don't, India, for example, with 38 percent childhood stunting,

309
0:14:51.5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
how are they going to compete in the economy of the future

310
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
if 40 percent of their future workers cannot achieve educationally

311
0:15:00.14,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and certainly we worry about achieving economically

312
0:15:03.9,000 --> 0:15:06,000
in a way that will help the country as a whole grow.

313
0:15:07.7,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Now, what are we going to do?

314
0:15:10.34,000 --> 0:15:13,000
78 trillion dollars is the size of the global economy.

315
0:15:14.22,000 --> 0:15:17,000
8.55 trillion dollars are sitting in negative interest rate bonds.

316
0:15:18.14,000 --> 0:15:22,000
That means that you give the German central bank your money

317
0:15:22.62,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and then you pay them to keep your money.

318
0:15:25.14,000 --> 0:15:26,000
That's a negative interest rate bond.

319
0:15:26.98,000 --> 0:15:29,000
24.4 trillion dollars in very low-earning government bonds.

320
0:15:30.18,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And 8 trillion literally sitting in the hands of rich people

321
0:15:35.42,000 --> 0:15:36,000
under their very large mattresses.

322
0:15:37.86,000 --> 0:15:4,000
What we are trying to do is now use our own tools --

323
0:15:41.82,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and just to get nerdy for a second,

324
0:15:43.54,000 --> 0:15:45,000
we're talking about first-loss risk debt instruments,

325
0:15:46.06,000 --> 0:15:48,000
we're talking about derisking, blended finance,

326
0:15:48.66,000 --> 0:15:5,000
we're talking about political risk insurance,

327
0:15:51.18,000 --> 0:15:52,000
credit enhancement --

328
0:15:52.42,000 --> 0:15:54,000
all these things that I've now learned at the World Bank Group

329
0:15:55.38,000 --> 0:15:59,000
that rich people use every single day to make themselves richer,

330
0:15:59.54,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but we haven't used aggressively enough on behalf of the poor

331
0:16:03.3,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to bring this capital in.

332
0:16:04.94,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Applause)

333
0:16:12.1,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So does this work?

334
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Can you actually bring private-sector players into a country

335
0:16:19.1,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and really make things work?

336
0:16:20.5,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Well, we've done it a couple of times.

337
0:16:22.38,000 --> 0:16:24,000
This is Zambia, Scaling Solar.

338
0:16:24.62,000 --> 0:16:26,000
It's a box-set solution from the World Bank

339
0:16:26.82,000 --> 0:16:28,000
where we come in and we do all the things you need

340
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
to attract private-sector investors.

341
0:16:31.14,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And in this case, Zambia went from having a cost of electricity

342
0:16:35.74,000 --> 0:16:36,000
at 25 cents a kilowatt-hour,

343
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and by just doing simple things, doing the auction,

344
0:16:42.02,000 --> 0:16:43,000
changing some policies,

345
0:16:43.54,000 --> 0:16:45,000
we were able to bring the cost down.

346
0:16:46.54,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Lowest bid,

347
0:16:47.78,000 --> 0:16:49,000
25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?

348
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
The lowest bid was 4.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. It's possible.

349
0:16:54.46,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Applause)

350
0:16:56.62,000 --> 0:16:57,000
But here's my proposal for you.

351
0:16:58.58,000 --> 0:16:59,000
This is from a group called Zipline,

352
0:17:00.5,000 --> 0:17:02,000
a cool company, and they literally are rocket scientists.

353
0:17:03.38,000 --> 0:17:05,000
They figured out how to use drones in Rwanda.

354
0:17:05.82,000 --> 0:17:07,000
This is me launching a drone in Rwanda

355
0:17:08.06,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that delivers blood anywhere in the country

356
0:17:11.02,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in less than an hour.

357
0:17:12.58,000 --> 0:17:13,000
So we save lives,

358
0:17:14.06,000 --> 0:17:15,000
this program saved lives --

359
0:17:15.939,000 --> 0:17:16,000
(Applause)

360
0:17:16.98,000 --> 0:17:17,000
This program made money for Zipline

361
0:17:18.74,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and this program saved huge amounts of money for Rwanda.

362
0:17:22.78,000 --> 0:17:24,000
That's what we need, and we need that from all of you.

363
0:17:25.5,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I'm asking you, carve out a little bit of time in your brains

364
0:17:28.78,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to think about the technology that you work on,

365
0:17:31.38,000 --> 0:17:33,000
the companies that you start, the design that you do.

366
0:17:34.02,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Think a little bit and work with us

367
0:17:36.98,000 --> 0:17:4,000
to see if we can come up with these kinds of extraordinary win-win solutions.

368
0:17:41.3,000 --> 0:17:43,000
I'm going to leave you with one final story.

369
0:17:44.7,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I was in Tanzania, and I was in a classroom.

370
0:17:47.02,000 --> 0:17:5,000
This is me with a classroom of 11-year-olds.

371
0:17:51.3,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And I asked them, as I always do,

372
0:17:52.94,000 --> 0:17:54,000
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

373
0:17:55.02,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Two raised their hands and said,

374
0:17:56.78,000 --> 0:17:58,000
"I want to be President of the World Bank."

375
0:17:58.82,000 --> 0:17:59,000
(Laughter)

376
0:18:00.66,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And just like you, my own team and their teachers laughed.

377
0:18:04.1,000 --> 0:18:05,000
But then I stopped them.

378
0:18:05.66,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I said, "Look, I want to tell you a story.

379
0:18:08.86,000 --> 0:18:11,000
When I was born in South Korea, this is what it looked like.

380
0:18:13.1,000 --> 0:18:14,000
This is where I came from.

381
0:18:15.18,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And when I was three years old,

382
0:18:18.06,000 --> 0:18:19,000
in preschool,

383
0:18:20.14,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I don't think that George David Woods, the President of the World Bank,

384
0:18:23.54,000 --> 0:18:26,000
if he had visited Korea on that day and come to my classroom,

385
0:18:27.14,000 --> 0:18:28,000
that he would have thought

386
0:18:28.5,000 --> 0:18:3,000
that the future President of the World Bank

387
0:18:30.54,000 --> 0:18:31,000
was sitting in that classroom.

388
0:18:32.02,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Don't let anyone ever tell you

389
0:18:34.34,000 --> 0:18:36,000
that you cannot be President of the World Bank."

390
0:18:37.14,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Now -- thank you.

391
0:18:38.38,000 --> 0:18:39,000
(Applause)

392
0:18:39.98,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Let me leave you with one thought.

393
0:18:42.06,000 --> 0:18:44,000
I came from a country that was the poorest in the world.

394
0:18:44.74,000 --> 0:18:45,000
I'm President of the World Bank.

395
0:18:46.34,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I cannot and I will not pull up the ladder behind me.

396
0:18:49.54,000 --> 0:18:5,000
This is urgent.

397
0:18:51.1,000 --> 0:18:52,000
Aspirations are going up.

398
0:18:52.62,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Everywhere aspirations are going up.

399
0:18:54.94,000 --> 0:18:56,000
You folks in this room, work with us.

400
0:18:57.58,000 --> 0:19:01,000
We know that we can find those Zipline-type solutions

401
0:19:01.62,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and help the poor leapfrog into a better world,

402
0:19:04.94,000 --> 0:19:06,000
but it won't happen until we work together.

403
0:19:08.06,000 --> 0:19:1,000
The future "you" -- and especially for your children --

404
0:19:10.82,000 --> 0:19:11,000
the future you

405
0:19:12.42,000 --> 0:19:14,000
will depend on how much care and compassion we bring

406
0:19:15.42,000 --> 0:19:19,000
to ensuring that the future "us" provides equality of opportunity

407
0:19:20.06,000 --> 0:19:21,000
for every child in the world.

408
0:19:21.5,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Thank you very much.

409
0:19:22.78,000 --> 0:19:23,000
(Applause)

410
0:19:24.5,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

411
0:19:27.58,000 --> 0:19:3,000
(Applause)

412
0:19:32.86,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Chris Anderson: You'd almost think

413
0:19:34.54,000 --> 0:19:36,000
people are surprised to hear a talk like this

414
0:19:36.7,000 --> 0:19:37,000
from the President of the World Bank.

415
0:19:38.54,000 --> 0:19:39,000
It's kind of cool.

416
0:19:39.78,000 --> 0:19:42,000
I'd encourage you to even be a little more specific on your proposal.

417
0:19:43.06,000 --> 0:19:47,000
There's many investors, entrepreneurs in this room.

418
0:19:47.58,000 --> 0:19:49,000
How will you partner with them? What's your proposal?

419
0:19:50.1,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdy for just a second.

420
0:19:52.38,000 --> 0:19:54,000
CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely. JYK: So here's what we did.

421
0:19:54.98,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Insurance companies never invest in developing country infrastructure,

422
0:19:58.3,000 --> 0:20:,000
for example, because they can't take the risk.

423
0:20:00.5,000 --> 0:20:02,000
They're holding money for people who pay for insurance.

424
0:20:03.14,000 --> 0:20:06,000
So what we did was a Swedish International Development Association

425
0:20:06.3,000 --> 0:20:07,000
gave us a little bit of money,

426
0:20:07.78,000 --> 0:20:1,000
we went out and raised a little bit more money, a hundred million,

427
0:20:10.94,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and we took first loss, meaning if this thing goes bad,

428
0:20:13.58,000 --> 0:20:14,000
10 percent of the loss we'll just eat,

429
0:20:15.46,000 --> 0:20:16,000
and the rest of you will be safe.

430
0:20:17.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
And that created a 90-percent chunk, tranche

431
0:20:21.02,000 --> 0:20:24,000
that was triple B, investment-grade, so the insurance companies invested.

432
0:20:24.5,000 --> 0:20:28,000
So for us, what we're doing is taking our public money

433
0:20:29.14,000 --> 0:20:32,000
and using it to derisk specific instruments

434
0:20:32.7,000 --> 0:20:33,000
to bring people in from the outside.

435
0:20:34.46,000 --> 0:20:36,000
So all of you who are sitting on trillions of dollars of cash,

436
0:20:37.42,000 --> 0:20:38,000
come to us. Right?

437
0:20:38.66,000 --> 0:20:39,000
(Laughter)

438
0:20:39.7,000 --> 0:20:42,000
CA: And what you're specifically looking for are investment proposals

439
0:20:42.98,000 --> 0:20:44,000
that create employment in the developing world.

440
0:20:45.22,000 --> 0:20:46,000
JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.

441
0:20:46.62,000 --> 0:20:49,000
So these will be, for example, in infrastructure that brings energy,

442
0:20:50.38,000 --> 0:20:52,000
builds roads, bridges, ports.

443
0:20:52.86,000 --> 0:20:54,000
These kinds of things are necessary to create jobs,

444
0:20:55.62,000 --> 0:20:57,000
but also what we're saying is

445
0:20:57.94,000 --> 0:20:59,000
you may think that the technology you're working on

446
0:21:00.38,000 --> 0:21:01,000
or the business that you're working on

447
0:21:02.26,000 --> 0:21:05,000
may not have applications in the developing world,

448
0:21:05.34,000 --> 0:21:06,000
but look at Zipline.

449
0:21:06.7,000 --> 0:21:08,000
And that Zipline thing didn't happen

450
0:21:08.74,000 --> 0:21:1,000
just because of the quality of the technology.

451
0:21:10.94,000 --> 0:21:13,000
It was because they engaged with the Rwandans early

452
0:21:14.14,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and used artificial intelligence --

453
0:21:16.02,000 --> 0:21:18,000
one thing, Rwanda has great broadband --

454
0:21:18.9,000 --> 0:21:2,000
but these things fly completely on their own.

455
0:21:21.78,000 --> 0:21:23,000
So we will help you do that. We will make the introductions.

456
0:21:24.66,000 --> 0:21:26,000
We will even provide financing. We will help you do that.

457
0:21:27.38,000 --> 0:21:29,000
CA: How much capital is the World Bank willing to deploy

458
0:21:30.06,000 --> 0:21:31,000
to back those kinds of efforts?

459
0:21:31.62,000 --> 0:21:34,000
JYK: Chris, you're always getting me to try to do something like this.

460
0:21:34.94,000 --> 0:21:37,000
CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble. JYK: So here's what we're going to do.

461
0:21:38.54,000 --> 0:21:42,000
We have 25 billion a year that we're investing in poor countries,

462
0:21:43.3,000 --> 0:21:44,000
the poorest countries.

463
0:21:44.54,000 --> 0:21:46,000
And as we invest over the next three years,

464
0:21:46.62,000 --> 0:21:47,000
25 billion a year,

465
0:21:48.06,000 --> 0:21:49,000
we have got to think with you

466
0:21:49.94,000 --> 0:21:51,000
about how to use that money more effectively.

467
0:21:52.1,000 --> 0:21:55,000
So I can't give you a specific number. It depends on the quality of the ideas.

468
0:21:55.94,000 --> 0:21:56,000
So bring us your ideas,

469
0:21:57.5,000 --> 0:22:02,000
and I don't think that financing is going to be the problem.

470
0:22:03.22,000 --> 0:22:05,000
CA: All right, you heard it from the man himself.

471
0:22:05.58,000 --> 0:22:07,000
Jim, thanks so much. JYK: Thank you. Thank you.

472
0:22:07.82,000 --> 0:22:1,000
(Applause)

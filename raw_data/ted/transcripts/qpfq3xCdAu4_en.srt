1
0:00:12.825,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"Will the blight end the chestnut?

2
0:00:15.857,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The farmers rather guess not.

3
0:00:17.881,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It keeps smouldering at the roots

4
0:00:20.143,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And sending up new shoots

5
0:00:22.175,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Till another parasite

6
0:00:23.865,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Shall come to end the blight."

7
0:00:28.51,000 --> 0:00:3,000
At the beginning of the 20th century,

8
0:00:30.573,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the eastern American chestnut population, counting nearly four billion trees,

9
0:00:35.244,000 --> 0:00:38,000
was completely decimated by a fungal infection.

10
0:00:38.369,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Fungi are the most destructive pathogens of plants,

11
0:00:41.601,000 --> 0:00:43,000
including crops of major economic importance.

12
0:00:44.673,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Can you imagine that today,

13
0:00:46.258,000 --> 0:00:48,000
crop losses associated with fungal infection

14
0:00:49.149,000 --> 0:00:52,000
are estimated at billions of dollars per year, worldwide?

15
0:00:53.585,000 --> 0:00:56,000
That represents enough food calories to feed half a billion people.

16
0:00:57.609,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And this leads to severe repercussions,

17
0:00:59.991,000 --> 0:01:02,000
including episodes of famine in developing countries,

18
0:01:03.435,000 --> 0:01:06,000
large reduction of income for farmers and distributors,

19
0:01:06.863,000 --> 0:01:07,000
high prices for consumers

20
0:01:08.815,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and risk of exposure to mycotoxin, poison produced by fungi.

21
0:01:14.318,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The problems that we face

22
0:01:15.604,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is that the current method used to prevent and treat

23
0:01:18.345,000 --> 0:01:19,000
those dreadful diseases,

24
0:01:19.911,000 --> 0:01:23,000
such as genetic control, exploiting natural sources of resistance,

25
0:01:24.244,000 --> 0:01:27,000
crop rotation or seed treatment, among others,

26
0:01:27.649,000 --> 0:01:29,000
are still limited or ephemeral.

27
0:01:30.879,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They have to be constantly renewed.

28
0:01:33.323,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Therefore, we urgently need to develop more efficient strategies

29
0:01:37.601,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and for this, research is required to identify biological mechanisms

30
0:01:42.744,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that can be targeted by novel antifungal treatments.

31
0:01:49.529,000 --> 0:01:52,000
One feature of fungi is that they cannot move

32
0:01:52.687,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and only grow by extension to form a sophisticated network,

33
0:01:56.236,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the mycelium.

34
0:01:58.284,000 --> 0:02:02,000
In 1884, Anton de Bary, the father of plant pathology,

35
0:02:02.561,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was the first to presume that fungi are guided by signals

36
0:02:06.141,000 --> 0:02:07,000
sent out from the host plant,

37
0:02:08.101,000 --> 0:02:12,000
meaning a plant upon which it can lodge and subsist,

38
0:02:12.259,000 --> 0:02:14,000
so signals act as a lighthouse

39
0:02:14.641,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for fungi to locate, grow toward, reach

40
0:02:19.831,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and finally invade and colonize a plant.

41
0:02:23.427,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He knew that the identification of such signals

42
0:02:26.397,000 --> 0:02:3,000
would unlock a great knowledge that then serves to elaborate strategy

43
0:02:31.046,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to block the interaction between the fungus and the plant.

44
0:02:34.752,000 --> 0:02:37,000
However, the lack of an appropriate method at that moment

45
0:02:38.196,000 --> 0:02:42,000
prevented him from identifying this mechanism at the molecular level.

46
0:02:45.323,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Using purification and mutational genomic approaches,

47
0:02:48.474,000 --> 0:02:49,000
as well as a technique

48
0:02:50.022,000 --> 0:02:53,000
allowing the measurement of directed hyphal growth,

49
0:02:53.379,000 --> 0:02:57,000
today I'm glad to tell you that after 130 years,

50
0:02:57.768,000 --> 0:03:01,000
my former team and I could finally identify such plant signals

51
0:03:02.616,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by studying the interaction between a pathogenic fungus

52
0:03:05.997,000 --> 0:03:06,000
called Fusarium oxysporum

53
0:03:07.704,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and one of its host plants, the tomato plant.

54
0:03:12.31,000 --> 0:03:13,000
As well, we could characterize

55
0:03:14.085,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the fungal receptor receiving those signals

56
0:03:17.024,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and part of the underlying reaction occurring within the fungus

57
0:03:20.744,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and leading to its direct growth toward the plant.

58
0:03:24.879,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Applause)

59
0:03:27.577,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Thank you.

60
0:03:28.752,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Applause)

61
0:03:30.03,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The understanding of such molecular processes

62
0:03:32.817,000 --> 0:03:34,000
offers a panel of potential molecules

63
0:03:35.339,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that can be used to create novel antifungal treatments.

64
0:03:39.606,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And those treatments would disrupt

65
0:03:42.026,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the interaction between the fungus and the plant

66
0:03:44.789,000 --> 0:03:46,000
either by blocking the plant signal

67
0:03:47.511,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or the fungal reception system which receives those signals.

68
0:03:51.876,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Fungal infections have devastated agriculture crops.

69
0:03:55.066,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Moreover, we are now in an era

70
0:03:57.812,000 --> 0:04:,000
where the demand of crop production is increasing significantly.

71
0:04:01.387,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And this is due to population growth, economic development,

72
0:04:05.276,000 --> 0:04:07,000
climate change and demand for bio fuels.

73
0:04:08.751,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Our understanding of the molecular mechanism

74
0:04:11.847,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of interaction between a fungus and its host plant,

75
0:04:14.903,000 --> 0:04:15,000
such as the tomato plant,

76
0:04:16.633,000 --> 0:04:21,000
potentially represents a major step towards developing more efficient strategy

77
0:04:21.998,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to combat plant fungal diseases

78
0:04:24.393,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and therefore solving of problems that affect people's lives,

79
0:04:27.942,000 --> 0:04:29,000
food security and economic growth.

80
0:04:30.418,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Thank you.

81
0:04:31.594,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Applause)

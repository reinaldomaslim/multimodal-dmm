1
0:00:13.135,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've been a police officer in an urban city

2
0:00:16.516,000 --> 0:00:17,000
for nearly 25 years.

3
0:00:18.992,000 --> 0:00:19,000
That's crazy, right?

4
0:00:21.54,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And in that time, I've served in every rank,

5
0:00:24.626,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from police officer to police chief.

6
0:00:28.347,000 --> 0:00:31,000
A few years ago, I noticed something alarming.

7
0:00:32.442,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Starting in 2014,

8
0:00:34.236,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I started monitoring recruits

9
0:00:35.945,000 --> 0:00:38,000
as they cycled through police academies in the state of New Jersey,

10
0:00:39.95,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I found that women were failing at rates between 65 and 80 percent,

11
0:00:45.593,000 --> 0:00:48,000
due to varying aspects of the physical fitness test.

12
0:00:49.482,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I learned that a change in policy

13
0:00:51.106,000 --> 0:00:54,000
now required recruits to pass the fitness exam

14
0:00:54.403,000 --> 0:00:56,000
within 10 short workout sessions.

15
0:00:57.276,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This had the greatest impact on women.

16
0:01:00.447,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The change meant that recruits had about three weeks

17
0:01:03.518,000 --> 0:01:04,000
out of a five-month-long academy

18
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to pass the fitness exam.

19
0:01:07.82,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This just didn't make sense, though.

20
0:01:10.617,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Police agencies and police recruits

21
0:01:13.196,000 --> 0:01:16,000
had made huge investments to get those recruits into the academy.

22
0:01:17.986,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Police recruits had passed lengthy background checks,

23
0:01:21.273,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they had passed medical and psychological exams,

24
0:01:24.487,000 --> 0:01:25,000
they had quit their jobs.

25
0:01:26.495,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And many had spent more than 2,000 dollars in fees and equipment

26
0:01:30.458,000 --> 0:01:33,000
just to get kicked out within the first three weeks?

27
0:01:34.165,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The dire situation in New Jersey

28
0:01:36.006,000 --> 0:01:38,000
led me to examine the status of women in policing

29
0:01:38.612,000 --> 0:01:39,000
across the United States.

30
0:01:40.89,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I found that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers.

31
0:01:45.898,000 --> 0:01:48,000
A number that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years.

32
0:01:50.303,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And they make up just three percent of police chiefs as of 2013,

33
0:01:54.873,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the last time the data was collected.

34
0:01:58.23,000 --> 0:02:,000
We know that we can improve those rates.

35
0:02:01.458,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Other countries like Canada, Australia and the UK

36
0:02:04.934,000 --> 0:02:06,000
have nearly twice the amount of policewomen.

37
0:02:07.839,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And New Zealand is steadily marching towards their goal

38
0:02:12.252,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of recruit gender parity by 2021.

39
0:02:15.942,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Other countries are actively working

40
0:02:18.061,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to increase the number of women in policing,

41
0:02:20.514,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because they know of a vast body of research evidence,

42
0:02:23.752,000 --> 0:02:24,000
spanning more than 50 years,

43
0:02:25.76,000 --> 0:02:28,000
detailing the advantages to women in policing.

44
0:02:29.434,000 --> 0:02:3,000
From that research,

45
0:02:31.014,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we know that policewomen are less likely to use force

46
0:02:34.482,000 --> 0:02:36,000
or to be accused of excessive force.

47
0:02:37.49,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We know that policewomen are less likely to be named in a lawsuit

48
0:02:41.491,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or a citizen complaint.

49
0:02:43.625,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We know that the mere presence of a policewoman

50
0:02:46.117,000 --> 0:02:48,000
reduces the use of force among other officers.

51
0:02:49.561,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And we know that policewomen are met with the same rates of force

52
0:02:53.022,000 --> 0:02:56,000
as their male counterparts, and sometimes more,

53
0:02:56.315,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and yet they're more successful

54
0:02:57.898,000 --> 0:03:,000
in defusing violent or aggressive behavior overall.

55
0:03:01.458,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So there are vast advantages to women in policing,

56
0:03:04.53,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and we're losing them to arbitrary fitness standards.

57
0:03:08.668,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The problem is,

58
0:03:10.017,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the United States has nearly 18,000 police agencies --

59
0:03:13.889,000 --> 0:03:17,000
18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standards.

60
0:03:19.053,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We know that a majority of academies rely on a masculine ideal of policing

61
0:03:23.776,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that works to decrease the number of women in policing.

62
0:03:27.363,000 --> 0:03:3,000
These types of academies overemphasize physical strength,

63
0:03:30.728,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with much less attention spent to subjects like community policing,

64
0:03:35.212,000 --> 0:03:36,000
problem-solving

65
0:03:36.402,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and interpersonal communication skills.

66
0:03:39.665,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing.

67
0:03:44.729,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Physical agility is but a small component of police work.

68
0:03:48.34,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Much of an officer's day is spent mediating interpersonal conflicts.

69
0:03:52.527,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That's the reality of policing.

70
0:03:57.488,000 --> 0:03:58,000
These are my babies.

71
0:03:59.691,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And we can reduce the disparity in policing

72
0:04:03.188,000 --> 0:04:06,000
by changing exams that produce disparate outcomes.

73
0:04:08.03,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The federal courts have stated that men and women

74
0:04:10.369,000 --> 0:04:11,000
simply are not physiologically the same

75
0:04:12.268,000 --> 0:04:14,000
for the purposes of physical fitness programs.

76
0:04:15.236,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And that's based on science.

77
0:04:17.965,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Respected institutions that law enforcement deeply respects,

78
0:04:22.195,000 --> 0:04:24,000
like the FBI, the US Marshals Service,

79
0:04:24.917,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the DEA and even the US military --

80
0:04:28.406,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they rigorously test fitness programs to ensure they measure fitness

81
0:04:32.855,000 --> 0:04:34,000
without gender-disparate outcomes.

82
0:04:35.307,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Why is that?

83
0:04:37.006,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Because recruiting is expensive.

84
0:04:39.323,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They want to recruit and retain qualified candidates.

85
0:04:43.791,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You know what else the research finds?

86
0:04:46.173,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Well-trained women are as capable as their male counterparts

87
0:04:50.514,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in overall fitness,

88
0:04:51.958,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but more importantly, in how they police.

89
0:04:56.014,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The law-enforcement community

90
0:04:57.458,000 --> 0:05:,000
is admittedly experiencing a recruitment crisis.

91
0:05:00.744,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Yet, if they truly want to increase the number of applicants, they can.

92
0:05:07.296,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We can easily recruit more women

93
0:05:10.645,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and reap all those research benefits

94
0:05:13.479,000 --> 0:05:17,000
by training well-qualified candidates to pass validated, work-related,

95
0:05:18.415,000 --> 0:05:21,000
physiologically-based fitness exams,

96
0:05:21.561,000 --> 0:05:24,000
as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

97
0:05:26.03,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We can increase the number of women,

98
0:05:28.512,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we can reduce that gender disparity,

99
0:05:31.141,000 --> 0:05:34,000
by simply changing exams that produce disparate outcomes.

100
0:05:35.402,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We have the tools.

101
0:05:36.989,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We have the research, we have the science, we have the law.

102
0:05:40.552,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This, my friends, should be a very easy fix.

103
0:05:45.068,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Thank you.

104
0:05:46.261,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Applause)

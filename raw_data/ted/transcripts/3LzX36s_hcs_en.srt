1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Under a tree she saw a woman

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
meditating furiously.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.

6
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.

7
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Just then, with a loud bang,

8
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the heavens opened. (Claps)

9
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.

10
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.

11
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Ah-hah.

12
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The woman paid him no heed.

13
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,

14
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and proceeded to rape her.

15
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!)

16
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.

17
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
He realized at once what had happened.

18
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So, he petitioned the higher gods

19
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
so that he may have justice.

20
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, the god Vishnu arrived.

21
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"Are there any witnesses?"

22
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.

23
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, the one-eyed monkey

24
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,

25
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so she retold events exactly as they had happened.

26
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Vishnu gave his judgment.

27
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"The god Indra has sinned,

28
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.

29
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
May he be called to wash away his sins."

30
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, Indra arrived,

31
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and performed the sacrifice of the horse.

32
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And so it transpired

33
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that a horse was killed,

34
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a god was made sin-free,

35
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
a Brahmin's ego was appeased,

36
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a woman ... was ruined,

37
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and a one-eyed monkey was left ...

38
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
very confused at what we humans call justice.

39
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In India there is a rape every three minutes.

40
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In India, only 25 percent of rapes

41
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
come to a police station,

42
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and of these 25 percent that come to a police station,

43
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
convictions are only in four percent of the cases.

44
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.

45
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And it's not only about women.

46
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Look around you, look at your own countries.

47
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.

48
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.

49
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,

50
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
our tribals, the Naxalites.

51
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.

52
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
There is a trend here.

53
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,

54
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
always get to tell their truth as The Truth.

55
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So, have we all become

56
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?

57
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Have we stopped seeing injustice?

58
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Good morning.

59
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Applause)

60
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You know, I have told this story

61
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
close to 550 times,

62
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in audiences in 40 countries,

63
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,

64
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and every time it hits something.

65
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now, if I were to go into the same crowd

66
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"

67
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
they would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."

68
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And that is the astonishing power of art.

69
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Art can go through where other things can't.

70
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,

71
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
breaks through everything that you have as your mask,

72
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."

73
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
No. It breaks through those.

74
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.

75
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,

76
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we need a language that reaches through.

77
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner

78
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.

79
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop

80
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.

81
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,

82
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,

83
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
they also know the power of the arts.

84
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
For me it came very early.

85
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,

86
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
came upon a phenomenon that worried her.

87
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It was a phenomenon where young brides

88
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
were committing suicide in rural Gujarat,

89
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.

90
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.

91
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"

92
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
She told him and he set out the first inquiry

93
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
into what today we call Dowry Dance.

94
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Imagine a dance piece

95
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for the first inquiry into something

96
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that even today kills thousands of women.

97
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook

98
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist

99
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
called Draupadi, I had similar experiences.

100
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Big fat black mamas in the Bronx

101
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
used to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"

102
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,

103
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"

104
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then aboriginal women in Africa

105
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
would come and say, "This is it!"

106
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And I thought, "This is what we need,

107
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as a language."

108
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.

109
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Well, millions of people around the world die

110
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of waterborne disease every year.

111
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And that's because there is no clean water to drink,

112
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
or in countries like India,

113
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.

114
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So, what do they do?

115
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They drink the water they know is dirty,

116
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice

117
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and they die.

118
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.

119
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.

120
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.

121
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So what do you do? Do you let them die?

122
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Well, somebody had a great idea.

123
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody

124
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but would help health in every field.

125
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Most houses in Asia and India

126
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
have a cotton garment.

127
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,

128
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,

129
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.

130
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?

131
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?

132
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Because there is no profit in it.

133
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Because nobody can get a kickback.

134
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But it still needs to get to people.

135
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.

136
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.

137
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Man: You know how expensive those are.

138
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I have a solution that requires neither machine,

139
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
nor wood, nor cooking gas.

140
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Woman: What solution?

141
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.

142
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.

143
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait.

144
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Woman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.

145
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Man: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.

146
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Woman: All right, father.

147
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)

148
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Man: One, two, three, four folds we make.

149
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
All the germs from the water we take.

150
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.

151
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
All the germs from the water we take.

152
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.

153
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Our drinking water safe we make.

154
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.

155
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Our drinking water safe we make.

156
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Woman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.

157
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Man: So this is the cotton sari.

158
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And through this we will have clean water.

159
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

160
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I think it's safe to say that all of us here

161
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.

162
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,

163
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,

164
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,

165
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
or whether it's domestic violence,

166
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her

167
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.

168
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, why are we not doing something

169
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?

170
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
What are we doing to try and make children

171
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and young people realize

172
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that violence is something that we indulge in,

173
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that we can stop,

174
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and that there are other ways of actually

175
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations

176
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
into different things that do not harm other people.

177
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Well, here is one such way.

178
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.

179
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Your parents were peaceful people.

180
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Your grandparents were peaceful people.

181
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So much peace in one place?

182
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
How could it be otherwise?

183
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Music)

184
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But, what if ...

185
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Yes. What if ...

186
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
One little gene in you

187
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
has been trying to get through?

188
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
From your beginnings in Africa,

189
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
through each generation, may be passed on to you,

190
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.

191
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.

192
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's what made you smack your baby brother,

193
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.

194
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,

195
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.

196
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work,

197
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.

198
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown,

199
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.

200
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.

201
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.

202
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.

203
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.

204
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.

205
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.

206
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln.

207
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.

208
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Goodbye, Martin Luther King.

209
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Hello, gangs from this neighborhood

210
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
killing gangs from that neighborhood.

211
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Hello governments of rich countries

212
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
selling arms to governments of poor countries

213
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
who can't even afford to give them food.

214
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.

215
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Look what we've ...

216
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
look what they've done.

217
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

218
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Mainstream art, cinema,

219
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
has been used across the world to talk about social issues.

220
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,

221
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
which suddenly spawned thousands of young people

222
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
wanting to volunteer for social change.

223
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
In Venezuela, one of the most popular

224
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
soap operas has a heroine called Crystal.

225
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,

226
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.

227
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.

228
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And there are stand-up comics

229
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.

230
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So, why is it,

231
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that if we think that we all agree

232
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that we need a better world,

233
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
we need a more just world,

234
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
why is it that we are not using the one language

235
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that has consistently showed us

236
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?

237
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
What I need to say to the planners of the world,

238
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the governments, the strategists

239
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
is, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.

240
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It needs to be the yeast."

241
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Because, any future planning,

242
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
if 2048 is when we want to get there,

243
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
unless the arts are put with the scientists,

244
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
with the economists,

245
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
with all those who prepare for the future, badly,

246
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
we're not going to get there.

247
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.

248
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?

249
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We need to break down our vision

250
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
of what planners are,

251
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of what the correct way of a path is.

252
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And to say all these years of trying

253
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to make a better world, and we have failed.

254
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
There are more people being raped. There are more wars.

255
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
There are more people dying of simple things.

256
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So, something has got to give. And that is what I want.

257
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Can I have my last audio track please?

258
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.

259
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Whistling)

260
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Her father the king said, "Don't whistle."

261
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."

262
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But the princess continued whistling.

263
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Whistling)

264
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
The years went by and the princess grew up

265
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
into a beautiful young woman,

266
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
who whistled even more beautifully.

267
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Whistling)

268
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Her father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"

269
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"

270
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But the king had an idea.

271
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
He announced a Swayamvara.

272
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.

273
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom

274
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and her hand in marriage!"

275
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.

276
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
(Whistling)

277
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Some whistled badly.

278
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Some whistled well.

279
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
But nobody could defeat the princess.

280
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
"Now what shall we do?" said the king.

281
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.

282
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.

283
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men

284
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and I am going to ask them

285
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
if they defeated correctly.

286
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."

287
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?"

288
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?

289
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."

290
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Till finally one prince said,

291
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."

292
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
"Uh-huh ..." she said.

293
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."

294
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Whistling)

295
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thank you.

296
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Most of us go through life trying to do our best at whatever we do,

2
0:00:16.62,000 --> 0:00:18,000
whether it's our job, family, school

3
0:00:19.22,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or anything else.

4
0:00:21.06,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I feel that way. I try my best.

5
0:00:23.74,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But some time ago, I came to a realization

6
0:00:26.66,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that I wasn't getting much better at the things I cared most about,

7
0:00:30.46,000 --> 0:00:33,000
whether it was being a husband or a friend

8
0:00:33.66,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or a professional or teammate,

9
0:00:35.9,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I wasn't improving much at those things

10
0:00:37.94,000 --> 0:00:39,000
even though I was spending a lot of time

11
0:00:40.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
working hard at them.

12
0:00:43.02,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I've since realized from conversations I've had and from research

13
0:00:46.42,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that this stagnation, despite hard work,

14
0:00:49.1,000 --> 0:00:5,000
turns out to be pretty common.

15
0:00:50.86,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I'd like to share with you some insights into why that is

16
0:00:53.74,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and what we can all do about it.

17
0:00:55.98,000 --> 0:00:57,000
What I've learned is that the most effective people

18
0:00:58.5,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and teams in any domain

19
0:01:00.5,000 --> 0:01:01,000
do something we can all emulate.

20
0:01:02.82,000 --> 0:01:06,000
They go through life deliberately alternating between two zones:

21
0:01:06.9,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the learning zone and the performance zone.

22
0:01:09.98,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The learning zone is when our goal is to improve.

23
0:01:12.66,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Then we do activities designed for improvement,

24
0:01:15.78,000 --> 0:01:17,000
concentrating on what we haven't mastered yet,

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which means we have to expect to make mistakes,

26
0:01:20.74,000 --> 0:01:21,000
knowing that we will learn from them.

27
0:01:22.98,000 --> 0:01:25,000
That is very different from what we do when we're in our performance zone,

28
0:01:26.74,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which is when our goal is to do something as best as we can, to execute.

29
0:01:31.06,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Then we concentrate on what we have already mastered

30
0:01:33.7,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we try to minimize mistakes.

31
0:01:36.66,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Both of these zones should be part of our lives,

32
0:01:39.1,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but being clear about when we want to be in each of them,

33
0:01:42.38,000 --> 0:01:44,000
with what goal, focus and expectations,

34
0:01:44.7,000 --> 0:01:46,000
helps us better perform and better improve.

35
0:01:47.54,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The performance zone maximizes our immediate performance,

36
0:01:50.5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
while the learning zone maximizes our growth

37
0:01:52.62,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and our future performance.

38
0:01:55.14,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The reason many of us don't improve much

39
0:01:57.22,000 --> 0:01:58,000
despite our hard work

40
0:01:58.98,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is that we tend to spend almost all of our time in the performance zone.

41
0:02:03.7,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This hinders our growth,

42
0:02:05.1,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and ironically, over the long term, also our performance.

43
0:02:09.86,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So what does the learning zone look like?

44
0:02:12.58,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Take Demosthenes, a political leader

45
0:02:14.62,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the greatest orator and lawyer in ancient Greece.

46
0:02:18.06,000 --> 0:02:21,000
To become great, he didn't spend all his time

47
0:02:21.739,000 --> 0:02:23,000
just being an orator or a lawyer,

48
0:02:24.18,000 --> 0:02:26,000
which would be his performance zone.

49
0:02:26.38,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But instead, he did activities designed for improvement.

50
0:02:29.42,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Of course, he studied a lot.

51
0:02:30.82,000 --> 0:02:32,000
He studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors,

52
0:02:33.66,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people,

53
0:02:38.22,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so he also studied great speeches

54
0:02:40.62,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and acting.

55
0:02:42.46,000 --> 0:02:46,000
To get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder,

56
0:02:46.78,000 --> 0:02:48,000
he practiced his speeches in front of a mirror,

57
0:02:49.22,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and he suspended a sword from the ceiling

58
0:02:52.22,000 --> 0:02:53,000
so that if he raised his shoulder,

59
0:02:53.98,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it would hurt.

60
0:02:55.22,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:56.86,000 --> 0:02:58,000
To speak more clearly despite a lisp,

62
0:02:59.02,000 --> 0:03:01,000
he went through his speeches with stones in his mouth.

63
0:03:02.66,000 --> 0:03:03,000
He built an underground room

64
0:03:04.06,000 --> 0:03:06,000
where he could practice without interruptions

65
0:03:06.22,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and not disturb other people.

66
0:03:07.66,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And since courts at the time were very noisy,

67
0:03:09.82,000 --> 0:03:1,000
he also practiced by the ocean,

68
0:03:11.7,000 --> 0:03:13,000
projecting his voice above the roar of the waves.

69
0:03:15.22,000 --> 0:03:16,000
His activities in the learning zone

70
0:03:16.94,000 --> 0:03:18,000
were very different from his activities in court,

71
0:03:19.46,000 --> 0:03:2,000
his performance zone.

72
0:03:21.58,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In the learning zone,

73
0:03:22.82,000 --> 0:03:24,000
he did what Dr. Anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice.

74
0:03:25.62,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This involves breaking down abilities into component skills,

75
0:03:29.18,000 --> 0:03:31,000
being clear about what subskill we're working to improve,

76
0:03:32.1,000 --> 0:03:33,000
like keeping our shoulders down,

77
0:03:34.1,000 --> 0:03:36,000
giving full concentration to a high level of challenge

78
0:03:36.98,000 --> 0:03:37,000
outside our comfort zone,

79
0:03:38.42,000 --> 0:03:4,000
just beyond what we can currently do,

80
0:03:40.78,000 --> 0:03:43,000
using frequent feedback with repetition and adjustments,

81
0:03:44.02,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and ideally engaging the guidance of a skilled coach,

82
0:03:47.02,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because activities designed for improvement

83
0:03:49.1,000 --> 0:03:5,000
are domain-specific,

84
0:03:50.38,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and great teachers and coaches know what those activities are

85
0:03:53.3,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and can also give us expert feedback.

86
0:03:55.78,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It is this type of practice in the learning zone

87
0:03:58.5,000 --> 0:03:59,000
which leads to substantial improvement,

88
0:04:00.42,000 --> 0:04:02,000
not just time on task performing.

89
0:04:03.78,000 --> 0:04:06,000
For example, research shows that after the first couple of years

90
0:04:06.98,000 --> 0:04:07,000
working in a profession,

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
performance usually plateaus.

92
0:04:10.62,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This has been shown to be true in teaching, general medicine,

93
0:04:13.7,000 --> 0:04:14,000
nursing and other fields,

94
0:04:15.42,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and it happens because once we think we have become good enough,

95
0:04:19.18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
adequate,

96
0:04:20.42,000 --> 0:04:22,000
then we stop spending time in the learning zone.

97
0:04:22.7,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We focus all our time on just doing our job,

98
0:04:24.9,000 --> 0:04:25,000
performing,

99
0:04:26.14,000 --> 0:04:28,000
which turns out not to be a great way to improve.

100
0:04:28.98,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But the people who continue to spend time in the learning zone

101
0:04:31.94,000 --> 0:04:33,000
do continue to always improve.

102
0:04:34.1,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The best salespeople at least once a week

103
0:04:36.54,000 --> 0:04:38,000
do activities with the goal of improvement.

104
0:04:39.18,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They read to extend their knowledge,

105
0:04:40.98,000 --> 0:04:42,000
consult with colleagues or domain experts,

106
0:04:43.42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
try out new strategies, solicit feedback and reflect.

107
0:04:47.18,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The best chess players

108
0:04:48.82,000 --> 0:04:51,000
spend a lot of time not playing games of chess,

109
0:04:52.38,000 --> 0:04:53,000
which would be their performance zone,

110
0:04:54.34,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them.

111
0:04:58.74,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Each of us has probably spent many, many, many hours

112
0:05:02.86,000 --> 0:05:03,000
typing on a computer

113
0:05:04.42,000 --> 0:05:05,000
without getting faster,

114
0:05:06.02,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day

115
0:05:09.46,000 --> 0:05:12,000
fully concentrating on typing 10 to 20 percent faster

116
0:05:12.66,000 --> 0:05:13,000
than our current reliable speed,

117
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we would get faster,

118
0:05:15.54,000 --> 0:05:18,000
especially if we also identified what mistakes we're making

119
0:05:18.58,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and practiced typing those words.

120
0:05:21.22,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That's deliberate practice.

121
0:05:24.1,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In what other parts of our lives,

122
0:05:25.86,000 --> 0:05:26,000
perhaps that we care more about,

123
0:05:27.58,000 --> 0:05:29,000
are we working hard but not improving much

124
0:05:30.14,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because we're always in the performance zone?

125
0:05:34.38,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now, this is not to say that the performance zone has no value.

126
0:05:37.38,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It very much does.

127
0:05:38.62,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When I needed a knee surgery, I didn't tell the surgeon,

128
0:05:41.3,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"Poke around in there and focus on what you don't know."

129
0:05:43.98,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:45.02,000 --> 0:05:46,000
"We'll learn from your mistakes!"

131
0:05:47.5,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I looked for a surgeon who I felt would do a good job,

132
0:05:50.78,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and I wanted her to do a good job.

133
0:05:52.98,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Being in the performance zone

134
0:05:54.42,000 --> 0:05:56,000
allows us to get things done as best as we can.

135
0:05:57.62,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It can also be motivating,

136
0:05:59.02,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and it provides us with information to identify what to focus on next

137
0:06:02.62,000 --> 0:06:04,000
when we go back to the learning zone.

138
0:06:04.94,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So the way to high performance

139
0:06:06.66,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is to alternate between the learning zone and the performance zone,

140
0:06:10.38,000 --> 0:06:12,000
purposefully building our skills in the learning zone,

141
0:06:12.94,000 --> 0:06:14,000
then applying those skills in the performance zone.

142
0:06:16.38,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When Beyoncé is on tour,

143
0:06:18.42,000 --> 0:06:21,000
during the concert, she's in her performance zone,

144
0:06:21.62,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but every night when she gets back to the hotel room,

145
0:06:24.14,000 --> 0:06:26,000
she goes right back into her learning zone.

146
0:06:26.38,000 --> 0:06:28,000
She watches a video of the show that just ended.

147
0:06:29.18,000 --> 0:06:31,000
She identifies opportunities for improvement,

148
0:06:31.34,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for herself, her dancers and her camera staff.

149
0:06:33.98,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And the next morning,

150
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
everyone receives pages of notes with what to adjust,

151
0:06:38.34,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which they then work on during the day before the next performance.

152
0:06:42.34,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It's a spiral

153
0:06:43.58,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to ever-increasing capabilities,

154
0:06:45.18,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but we need to know when we seek to learn, and when we seek to perform,

155
0:06:48.82,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and while we want to spend time doing both,

156
0:06:50.9,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the more time we spend in the learning zone,

157
0:06:53.02,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the more we'll improve.

158
0:06:55.18,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So how can we spend more time in the learning zone?

159
0:06:58.86,000 --> 0:07:01,000
First, we must believe and understand

160
0:07:02.06,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that we can improve,

161
0:07:03.42,000 --> 0:07:04,000
what we call a growth mindset.

162
0:07:05.66,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Second, we must want to improve at that particular skill.

163
0:07:08.94,000 --> 0:07:09,000
There has to be a purpose we care about,

164
0:07:10.9,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because it takes time and effort.

165
0:07:13.18,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Third, we must have an idea about how to improve,

166
0:07:16.22,000 --> 0:07:17,000
what we can do to improve,

167
0:07:17.94,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not how I used to practice the guitar as a teenager,

168
0:07:20.54,000 --> 0:07:22,000
performing songs over and over again,

169
0:07:22.66,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but doing deliberate practice.

170
0:07:24.78,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And fourth, we must be in a low-stakes situation,

171
0:07:28.98,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because if mistakes are to be expected,

172
0:07:31.22,000 --> 0:07:34,000
then the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic,

173
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or even very significant.

174
0:07:36.06,000 --> 0:07:39,000
A tightrope walker doesn't practice new tricks without a net underneath,

175
0:07:39.78,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and an athlete wouldn't set out to first try a new move

176
0:07:42.42,000 --> 0:07:43,000
during a championship match.

177
0:07:44.94,000 --> 0:07:45,000
One reason that in our lives

178
0:07:46.62,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we spend so much time in the performance zone

179
0:07:49.1,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is that our environments often are, unnecessarily, high stakes.

180
0:07:54.02,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We create social risks for one another,

181
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
even in schools which are supposed to be all about learning,

182
0:07:59.14,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and I'm not talking about standardized tests.

183
0:08:01.3,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I mean that every minute of every day,

184
0:08:03.54,000 --> 0:08:05,000
many students in elementary schools through colleges

185
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
feel that if they make a mistake, others will think less of them.

186
0:08:09.7,000 --> 0:08:1,000
No wonder they're always stressed out

187
0:08:11.66,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and not taking the risks necessary for learning.

188
0:08:14.58,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But they learn that mistakes are undesirable

189
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:17,000
inadvertently

190
0:08:18.14,000 --> 0:08:21,000
when teachers or parents are eager to hear just correct answers

191
0:08:21.66,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and reject mistakes rather than welcome and examine them

192
0:08:24.34,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to learn from them,

193
0:08:25.62,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or when we look for narrow responses

194
0:08:27.38,000 --> 0:08:29,000
rather than encourage more exploratory thinking

195
0:08:29.62,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that we can all learn from.

196
0:08:30.98,000 --> 0:08:33,000
When all homework or student work has a number or a letter on it,

197
0:08:34.1,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and counts towards a final grade,

198
0:08:35.86,000 --> 0:08:38,000
rather than being used for practice, mistakes, feedback and revision,

199
0:08:39.46,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we send the message that school is a performance zone.

200
0:08:44.06,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The same is true in our workplaces.

201
0:08:46.14,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In the companies I consult with, I often see flawless execution cultures

202
0:08:50.18,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which leaders foster to encourage great work.

203
0:08:52.78,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But that leads employees to stay within what they know

204
0:08:55.34,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and not try new things,

205
0:08:56.62,000 --> 0:08:58,000
so companies struggle to innovate and improve,

206
0:08:58.98,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and they fall behind.

207
0:09:01.78,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We can create more spaces for growth

208
0:09:04.1,000 --> 0:09:06,000
by starting conversations with one another

209
0:09:06.18,000 --> 0:09:08,000
about when we want to be in each zone.

210
0:09:09.06,000 --> 0:09:11,000
What do we want to get better at and how?

211
0:09:11.78,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And when do we want to execute and minimize mistakes?

212
0:09:15.5,000 --> 0:09:18,000
That way, we gain clarity about what success is,

213
0:09:18.54,000 --> 0:09:2,000
when, and how to best support one another.

214
0:09:21.82,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But what if we find ourselves in a chronic high-stakes setting

215
0:09:24.94,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and we feel we can't start those conversations yet?

216
0:09:28.54,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Then here are three things that we can still do as individuals.

217
0:09:31.66,000 --> 0:09:35,000
First, we can create low-stakes islands in an otherwise high-stakes sea.

218
0:09:36.46,000 --> 0:09:38,000
These are spaces where mistakes have little consequence.

219
0:09:39.22,000 --> 0:09:42,000
For example, we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague

220
0:09:42.7,000 --> 0:09:45,000
with whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable conversations

221
0:09:45.9,000 --> 0:09:46,000
or even role-play.

222
0:09:47.3,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Or we can ask for feedback-oriented meetings as projects progress.

223
0:09:50.94,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Or we can set aside time to read or watch videos or take online courses.

224
0:09:55.1,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Those are just some examples.

225
0:09:57.18,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Second, we can execute and perform as we're expected,

226
0:10:01.38,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but then reflect on what we could do better next time,

227
0:10:03.98,000 --> 0:10:04,000
like Beyoncé does,

228
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and we can observe and emulate experts.

229
0:10:07.42,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The observation, reflection and adjustment is a learning zone.

230
0:10:11.7,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And finally, we can lead

231
0:10:14.58,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and lower the stakes for others by sharing what we want to get better at,

232
0:10:18.18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
by asking questions about what we don't know,

233
0:10:20.7,000 --> 0:10:22,000
by soliciting feedback and by sharing our mistakes

234
0:10:23.22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and what we've learned from them,

235
0:10:24.86,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so that others can feel safe to do the same.

236
0:10:27.58,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Real confidence is about modeling ongoing learning.

237
0:10:32.7,000 --> 0:10:36,000
What if, instead of spending our lives doing, doing, doing,

238
0:10:37.18,000 --> 0:10:39,000
performing, performing, performing,

239
0:10:39.3,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we spent more time exploring,

240
0:10:42.46,000 --> 0:10:43,000
asking,

241
0:10:43.9,000 --> 0:10:44,000
listening,

242
0:10:45.22,000 --> 0:10:48,000
experimenting, reflecting,

243
0:10:48.34,000 --> 0:10:5,000
striving and becoming?

244
0:10:52.14,000 --> 0:10:54,000
What if we each always had something

245
0:10:54.98,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we were working to improve?

246
0:10:57.58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What if we created more low-stakes islands

247
0:11:00.02,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and waters?

248
0:11:01.66,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And what if we got clear,

249
0:11:04.14,000 --> 0:11:06,000
within ourselves and with our teammates,

250
0:11:06.54,000 --> 0:11:09,000
about when we seek to learn and when we seek to perform,

251
0:11:10.1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
so that our efforts can become more consequential,

252
0:11:13.18,000 --> 0:11:15,000
our improvement never-ending

253
0:11:15.86,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and our best even better?

254
0:11:18.82,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Thank you.

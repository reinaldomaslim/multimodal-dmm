1
0:00:12.802,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In 1996, I was commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum

2
0:00:18.174,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to execute a large body of work called "Uses of Evidence."

3
0:00:25.37,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It was a cube --

4
0:00:27.696,000 --> 0:00:29,000
a very well large cube, at that.

5
0:00:30.759,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Each side had a window

6
0:00:32.553,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in order for the spectators to view the interior of the structure.

7
0:00:37.68,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The exterior of the structure was a collage of Africa and Africans

8
0:00:44.069,000 --> 0:00:47,000
as portrayed in the Western media and literature.

9
0:00:48.627,000 --> 0:00:54,000
A look through the windows revealed a sharp contrast:

10
0:00:55.59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
within the cubes are tranquil, civilized, domestic images

11
0:01:01.875,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of African family members, friends

12
0:01:07.585,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and Nigerian professionals,

13
0:01:09.601,000 --> 0:01:15,000
ranging from writers, poets, fashion designers, etc.

14
0:01:17.112,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The thing is,

15
0:01:19.829,000 --> 0:01:24,000
both the exterior and the interior images are quite true.

16
0:01:25.581,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But the images captured by Western media

17
0:01:31.971,000 --> 0:01:37,000
overwhelmingly depict Africans as basically primitive at best,

18
0:01:39.442,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or barely distinguishable from the African animals.

19
0:01:44.8,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Not much has changed, I'm afraid, since 1996,

20
0:01:50.045,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when I executed this work.

21
0:01:56.219,000 --> 0:02:,000
I began my professional photography practice in 1994,

22
0:02:01.812,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but my passion and enthusiasm for photography

23
0:02:06.693,000 --> 0:02:08,000
goes back to childhood,

24
0:02:10.109,000 --> 0:02:15,000
when my parents arranged for us to be photographed

25
0:02:15.314,000 --> 0:02:17,000
by a professional photographer

26
0:02:18.228,000 --> 0:02:2,000
on almost a monthly basis.

27
0:02:21.127,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It was also an opportunity for my siblings to dress up in our latest gear,

28
0:02:28.639,000 --> 0:02:29,000
made by our tailor.

29
0:02:30.911,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Later, when I was in boarding school,

30
0:02:33.847,000 --> 0:02:36,000
my friends and I bought Polaroid cameras,

31
0:02:38.323,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and then I began to experiment with self-portraiture,

32
0:02:42.617,000 --> 0:02:43,000
or what I would call

33
0:02:45.566,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"proto-selfie auto-portraits."

34
0:02:48.629,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:50.503,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"Cover Girl 1994" was my first major work

36
0:02:54.931,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that was critically well received in the US and Europe

37
0:02:59.956,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and quite instantly became a part of the school anthologies

38
0:03:06.093,000 --> 0:03:08,000
at universities and colleges.

39
0:03:08.235,000 --> 0:03:1,000
With the "Cover Girl" series,

40
0:03:10.466,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I wanted to reimagine the magazine cover

41
0:03:14.863,000 --> 0:03:2,000
with imagery totally unexpected, yet profoundly reasonable.

42
0:03:21.355,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The "Cover Girl" series proposed a different way

43
0:03:26.145,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the African can be represented in a more complex manner.

44
0:03:33.455,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Like "Cover Girl," the "Sartorial Anarchy" series

45
0:03:38.104,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is made up of self-portraits.

46
0:03:42.521,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It is an ongoing body of work, started in 2010.

47
0:03:47.339,000 --> 0:03:53,000
In each image, I married disparate costumes

48
0:03:53.618,000 --> 0:03:59,000
from widely diverse traditions, countries and time frames.

49
0:04:00.307,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And in mixing eras, cultures,

50
0:04:04.879,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I was able to bring harmony, as it were,

51
0:04:08.727,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to their similarly irreconcilable differences.

52
0:04:12.95,000 --> 0:04:15,000
These differences became a source

53
0:04:16.569,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of inspired artistic celebration.

54
0:04:23.822,000 --> 0:04:24,000
For example,

55
0:04:26.386,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in "Sartorial Anarchy #4,"

56
0:04:29.291,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I mixed a boater hat,

57
0:04:32.053,000 --> 0:04:38,000
inspired by the traditional Eton-Oxford College Boat Race,

58
0:04:38.673,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with a green Afghan traditional coat

59
0:04:42.907,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and an American Boy Scout shirt --

60
0:04:46.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a culture clash that works.

61
0:04:50.403,000 --> 0:04:52,000
In "Sartorial Anarchy #5,"

62
0:04:53.905,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I wore a macaroni wig,

63
0:04:56.561,000 --> 0:05:01,000
inspired by eighteenth-century macaroni headgear from England.

64
0:05:02.609,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This was paired with a British Norfolk jacket,

65
0:05:07.903,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Yoruba Nigerian trousers,

66
0:05:11.919,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and, improbably, a South African Zulu fighting stick.

67
0:05:17.575,000 --> 0:05:2,000
All harmoniously coexist on one body.

68
0:05:22.744,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And with "Sartorial Anarchy," I began to invest more

69
0:05:27.395,000 --> 0:05:3,000
into the organization of my pictures.

70
0:05:31.149,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I also began to investigate the vast possibilities of color:

71
0:05:38.187,000 --> 0:05:39,000
its emotional values,

72
0:05:40.693,000 --> 0:05:41,000
psychological impulse,

73
0:05:43.156,000 --> 0:05:44,000
poetic allure

74
0:05:45.267,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and a boundless capacity beyond the realm of meaning and logic.

75
0:05:52.89,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Now, enter Nollywood.

76
0:05:55.168,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In October of 2014,

77
0:05:57.887,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I returned to Lagos, Nigeria, after over three decades away

78
0:06:03.331,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and took photographs of 64 Nollywood personalities.

79
0:06:08.22,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I captured a cross section of the industry,

80
0:06:13.844,000 --> 0:06:17,000
as well as the next generation of rising stars.

81
0:06:19.559,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Nollywood is the first time that you have a school of African filmmakers

82
0:06:25.427,000 --> 0:06:31,000
truly, truly, profoundly in charge of telling African stories.

83
0:06:32.157,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In their varied movies --

84
0:06:34.461,000 --> 0:06:4,000
from romantic movies, horror films, gangster movies to action movies --

85
0:06:41.491,000 --> 0:06:47,000
one sees Nigerians portrayed with many layers of complexities.

86
0:06:47.95,000 --> 0:06:53,000
All the Nigerian, or "Naija," archetypes, if you allow, are there --

87
0:06:55.264,000 --> 0:07:,000
from the divvers, the "Shakara," the coquette,

88
0:07:00.372,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the gangsters, the rich, the corrupt politicians,

89
0:07:05.269,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the whore, the pimp --

90
0:07:07.205,000 --> 0:07:08,000
all in their swagger.

91
0:07:09.149,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And of course, you have the lowlifes and the losers, too,

92
0:07:12.982,000 --> 0:07:14,000
all vividly portrayed.

93
0:07:16.561,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Nollywood is Africa's mirror par excellence.

94
0:07:21.99,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Typically, I direct all of my portraits,

95
0:07:25.658,000 --> 0:07:29,000
from the way my subject conducts his or her head,

96
0:07:30.776,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the way the neck is tilted,

97
0:07:33.871,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the expression of the fingers,

98
0:07:36.728,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the gestures of the hands,

99
0:07:39.533,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to the gaze

100
0:07:41.411,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and overall bearing and countenance.

101
0:07:44.069,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Let me describe some of the photographs for you.

102
0:07:47.028,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Genevieve Nnaji.

103
0:07:49.228,000 --> 0:07:51,000
She is the reigning queen of Nollywood.

104
0:07:51.876,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Here, I was quoting from the grand, Pharaonic African cultures

105
0:07:57.692,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of the Nile Valley civilizations;

106
0:08:00.379,000 --> 0:08:03,000
namely, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia,

107
0:08:03.902,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so as to imbue her with a stately, ironic, calm grandeur.

108
0:08:11.014,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Taiwo Ajai-Lycett is the grande dame of Nollywood.

109
0:08:17.283,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Every aspect of her being commands attention.

110
0:08:23.085,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So I posed her with her back to the audience.

111
0:08:27.99,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Her face turned to meet us with a redoubtable gaze.

112
0:08:34.276,000 --> 0:08:37,000
She doesn't need to seek our approval.

113
0:08:38.157,000 --> 0:08:39,000
She's all that.

114
0:08:40.458,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Sadiq Daba.

115
0:08:42.592,000 --> 0:08:47,000
There was an unspoken authoritarian and imperial bearing

116
0:08:47.727,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that Sadiq Daba exudes upon meeting him.

117
0:08:52.522,000 --> 0:08:56,000
In this portrait, he simply sat

118
0:08:57.847,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and allowed his massive, massive Nigerian caftan

119
0:09:03.403,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to signal his status.

120
0:09:06.815,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Quite an accomplishment.

121
0:09:09.609,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Belinda Effah.

122
0:09:11.521,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Belinda Effah's portrait allowed me to indulge my passion for color,

123
0:09:15.957,000 --> 0:09:21,000
dressed in a long, fitted blue dress that emphasizes her curves,

124
0:09:22.585,000 --> 0:09:26,000
seated on an upholstered green velvet bench.

125
0:09:26.828,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I gamely employed the multicolored carpet

126
0:09:32.106,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and a vibrant color,

127
0:09:34.43,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in order to evoke the splendor of the multicolored painted bunting bird.

128
0:09:41.95,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Everything was designed to harmonize the figure of Belinda within the frame.

129
0:09:49.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Monalisa Chinda is, shall we say,

130
0:09:53.503,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the epitome of the luxe existence and lifestyle.

131
0:09:57.792,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Her picture, or portrait, pretty much speaks for itself.

132
0:10:02.919,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Alexx Ekubo is a sharp study

133
0:10:07.22,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in simplified elegance and dignity

134
0:10:11.387,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and a harmony in blue and white, as well.

135
0:10:16.371,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Enyinna Nwigwe is a Nollywood matinee idol.

136
0:10:20.853,000 --> 0:10:25,000
There is whiff of the rake about him,

137
0:10:25.982,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and that gives him an enchanting edge.

138
0:10:29.239,000 --> 0:10:33,000
That's what I felt when I designed and organized the portrait.

139
0:10:34.776,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Now, Nollywood is a new phase of Africa.

140
0:10:39.856,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It is modern, post-modern,

141
0:10:44.228,000 --> 0:10:47,000
meta-modern, bold

142
0:10:47.363,000 --> 0:10:49,000
sexy, shrewd

143
0:10:50.268,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and with a contagious attitude worth catching.

144
0:10:55.411,000 --> 0:10:57,000
As the finale of the project,

145
0:10:58.117,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I assembled the Nollywood stars

146
0:11:01.49,000 --> 0:11:06,000
into a group grand portrait of 64 subjects,

147
0:11:06.792,000 --> 0:11:09,000
called "The School of Nollywood,"

148
0:11:10.704,000 --> 0:11:15,000
which was inspired by Rafael's "School of Athens,"

149
0:11:15.774,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that was done circa 1509.

150
0:11:20.49,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It is at the Vatican.

151
0:11:22.895,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This grand group portrait

152
0:11:25.865,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is the exact same size as Rafael's "School of Athens."

153
0:11:31.339,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It measures roughly 27 feet in width

154
0:11:36.355,000 --> 0:11:39,000
by six and a half feet in height.

155
0:11:40.291,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Nollywood also exemplifies a type of modernity

156
0:11:44.315,000 --> 0:11:45,000
never before seen in Africa.

157
0:11:47.029,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Think of it:

158
0:11:48.76,000 --> 0:11:52,000
there has never been anything so ubiquitous

159
0:11:53.135,000 --> 0:11:55,000
with such iconic optics

160
0:11:56.097,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to come out of Africa

161
0:11:57.641,000 --> 0:12:01,000
since the Nile Valley civilizations

162
0:12:02.117,000 --> 0:12:06,000
of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia.

163
0:12:07.553,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Outside of Nollywood,

164
0:12:09.403,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the image of Africa remains frozen in the old "National Geographic" mode

165
0:12:15.752,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and safari perspective.

166
0:12:18.703,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But as Africans continue to step and see themselves portrayed by Nollywood

167
0:12:25.624,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in their varied and fantastic complexities,

168
0:12:29.784,000 --> 0:12:32,000
they will, in turn, propagate and perpetuate

169
0:12:33.655,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the positive image of themselves.

170
0:12:36.046,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is what Hollywood did and continues to do for the West.

171
0:12:40.625,000 --> 0:12:42,000
As shocking as this may be,

172
0:12:43.363,000 --> 0:12:46,000
it is almost a taboo in the art world

173
0:12:46.688,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to show Africans in a modern framework --

174
0:12:51.094,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that is to say, as polished, dry-cleaned,

175
0:12:55.481,000 --> 0:12:58,000
manicured, pedicured and coiffed.

176
0:12:59.998,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Applause)

177
0:13:04.839,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Part of my job is to keep beautifying Africa for the world,

178
0:13:10.292,000 --> 0:13:13,000
one portrait at a time.

179
0:13:13.427,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Thank you.

180
0:13:14.611,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.906,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I've been intrigued by this question

2
0:00:15.091,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense --

3
0:00:19.542,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a sense that would give us seamless access

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that may be relevant to help us make the right decision

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
about whatever it is that we're coming across.

7
0:00:36.024,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And some of you may argue,

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?"

9
0:00:41.446,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But I would say no.

10
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
When you meet someone here at TED --

11
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year --

12
0:00:49.223,000 --> 0:00:5,000
you don't shake somebody's hand

13
0:00:51.105,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment

14
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
while I take out my phone and Google you?"

15
0:00:56.27,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Or when you go to the supermarket

16
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and you're standing there in that huge aisle

17
0:01:01.993,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of different types of toilet papers,

18
0:01:04.533,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser,

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers

20
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.

21
0:01:17.244,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information

22
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that can just help us make optimal decisions

23
0:01:25.154,000 --> 0:01:28,000
about what to do next and what actions to take.

24
0:01:28.331,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And so my research group at the Media Lab

25
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
has been developing a series of inventions

26
0:01:36.044,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way,

27
0:01:40.645,000 --> 0:01:44,000
without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.

28
0:01:45.641,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort,

29
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and most successful effort so far,

30
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
which is still very much a work in process.

31
0:01:54.994,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together

32
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
with components that are off the shelf --

33
0:02:03.842,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.

34
0:02:08.762,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam,

35
0:02:12.742,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.

36
0:02:18.514,000 --> 0:02:22,000
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket

37
0:02:22.609,000 --> 0:02:26,000
which acts as the communication and computation device.

38
0:02:26.914,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry,

39
0:02:30.858,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who's really the genius who's been implementing

40
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and designing this whole system.

41
0:02:35.551,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface

42
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and start using his hands to interact with the information

43
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that is projected in front of him.

44
0:02:47.876,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The system tracks the four significant fingers.

45
0:02:51.998,000 --> 0:02:54,000
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps

46
0:02:55.688,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that you may recognize.

47
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But if you want a more stylish version,

48
0:02:59.874,000 --> 0:03:02,000
you could also paint your nails in different colors.

49
0:03:03.575,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers

50
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and recognizes any gestures that he's making

51
0:03:11.023,000 --> 0:03:15,000
so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach,

52
0:03:15.549,000 --> 0:03:17,000
zoom in and out, etc.

53
0:03:17.811,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture,

54
0:03:23.929,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.

55
0:03:27.371,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab,

56
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
he can just go up to any wall

57
0:03:32.629,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and project all the pictures that he's taken,

58
0:03:35.565,000 --> 0:03:38,000
sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc.,

59
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
again using all natural gestures.

60
0:03:43.008,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago

61
0:03:47.091,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think,

62
0:03:51.369,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"

63
0:03:54.764,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures,

64
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
both hands, etc.

65
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But the difference here is that you can use any surface,

66
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
you can walk up to any surface,

67
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
including your hand, if nothing else is available,

68
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and interact with this projected data.

69
0:04:13.681,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The device is completely portable, and can be --

70
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

71
0:04:23.728,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Applause ends)

72
0:04:25.565,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So, one important difference is that it's totally mobile.

73
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Another even more important difference is that in mass production,

74
0:04:33.918,000 --> 0:04:36,000
this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones

75
0:04:37.607,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging --

76
0:04:41.609,000 --> 0:04:43,000
could look a lot more stylish

77
0:04:43.655,000 --> 0:04:46,000
than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.

78
0:04:48.293,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy

79
0:04:53.063,000 --> 0:04:56,000
of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report,"

80
0:04:57.018,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the reason why we're really excited about this device

81
0:05:01.06,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices

82
0:05:06.916,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.

83
0:05:12.192,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket

84
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and he's shopping for some paper towels.

85
0:05:19.524,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And, as he picks up a product,

86
0:05:21.452,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the system can recognize the product that he's picking up,

87
0:05:24.53,000 --> 0:05:28,000
using either image recognition or marker technology,

88
0:05:28.79,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and give him the green light or an orange light.

89
0:05:31.788,000 --> 0:05:33,000
He can ask for additional information.

90
0:05:34.722,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So this particular choice here

91
0:05:38.507,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.

92
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it

93
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
rather than the most ecologically responsible choice.

94
0:05:49.755,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:52.932,000 --> 0:05:56,000
If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating --

96
0:05:57.664,000 --> 0:05:59,000
it gets projected right on the cover of the book.

97
0:06:00.3,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker,

98
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.

99
0:06:06.892,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book

100
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and can then see additional information about the book --

101
0:06:12.916,000 --> 0:06:18,000
reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.

102
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If he turns to a particular page,

103
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours

104
0:06:25.477,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that gives him a little bit of additional information

105
0:06:28.323,000 --> 0:06:31,000
about whatever is on that particular page.

106
0:06:31.372,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated.

107
0:06:35.773,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

108
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about.

109
0:06:41.973,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You can get the latest sports scores, etc.

110
0:06:46.044,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is a more controversial one.

111
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:49.835,000 --> 0:06:51,000
As you interact with someone at TED,

113
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags,

114
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the words that are associated with that person

115
0:06:58.912,000 --> 0:07:,000
in their blog and personal web pages.

116
0:07:01.684,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.

117
0:07:06.861,000 --> 0:07:07,000
On your way to the airport,

118
0:07:08.841,000 --> 0:07:12,000
if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed,

119
0:07:12.934,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that the gate has changed, etc.

120
0:07:15.594,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And, if you need to know what the current time is,

121
0:07:18.738,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it's as simple as drawing a watch --

122
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

123
0:07:23.389,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

124
0:07:24.548,000 --> 0:07:25,000
on your arm.

125
0:07:27.774,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense

126
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information

127
0:07:38.91,000 --> 0:07:4,000
about the things that we may come across.

128
0:07:41.752,000 --> 0:07:45,000
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.

129
0:07:46.17,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause and cheering)

130
0:08:07.005,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Applause ends)

131
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He does deserve a lot of applause,

132
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.

133
0:08:15.532,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.

134
0:08:18.958,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.

135
0:08:23.837,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years

136
0:08:26.794,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.

137
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Thank you.

138
0:08:32.231,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Applause)

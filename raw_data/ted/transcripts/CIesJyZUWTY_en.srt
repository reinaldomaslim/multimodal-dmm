2
0:00:12.346,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What do you guys think?

3
0:00:14.706,000 --> 0:00:18,000
For those who watched Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk,

4
0:00:19.18,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I am a typical example of what he describes

5
0:00:22.322,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as "the body as a form of transport for the head,"

6
0:00:25.346,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a university professor.

7
0:00:27.737,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You might think it was not fair

8
0:00:31.217,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that I've been lined up to speak after these first two talks

9
0:00:34.18,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to speak about science.

10
0:00:36.774,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I can't move my body to the beat,

11
0:00:40.272,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and after a scientist who became a philosopher,

12
0:00:43.184,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I have to talk about hard science.

13
0:00:45.126,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It could be a very dry subject.

14
0:00:48.154,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Yet, I feel honored.

15
0:00:51.679,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Never in my career,

16
0:00:53.462,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and it's been a long career,

17
0:00:55.023,000 --> 0:00:57,000
have I had the opportunity to start a talk

18
0:00:57.256,000 --> 0:01:,000
feeling so inspired, like this one.

19
0:01:00.264,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Usually, talking about science

20
0:01:04.144,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is like exercising in a dry place.

21
0:01:08.284,000 --> 0:01:11,000
However, I've had the pleasure

22
0:01:11.516,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of being invited to come here to talk about water.

23
0:01:15.885,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The words "water" and "dry" do not match, right?

24
0:01:19.426,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It is even better to talk about water in the Amazon,

25
0:01:22.916,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which is the splendid cradle of life. Fresh life.

26
0:01:27.95,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So this is what inspired me.

27
0:01:30.028,000 --> 0:01:32,000
That's why I'm here, although I'm carrying

28
0:01:32.23,000 --> 0:01:33,000
my head over here.

29
0:01:34.143,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I am trying, or will try to convey this inspiration.

30
0:01:38.237,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I hope this story will inspire you and that you'll spread the word.

31
0:01:43.317,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We know that there is controversy.

32
0:01:47.637,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The Amazon is the "lung of the world,"

33
0:01:50.94,000 --> 0:01:55,000
because of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged

34
0:01:56.426,000 --> 0:01:57,000
between the forest and the atmosphere.

35
0:01:58.245,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity.

36
0:02:02.345,000 --> 0:02:06,000
While many believe it,

37
0:02:06.651,000 --> 0:02:07,000
few know it.

38
0:02:08.197,000 --> 0:02:09,000
If you go out there, in this marsh,

39
0:02:10.075,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you'll be amazed at the --

40
0:02:13.913,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You can barely see the animals.

41
0:02:15.957,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The Indians say, "The forest has more eyes than leaves."

42
0:02:20.011,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That is true, and I will try to show you something.

43
0:02:22.987,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But today, I'm going to use a different approach,

44
0:02:26.168,000 --> 0:02:29,000
one that is inspired by these two initiatives here,

45
0:02:29.188,000 --> 0:02:31,000
a harmonic one and a philosophical one.

46
0:02:31.869,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'll try to use an approach that's slightly materialistic,

47
0:02:35.998,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but it also attempts to convey that, in nature, there is

48
0:02:39.216,000 --> 0:02:42,000
extraordinary philosophy and harmony.

49
0:02:42.31,000 --> 0:02:43,000
There'll be no music in my presentation,

50
0:02:44.271,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but I hope you'll all notice the music of the reality I'm going to show you.

51
0:02:48.494,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I'm going to talk about physiology — not about lungs,

52
0:02:51.107,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but other analogies with human physiology,

53
0:02:54.635,000 --> 0:02:56,000
especially the heart.

54
0:02:56.744,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We'll start

55
0:03:01.132,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by thinking that water is like blood.

56
0:03:06.5,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The circulation in our body distributes fresh blood,

57
0:03:11.349,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which feeds, nurtures and supports us,

58
0:03:13.959,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and brings the used blood back to be renewed.

59
0:03:18.337,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In the Amazon, things happen similarly.

60
0:03:22.659,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We'll start by talking about the power of all these processes.

61
0:03:27.766,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is an image

62
0:03:32.387,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of rain in motion.

63
0:03:35.198,000 --> 0:03:39,000
What you see there is the years passing in seconds.

64
0:03:39.211,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Rains all over the world. What do you see?

65
0:03:42.159,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The equatorial region, in general,

66
0:03:44.019,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and the Amazon specifically,

67
0:03:45.882,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is extremely important for the world's climate.

68
0:03:48.751,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It's a powerful engine.

69
0:03:50.916,000 --> 0:03:55,000
There is a frantic evaporation taking place here.

70
0:03:56.212,000 --> 0:03:58,000
If we take a look at this other image,

71
0:03:58.834,000 --> 0:04:,000
which shows the water vapor flow,

72
0:04:01.616,000 --> 0:04:04,000
you have dry air in black, moist air in gray,

73
0:04:04.801,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and clouds in white.

74
0:04:06.232,000 --> 0:04:11,000
What you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon.

75
0:04:11.908,000 --> 0:04:13,000
What phenomenon -- if it's not a desert,

76
0:04:14.031,000 --> 0:04:19,000
what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere

77
0:04:19.277,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with such power that it can be seen from space?

78
0:04:22.36,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What phenomenon is this?

79
0:04:23.902,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It could be a geyser.

80
0:04:26.77,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A geyser is underground water heated by magma,

81
0:04:30.558,000 --> 0:04:31,000
exploding into the atmosphere

82
0:04:31.998,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and transferring this water into the atmosphere.

83
0:04:35.668,000 --> 0:04:37,000
There are no geysers in the Amazon, unless I am wrong.

84
0:04:38.534,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I don't know of any.

85
0:04:40.502,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But we have something that plays the same role,

86
0:04:44.906,000 --> 0:04:47,000
with much more elegance though:

87
0:04:48.298,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the trees, our good old friends

88
0:04:51.194,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that, like geysers,

89
0:04:54.008,000 --> 0:04:59,000
can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere.

90
0:04:59.086,000 --> 0:05:04,000
There are 600 billion trees in the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers.

91
0:05:04.783,000 --> 0:05:07,000
That is done with an extraordinary sophistication.

92
0:05:08.646,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They don't need the heat of magma.

93
0:05:10.291,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They use sunlight to do this process.

94
0:05:13.262,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon,

95
0:05:16.793,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a big tree manages to transfer 1,000 liters of water

96
0:05:19.723,000 --> 0:05:21,000
through its transpiration --

97
0:05:22.032,000 --> 0:05:23,000
1,000 liters.

98
0:05:23.447,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If we take all the Amazon,

99
0:05:28.642,000 --> 0:05:29,000
which is a very large area,

100
0:05:30.505,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and add it up to all that water that is released by transpiration,

101
0:05:33.785,000 --> 0:05:35,000
which is the sweat of the forest,

102
0:05:36.291,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we'll get to an incredible number:

103
0:05:38.985,000 --> 0:05:4,000
20 billion metric tons of water.

104
0:05:41.781,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In one day.

105
0:05:43.375,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Do you know how much that is?

106
0:05:45.562,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The Amazon River, the largest river on Earth,

107
0:05:48.122,000 --> 0:05:49,000
one fifth of all the fresh water

108
0:05:49.703,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that leaves the continents of the whole world and ends up in the oceans,

109
0:05:53.152,000 --> 0:05:57,000
dumps 17 billion metric tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.

110
0:05:57.562,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This river of vapor

111
0:05:58.811,000 --> 0:06:,000
that comes up from the forest and goes into the atmosphere

112
0:06:01.706,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is greater than the Amazon River.

113
0:06:03.31,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Just to give you an idea.

114
0:06:05.187,000 --> 0:06:08,000
If we could take a gigantic kettle,

115
0:06:08.743,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the kind you could plug into a power socket, an electric one,

116
0:06:11.642,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and put those 20 billion metric tons of water in it,

117
0:06:14.14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
how much power would you need to have this water evaporated?

118
0:06:17.49,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Any idea? A really big kettle.

119
0:06:20.247,000 --> 0:06:22,000
A gigantic kettle, right?

120
0:06:22.432,000 --> 0:06:24,000
50 thousand Itaipus.

121
0:06:24.518,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Itaipu is still the largest hydroelectric plant in the world.

122
0:06:28.264,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and Brazil is very proud of it

123
0:06:29.937,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because it provides more than 30 percent of the power

124
0:06:32.136,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that is consumed in Brazil.

125
0:06:34.093,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And the Amazon is here, doing this for free.

126
0:06:38.785,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant, providing environmental services.

127
0:06:46.047,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Related to this subject,

128
0:06:47.608,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we are going to talk about what I call the paradox of chance,

129
0:06:50.596,000 --> 0:06:52,000
which is curious.

130
0:06:52.764,000 --> 0:06:53,000
If you look at the world map --

131
0:06:54.476,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it's easy to see this --

132
0:06:55.835,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone,

133
0:06:58.904,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude,

134
0:07:02.116,000 --> 0:07:05,000
30 degrees south latitude, aligned.

135
0:07:05.199,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Look over there, in the southern hemisphere, the Atacama;

136
0:07:08.243,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Namibia and Kalahari in Africa; the Australian desert.

137
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
In the northern hemisphere, the Sahara, Sonoran, etc.

138
0:07:13.994,000 --> 0:07:17,000
There is an exception, and it's curious:

139
0:07:18.433,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's the quadrangle that ranges from Cuiabá to Buenos Aires,

140
0:07:21.52,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and from São Paulo to the Andes.

141
0:07:23.323,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This quadrangle was supposed to be a desert.

142
0:07:26.437,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's on the line of deserts.

143
0:07:28.746,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Why isn't it? That's why I call it the paradox of chance.

144
0:07:32.01,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What do we have in South America that is different?

145
0:07:36.279,000 --> 0:07:38,000
If we could use the analogy

146
0:07:38.448,000 --> 0:07:42,000
of the blood circulating in our bodies,

147
0:07:42.58,000 --> 0:07:45,000
like the water circulating in the landscape,

148
0:07:45.662,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we see that rivers are veins,

149
0:07:49.788,000 --> 0:07:53,000
they drain the landscape, they drain the tissue of nature.

150
0:07:54.333,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Where are the arteries?

151
0:07:56.288,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Any guess?

152
0:07:58.323,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What takes --

153
0:08:00.139,000 --> 0:08:05,000
How does water get to irrigate the tissues of nature

154
0:08:05.402,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and bring everything back through rivers?

155
0:08:08.585,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There is a new type of river,

156
0:08:11.606,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which originates in the blue sea,

157
0:08:14.897,000 --> 0:08:17,000
which flows through the green ocean --

158
0:08:18.247,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it not only flows, but it is also pumped by the green ocean --

159
0:08:21.244,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and then it falls on our land.

160
0:08:24.299,000 --> 0:08:26,000
All our economy, that quadrangle,

161
0:08:26.507,000 --> 0:08:3,000
70 percent of South America's GDP comes from that area.

162
0:08:31.037,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It depends on this river.

163
0:08:32.675,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This river flows invisibly above us.

164
0:08:34.727,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We are floating here on this floating hotel,

165
0:08:36.915,000 --> 0:08:38,000
on one of the largest rivers on Earth, the Negro River.

166
0:08:39.87,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's a bit dry and rough, but we are floating here,

167
0:08:43.259,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and there is this invisible river running above us.

168
0:08:46.349,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This river has a pulse.

169
0:08:49.516,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Here it is, pulsing.

170
0:08:51.939,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That's why we also talk about the heart.

171
0:08:54.327,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You can see the different seasons there.

172
0:08:56.462,000 --> 0:08:59,000
There's the rainy season. In the Amazon, we used to have two seasons,

173
0:08:59.823,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the humid season and the even more humid season.

174
0:09:02.306,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now we have a dry season.

175
0:09:03.962,000 --> 0:09:05,000
You can see the river covering that region

176
0:09:06.671,000 --> 0:09:09,000
which, otherwise, would be a desert. And it is not.

177
0:09:13.633,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We, scientists -- You see that I'm struggling here

178
0:09:17.151,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to move my head from one side to the other.

179
0:09:19.634,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Scientists study how it works, why, etc.

180
0:09:25.031,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and these studies are generating a series of discoveries,

181
0:09:29.718,000 --> 0:09:3,000
which are absolutely fabulous,

182
0:09:31.29,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to raise our awareness of the wealth,

183
0:09:34.283,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the complexity, and the wonder that we have,

184
0:09:36.668,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the symphony we have in this process.

185
0:09:39.649,000 --> 0:09:41,000
One of them is: How is rain formed?

186
0:09:41.997,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Above the Amazon, there is clean air,

187
0:09:45.522,000 --> 0:09:46,000
as there is clean air above the ocean.

188
0:09:47.44,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The blue sea has clean air above it and forms pretty few clouds;

189
0:09:50.493,000 --> 0:09:51,000
there's almost no rain there.

190
0:09:51.952,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The green ocean has the same clean air, but forms a lot of rain.

191
0:09:56.366,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What is happening here that is different?

192
0:09:58.753,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The forest emits smells,

193
0:10:00.423,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and these smells are condensation nuclei,

194
0:10:03.361,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which form drops in the atmosphere.

195
0:10:05.625,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Then, clouds are formed and there is torrential rain.

196
0:10:10.503,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden.

197
0:10:13.9,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This relation between a living thing, which is the forest,

198
0:10:18.712,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and a nonliving thing, which is the atmosphere,

199
0:10:21.856,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is ingenious in the Amazon,

200
0:10:24.133,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because the forest provides water and seeds,

201
0:10:29.464,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back,

202
0:10:32.449,000 --> 0:10:35,000
guaranteeing the forest's survival.

203
0:10:36.421,000 --> 0:10:37,000
There are other factors as well.

204
0:10:37.95,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We've talked a little about the heart,

205
0:10:39.764,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and let's now talk about another function: the liver!

206
0:10:42.654,000 --> 0:10:47,000
When humid air, high humidity and radiation are combined

207
0:10:47.715,000 --> 0:10:49,000
with these organic compounds,

208
0:10:49.775,000 --> 0:10:54,000
which I call exogenous vitamin C, generous vitamin C in the form of gas,

209
0:10:55.487,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the plants release antioxidants

210
0:10:58.317,000 --> 0:11:,000
which react with pollutants.

211
0:11:00.637,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You can rest assured

212
0:11:02.041,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that you are breathing the purest air on Earth, here in the Amazon,

213
0:11:05.538,000 --> 0:11:08,000
because the plants take care of this characteristic as well.

214
0:11:09.045,000 --> 0:11:11,000
This benefits the very way plants work,

215
0:11:11.662,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which is another ingenious cycle.

216
0:11:13.715,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Speaking of fractals,

217
0:11:17.569,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and their relation with the way we work,

218
0:11:19.905,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we can establish other comparisons.

219
0:11:22.493,000 --> 0:11:25,000
As in the upper airways of our lungs,

220
0:11:26.024,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the air in the Amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust.

221
0:11:29.736,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our airways.

222
0:11:33.714,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall.

223
0:11:37.533,000 --> 0:11:38,000
When there are fires in the Amazon,

224
0:11:39.38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the smoke stops the rain, it stops raining,

225
0:11:42.224,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the forest dries up and catches fire.

226
0:11:44.426,000 --> 0:11:46,000
There is another fractal analogy.

227
0:11:47.057,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Like in the veins and arteries,

228
0:11:49.009,000 --> 0:11:51,000
the rain water is a feedback.

229
0:11:51.805,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It returns to the atmosphere.

230
0:11:53.834,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Like endocrinal glands and hormones,

231
0:11:58.12,000 --> 0:12:,000
there are those gases which I told you about before,

232
0:12:00.863,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that are formed and released into the atmosphere, like hormones,

233
0:12:04.495,000 --> 0:12:06,000
which help in the formation of rain.

234
0:12:07.49,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Like the liver and the kidneys, as I've said, cleaning the air.

235
0:12:11.435,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And, finally, like the heart:

236
0:12:13.234,000 --> 0:12:18,000
pumping water from outside, from the sea,

237
0:12:18.307,000 --> 0:12:19,000
into the forest.

238
0:12:20.179,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We call it the biotic moisture pump,

239
0:12:23.581,000 --> 0:12:27,000
a new theory that is explained in a very simple way.

240
0:12:27.731,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If there is a desert in the continent

241
0:12:30.389,000 --> 0:12:32,000
with a nearby sea,

242
0:12:32.477,000 --> 0:12:33,000
evaporation's greater on the sea,

243
0:12:34.311,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and it sucks the air above the desert.

244
0:12:37.28,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The desert is trapped in this condition. It will always be dry.

245
0:12:40.762,000 --> 0:12:42,000
If you have the opposite situation, a forest,

246
0:12:43.528,000 --> 0:12:46,000
the evaporation, as we showed, is much greater, because of the trees,

247
0:12:47.266,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and this relation is reversed.

248
0:12:48.978,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The air above the sea is sucked into the continent

249
0:12:51.331,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and humidity is imported.

250
0:12:54.179,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This satellite image was taken one month ago —

251
0:12:58.676,000 --> 0:13:,000
that's Manaus down there, we're down there —

252
0:13:01.063,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and it shows this process.

253
0:13:02.418,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It's not a common little river that flows into a canal.

254
0:13:05.462,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It's a mighty river that irrigates South America,

255
0:13:10.192,000 --> 0:13:11,000
among other things.

256
0:13:12.016,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This image shows those paths,

257
0:13:14.333,000 --> 0:13:17,000
all the hurricanes that have been recorded.

258
0:13:17.638,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You can see that, in the red square, there hardly are any hurricanes.

259
0:13:22.208,000 --> 0:13:23,000
That is no accident.

260
0:13:23.786,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This pump that sucks the moisture into the continent

261
0:13:27.25,000 --> 0:13:29,000
also speeds up the air above the sea,

262
0:13:29.485,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and this prevents hurricane formations.

263
0:13:33.053,000 --> 0:13:37,000
To close this part and sum up,

264
0:13:37.645,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I'd like to talk about something a little different.

265
0:13:40.265,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I have several colleagues

266
0:13:42.225,000 --> 0:13:44,000
who worked in the development of these theories.

267
0:13:44.71,000 --> 0:13:47,000
They think, and so do I,

268
0:13:48.341,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that we can save planet Earth.

269
0:13:50.939,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I'm not talking only about the Amazon.

270
0:13:53.684,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The Amazon teaches us a lesson

271
0:13:55.809,000 --> 0:13:59,000
on how pristine nature works.

272
0:13:59.845,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We didn't understand these processes before

273
0:14:02.251,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because the rest of the world is messed up.

274
0:14:05.086,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We could understand it here, though.

275
0:14:06.993,000 --> 0:14:09,000
These colleagues propose that, yes, we can

276
0:14:10.37,000 --> 0:14:11,000
save other areas,

277
0:14:12.077,000 --> 0:14:14,000
including deserts.

278
0:14:14.172,000 --> 0:14:17,000
If we could establish forests in those other areas,

279
0:14:17.597,000 --> 0:14:19,000
we can reverse climate change,

280
0:14:19.709,000 --> 0:14:21,000
including global warming.

281
0:14:22.324,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I have a dear colleague in India,

282
0:14:24.54,000 --> 0:14:27,000
whose name is Suprabha Seshan, and she has a motto.

283
0:14:27.614,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Her motto is, "Gardening back the biosphere,"

284
0:14:31.928,000 --> 0:14:33,000
"Reajardinando a biosfera" in Portuguese.

285
0:14:34.286,000 --> 0:14:36,000
She does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems.

286
0:14:37.284,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We need to do this.

287
0:14:39.851,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Having closed this quick introduction,

288
0:14:44.036,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we see the reality that we have out here,

289
0:14:47.622,000 --> 0:14:5,000
which is drought, this climate change,

290
0:14:50.632,000 --> 0:14:51,000
things that we already knew.

291
0:14:52.515,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I'd like to tell you a short story.

292
0:14:56.649,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Once, about four years ago,

293
0:15:00.282,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I attended a declamation, of a text by Davi Kopenawa,

294
0:15:04.169,000 --> 0:15:07,000
a wise representative of the Yanomami people,

295
0:15:07.267,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and it went more or less like this:

296
0:15:09.462,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"Doesn't the white man know

297
0:15:12.087,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that, if he destroys the forest, there will be no more rain?

298
0:15:15.478,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And that, if there's no more rain,

299
0:15:17.241,000 --> 0:15:2,000
there'll be nothing to drink, or to eat?"

300
0:15:20.464,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I heard that, and my eyes welled up

301
0:15:23.145,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and I went, "Oh, my!

302
0:15:24.588,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I've been studying this for 20 years, with a super computer,

303
0:15:28.904,000 --> 0:15:3,000
dozens, thousands of scientists,

304
0:15:31.034,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and we are starting to get to this conclusion, which he already knows!"

305
0:15:34.712,000 --> 0:15:39,000
A critical point is the Yanomami have never deforested.

306
0:15:39.746,000 --> 0:15:41,000
How could they know the rain would end?

307
0:15:42.385,000 --> 0:15:45,000
This bugged me and I was befuddled.

308
0:15:46.327,000 --> 0:15:47,000
How could he know that?

309
0:15:47.773,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Some months later, I met him at another event and said,

310
0:15:51.536,000 --> 0:15:56,000
"Davi, how did you know that if the forest was destroyed, there'd be no more rain?"

311
0:15:57.342,000 --> 0:16:01,000
He replied: "The spirit of the forest told us."

312
0:16:02.157,000 --> 0:16:06,000
For me, this was a game changer,

313
0:16:06.744,000 --> 0:16:07,000
a radical change.

314
0:16:08.447,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I said, "Gosh!

315
0:16:09.866,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Why am I doing all this science

316
0:16:14.105,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to get to a conclusion that he already knows?"

317
0:16:17.167,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Then, something absolutely critical hit me,

318
0:16:23.174,000 --> 0:16:24,000
which is,

319
0:16:27.697,000 --> 0:16:3,000
seeing is believing.

320
0:16:31.932,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Out of sight, out of mind.

321
0:16:35.14,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This is a need the previous speaker pointed out:

322
0:16:39.928,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We need to see things --

323
0:16:42.712,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I mean, we, Western society,

324
0:16:44.9,000 --> 0:16:46,000
which is becoming global, civilized --

325
0:16:47.262,000 --> 0:16:48,000
we need to see.

326
0:16:48.665,000 --> 0:16:5,000
If we don't see, we don't register the information.

327
0:16:51.188,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We live in ignorance.

328
0:16:52.932,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So, I propose the following --

329
0:16:54.822,000 --> 0:16:56,000
of course, the astronomer wouldn't like the idea --

330
0:16:57.274,000 --> 0:16:59,000
but let's turn the Hubble telescope upside down.

331
0:17:00.13,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And let's make it look down here,

332
0:17:02.547,000 --> 0:17:04,000
rather than to the far reaches of the universe.

333
0:17:04.797,000 --> 0:17:05,000
The universe is wonderful,

334
0:17:06.539,000 --> 0:17:08,000
but we have a practical reality,

335
0:17:08.914,000 --> 0:17:11,000
which is we live in an unknown cosmos,

336
0:17:12.734,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and we're ignorant about it.

337
0:17:14.117,000 --> 0:17:17,000
We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos

338
0:17:17.787,000 --> 0:17:19,000
that shelters us and houses us.

339
0:17:19.826,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Talk to any astrophysicist.

340
0:17:21.492,000 --> 0:17:24,000
The Earth is a statistical improbability.

341
0:17:24.778,000 --> 0:17:28,000
The stability and comfort that we enjoy, despite the droughts of the Negro River,

342
0:17:28.976,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and all the heat and cold and typhoons, etc.,

343
0:17:31.939,000 --> 0:17:33,000
there is nothing like it in the universe, that we know of.

344
0:17:34.673,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Then, let's turn Hubble in our direction,

345
0:17:36.922,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and let's look at the Earth.

346
0:17:41.431,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Let's start with the Amazon!

347
0:17:43.541,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Let's dive,

348
0:17:44.92,000 --> 0:17:48,000
let's reach out the reality we live in every day,

349
0:17:49.466,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and look carefully at it, since that's what we need.

350
0:17:52.693,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this.

351
0:17:54.624,000 --> 0:17:56,000
He has something already that I think I missed.

352
0:17:57.003,000 --> 0:17:58,000
I was educated by television.

353
0:17:58.678,000 --> 0:17:59,000
I think that I missed this,

354
0:18:00.589,000 --> 0:18:01,000
an ancestral record,

355
0:18:02.484,000 --> 0:18:06,000
a valuation of what I don't know, what I haven't seen.

356
0:18:06.864,000 --> 0:18:08,000
He is not a doubting Thomas.

357
0:18:08.986,000 --> 0:18:11,000
He believes, with veneration and reverence,

358
0:18:12.192,000 --> 0:18:15,000
in what his ancestors and the spirits taught him.

359
0:18:15.563,000 --> 0:18:17,000
We can't do it, so let's look into the forest.

360
0:18:18.337,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Even with Hubble up there --

361
0:18:21.543,000 --> 0:18:23,000
this is a bird's-eye view, right?

362
0:18:23.888,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Even when this happens,

363
0:18:25.758,000 --> 0:18:28,000
we also see something that we don't know.

364
0:18:28.862,000 --> 0:18:3,000
The Spanish called it the green inferno.

365
0:18:31.148,000 --> 0:18:33,000
If you go out there into the bushes and get lost,

366
0:18:34.018,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and, let's say, if you head west,

367
0:18:36.256,000 --> 0:18:37,000
it's 900 kilometers to Colombia,

368
0:18:38.225,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and another 1,000 to somewhere else.

369
0:18:40.162,000 --> 0:18:43,000
So, you can figure out why they called it the green inferno.

370
0:18:43.309,000 --> 0:18:46,000
But go and look at what is in there.

371
0:18:46.563,000 --> 0:18:47,000
It is a live carpet.

372
0:18:48.054,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Each color you see is a tree species.

373
0:18:50.35,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Each tree, each tree top,

374
0:18:52.135,000 --> 0:18:56,000
has up to 10,000 species of insects in it,

375
0:18:56.691,000 --> 0:19:,000
let alone the millions of species of fungi, bacteria, etc.

376
0:19:00.749,000 --> 0:19:01,000
All invisible.

377
0:19:02.401,000 --> 0:19:05,000
All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us

378
0:19:05.645,000 --> 0:19:07,000
than the galaxies billions of light years away from the Earth,

379
0:19:08.554,000 --> 0:19:11,000
which Hubble brings to our newspapers everyday.

380
0:19:12.983,000 --> 0:19:13,000
I'm going to end my talk here --

381
0:19:14.853,000 --> 0:19:15,000
I have a few seconds left --

382
0:19:16.664,000 --> 0:19:18,000
by showing you this wonderful being.

383
0:19:18.708,000 --> 0:19:2,000
When we see the morpho butterfly in the forest,

384
0:19:21.596,000 --> 0:19:23,000
we feel like someone's left open the door to heaven,

385
0:19:24.431,000 --> 0:19:27,000
and this creature escaped from there, because it's so beautiful.

386
0:19:27.632,000 --> 0:19:29,000
However, I cannot finish

387
0:19:30.017,000 --> 0:19:32,000
without showing you a tech side.

388
0:19:32.548,000 --> 0:19:35,000
We are tech-arrogant.

389
0:19:35.758,000 --> 0:19:38,000
We deprive nature of its technology.

390
0:19:39.049,000 --> 0:19:4,000
A robotic hand is technological,

391
0:19:40.773,000 --> 0:19:41,000
mine is biological,

392
0:19:42.15,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and we don't think about it anymore.

393
0:19:43.913,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Let's then look at the morpho butterfly,

394
0:19:46.015,000 --> 0:19:51,000
an example of an invisible technological competence of life,

395
0:19:51.456,000 --> 0:19:55,000
which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet,

396
0:19:56.083,000 --> 0:19:58,000
and let's zoom in on it. Again, Hubble is there.

397
0:19:58.348,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Let's get into the butterfly's wings.

398
0:20:00.262,000 --> 0:20:04,000
Scholars have tried to explain: Why is it blue?

399
0:20:04.465,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Let's zoom in on it.

400
0:20:05.935,000 --> 0:20:1,000
What you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates

401
0:20:11.011,000 --> 0:20:14,000
the best architects in the world.

402
0:20:14.043,000 --> 0:20:16,000
All of this on a tiny scale.

403
0:20:16.44,000 --> 0:20:19,000
Besides its beauty and functioning, there is another side to it.

404
0:20:19.968,000 --> 0:20:21,000
In nature,

405
0:20:22.166,000 --> 0:20:26,000
all that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function.

406
0:20:26.529,000 --> 0:20:3,000
This function of the morpho butterfly — it is not blue;

407
0:20:31.019,000 --> 0:20:32,000
it does not have blue pigments.

408
0:20:32.673,000 --> 0:20:36,000
It has photonic crystals on its surface, according to people who studied it,

409
0:20:36.717,000 --> 0:20:38,000
which are extremely sophisticated crystals.

410
0:20:38.968,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Our technology had nothing like that at the time.

411
0:20:42.427,000 --> 0:20:44,000
Hitachi has now made a monitor

412
0:20:45.208,000 --> 0:20:46,000
that uses this technology,

413
0:20:46.563,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and it is used in optical fibers to transmit --

414
0:20:48.94,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Janine Benyus, who's been here several times, talks about it: biomimetics.

415
0:20:53.35,000 --> 0:20:54,000
My time's up.

416
0:20:54.702,000 --> 0:20:59,000
Then, I'll wrap it up with what is at the base of this capacity,

417
0:21:00.012,000 --> 0:21:02,000
of this competence of biodiversity,

418
0:21:02.584,000 --> 0:21:04,000
producing all these wonderful services:

419
0:21:05.006,000 --> 0:21:06,000
the living cell.

420
0:21:06.913,000 --> 0:21:09,000
It is a structure with a few microns, which is an internal wonder.

421
0:21:10.427,000 --> 0:21:13,000
There are TED Talks about it. I won't talk much longer,

422
0:21:13.454,000 --> 0:21:16,000
but each person in this room, including myself,

423
0:21:16.628,000 --> 0:21:19,000
has 100 trillion of these micromachines in their body,

424
0:21:20.319,000 --> 0:21:22,000
so that we can enjoy well-being.

425
0:21:23.159,000 --> 0:21:25,000
Imagine what is out there in the Amazon forest:

426
0:21:25.916,000 --> 0:21:29,000
100 trillion. This is greater than the number of stars in the sky.

427
0:21:29.927,000 --> 0:21:31,000
And we are not aware of it.

428
0:21:31.985,000 --> 0:21:32,000
Thank you so much. (Applause)

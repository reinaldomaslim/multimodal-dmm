1
0:00:12.877,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Each of these songs represents a scene, a movement,

2
0:00:16.268,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in some cases, a sonic revolution

3
0:00:18.763,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that completely altered the course of popular music.

4
0:00:22.524,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They're all also calling cards, almost, for those cities,

5
0:00:26.333,000 --> 0:00:28,000
songs totally linked with their city's identity,

6
0:00:28.999,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and it might be why you probably consider them to be music cities.

7
0:00:33.827,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now, the magical mythical thing, the thing we kind of all love

8
0:00:37.256,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about stories like these

9
0:00:38.519,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is that those cities weren't doing anything in particular

10
0:00:42.479,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to make those moments happen.

11
0:00:45.155,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There's no formula for capturing lightning in a bottle.

12
0:00:48.828,000 --> 0:00:5,000
A formula didn't give us grunge music

13
0:00:51.164,000 --> 0:00:53,000
or introduce Tupac to Dr. Dre,

14
0:00:53.785,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and there's definitely no blueprint for how to open your record business

15
0:00:57.849,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in a South Memphis neighborhood

16
0:00:59.39,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that, turns out, is home to Booker T. Jones,

17
0:01:02.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
William Bell and Albert King.

18
0:01:05.121,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So this is just something that happens, then, right?

19
0:01:08.636,000 --> 0:01:1,000
When the stars perfectly align,

20
0:01:10.977,000 --> 0:01:12,000
great music just happens.

21
0:01:13.461,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And in the meantime, New York and Nashville

22
0:01:16.017,000 --> 0:01:18,000
can churn out the hits that come through our radios,

23
0:01:18.612,000 --> 0:01:19,000
define our generations

24
0:01:19.867,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and soundtrack our weddings and our funerals

25
0:01:22.32,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and everything in between.

26
0:01:25.057,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Well, I don't know about you,

27
0:01:26.478,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but the very idea of that is just deadly boring to me.

28
0:01:30.697,000 --> 0:01:35,000
There are musicians all around you, making powerful, important music,

29
0:01:36.228,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and thanks to the internet and its limitless possibilities

30
0:01:39.765,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for creators to create music

31
0:01:41.745,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and fans to discover that music,

32
0:01:44.149,000 --> 0:01:47,000
those zeitgeist songs don't have to be handed down to us

33
0:01:48.14,000 --> 0:01:5,000
from some conference room full of songwriters

34
0:01:50.806,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in a corporate high-rise.

35
0:01:53.411,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But also, and more importantly,

36
0:01:56.091,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we can't decide that it's just something that happens,

37
0:01:59.322,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because music is about so much more than hits,

38
0:02:03.778,000 --> 0:02:05,000
those big, iconic moments that change everything.

39
0:02:07.415,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's more than just entertainment.

40
0:02:09.944,000 --> 0:02:1,000
For so many of us,

41
0:02:11.673,000 --> 0:02:14,000
music is truly a way to navigate life.

42
0:02:16.269,000 --> 0:02:17,000
A means of self-expression, sure,

43
0:02:17.977,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but it also helps us find our self-worth and figure out who we are.

44
0:02:22.745,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It connects us with other people as almost nothing else can,

45
0:02:26.396,000 --> 0:02:27,000
across language barriers,

46
0:02:28.254,000 --> 0:02:31,000
across social and cultural and economic divides.

47
0:02:31.879,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Music makes us smarter and healthier and happier.

48
0:02:37.046,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Music is necessary.

49
0:02:40.338,000 --> 0:02:42,000
What if you lived in a city that believed that,

50
0:02:43.719,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that said, "We're not waiting for that hit song to define us.

51
0:02:47.965,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We're a music city because music is necessary."

52
0:02:53.142,000 --> 0:02:56,000
By seeing music as necessary, a city can build two things:

53
0:02:57.547,000 --> 0:03:01,000
first, an ecosystem to support the development of professional musicians

54
0:03:02.396,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and music business;

55
0:03:04.008,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and second, a receptive and engaged audience to sustain them.

56
0:03:09.222,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And those are the two critical elements of a music city,

57
0:03:13.784,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a city whose leaders recognize the importance of music

58
0:03:17.728,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for our development as individuals,

59
0:03:20.07,000 --> 0:03:22,000
our connection as a community

60
0:03:22.174,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and our viability as a vibrant place to live.

61
0:03:26.209,000 --> 0:03:28,000
See, smart cities, music cities,

62
0:03:28.307,000 --> 0:03:32,000
know that thriving nightlife, a creative class, culture

63
0:03:33.069,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is what attracts young, talented people to cities.

64
0:03:37.251,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's what brings that lightning.

65
0:03:40.536,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And no, we can't predict the next egg that will hatch,

66
0:03:45.305,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but we can create a city that acts like an incubator.

67
0:03:48.652,000 --> 0:03:51,000
To do that, first, we've got to know what we've got.

68
0:03:51.812,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That means identifying and quantifying our assets.

69
0:03:55.004,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We need to know them backward and forward,

70
0:03:57.099,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from who and what and where they are to what their impact is on the economy.

71
0:04:01.439,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Let's count our recording studios and our record labels,

72
0:04:04.594,000 --> 0:04:07,000
our historic landmarks and our hard-core punk clubs.

73
0:04:07.722,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We should count monthly free jazz nights and weekly folk jams,

74
0:04:11.818,000 --> 0:04:14,000
music schools, artist development, instrument shops,

75
0:04:15.265,000 --> 0:04:17,000
every lathe and every luthier,

76
0:04:17.399,000 --> 0:04:2,000
music museums open year round

77
0:04:21.058,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and music festivals open just one weekend a year.

78
0:04:25.222,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now, ideally through this process, we'll create an actual asset map,

79
0:04:28.626,000 --> 0:04:29,000
dropping a pin for each one,

80
0:04:30.446,000 --> 0:04:32,000
allowing us to see exactly what we've got

81
0:04:33.281,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and where organic momentum is already happening.

82
0:04:36.839,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Because it's not enough to paint in broad strokes here.

83
0:04:39.611,000 --> 0:04:42,000
When it comes to specific support for music locally

84
0:04:42.897,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and a broad understanding of a music brand nationally,

85
0:04:46.599,000 --> 0:04:47,000
you've got to have the receipts.

86
0:04:49.178,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Next, we'll need to identify our challenges.

87
0:04:52.781,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, it's important to know that, for the most part,

88
0:04:55.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this won't be just the opposite of step one.

89
0:04:58.098,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We won't gain a whole lot

90
0:04:59.385,000 --> 0:05:01,000
by simply thinking about what's missing from our map.

91
0:05:03.119,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Instead, we need to approach this more holistically.

92
0:05:06.531,000 --> 0:05:08,000
There are lots of music venues on our map.

93
0:05:08.786,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Awesome.

94
0:05:09.961,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But are they struggling?

95
0:05:11.914,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Do we have a venue ladder,

96
0:05:13.813,000 --> 0:05:17,000
which just means, can an artist starting out at a coffee house open mic

97
0:05:18.551,000 --> 0:05:2,000
see a clear path for how they'll grow

98
0:05:20.821,000 --> 0:05:23,000
from that 25-seat room to a hundred-seat room and so on?

99
0:05:24.817,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Or are we expecting them to go from a coffeehouse to a coliseum?

100
0:05:29.658,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Maybe our challenges lie in city infrastructure:

101
0:05:32.586,000 --> 0:05:34,000
public transportation, affordable housing.

102
0:05:35.586,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Maybe, like in London,

103
0:05:37.181,000 --> 0:05:41,000
where the number of music venues went from 400 in 2010

104
0:05:42.085,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to 100 in 2015,

105
0:05:44.523,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we need to think about protections against gentrification.

106
0:05:48.244,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The mayor of London, in December of last year,

107
0:05:50.756,000 --> 0:05:53,000
actually added something called the "Agent of Change" principle

108
0:05:54.212,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to the city's comprehensive plan.

109
0:05:56.219,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And the name says it all.

110
0:05:57.467,000 --> 0:06:,000
If a real-estate developer wants to build condos

111
0:06:00.614,000 --> 0:06:02,000
next to an existing music venue,

112
0:06:02.891,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the developer is the agent of change.

113
0:06:05.199,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They have to take the necessary steps for noise mitigation.

114
0:06:09.096,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Next, and this is a very big one,

115
0:06:11.144,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we need leadership, and we need a strategy.

116
0:06:14.531,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now we know there's a lot of magic in this mix:

117
0:06:17.367,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a lot of right people, right place, right time.

118
0:06:20.168,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And that will never stop being an important element

119
0:06:22.772,000 --> 0:06:23,000
of the way music is made,

120
0:06:24.767,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the way some of the best, most enduring music is made.

121
0:06:28.973,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But there cannot be a leadership vacuum.

122
0:06:32.142,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In 2018, thriving music cities don't often happen

123
0:06:35.682,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and don't have to happen accidentally.

124
0:06:38.904,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We need elected officials who recognize the power of music

125
0:06:43.672,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and elevate the voices of creatives,

126
0:06:45.887,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and they're ready to put a strategy in place.

127
0:06:48.387,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In music cities, from Berlin to Paris to Bogotá,

128
0:06:51.524,000 --> 0:06:52,000
music advisory councils

129
0:06:53.237,000 --> 0:06:56,000
ensure that musicians have a seat at the table.

130
0:06:56.859,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They're volunteer councils,

131
0:06:58.186,000 --> 0:07:,000
and they work directly with a designated advocate

132
0:07:00.694,000 --> 0:07:03,000
inside of city hall or even the chamber of commerce.

133
0:07:04.627,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The strongest strategies will build music community supports like this one inward

134
0:07:09.127,000 --> 0:07:1,000
while also exporting music outward.

135
0:07:11.628,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They go hand in hand.

136
0:07:13.173,000 --> 0:07:17,000
When we look inward, we create that place that musicians want to live.

137
0:07:17.267,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And when we look outward,

138
0:07:18.711,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we build opportunities for them to advance their career

139
0:07:21.774,000 --> 0:07:24,000
while also driving attention back to our city

140
0:07:24.829,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and leveraging music as a talent-attraction tool.

141
0:07:28.352,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And here's something else that will help with that:

142
0:07:30.844,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we've got to figure out who we are.

143
0:07:33.662,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, when I say Austin,

144
0:07:35.908,000 --> 0:07:37,000
you probably think "live music capital."

145
0:07:38.619,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And why?

146
0:07:39.92,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Because in 1991, leadership in Austin saw something percolating

147
0:07:44.581,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with an existing asset, and they chose to own it.

148
0:07:48.017,000 --> 0:07:51,000
By recognizing that momentum, naming it and claiming it,

149
0:07:51.566,000 --> 0:07:54,000
they inevitably caused more live music venues to open,

150
0:07:54.919,000 --> 0:07:57,000
existing spaces to add live music to their repertoire,

151
0:07:58.155,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and they created a swell of civic buy-in around the idea,

152
0:08:01.863,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which meant that it wasn't just a slogan in some tourism pamphlet.

153
0:08:05.838,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It was something that locals really started to believe and take pride in.

154
0:08:10.893,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Now, generally speaking, what Austin created

155
0:08:13.124,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is just an assets-based narrative.

156
0:08:16.171,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And when we think back to step one,

157
0:08:18.164,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we know that every city will not tick every box.

158
0:08:21.83,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Many cities won't have recording studios like Memphis

159
0:08:25.398,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or a songwriter and publishing scene like Nashville,

160
0:08:28.613,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and that's not a dealbreaker.

161
0:08:30.182,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We simply have to find the momentum happening in our city.

162
0:08:33.927,000 --> 0:08:37,000
What are our unique assets in comparison to no other place?

163
0:08:40.651,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So, if all of that sounds like something you'd like to happen where you live,

164
0:08:45.27,000 --> 0:08:48,000
here are three things you can do to move the needle.

165
0:08:48.496,000 --> 0:08:51,000
First, you can use your feet, your ears and your dollars.

166
0:08:52.337,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Show up. Be that receptive and engaged audience

167
0:08:55.892,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that is so necessary for a music city to thrive.

168
0:08:59.138,000 --> 0:09:,000
Pay a cover charge.

169
0:09:00.574,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Buy a record.

170
0:09:01.752,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Discover new music, and please, take your friends.

171
0:09:05.125,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Two, you can use your voice.

172
0:09:07.767,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Buy into the assets-based narrative.

173
0:09:10.656,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Talk about and celebrate what your city has.

174
0:09:14.765,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And three, you can use your vote.

175
0:09:17.344,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Seek out leadership that doesn't just pay lip service to your city's music,

176
0:09:21.09,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but recognizes its power

177
0:09:22.707,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and is prepared to put a strategy in place

178
0:09:25.294,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to elevate it, grow it and build collaboration.

179
0:09:29.697,000 --> 0:09:32,000
There really is no telling what city could be defined

180
0:09:33.22,000 --> 0:09:37,000
by a certain scene or a certain song in the next decade,

181
0:09:37.627,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but as much as we absolutely cannot predict that,

182
0:09:40.763,000 --> 0:09:42,000
what we absolutely can predict

183
0:09:43.043,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is what happens when we treat music as necessary

184
0:09:46.456,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and we work to build a music city.

185
0:09:49.027,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And that is a place where I want to live.

186
0:09:51.963,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Thank you.

187
0:09:53.138,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

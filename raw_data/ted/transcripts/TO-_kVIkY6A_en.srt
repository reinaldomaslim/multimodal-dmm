1
0:00:13.145,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Let's say you despise

2
0:00:15.407,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Western democracy.

3
0:00:18.412,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Democracy, in all its trappings,

4
0:00:20.648,000 --> 0:00:22,000
free elections, town halls,

5
0:00:23.335,000 --> 0:00:25,000
endless debates about the proper role of government.

6
0:00:26.195,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Too messy,

7
0:00:27.552,000 --> 0:00:28,000
too unpredictable,

8
0:00:28.732,000 --> 0:00:29,000
too constraining for your taste.

9
0:00:31.531,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And the way these democracies band together and lecture everyone else

10
0:00:35.805,000 --> 0:00:37,000
about individual rights and freedoms --

11
0:00:38.12,000 --> 0:00:4,000
it gets under your skin.

12
0:00:41.2,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So what to do about it?

13
0:00:43.961,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You can call out the hypocrisy and failures of Western democracies

14
0:00:48.523,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and explain how your way is better,

15
0:00:51.776,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but that's never really worked for you.

16
0:00:54.536,000 --> 0:00:56,000
What if you could get the people

17
0:00:57.236,000 --> 0:01:,000
whose support is the very foundation of these democracies

18
0:01:00.4,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to start questioning the system?

19
0:01:04.262,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Make the idea occur in their own minds

20
0:01:06.734,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that democracy and its institutions are failing them,

21
0:01:10.87,000 --> 0:01:12,000
their elite are corrupt puppet masters

22
0:01:13.154,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the country they knew is in free fall.

23
0:01:17.603,000 --> 0:01:18,000
To do that,

24
0:01:18.901,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you'll need to infiltrate the information spheres

25
0:01:21.923,000 --> 0:01:22,000
of these democracies.

26
0:01:23.249,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You'll need to turn their most powerful asset --

27
0:01:26.974,000 --> 0:01:27,000
an open mind --

28
0:01:28.903,000 --> 0:01:29,000
into their greatest vulnerability.

29
0:01:31.908,000 --> 0:01:33,000
You'll need people to question the truth.

30
0:01:35.922,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, you'll be familiar of hacking and leaks that happened in 2016.

31
0:01:40.688,000 --> 0:01:42,000
One was the Democratic National Committee's networks,

32
0:01:43.534,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the personal email accounts of its staff,

33
0:01:46.389,000 --> 0:01:47,000
later released on WikiLeaks.

34
0:01:48.844,000 --> 0:01:5,000
After that, various online personas,

35
0:01:51.194,000 --> 0:01:55,000
like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal who didn't speak Romanian,

36
0:01:56.098,000 --> 0:01:59,000
aggressively pushed news of these leaks to journalists.

37
0:02:00.811,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The media took the bait.

38
0:02:02.631,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They were consumed by how much the DNC hated Bernie.

39
0:02:06.738,000 --> 0:02:1,000
At the time, it was that narrative that far outshined the news

40
0:02:11.002,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that a group of Russian government sponsored hackers

41
0:02:14.366,000 --> 0:02:17,000
who we called "Advanced Persistent Threat 28,"

42
0:02:17.623,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or "APT28" for short,

43
0:02:20.228,000 --> 0:02:23,000
was carrying out these operations against the US.

44
0:02:24.012,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And there was no shortage of evidence.

45
0:02:26.804,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This group of Russian government hackers hadn't just appeared out of nowhere

46
0:02:30.546,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in 2016.

47
0:02:31.734,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We had started tracking this group back in 2014.

48
0:02:34.915,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And the tools that APT28 used to compromise its victims' networks

49
0:02:39.82,000 --> 0:02:42,000
demonstrated a thoughtful, well-resourced effort

50
0:02:43.437,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that had taken place for now over a decade

51
0:02:46.287,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in Moscow's time zone

52
0:02:47.81,000 --> 0:02:48,000
from about 9 am to 6 pm.

53
0:02:50.915,000 --> 0:02:55,000
APT28 loved to prey on the emails and contacts of journalists in Chechnya,

54
0:02:56.021,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the Georgian government, eastern European defense attachés --

55
0:02:59.552,000 --> 0:03:03,000
all targets with an undeniable interest to the Russian government.

56
0:03:03.617,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We weren't the only ones onto this.

57
0:03:05.601,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Governments, research teams across the world,

58
0:03:09.042,000 --> 0:03:1,000
were coming to similar conclusions

59
0:03:10.973,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and observing the same types of operations.

60
0:03:14.152,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But what Russia was doing in 2016

61
0:03:17.284,000 --> 0:03:18,000
went far beyond espionage.

62
0:03:19.88,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The DNC hack was just one of many where stolen data was posted online

63
0:03:26.522,000 --> 0:03:28,000
accompanied by a sensational narrative,

64
0:03:28.8,000 --> 0:03:29,000
then amplified in social media

65
0:03:30.762,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for lightning-speed adoption by the media.

66
0:03:36.656,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This didn't ring the alarm bells

67
0:03:39.222,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that a nation-state was trying to interfere with the credibility

68
0:03:43.737,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of another's internal affairs.

69
0:03:45.685,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So why, collectively, did we not see this coming?

70
0:03:50.931,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Why did it take months before Americans understood

71
0:03:54.837,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that they were under a state-sponsored information attack?

72
0:04:00.276,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The easy answer is politics.

73
0:04:01.939,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The Obama Administration was caught in a perfect catch-22.

74
0:04:05.886,000 --> 0:04:09,000
By raising the specter that the Russian government was interfering

75
0:04:10.308,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in the US presidential campaign,

76
0:04:12.424,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the Administration risked appearing to meddle in the campaign itself.

77
0:04:17.812,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But the better answer, I think,

78
0:04:19.891,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is that the US and the West were utterly unequipped

79
0:04:23.768,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to recognize and respond to a modern information operation,

80
0:04:28.446,000 --> 0:04:33,000
despite the fact that the US had wielded information

81
0:04:33.582,000 --> 0:04:36,000
with devastating success in an era not so long ago.

82
0:04:38.104,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Look, so while the US and the West spent the last 20 years

83
0:04:42.022,000 --> 0:04:43,000
caught up in cybersecurity --

84
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:44,000
what networks to harden,

85
0:04:45.119,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which infrastructure to deem critical,

86
0:04:47.452,000 --> 0:04:5,000
how to set up armies of cyber warriors and cyber commands --

87
0:04:51.469,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Russia was thinking in far more consequential terms.

88
0:04:57.142,000 --> 0:05:,000
Before the first iPhone even hit the shelf,

89
0:05:00.493,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity

90
0:05:04.99,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that technology provided

91
0:05:06.439,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and the inter-communication and instant communication it provided us.

92
0:05:12.311,000 --> 0:05:15,000
As our realities are increasingly based on the information

93
0:05:15.552,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that we're consuming at the palm of our hand

94
0:05:17.932,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and from the news feeds that we're scanning

95
0:05:20.209,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and the hashtags and stories that we see trending,

96
0:05:23.199,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the Russian government was the first to recognize

97
0:05:26.15,000 --> 0:05:27,000
how this evolution

98
0:05:28.049,000 --> 0:05:32,000
had turned your mind into the most exploitable device on the planet.

99
0:05:34.774,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And your mind is particularly exploitable

100
0:05:37.262,000 --> 0:05:4,000
if you're accustomed to an unfettered flow of information,

101
0:05:41.061,000 --> 0:05:44,000
now increasingly curated to your own tastes.

102
0:05:47.064,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This panorama of information that's so interesting to you

103
0:05:49.979,000 --> 0:05:54,000
gives a state, or anyone for that matter, a perfect back door into your mind.

104
0:05:56.798,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It's this new brand of state-sponsored information operations

105
0:06:00.5,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that can be that much more successful,

106
0:06:02.659,000 --> 0:06:03,000
more insidious,

107
0:06:03.985,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and harder for the target audience -- that includes the media --

108
0:06:08.095,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to decipher and characterize.

109
0:06:10.522,000 --> 0:06:12,000
If you can get a hashtag trending on Twitter,

110
0:06:12.739,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or chum the waters with fake news

111
0:06:15.878,000 --> 0:06:17,000
directed to audiences primed to receive it,

112
0:06:18.343,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or drive journalists to dissect terabytes of email

113
0:06:21.244,000 --> 0:06:22,000
for a cent of impropriety --

114
0:06:23.243,000 --> 0:06:25,000
all tactics used in Russian operations --

115
0:06:25.909,000 --> 0:06:29,000
then you've got a shot at effectively camouflaging your operations

116
0:06:30.224,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in the mind of your target.

117
0:06:33.687,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is what Russia's long called "reflexive control."

118
0:06:38.669,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's the ability to use information on someone else

119
0:06:42.475,000 --> 0:06:44,000
so that they make a decision

120
0:06:44.683,000 --> 0:06:45,000
on their own accord

121
0:06:46.258,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that's favorable to you.

122
0:06:50.111,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This is nation-state-grade image control and perception management,

123
0:06:54.214,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and it's conducted by any means,

124
0:06:56.556,000 --> 0:07:,000
with any tools, network-based or otherwise, that will achieve it.

125
0:07:01.631,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Take this for another example.

126
0:07:03.085,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In early February 2014, a few weeks before Russia would invade Crimea,

127
0:07:08.062,000 --> 0:07:1,000
a phone call is posted on YouTube.

128
0:07:10.315,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In it, there's two US diplomats.

129
0:07:12.714,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They sound like they're playing kingmaker in Ukraine,

130
0:07:15.932,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and worse, they curse the EU for its lack of speed and leadership

131
0:07:19.399,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in resolving the crisis.

132
0:07:21.887,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The media covers the phone call,

133
0:07:24.37,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash

134
0:07:29.003,000 --> 0:07:31,000
leaves Washington and Europe reeling.

135
0:07:32.782,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And it creates a fissured response and a feckless attitude

136
0:07:36.885,000 --> 0:07:38,000
towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.

137
0:07:39.938,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Mission accomplished.

138
0:07:42.468,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So while hacked phone calls and emails and networks

139
0:07:45.872,000 --> 0:07:47,000
keep grabbing the headlines,

140
0:07:47.942,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the real operations are the ones

141
0:07:50.6,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that are influencing the decisions you make

142
0:07:53.432,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the opinions you hold,

143
0:07:55.274,000 --> 0:07:58,000
all in the service of a nation-state's strategic interest.

144
0:07:59.764,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This is power in the information age.

145
0:08:03.347,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And this information is all that much more seductive,

146
0:08:06.815,000 --> 0:08:09,000
all that much easier to take at face value and pass on,

147
0:08:10.626,000 --> 0:08:11,000
when it's authentic.

148
0:08:12.697,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Who's not interested in the truth that's presented in phone calls and emails

149
0:08:18.115,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that were never intended for public consumption?

150
0:08:22.061,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But how meaningful is that truth

151
0:08:23.839,000 --> 0:08:25,000
if you don't know why it's being revealed to you?

152
0:08:27.786,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We must recognize that this place where we're increasingly living,

153
0:08:31.998,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which we've quaintly termed "cyberspace,"

154
0:08:34.307,000 --> 0:08:36,000
isn't defined by ones and zeroes,

155
0:08:36.537,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but by information and the people behind it.

156
0:08:40.648,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This is far more than a network of computers and devices.

157
0:08:43.815,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is a network composed of minds

158
0:08:46.991,000 --> 0:08:48,000
interacting with computers and devices.

159
0:08:50.77,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And for this network,

160
0:08:54.448,000 --> 0:08:57,000
there's no encryption, there's no firewall,

161
0:08:57.853,000 --> 0:08:58,000
no two-factor authentication,

162
0:08:59.6,000 --> 0:09:01,000
no password complex enough to protect you.

163
0:09:03.388,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What you have for defense

164
0:09:05.826,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is far stronger, it's more adaptable, it's always running the latest version.

165
0:09:11.13,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's the ability to think critically:

166
0:09:14.079,000 --> 0:09:15,000
call out falsehood,

167
0:09:15.822,000 --> 0:09:16,000
press for the facts.

168
0:09:18.622,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And above all, you must have the courage

169
0:09:22.839,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to unflinchingly pursue the truth.

170
0:09:27.572,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Applause)

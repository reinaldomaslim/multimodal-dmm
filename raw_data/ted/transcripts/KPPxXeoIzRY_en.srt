0:00:15.756,000 --> 0:00:16,000
As you might imagine, I'm absolutely passionate

3
0:00:17.249,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about dance. I'm passionate about making it,

4
0:00:19.454,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about watching it, about encouraging others

5
0:00:22.058,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to participate in it,

6
0:00:23.927,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I'm also really passionate about creativity.

7
0:00:26.55,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Creativity for me is something that's absolutely critical,

8
0:00:30.667,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I think it's something that you can teach.

9
0:00:33.052,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I think the technicities of creativity can be taught

10
0:00:35.313,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and shared, and I think you can find out things

11
0:00:37.479,000 --> 0:00:39,000
about your own personal physical signature,

12
0:00:39.748,000 --> 0:00:4,000
your own cognitive habits, and use that as

13
0:00:41.66,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a point of departure to misbehave beautifully.

14
0:00:45.112,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big

15
0:00:49.515,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in those days: "Grease," "Saturday Night Fever,"

16
0:00:51.986,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me

17
0:00:54.663,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to start dancing. My parents were very up for me going.

18
0:00:57.443,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go,

19
0:01:00.305,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to try, to try. I had an opportunity, an access

20
0:01:04.53,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to a local dance studio, and I had an enlightened teacher

21
0:01:08.121,000 --> 0:01:11,000
who allowed me to make up my own and invent

22
0:01:11.226,000 --> 0:01:13,000
my own dances, so what she did was let me make up

23
0:01:14.22,000 --> 0:01:16,000
my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach

24
0:01:17.169,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to my peers.

25
0:01:18.541,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And that was the very first time that I found an opportunity

26
0:01:21.31,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to feel that I was able to express my own voice,

27
0:01:24.195,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.

28
0:01:27.013,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I feel like I've got something to say and something to share.

29
0:01:30.029,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed

30
0:01:33.606,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with the technology of the body.

31
0:01:35.193,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have,

32
0:01:38.489,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way

33
0:01:41.588,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of communicating ideas through the body to audiences

34
0:01:44.886,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that might move them, touch them,

35
0:01:47.039,000 --> 0:01:5,000
help them think differently about things.

36
0:01:50.141,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So for me, choreography is very much a process

37
0:01:52.743,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of physical thinking. It's very much in mind,

38
0:01:56.152,000 --> 0:01:59,000
as well as in body, and it's a collaborative process.

39
0:01:59.415,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's something that I have to do with other people.

40
0:02:01.241,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.

41
0:02:03.995,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I work often with designers and visual artists,

42
0:02:06.593,000 --> 0:02:08,000
obviously dancers and other choreographers,

43
0:02:09.201,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but also, more and more, with economists,

44
0:02:13.572,000 --> 0:02:17,000
anthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists,

45
0:02:17.878,000 --> 0:02:19,000
people really who come from very different domains of

46
0:02:20.645,000 --> 0:02:22,000
expertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear

47
0:02:23.638,000 --> 0:02:25,000
on a different kind of creative process.

48
0:02:26.026,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What I thought we would do today a little bit is

49
0:02:29.229,000 --> 0:02:31,000
explore this idea of physical thinking,

50
0:02:31.49,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we're all experts in physical thinking.

51
0:02:33.291,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Yeah, you all have a body, right?

52
0:02:34.669,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And we all know what that body is like in the real world,

53
0:02:36.86,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so one of the aspects of physical thinking

54
0:02:38.554,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception,

55
0:02:41.468,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the sense of my own body in the space in the real world.

56
0:02:44.533,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So, we all understand what it feels like to know

57
0:02:47.919,000 --> 0:02:48,000
where the ends of your fingers are

58
0:02:49.272,000 --> 0:02:5,000
when you hold out your arms, yeah?

59
0:02:51.269,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup,

60
0:02:54.084,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.

61
0:02:55.994,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So we're experts in physical thinking already.

62
0:02:57.952,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We just don't think about our bodies very much.

63
0:02:59.988,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We only think about them when they go wrong, so, when

64
0:03:03.093,000 --> 0:03:05,000
there's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack,

65
0:03:05.331,000 --> 0:03:07,000
then you become really very aware of your bodies.

66
0:03:07.796,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But how is it that we can start to think about using

67
0:03:10.083,000 --> 0:03:13,000
choreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm

68
0:03:13.491,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the ways in which we think about things more generally?

69
0:03:15.849,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.

70
0:03:18.805,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not.

71
0:03:21.108,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I'll just be doing it.

72
0:03:23.083,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions

73
0:03:25.17,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of physical thinking to make something.

74
0:03:26.814,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina.

75
0:03:29.93,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause)

76
0:03:32.778,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They have no idea what we're going to do.

77
0:03:35.382,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So this is not the type of choreography where

78
0:03:37.726,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I already have in mind what I'm going to make,

79
0:03:40.07,000 --> 0:03:42,000
where I've fixed the routine in my head

80
0:03:42.611,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and I'm just going to teach it to them,

81
0:03:44.201,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it.

82
0:03:46.51,000 --> 0:03:48,000
That's not the methodology at all that we work with.

83
0:03:49.444,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But what's important about it is how it is that they're

84
0:03:53.777,000 --> 0:03:55,000
grasping information, how they're taking information,

85
0:03:55.824,000 --> 0:03:57,000
how they're using it, and how they're thinking with it.

86
0:03:57.955,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I'm going to start really, really simply.

87
0:03:59.403,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Usually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought

88
0:04:02.38,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it,

89
0:04:05.484,000 --> 0:04:07,000
it's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something

90
0:04:07.833,000 --> 0:04:09,000
very simply, where you take one idea from a body,

91
0:04:10.622,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and it happens to be my body, and translate that

92
0:04:12.626,000 --> 0:04:14,000
into somebody else's body,

93
0:04:14.818,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy.

94
0:04:18.172,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like,

95
0:04:20.952,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that I'm going to just take the letter "T" and I'm going

96
0:04:23.19,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in

97
0:04:26.065,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the real world. So I absolutely see a letter "T" in front of me.

98
0:04:29.969,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Yeah? It's absolutely there.

99
0:04:31.374,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?

100
0:04:34.354,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do

101
0:04:36.279,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with it, and I can start to describe it, so I can describe it

102
0:04:39.214,000 --> 0:04:41,000
very simply. I can describe it in my arms, right?

103
0:04:42.185,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.

104
0:04:44.863,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa.

105
0:04:47.05,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Okay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah?

106
0:04:49.358,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It gives me something to do, something to work towards.

107
0:04:52.366,000 --> 0:04:54,000
If I were to take that letter "T" and flatten it down

108
0:04:54.484,000 --> 0:04:56,000
on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor,

109
0:04:57.42,000 --> 0:04:58,000
all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee,

110
0:04:58.893,000 --> 0:05:,000
yeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together,

111
0:05:01.444,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something.

112
0:05:05.004,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so

113
0:05:07.465,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something,

114
0:05:10.065,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it,

115
0:05:12.943,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they're going to snapshot it, they're going to take

116
0:05:14.587,000 --> 0:05:16,000
aspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory

117
0:05:17.566,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and they're holding onto memory? Yeah?

118
0:05:19.682,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And we'll see what we come up with.

119
0:05:21.086,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So just have a little watch about how they're, how they're

120
0:05:23.241,000 --> 0:05:24,000
accessing this and what they're doing,

121
0:05:24.549,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and I'm just going to take this letter "T," the letter "E,"

122
0:05:26.51,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and the letter "D," to make something. Okay. Here goes.

123
0:05:29.541,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So I have to get myself in the zone. Right.

124
0:05:47.137,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's a bit of a cross of my arm.

125
0:05:55.698,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So all I'm doing is exploring this space of "T"

126
0:06:00.349,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and flashing through it with some action.

127
0:06:05.664,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I'm not remembering what I'm doing.

128
0:06:08.067,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I'm just working on my task. My task is this "T."

129
0:06:10.83,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Going to watch it from the side, whoa.

130
0:06:16.207,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Strike moment.

131
0:06:18.077,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That's it.

132
0:06:23.049,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So we're starting to build a phrase.

133
0:06:27.391,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So what they're doing, let's see, something like that,

134
0:06:29.344,000 --> 0:06:32,000
so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement

135
0:06:32.491,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and they're generating it into a phrase.

136
0:06:34.396,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?

137
0:06:36.654,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I'm not asking them to copy exactly.

138
0:06:38.944,000 --> 0:06:4,000
They're using the information that they receive

139
0:06:41.301,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to generate the beginnings of a phrase.

140
0:06:44.617,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I can watch that and that can tell me something

141
0:06:46.538,000 --> 0:06:48,000
about how it is that they're moving.

142
0:06:49.291,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Yeah, they're super quick, right?

143
0:06:52.371,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it

144
0:06:56.155,000 --> 0:06:58,000
into something that's physical.

145
0:07:00.876,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Some dancers, when they're watching action,

146
0:07:03.46,000 --> 0:07:05,000
take the overall shape, the arc of the movement,

147
0:07:05.935,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the kinetic sense of the movement,

148
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and use that for memory.

149
0:07:09.635,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Some work very much in specific detail.

150
0:07:11.918,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They start with small little units and build it up.

151
0:07:15.736,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Okay, you've got something? One more thing.

152
0:07:33.272,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So they're solving this problem for me,

153
0:07:36.42,000 --> 0:07:39,000
having a little --

154
0:07:40.253,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They're constructing that phrase.

155
0:07:42.114,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They have something and they're going to hold on to it,

156
0:07:43.59,000 --> 0:07:45,000
yeah? One way of making.

157
0:07:45.613,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere.

158
0:07:47.969,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Okay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing.

159
0:07:49.943,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So basically I'm going to make a duet.

160
0:07:52.659,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I want you to think about them as architectural objects,

161
0:07:56.154,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so what they are, are just pure lines.

162
0:07:58.45,000 --> 0:08:,000
They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going

163
0:08:01.006,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah?

164
0:08:05.231,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So what I'm thinking about is taking

165
0:08:07.708,000 --> 0:08:1,000
a few physical extensions from the body as I move, and

166
0:08:11.633,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them:

167
0:08:13.931,000 --> 0:08:16,000
If, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go.

168
0:08:17.108,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Just grab this arm.

169
0:08:18.284,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Can you place that down into the floor?

170
0:08:21.309,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Yeah, down to the floor. Can you go underneath?

171
0:08:23.515,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Yeah. Cat, can you put leg over that side? Yeah.

172
0:08:27.332,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Can you rotate?

173
0:08:28.781,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Whoom, just go back to the beginning.

174
0:08:29.897,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Here we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ... (clicks metronome)

175
0:08:36.245,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Great. Okay, from there, you're both getting up.

176
0:08:38.169,000 --> 0:08:41,000
You're both getting up. Here we go. Good, now? Them.

177
0:08:41.709,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Applause)

178
0:08:43.278,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So from there, from there, we're both getting up,

179
0:08:45.979,000 --> 0:08:46,000
we're both getting up, going in this direction,

180
0:08:47.222,000 --> 0:08:49,000
going underneath. Whoa, whoa, underneath.

181
0:08:49.56,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Whoa, underneath, whoo-um. Yeah? Underneath. Jump.

182
0:08:53.524,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Underneath. Jump. Paolo, kick. Don't care where. Kick.

183
0:08:57.706,000 --> 0:09:,000
Kick, replace, change a leg. Kick, replace, change the leg.

184
0:09:01.125,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Yeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head.

185
0:09:04.834,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Whoaa. Just after it, maybe. Whoaa, whaaay, ooh.

186
0:09:09.699,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Grab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin,

187
0:09:14.017,000 --> 0:09:15,000
turn her, whoo-aa. (Snaps) Great.

188
0:09:15.623,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Okay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that.

189
0:09:17.982,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Just, let me slow down here. Fancy having eight -- (Laughter)

190
0:09:23.491,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Fancy having eight hours with me in a day.

191
0:09:26.293,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So, maybe too much. So, here we go, ready, and -- (Clicks metronome)

192
0:09:30.799,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Clicks metronome)

193
0:09:38.382,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Nice, good job. Yeah? Okay. (Applause)

194
0:09:41.523,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Okay, not bad. (Applause) A little bit more?

195
0:09:44.521,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Yeah. Just a little bit more, here we go, from that place.

196
0:09:47.313,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Separate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front.

197
0:09:49.786,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Imagine that there's a circle in front of you, yeah?

198
0:09:52.011,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Avoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way.

199
0:09:56.906,000 --> 0:10:,000
Kick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom.

200
0:10:00.995,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Throw it into the audience again.

201
0:10:02.038,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We've got mental architecture, we're sharing it,

202
0:10:03.92,000 --> 0:10:04,000
therefore solving a problem. They're enacting it.

203
0:10:05.812,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Let me just see that a little bit. Ready, and go.

204
0:10:07.995,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Clicks metronome)

205
0:10:12.498,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Okay, brilliant. Okay, here we go. From the beginning,

206
0:10:14.163,000 --> 0:10:16,000
can we do our phrases first? And then that.

207
0:10:17.101,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And we're going to build something now, organize it,

208
0:10:18.79,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow?

209
0:10:20.439,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Ready and go ... um. (Clicks metronome)

210
0:10:23.841,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Clicks metronome)

211
0:10:28.237,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The duet starts. (Clicks metronome)

212
0:10:31.921,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Clicks metronome)

213
0:10:45.247,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice. (Applause)

214
0:10:48.684,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So good. So -- (Applause)

215
0:10:50.394,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Okay. So that was -- (Applause)

216
0:10:53.641,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Well done. (Applause)

217
0:10:55.535,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That was the second way of working.

218
0:10:57.094,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The first one, body-to-body transfer, yeah,

219
0:10:59.466,000 --> 0:11:01,000
with an outside mental architecture that I work with

220
0:11:02.214,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that they hold memory with for me.

221
0:11:04.286,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The second one, which is using them as objects to think

222
0:11:06.524,000 --> 0:11:07,000
with their architectural objects, I do a series of

223
0:11:08.292,000 --> 0:11:1,000
provocations, I say, "If this happens, then that.

224
0:11:10.765,000 --> 0:11:12,000
If this, if that happens -- " I've got lots of methods like that,

225
0:11:13.12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but it's very, very quick, and this is a third method.

226
0:11:15.751,000 --> 0:11:17,000
They're starting it already, and this is a task-based method,

227
0:11:18.505,000 --> 0:11:19,000
where they have the autonomy to make

228
0:11:20.186,000 --> 0:11:21,000
all of the decisions for themselves.

229
0:11:21.992,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little

230
0:11:23.251,000 --> 0:11:26,000
mental dance, a little, in this little one minute,

231
0:11:26.673,000 --> 0:11:27,000
so what I'd love you to do is imagine,

232
0:11:28.572,000 --> 0:11:3,000
you can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you

233
0:11:30.673,000 --> 0:11:32,000
don't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you.

234
0:11:33.151,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Just for a second, think about that word "TED" in front of

235
0:11:36.891,000 --> 0:11:39,000
you, so it's in mind, and it's there right in front of your mind.

236
0:11:40.192,000 --> 0:11:42,000
What I'd like you to do is transplant that outside

237
0:11:42.429,000 --> 0:11:45,000
into the real world, so just imagine that word "TED"

238
0:11:45.972,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in the real world.

239
0:11:48.305,000 --> 0:11:5,000
What I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it.

240
0:11:51.245,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I'm going to zone in on the "E," and I'm going to

241
0:11:54.385,000 --> 0:11:56,000
scale that "E" so it's absolutely massive,

242
0:11:57.032,000 --> 0:11:59,000
so I'm scaling that "E" so it's absolutely massive,

243
0:11:59.744,000 --> 0:12:,000
and then I'm going to give it dimensionality.

244
0:12:00.915,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I'm going to think about it in 3D space. So now,

245
0:12:03.167,000 --> 0:12:05,000
instead of it just being a letter that's in front of me,

246
0:12:05.64,000 --> 0:12:07,000
it's a space that my body can go inside of.

247
0:12:08.521,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I now decide where I'm going to be in that space,

248
0:12:11.238,000 --> 0:12:15,000
so I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib

249
0:12:15.709,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of the letter "E," and I'm thinking about it, and I'm imagining

250
0:12:18.577,000 --> 0:12:21,000
this space that's really high and above. If I asked you to

251
0:12:22.031,000 --> 0:12:24,000
reach out — you don't have to literally do it, but in mind —

252
0:12:24.788,000 --> 0:12:27,000
reach out to the top of the "E," where would you reach?

253
0:12:27.838,000 --> 0:12:28,000
If you reach with your finger, where would it be?

254
0:12:29.816,000 --> 0:12:31,000
If you reach with your elbow, where would it be?

255
0:12:32.708,000 --> 0:12:35,000
If I already then said about that space that you're in,

256
0:12:36.605,000 --> 0:12:38,000
let's infuse it with the color red, what does that do

257
0:12:38.964,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to the body? If I then said to you, what happens if

258
0:12:41.69,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that whole wall on the side of "E" collapses and you have to

259
0:12:44.964,000 --> 0:12:45,000
use your weight to put it back up,

260
0:12:46.81,000 --> 0:12:48,000
what would you be able to do with it?

261
0:12:49.234,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So this is a mental picture, I'm describing a mental,

262
0:12:51.131,000 --> 0:12:55,000
vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices

263
0:12:55.136,000 --> 0:12:57,000
for themselves about what to make.

264
0:12:57.517,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Okay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed.

265
0:12:58.952,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So the dancers have been working on them.

266
0:13:00.326,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So just keep working on them for a little second.

267
0:13:02.182,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So they've been working on those mental architectures in the here.

268
0:13:05.198,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I know, I think we should keep them as a surprise.

269
0:13:07.7,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So here goes, world premiere dance. Yeah? Here we go.

270
0:13:10.28,000 --> 0:13:13,000
TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly.

271
0:13:13.801,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So, you're going to do the first solo that we made,

272
0:13:17.085,000 --> 0:13:19,000
yeah blah blah blah blah, we go into the duet, yeah,

273
0:13:19.884,000 --> 0:13:22,000
blah blah blah blah. The next solo, blah blah blah blah,

274
0:13:23.634,000 --> 0:13:26,000
yeah, and both at the same time, you do the last solutions.

275
0:13:27.358,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Okay? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, world premiere,

276
0:13:29.9,000 --> 0:13:31,000
TED dance, three versions of physical thinking. (Applause)

277
0:13:32.668,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah? (Laughter)

278
0:13:35.364,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So yeah, let's clap -- yeah, let's clap afterwards.

279
0:13:37.863,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Here we go. Catarina, big moment, here we go, one.

280
0:13:40.025,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Clicks metronome)

281
0:14:05.406,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Here it comes, Cat. (Clicks metronome)

282
0:14:10.617,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Paolo, go. (Clicks metronome) Last you solo.

283
0:14:15.053,000 --> 0:14:18,000

285
0:14:30.264,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Well done. Okay, good. Super. So --

286
0:14:32.223,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

287
0:14:34.104,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So -- (Applause)

288
0:14:36.395,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Thank you. (Applause)

289
0:14:38.186,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So -- three versions. (Applause) Oh. (Laughs)

290
0:14:47.171,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Applause) Three versions of physical thinking, yeah?

291
0:14:50.152,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Three versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today,

292
0:14:53.111,000 --> 0:14:54,000
what you're going to do is go away and make a dance

293
0:14:54.685,000 --> 0:14:55,000
for yourself, and if not that,

294
0:14:56.638,000 --> 0:14:58,000
at least misbehave more beautifully, more often.

295
0:14:58.865,000 --> 0:15:,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

296
0:15:01.483,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

297
0:15:06.213,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Here we go. (Applause)

298
0:15:08.524,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Applause)

Text: BeatJazz.

3
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
BeatJazz is:

4
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
1. Live looping,

5
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
2. Jazz improvisation

6
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And

7
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
3. "Gestural" sound design.

8
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Accelerometers

9
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
on each hand

10
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
read hand position.

11
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The color of the lights

12
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
indicates which sound I am playing.

13
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Red = Drums,

14
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Blue = Bass,

15
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Green = Chords,

16
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Orange = Leads,

17
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Purple = Pads

18
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The mouthpiece

19
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
consists of ...

20
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a button,

21
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
two guitar picks

22
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and lots of hot glue.

23
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The heads-up display

24
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is a smartphone that displays system parameters.

25
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Why?

26
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
To atomize music culture

27
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
so that ALL past, present and future genres

28
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
can be studied and abstracted, live.

29
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And

30
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"BeatJazzers"

31
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
become as common as D.J.'s.

32
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But mostly ...

33
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to MAKE the future

34
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
rather than wait for it.

35
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
One of the most common ways of dividing the world

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is into those who believe

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and those who don't --

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
into the religious and the atheists.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And for the last decade or so,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
it's been quite clear

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
what being an atheist means.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
There have been some very vocal atheists

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who've pointed out,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
not just that religion is wrong,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but that it's ridiculous.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
have argued --

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
they've argued that believing in God

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is akin to believing in fairies

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and essentially that the whole thing

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is a childish game.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now I think it's too easy.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I think it's too easy

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to dismiss the whole of religion that way.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And what I'd like to inaugurate today

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is a new way of being an atheist --

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
if you like, a new version of atheism

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
we could call Atheism 2.0.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now what is Atheism 2.0?

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Well it starts from a very basic premise:

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of course, there's no God.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
or angels, etc.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now let's move on; that's not the end of the story,

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that's the very, very beginning.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm interested in the kind of constituency

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that thinks something along these lines:

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I can't believe in the doctrines.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I don't think these doctrines are right.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I really like the art of Mantegna.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I really like looking at old churches.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Whatever it may be,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
you know the kind of thing I'm talking about --

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
people who are attracted to the ritualistic side,

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the moralistic, communal side of religion,

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but can't bear the doctrine.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and then you can have all the nice stuff,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
or you reject the doctrine and

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So that's a sort of tough choice.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I don't think we have to make that choice.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I think there is an alternative.

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I think there are ways --

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious --

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of stealing from religions.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
If you don't believe in a religion,

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with taking out the best sides of religion.

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And for me, atheism 2.0

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is about both, as I say,

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a respectful and an impious way

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The secular world is full of holes.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We have secularized badly, I would argue.

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And a thorough study of religion

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
could give us all sorts of insights

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
into areas of life that are not going too well.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I'd like to run through a few of these today.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now education is a field

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the secular world really believes in.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it's also going to make us better people.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
those lyrical claims

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education --

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
will make us into nobler and better human beings.

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
That's a lovely idea.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Interesting where it came from.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In the early 19th century,

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
church attendance in Western Europe

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They asked themselves the following question.

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They said, where are people going to find the morality,

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
where are they going to find guidance,

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and where are they going to find sources of consolation?

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And influential voices came up with one answer.

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They said culture.

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's to culture that we should look

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for guidance, for consolation, for morality.

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare,

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In there, we'll find a lot of the truths

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
They wanted to replace scripture with culture.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And that's a very plausible idea.

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's also an idea that we have forgotten.

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you went to a top university --

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge --

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and you said, "I've come here

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I want to know how to live,"

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
they would show you the way to the insane asylum.

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
are in the business of.

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Why? They don't think we need it.

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They see us as adults, rational adults.

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What we need is information.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We need data, we don't need help.

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now religions start from a very different place indeed.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
All religions, all major religions,

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
at various points call us children.

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And like children,

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We're only just holding it together.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And we need help. Of course, we need help.

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,

128
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
who went up and down this country delivering sermons,

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
advising people how they could live.

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and children to their parents,

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
He was trying to tell people how they should live

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
through the medium of sermons,

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the classic medium of delivery of religions.

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.

138
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
If you said to a modern liberal individualist,

139
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"Hey, how about a sermon?"

140
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.

141
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm an independent, individual person."

142
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
What's the difference between a sermon

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?

144
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Well a sermon wants to change your life

145
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.

146
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.

147
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,

148
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because we are in need of guidance,

149
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
morality and consolation --

150
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and religions know that.

151
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Another point about education:

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we tend to believe in the modern secular world

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,

156
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and that lesson will stick with them.

157
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Religions go, "Nonsense.

158
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.

159
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So get on your knees and repeat it."

160
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
That's what all religions tell us:

161
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."

162
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Otherwise our minds are like sieves.

163
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So religions are cultures of repetition.

164
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They circle the great truths again and again and again.

165
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We associate repetition with boredom.

166
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
"Give us the new," we're always saying.

167
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"The new is better than the old."

168
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
If I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We're just going to run through all the old ones

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and watch them five times because they're so true.

171
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.

173
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The other things that religions do

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is to arrange time.

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
All the major religions give us calendars.

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
What is a calendar?

178
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year

179
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
you will bump into certain very important ideas.

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and his qualities of humility and goodness

183
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and his generosity to the poor.

184
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now we don't think that way.

186
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.

187
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I'll just come across it."

188
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Nonsense, says the religious world view.

189
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,

190
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we need to synchronize encounters.

191
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
This comes across also

192
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in the way in which religions set up rituals

193
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
around important feelings.

194
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.

195
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You know, when you look at the Moon,

196
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"

197
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.

198
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.

199
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Why don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."

200
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,

201
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform

202
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,

203
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
where you will be given poems to read

204
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in honor of the Moon and the passage of time

205
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.

206
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You'll be handed rice cakes.

207
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon

208
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
will have a secure place in your heart.

209
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
That's very good.

210
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The other thing that religions are really aware of

211
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is: speak well --

212
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'm not doing a very good job of this here --

213
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.

214
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker

215
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and still have a great career.

216
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But the religious world doesn't think that way.

217
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
What you're saying needs to be backed up

218
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
by a really convincing way of saying it.

219
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church

220
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in the American South

221
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and you listen to how they talk,

222
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
my goodness, they talk well.

223
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
After every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."

224
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
At the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,

225
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."

226
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
If we were doing it like they do it --

227
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
let's not do it, but if we were to do it --

228
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."

229
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."

230
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And at the end of my talk, you would all stand up

231
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."

232
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.

233
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.

234
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Applause)

235
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,

236
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we are also bodies.

237
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And when they teach us a lesson,

238
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
they do it via the body.

239
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So for example,

240
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.

241
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Jews are very interested in forgiveness

242
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and how we should start anew and start afresh.

243
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They don't just deliver us sermons on this.

244
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
They don't just give us books or words about this.

245
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They tell us to have a bath.

246
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.

247
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
You immerse yourself in the water,

248
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.

249
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We don't tend to do that.

250
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.

252
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Let's look at art now.

253
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Now art is something that in the secular world,

254
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.

255
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.

256
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We sometimes hear it said

257
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.

258
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You've heard that saying.

259
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now I think that the potential is there,

260
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but we've completely let ourselves down.

261
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And the reason we've let ourselves down

262
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is that we're not properly studying

263
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
how religions handle art.

264
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world

265
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:

266
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The first idea is that art should be for art's sake --

267
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
a ridiculous idea --

268
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble

269
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.

270
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I couldn't disagree more.

271
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,

272
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that artists shouldn't say what they're up to,

273
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because if they said it, it might destroy the spell

274
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and we might find it too easy.

275
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum --

276
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
let's admit it --

277
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is, "I don't know what this is about."

278
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.

279
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural

280
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to contemporary art.

281
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.

282
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They have no trouble telling us what art is about.

283
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.

284
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Firstly, it's trying to remind you

285
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
of what there is to love.

286
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And secondly, it's trying to remind you

287
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
of what there is to fear and to hate.

288
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And that's what art is.

289
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.

290
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So as you walk around a church,

291
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or a mosque or a cathedral,

292
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,

293
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
through your eyes, through your senses,

294
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.

295
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Essentially it's propaganda.

296
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Rembrandt is a propagandist

297
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in the Christian view.

298
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.

299
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.

300
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.

301
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.

302
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.

303
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum --

304
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
if I was a museum curator,

305
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I would make a room for love, a room for generosity.

306
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
All works of art are talking to us about things.

307
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And if we were able to arrange spaces

308
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
where we could come across works

309
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
where we would be told, use these works of art

310
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to cement these ideas in your mind,

311
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we would get a lot more out of art.

312
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have

313
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.

314
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Art should be one of the tools

315
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
by which we improve our society.

316
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Art should be didactic.

317
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Let's think of something else.

318
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The people in the modern world, in the secular world,

319
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
who are interested in matters of the spirit,

320
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in matters of the mind,

321
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in higher soul-like concerns,

322
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
tend to be isolated individuals.

323
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.

324
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And they tend to be on their own.

325
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.

326
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own.

327
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And they don't really change much.

328
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Now think about religions, think about organized religions.

329
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
What do organized religions do?

330
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
They group together, they form institutions.

331
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And that has all sorts of advantages.

332
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
First of all, scale, might.

333
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year

334
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
according to the Wall Street Journal.

335
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
These are massive machines.

336
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,

337
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and they're highly disciplined.

338
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
These are all very good qualities.

339
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We recognize them in relation to corporations.

340
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And corporations are very like religions in many ways,

341
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.

342
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
They're selling us shoes and cars.

343
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff --

344
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the therapists, the poets --

345
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
are on their own and they have no power,

346
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
they have no might.

347
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So religions are the foremost example

348
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.

349
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,

350
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but we can admire the institutional way

351
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in which they're doing it.

352
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Books alone, books written by lone individuals,

353
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
are not going to change anything.

354
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We need to group together.

355
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
If you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.

356
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And that's what religions do.

357
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
They are multinational, as I say,

358
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
they are branded, they have a clear identity,

359
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
so they don't get lost in a busy world.

360
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
That's something we can learn from.

361
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I want to conclude.

362
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Really what I want to say

363
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,

364
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
there is something to learn from the example of religion --

365
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
even if you don't believe any of it.

366
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
If you're involved in anything that's communal,

367
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that involves lots of people getting together,

368
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
there are things for you in religion.

369
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,

370
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
look at pilgrimage.

371
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Look very closely at pilgrimage.

372
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We haven't begun to scratch the surface

373
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
of what travel could be

374
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.

375
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
If you're in the art world,

376
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
look at the example of what religions are doing with art.

377
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And if you're an educator in any way,

378
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.

379
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
You may not agree with the ideas,

380
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.

381
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So really my concluding point

382
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is you may not agree with religion,

383
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
but at the end of the day,

384
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
religions are so subtle, so complicated,

385
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
so intelligent in many ways

386
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;

387
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
they're for all of us.

388
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Thank you very much.

389
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
(Applause)

390
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Chris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,

391
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways

392
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to be ridiculed in some quarters.

393
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
AB: You can get shot by both sides.

394
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,

395
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and you can get shot by those who fully believe.

396
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
CA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment.

397
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
AB: Indeed.

398
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
CA: But you left out one aspect of religion

399
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that a lot of people might say

400
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
your agenda could borrow from,

401
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
which is this sense --

402
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious --

403
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
of spiritual experience,

404
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
of some kind of connection

405
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
with something that's bigger than you are.

406
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?

407
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people

408
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,

409
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
something else?"

410
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"

411
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,

412
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,

413
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?

414
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Science and just observation

415
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
gives us that feeling without it,

416
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
so I don't feel the need.

417
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
The universe is large and we are tiny,

418
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
without the need for further religious superstructure.

419
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So one can have so-called spiritual moments

420
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
without belief in the spirit.

421
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.

422
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
How many people here would say

423
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
that religion is important to them?

424
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Is there an equivalent process

425
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
by which there's a sort of bridge

426
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
between what you're talking about and what you would say to them?

427
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
AB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life

428
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and these can be plugged.

429
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
It's not as though, as I try to suggest,

430
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
it's not as though either you have religion

431
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and then you have to accept all sorts of things,

432
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
or you don't have religion

433
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and then you're cut off from all these very good things.

434
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
It's so sad that we constantly say,

435
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
"I don't believe so I can't have community,

436
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
so I'm cut off from morality,

437
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
so I can't go on a pilgrimage."

438
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"

439
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And that's really the spirit of my talk.

440
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
There's so much we can absorb.

441
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.

442
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
CA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community

443
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
who are atheists.

444
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
But probably most people in the community

445
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon

446
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and want to find the language

447
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
to have a constructive dialogue

448
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and to feel like we can actually talk to each other

449
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and at least share some things in common.

450
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Are we foolish to be optimistic

451
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
about the possibility of a world

452
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry

453
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
of divide and war,

454
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
that there could be bridging?

455
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.

456
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.

457
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
It's seen as hypocrisy.

458
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist

459
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,"

460
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
you politely ignore it.

461
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
You move on.

462
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things,

463
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
because you have a shared view on so many things,

464
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and you politely differ.

465
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.

466
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.

467
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
CA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing

468
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
that's not a religion but something else,

469
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
does it need a leader,

470
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and are you volunteering to be the pope?

471
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
(Laughter)

472
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
AB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of

473
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
is individual leaders.

474
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
It doesn't need it.

475
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
What I've tried to lay out is a framework

476
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.

477
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
I've sketched a sort of broad framework.

478
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
But wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.

479
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
If you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.

480
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
So it's a wiki project.

481
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
(Laughter)

482
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
CA: Alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later.

483
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
(Applause)

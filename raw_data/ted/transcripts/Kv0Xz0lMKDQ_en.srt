1
0:00:13.643,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Twenty years ago,

2
0:00:15.033,000 --> 0:00:2,000
my family introduced a system called "Friday Democracy Meetings."

3
0:00:21.812,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Every Friday at 7pm, my family came together for an official meeting

4
0:00:27.13,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to discuss the current family affairs.

5
0:00:31.74,000 --> 0:00:34,000
These meetings were facilitated by one of my parents,

6
0:00:35.058,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and we even had a notetaker.

7
0:00:37.551,000 --> 0:00:39,000
These meetings had two rules.

8
0:00:39.69,000 --> 0:00:42,000
First, you are allowed to speak open and freely.

9
0:00:42.931,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Us kids were allowed to criticize our parents

10
0:00:45.628,000 --> 0:00:48,000
without that being considered disrespectful or rude.

11
0:00:48.968,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Second rule was the Chatham House rule,

12
0:00:51.778,000 --> 0:00:54,000
meaning whatever is said in the meeting stays in the meeting.

13
0:00:55.752,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:56.777,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The topics which were discussed in these meetings

15
0:00:59.165,000 --> 0:01:01,000
varied from one week to another.

16
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
One week, we'd talk about what food we wanted to eat,

17
0:01:05.09,000 --> 0:01:07,000
what time us kids should go to bed

18
0:01:07.815,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and how to improve things as a family,

19
0:01:10.426,000 --> 0:01:14,000
while another meeting discussed pretty much events that happened at school

20
0:01:15.283,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and how to solve disputes between siblings,

21
0:01:18.451,000 --> 0:01:19,000
by which I mean real fights.

22
0:01:21.232,000 --> 0:01:24,000
At the end of each meeting, we'd reach decisions and agreements

23
0:01:25.066,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that would last at least until the next meeting.

24
0:01:28.854,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So you could say I was raised as a politician.

25
0:01:35.105,000 --> 0:01:38,000
By the age of six or seven, I mastered politics.

26
0:01:38.844,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I was negotiating, compromising,

27
0:01:41.711,000 --> 0:01:43,000
building alliances with other political actors.

28
0:01:44.543,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:46.898,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I even once tried to jeopardize the political process.

30
0:01:51.012,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:53.077,000 --> 0:01:57,000
These meetings sound very peaceful, civil and democratic, right?

32
0:01:58.421,000 --> 0:02:,000
But that was not always the case.

33
0:02:00.446,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Because of this open, free space to talk, discuss and criticize,

34
0:02:05.255,000 --> 0:02:07,000
things sometimes got really heated.

35
0:02:08.529,000 --> 0:02:1,000
One meeting went really bad for me.

36
0:02:11.236,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I was about 10 years old at that time,

37
0:02:13.327,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I'd done something really horrible at school,

38
0:02:15.646,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which I'm not going to share today --

39
0:02:17.481,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:18.523,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but my brother decided to bring it up in the meeting.

41
0:02:22.77,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I could not defend myself,

42
0:02:24.573,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so I decided to withdraw from the meeting and boycott the whole system.

43
0:02:29.287,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I literally wrote an official letter and handed it to my dad,

44
0:02:32.462,000 --> 0:02:33,000
announcing that I am boycotting.

45
0:02:34.303,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:36.485,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I thought that if I stopped attending these meetings anymore,

47
0:02:40.049,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the system would collapse,

48
0:02:42.025,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:43.58,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but my family continued with the meetings,

50
0:02:46.463,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and they often made decisions that I disliked.

51
0:02:50.177,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But I could not challenge these decisions,

52
0:02:52.393,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because I was not attending the meetings,

53
0:02:54.37,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and thus had no right to go against it.

54
0:02:57.517,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Ironically, when I turned about 13 years old,

55
0:03:01.745,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I ended up attending one of these meetings again,

56
0:03:04.669,000 --> 0:03:07,000
after I boycotted them for a long time.

57
0:03:07.79,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Because there was an issue that was affecting me only,

58
0:03:12.371,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and no other family member was bringing it up.

59
0:03:16.76,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The problem was that after each dinner,

60
0:03:20.936,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I was always the only one who was asked to wash the dishes,

61
0:03:24.992,000 --> 0:03:27,000
while my brothers didn't have to do anything about it.

62
0:03:28.971,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I felt this was unjust, unfair and discriminatory,

63
0:03:33.563,000 --> 0:03:35,000
so I wanted to discuss it in the meeting.

64
0:03:36.363,000 --> 0:03:41,000
As you know, the idea that it's a woman or a girl's role to do household work

65
0:03:42.014,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is a rule that has been carried out by many societies for so long,

66
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so in order for a 13-year-old me to challenge it, I needed a platform.

67
0:03:51.295,000 --> 0:03:53,000
In the meeting, my brothers argued

68
0:03:53.562,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that none of the other boys we knew were washing the dishes,

69
0:03:57.121,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so why should our family be any different?

70
0:03:59.842,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But my parents agreed with me and decided that my brothers should assist me.

71
0:04:04.802,000 --> 0:04:07,000
However, they could not force them, so the problem continued.

72
0:04:08.559,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Seeing no solution to my problem, I decided to attend another meeting

73
0:04:13.548,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and propose a new system that would be fair to everyone.

74
0:04:17.989,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So I suggested instead of one person

75
0:04:20.788,000 --> 0:04:23,000
washing all the dishes used by all the family members,

76
0:04:24.631,000 --> 0:04:27,000
each family member should wash their own dishes.

77
0:04:28.641,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And as a gesture of good faith,

78
0:04:30.697,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I said I'd wash the pots as well.

79
0:04:33.808,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This way, my brothers could no longer argue

80
0:04:36.634,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that it wasn't within their responsibility

81
0:04:38.704,000 --> 0:04:41,000
as boys or men to wash the dishes and clean after the family,

82
0:04:42.682,000 --> 0:04:47,000
because the system I proposed was about every member of the family

83
0:04:47.893,000 --> 0:04:5,000
cleaning after themselves and taking care of themselves.

84
0:04:51.537,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Everyone agreed to my proposal,

85
0:04:53.649,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and for years, that was our washing-the-dishes system.

86
0:05:00.152,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What I just shared with you is a family story,

87
0:05:03.851,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but it's pure politics.

88
0:05:06.5,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Every part of politics includes decision-making,

89
0:05:10.358,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and ideally, the process of decision-making

90
0:05:13.058,000 --> 0:05:15,000
should include people from different backgrounds,

91
0:05:16.008,000 --> 0:05:19,000
interests, opinions, gender,

92
0:05:19.175,000 --> 0:05:22,000
beliefs, race, ethnicity, age, and so on.

93
0:05:22.993,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And they should all have an equal opportunity to contribute

94
0:05:26.374,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to the decision-making process and influence the decisions

95
0:05:30.207,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that will affect their lives directly or indirectly.

96
0:05:34.742,000 --> 0:05:4,000
As such, I find it difficult to understand when I hear young people saying,

97
0:05:40.868,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"I'm too young to engage in politics or to even hold a political opinion."

98
0:05:45.569,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Similarly, when I hear some women saying,

99
0:05:47.994,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"Politics is a dirty world I don't want to engage with,"

100
0:05:52.041,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I'm worried that the idea of politics and political engagement

101
0:05:56.419,000 --> 0:05:59,000
has become so polarized in many parts of the world

102
0:06:00.406,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that ordinary people feel, in order for them to participate in politics,

103
0:06:04.745,000 --> 0:06:06,000
they need to be outspoken activists,

104
0:06:07.697,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and that is not true.

105
0:06:09.835,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I want to ask these young people, women and ordinary people in general:

106
0:06:15.542,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Can you really afford not to be interested or not to participate in politics?

107
0:06:22.172,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Politics is not only activism.

108
0:06:24.263,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's awareness,

109
0:06:25.438,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it's keeping ourselves informed, it's caring for the facts.

110
0:06:28.246,000 --> 0:06:3,000
When it's possible, it's casting a vote.

111
0:06:30.914,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Politics is the tool through which we structure ourselves

112
0:06:33.732,000 --> 0:06:34,000
as groups and societies.

113
0:06:36.039,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Politics governs every aspect of life,

114
0:06:38.778,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and by not participating in it,

115
0:06:41.024,000 --> 0:06:46,000
you're literally allowing other people to decide on what you can eat, wear,

116
0:06:46.295,000 --> 0:06:48,000
if you can have access to health care,

117
0:06:48.533,000 --> 0:06:49,000
free education,

118
0:06:50.004,000 --> 0:06:51,000
how much tax you pay,

119
0:06:51.878,000 --> 0:06:52,000
when you can retire,

120
0:06:53.441,000 --> 0:06:54,000
what is your pension.

121
0:06:55.199,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Other people are also deciding on whether your race and ethnicity

122
0:06:59.101,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is enough to consider you a criminal,

123
0:07:01.482,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or if your religion and nationality is enough to put you on a terrorist list.

124
0:07:06.293,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And if you still think you are a strong, independent human being

125
0:07:10.205,000 --> 0:07:12,000
unaffected by politics,

126
0:07:12.823,000 --> 0:07:13,000
then think twice.

127
0:07:15.607,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I am speaking to you as a young woman from Libya,

128
0:07:19.012,000 --> 0:07:21,000
a country that is in the middle of a civil war.

129
0:07:22.083,000 --> 0:07:25,000
After more than 40 years of authoritarian rule,

130
0:07:25.322,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it's not a place where political engagement

131
0:07:27.593,000 --> 0:07:29,000
by women and young people is possible, nor encouraged.

132
0:07:31.02,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Almost all political dialogues that took place in the past few years,

133
0:07:35.124,000 --> 0:07:37,000
even those gathered by foreign powers,

134
0:07:37.514,000 --> 0:07:39,000
has been with only middle-aged men in the room.

135
0:07:41.235,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But in places with a broken political system like Libya,

136
0:07:45.204,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or in seemingly functioning places, including international organizations,

137
0:07:50.06,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the systems we have nowadays for political decision-making

138
0:07:54.34,000 --> 0:07:56,000
are not from the people for the people,

139
0:07:57.309,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but they have been established by the few for the few.

140
0:08:01.417,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And these few have been historically almost exclusively men,

141
0:08:07.678,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and they've produced laws, policies,

142
0:08:10.877,000 --> 0:08:14,000
mechanisms for political participation that are based on the opinions,

143
0:08:15.659,000 --> 0:08:17,000
beliefs, worldviews, dreams,

144
0:08:18.527,000 --> 0:08:2,000
aspirations of this one group of people,

145
0:08:21.247,000 --> 0:08:23,000
while everyone else was kept out.

146
0:08:24.585,000 --> 0:08:28,000
After all, we've all heard some version of this sentence:

147
0:08:28.684,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"What does a woman, let alone a young person, who is brown,

148
0:08:32.831,000 --> 0:08:33,000
understand about politics?"

149
0:08:35.437,000 --> 0:08:36,000
When you're young --

150
0:08:36.724,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and in many parts of the world, a woman --

151
0:08:38.749,000 --> 0:08:43,000
you often hear experienced politicians say, "But you lack political experience."

152
0:08:44.513,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And when I hear that,

153
0:08:45.958,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I wonder what sort of experience are they referring to?

154
0:08:49.307,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The experience of corrupted political systems?

155
0:08:53.266,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Or of waging wars?

156
0:08:55.228,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Or are they referring to the experience

157
0:08:57.435,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of putting the interests of economic profits

158
0:08:59.643,000 --> 0:09:,000
before those of the environment?

159
0:09:01.545,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Because if this is political experience,

160
0:09:03.798,000 --> 0:09:04,000
then yes --

161
0:09:04.973,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Applause)

162
0:09:14.828,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we, as women and young people, have no political experience at all.

163
0:09:21.24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, politicians might not be the only ones to blame,

164
0:09:27.169,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because ordinary people, and many young people as well,

165
0:09:32.881,000 --> 0:09:34,000
don't care about politics.

166
0:09:35.074,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And even those who care don't know how to participate.

167
0:09:39.813,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This must change, and here is my proposal.

168
0:09:43.164,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We need to teach people at an early age

169
0:09:46.269,000 --> 0:09:49,000
about decision-making and how to be part of it.

170
0:09:49.838,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Every family is its own mini political system

171
0:09:53.44,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that is usually not democratic,

172
0:09:55.971,000 --> 0:09:59,000
because parents make decisions that affect all members of the family,

173
0:10:00.178,000 --> 0:10:02,000
while the kids have very little to say.

174
0:10:02.782,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Similarly, politicians make decisions that affect the whole nation,

175
0:10:06.956,000 --> 0:10:08,000
while the people have very little say in them.

176
0:10:10.566,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We need to change this,

177
0:10:12.565,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and in order to achieve this change systematically,

178
0:10:15.877,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we need to teach people

179
0:10:17.91,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that political, national and global affairs

180
0:10:21.352,000 --> 0:10:26,000
are as relevant to them as personal and family affairs.

181
0:10:26.684,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So if we want to achieve this, my proposal and advice is,

182
0:10:31.598,000 --> 0:10:34,000
try out the Family Democracy Meeting system.

183
0:10:35.226,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Because that will enable your kids to exercise their agency

184
0:10:38.845,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and decision-making from a very early age.

185
0:10:42.494,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Politics is about having conversations,

186
0:10:45.385,000 --> 0:10:47,000
including difficult conversations,

187
0:10:47.548,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that lead to decisions.

188
0:10:49.709,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And in order to have a conversation, you need to participate,

189
0:10:53.572,000 --> 0:10:55,000
not sign off like I did when I was a kid

190
0:10:55.669,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and then learn the lesson the hard way and have to go back again.

191
0:10:59.534,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If you include your kids in family conversations,

192
0:11:01.995,000 --> 0:11:02,000
they will grow up

193
0:11:03.353,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and know how to participate in political conversations.

194
0:11:06.733,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And most importantly, most importantly,

195
0:11:10.054,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they will help others engage.

196
0:11:11.948,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Thank you.

197
0:11:13.123,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Applause)

Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:13.527,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Something happened in the early morning hours

3
0:00:16.315,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect

4
0:00:19.9,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on the way our society operates.

5
0:00:22.206,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Ironically, hardly anyone noticed at the time.

6
0:00:25.484,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The change was silent, imperceptible,

7
0:00:28.144,000 --> 0:00:3,000
unless you knew exactly what to look for.

8
0:00:30.989,000 --> 0:00:32,000
On that morning, U.S. President Bill Clinton

9
0:00:33.34,000 --> 0:00:35,000
ordered that a special switch be thrown

10
0:00:35.612,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System.

11
0:00:39.045,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Instantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver

12
0:00:42.909,000 --> 0:00:46,000
around the globe went from errors the size of a football field

13
0:00:47.471,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to errors the size of a small room.

14
0:00:54.314,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's hard to overstate the effect that this change

15
0:00:58.105,000 --> 0:01:,000
in accuracy has had on us.

16
0:01:00.657,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Before this switch was thrown, we didn't have

17
0:01:02.904,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn

18
0:01:05.163,000 --> 0:01:07,000
directions, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you

19
0:01:07.755,000 --> 0:01:09,000
what block you were on, let alone what street.

20
0:01:10.449,000 --> 0:01:13,000
For geolocation, accuracy matters,

21
0:01:13.697,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and things have only improved over the last 10 years.

22
0:01:16.955,000 --> 0:01:18,000
With more base stations, more ground stations,

23
0:01:19.074,000 --> 0:01:21,000
better receivers and better algorithms,

24
0:01:22.043,000 --> 0:01:25,000
GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on,

25
0:01:25.106,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but what part of the street.

26
0:01:29.608,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This level of accuracy

27
0:01:31.854,000 --> 0:01:33,000
has unleashed a firestorm of innovation.

28
0:01:34.78,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In fact, many of you navigated here today

29
0:01:37.451,000 --> 0:01:4,000
with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone.

30
0:01:41.044,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Paper maps are becoming obsolete.

31
0:01:44.269,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But we now stand on the verge of another revolution

32
0:01:48.408,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in geolocation accuracy.

33
0:01:50.403,000 --> 0:01:52,000
What if I told you that the two-meter positioning

34
0:01:53.136,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us

35
0:01:56.567,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is pathetic compared to what we could be getting?

36
0:02:00.464,000 --> 0:02:02,000
For some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention

37
0:02:03.297,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to the carrier phase of the GPS signal,

38
0:02:05.832,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and if you have an Internet connection,

39
0:02:08.313,000 --> 0:02:1,000
then you can go from meter level to centimeter level,

40
0:02:11.129,000 --> 0:02:13,000
even millimeter-level positioning.

41
0:02:14.096,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So why don't we have this capability on our phones?

42
0:02:17.376,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Only, I believe, for a lack of imagination.

43
0:02:21.746,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique

44
0:02:24.913,000 --> 0:02:26,000
into their cheap GPS chips

45
0:02:27.019,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because they're not sure what the general public would do

46
0:02:29.173,000 --> 0:02:32,000
with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint

47
0:02:32.749,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the wrinkles in the palm of your hand.

48
0:02:36.587,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But you and I and other innovators,

49
0:02:38.974,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy.

50
0:02:43.014,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Imagine, for example, an augmented reality app

51
0:02:45.726,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision

52
0:02:49.263,000 --> 0:02:51,000
on top of the physical world.

53
0:02:51.271,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I could build for you a structure up here in 3D,

54
0:02:54.158,000 --> 0:02:56,000
millimeter accurate, that only you could see,

55
0:02:56.526,000 --> 0:02:58,000
or my friends at home.

56
0:02:59.419,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for,

57
0:03:03.934,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and I believe that, within the next few years, I predict,

58
0:03:07.858,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning

59
0:03:12.841,000 --> 0:03:15,000
will become cheap and ubiquitous,

60
0:03:16.065,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and the consequences will be fantastic.

61
0:03:18.61,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot.

62
0:03:23.266,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Do you remember the movie "The Da Vinci Code?"

63
0:03:25.946,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot,

64
0:03:29.394,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device

65
0:03:32.771,000 --> 0:03:35,000
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe,

66
0:03:35.832,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but we know that in the world of nonfiction,

67
0:03:38.738,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the GPS dot is impossible, right?

68
0:03:41.602,000 --> 0:03:43,000
For one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors,

69
0:03:44.226,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and for another, they don't make devices quite this small,

70
0:03:47.41,000 --> 0:03:49,000
especially when those devices have to relay

71
0:03:49.738,000 --> 0:03:51,000
their measurements back over a network.

72
0:03:52.713,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable

73
0:03:55.051,000 --> 0:03:58,000
a few years ago, but things have changed.

74
0:03:58.065,000 --> 0:04:,000
There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization,

75
0:04:00.921,000 --> 0:04:03,000
better sensitivity, so much so that, a few years ago,

76
0:04:04.64,000 --> 0:04:06,000
a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box

77
0:04:07.344,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to the left of the keys.

78
0:04:09.52,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Compare that with the device released just months ago

79
0:04:12.171,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob,

80
0:04:15.963,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and if you take a look at the state of the art

81
0:04:18.516,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter

82
0:04:21.262,000 --> 0:04:23,000
on a side and more sensitive than ever,

83
0:04:23.349,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you realize that the GPS dot will soon move

84
0:04:26.858,000 --> 0:04:3,000
from fiction to nonfiction.

85
0:04:31.257,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.

86
0:04:35.499,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys

87
0:04:38.405,000 --> 0:04:42,000
anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland.

88
0:04:42.976,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on

89
0:04:46.757,000 --> 0:04:49,000
everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars.

90
0:04:50.724,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning,

91
0:04:53.196,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them.

92
0:04:56.564,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality.

93
0:05:00.356,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.

94
0:05:02.967,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:05.106,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail,

96
0:05:08.614,000 --> 0:05:1,000
remember how refreshing it was to go from

97
0:05:11.492,000 --> 0:05:15,000
organizing all of your email to simply searching it.

98
0:05:15.636,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions.

99
0:05:20.138,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot.

100
0:05:24.824,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I was in my office some months back

101
0:05:27.213,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and got a telephone call.

102
0:05:29.756,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol,

103
0:05:33.377,000 --> 0:05:35,000
was panicked.

104
0:05:35.456,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Apparently, an ex-boyfriend of Carol's from California

105
0:05:38.249,000 --> 0:05:41,000
had found her in Texas and was following her around.

106
0:05:41.564,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So you might ask at this point why she's calling you.

107
0:05:45.401,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Well, so did I.

108
0:05:46.8,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.

109
0:05:50.791,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Every time her ex-boyfriend would show up,

110
0:05:53.525,000 --> 0:05:57,000
at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations,

111
0:05:57.875,000 --> 0:05:59,000
he was carrying an open laptop,

112
0:06:00.571,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and over time Carol realized that he had planted

113
0:06:03.414,000 --> 0:06:05,000
a GPS tracking device on her car,

114
0:06:05.962,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so she was calling me for help to disable it.

115
0:06:08.871,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Well, you should go to a good mechanic

116
0:06:10.859,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and have him look at your car," I said.

117
0:06:14.143,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"I already have," she told me.

118
0:06:16.847,000 --> 0:06:18,000
"He didn't see anything obvious,

119
0:06:18.991,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."

120
0:06:22.528,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Well then, you'd better go to the police," I said.

121
0:06:25.849,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"I already have," she replied.

122
0:06:28.953,000 --> 0:06:3,000
"They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment,

123
0:06:31.399,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and they're not set up technically to find the device."

124
0:06:35.152,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"Okay, what about the FBI?"

125
0:06:36.658,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"I've talked to them too, and same story."

126
0:06:40.821,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We then talked about her coming to my lab

127
0:06:42.491,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and us performing a radio sweep of her car,

128
0:06:45.039,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but I wasn't even sure that would work,

129
0:06:47.538,000 --> 0:06:49,000
given that some of these devices are configured

130
0:06:49.589,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to only transmit when they're inside safe zones

131
0:06:51.823,000 --> 0:06:54,000
or when the car is moving.

132
0:06:55.127,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, there we were.

133
0:06:56.621,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Carol isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last,

134
0:06:59.59,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment,

135
0:07:04.525,000 --> 0:07:09,000
worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking.

136
0:07:10.41,000 --> 0:07:11,000
In fact, as I looked into her case,

137
0:07:12.213,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal

138
0:07:15.675,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.

139
0:07:20.108,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman

140
0:07:23.988,000 --> 0:07:27,000
has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking,

141
0:07:28.32,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another,

142
0:07:31.836,000 --> 0:07:33,000
so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about,

143
0:07:34.466,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but Big Neighbor. (Laughter)

144
0:07:37.737,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There is one alternative that Carol could have taken,

145
0:07:42.385,000 --> 0:07:47,000
very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble.

146
0:07:48.088,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's an open-source GPS jammer,

147
0:07:51.023,000 --> 0:07:53,000
developed by Limor Fried,

148
0:07:53.578,000 --> 0:07:56,000
a graduate student at MIT, and Limor calls it

149
0:07:57.371,000 --> 0:08:,000
"a tool for reclaiming our personal space."

150
0:08:01.256,000 --> 0:08:03,000
With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you

151
0:08:03.521,000 --> 0:08:05,000
within which GPS signals can't reside.

152
0:08:05.768,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They get drowned out by the bubble.

153
0:08:08.124,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And Limor designed this, in part, because, like Carol,

154
0:08:11.771,000 --> 0:08:13,000
she felt threatened by GPS tracking.

155
0:08:14.417,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Then she posted her design to the web,

156
0:08:16.993,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and if you don't have time to build your own,

157
0:08:20.735,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you can buy one.

158
0:08:21.509,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands

159
0:08:23.567,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of nearly identical devices on the Internet.

160
0:08:27.34,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.

161
0:08:31.492,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car.

162
0:08:35.145,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal

163
0:08:38.927,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in the United States.

164
0:08:40.726,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And why is that?

165
0:08:41.473,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Well, because it's not a bubble at all.

166
0:08:44.566,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge

167
0:08:46.965,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of your personal space or at the edge of your car.

168
0:08:49.437,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you. (Laughter)

169
0:08:55.673,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now, if you're Carol or Limor,

170
0:08:58.424,000 --> 0:09:,000
or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking,

171
0:09:01.049,000 --> 0:09:04,000
it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble,

172
0:09:04.824,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but in fact, the results can be disastrous.

173
0:09:08.804,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Imagine, for example, you're the captain of a cruise ship

174
0:09:11.524,000 --> 0:09:13,000
trying to make your way through a thick fog

175
0:09:14.043,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble.

176
0:09:17.883,000 --> 0:09:19,000
All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank,

177
0:09:20.598,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and now it's just you and the fog

178
0:09:23.884,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and whatever you can pull off the radar system

179
0:09:26.484,000 --> 0:09:29,000
if you remember how to work it.

180
0:09:29.608,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They -- in fact, they don't update or upkeep lighthouses

181
0:09:35.544,000 --> 0:09:39,000
anymore, and LORAN, the only backup to GPS,

182
0:09:40.197,000 --> 0:09:42,000
was discontinued last year.

183
0:09:42.617,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS.

184
0:09:47.53,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We're almost blindly reliant on it.

185
0:09:49.8,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure.

186
0:09:53.451,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Some call it "the invisible utility."

187
0:09:57.079,000 --> 0:10:,000
So, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience.

188
0:10:00.801,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It might be deadly.

189
0:10:05.171,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy

190
0:10:09.379,000 --> 0:10:12,000
at the expense of general GPS reliability,

191
0:10:12.868,000 --> 0:10:14,000
there's something even more potent

192
0:10:15.028,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and more subversive than a Wave Bubble,

193
0:10:18.82,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and that is a GPS spoofer.

194
0:10:22.209,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.

195
0:10:25.034,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.

196
0:10:29.011,000 --> 0:10:32,000
You imitate them, and if you do it right, the device

197
0:10:32.129,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed.

198
0:10:35.296,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So let me show you how this works.

199
0:10:36.928,000 --> 0:10:38,000
In any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside

200
0:10:39.653,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that corresponds to the authentic signals.

201
0:10:42.288,000 --> 0:10:44,000
These three red dots represent the tracking points

202
0:10:45.103,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that try to keep themselves centered on that peak.

203
0:10:47.982,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But if you send in a fake GPS signal,

204
0:10:51.047,000 --> 0:10:55,000
another peak pops up, and if you can get these two peaks

205
0:10:55.513,000 --> 0:10:59,000
perfectly aligned, the tracking points can't tell the difference,

206
0:11:00.231,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal,

207
0:11:03.542,000 --> 0:11:06,000
with the authentic peak getting forced off.

208
0:11:07.502,000 --> 0:11:09,000
At this point, the game is over.

209
0:11:09.669,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver.

210
0:11:13.406,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So is this really possible?

211
0:11:14.901,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Can someone really manipulate

212
0:11:16.624,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver

213
0:11:18.606,000 --> 0:11:2,000
just like that, with a spoofer?

214
0:11:21.485,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Well, the short answer is yes.

215
0:11:23.5,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The key is that civil GPS signals

216
0:11:26.304,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are completely open.

217
0:11:27.406,000 --> 0:11:3,000
They have no encryption. They have no authentication.

218
0:11:31.397,000 --> 0:11:34,000
They're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack.

219
0:11:34.892,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Even so, up until very recently,

220
0:11:37.467,000 --> 0:11:39,000
nobody worried about GPS spoofers.

221
0:11:39.859,000 --> 0:11:4,000
People figured that it would be too complex

222
0:11:41.837,000 --> 0:11:43,000
or too expensive for some hacker to build one.

223
0:11:44.652,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But I, and a friend of mine from graduate school,

224
0:11:48.604,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we didn't see it that way.

225
0:11:50.756,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We knew it wasn't going to be so hard,

226
0:11:53.229,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and we wanted to be the first to build one

227
0:11:55.157,000 --> 0:11:57,000
so we could get out in front of the problem

228
0:11:57.237,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and help protect against GPS spoofing.

229
0:12:01.343,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I remember vividly the week it all came together.

230
0:12:04.688,000 --> 0:12:07,000
We built it at my home, which means that

231
0:12:08.137,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.

232
0:12:12.526,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Here's Ramon — (Laughter) —

233
0:12:14.944,000 --> 0:12:17,000
looking for a little attention from Dad that week.

234
0:12:18.629,000 --> 0:12:2,000
At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables

235
0:12:20.899,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and computers, though we eventually got it packaged

236
0:12:23.781,000 --> 0:12:24,000
into a small box.

237
0:12:25.453,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now, the Dr. Frankenstein moment,

238
0:12:28.262,000 --> 0:12:3,000
when the spoofer finally came alive

239
0:12:30.989,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and I glimpsed its awful potential,

240
0:12:33.59,000 --> 0:12:35,000
came late one night when I tested the spoofer

241
0:12:36.326,000 --> 0:12:38,000
against my iPhone.

242
0:12:38.412,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Let me show you some actual footage from that

243
0:12:40.029,000 --> 0:12:41,000
very first experiment.

244
0:12:41.965,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I had come to completely trust this little blue dot

245
0:12:45.559,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and its reassuring blue halo.

246
0:12:47.194,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They seemed to speak to me.

247
0:12:48.269,000 --> 0:12:52,000
They'd say, "Here you are. Here you are." (Laughter)

248
0:12:52.929,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And "you can trust us."

249
0:12:55.799,000 --> 0:13:,000
So something felt very wrong about the world.

250
0:13:00.917,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It was a sense, almost, of betrayal,

251
0:13:03.5,000 --> 0:13:07,000
when this little blue dot started at my house,

252
0:13:07.691,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and went running off toward the north

253
0:13:09.303,000 --> 0:13:12,000
leaving me behind. I wasn't moving.

254
0:13:13.198,000 --> 0:13:17,000
What I then saw in this little moving blue dot

255
0:13:17.431,000 --> 0:13:19,000
was the potential for chaos.

256
0:13:20.149,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I saw airplanes and ships veering off course, with the captain

257
0:13:24.291,000 --> 0:13:28,000
learning only too late that something was wrong.

258
0:13:28.565,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I saw the GPS-derived timing

259
0:13:31.065,000 --> 0:13:32,000
of the New York Stock Exchange

260
0:13:32.796,000 --> 0:13:33,000
being manipulated by hackers.

261
0:13:34.746,000 --> 0:13:36,000
You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc

262
0:13:37.714,000 --> 0:13:39,000
you could cause if you knew what you were doing

263
0:13:40.364,000 --> 0:13:43,000
with a GPS spoofer.

264
0:13:43.717,000 --> 0:13:48,000
There is, though, one redeeming feature

265
0:13:48.861,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of the GPS spoofer.

266
0:13:51.317,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.

267
0:13:55.918,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Imagine, for example, you're being tracked.

268
0:13:59.005,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Well, you can play the tracker for a fool,

269
0:14:01.529,000 --> 0:14:03,000
pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation.

270
0:14:04.49,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Or, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend

271
0:14:07.205,000 --> 0:14:08,000
into some empty parking lot

272
0:14:08.522,000 --> 0:14:1,000
where the police are waiting for him.

273
0:14:10.823,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So I'm fascinated by this conflict, a looming conflict,

274
0:14:16.026,000 --> 0:14:18,000
between privacy on the one hand

275
0:14:18.691,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other.

276
0:14:22.89,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers,

277
0:14:25.935,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and yet, given the lack of effective legal means

278
0:14:29.671,000 --> 0:14:33,000
for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot,

279
0:14:33.77,000 --> 0:14:34,000
can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on,

280
0:14:35.642,000 --> 0:14:37,000
for wanting to use them?

281
0:14:38.058,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile

282
0:14:41.111,000 --> 0:14:44,000
this conflict with some sort of,

283
0:14:44.297,000 --> 0:14:49,000
some yet uninvented technology.

284
0:14:49.727,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But meanwhile, grab some popcorn,

285
0:14:52.853,000 --> 0:14:54,000
because things are going to get interesting.

286
0:14:54.98,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Within the next few years,

287
0:14:56.32,000 --> 0:15:,000
many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot.

288
0:15:00.574,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.

289
0:15:02.922,000 --> 0:15:05,000
You'll never lose track of your things again.

290
0:15:06.374,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life.

291
0:15:10.403,000 --> 0:15:12,000
But will you be able to resist the temptation

292
0:15:13.085,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to track your fellow man?

293
0:15:16.077,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Or will you be able to resist the temptation

294
0:15:17.909,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble

295
0:15:21.204,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to protect your own privacy?

296
0:15:23.972,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon

297
0:15:27.604,000 --> 0:15:3,000
is full of promise and peril.

298
0:15:30.944,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.

299
0:15:34.132,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thanks. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.738,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I haven't told many people this,

2
0:00:14.436,000 --> 0:00:16,000
but in my head, I've got

3
0:00:16.832,000 --> 0:00:18,000
thousands of secret worlds all going on

4
0:00:18.969,000 --> 0:00:2,000
all at the same time.

5
0:00:21.27,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I am also autistic.

6
0:00:23.603,000 --> 0:00:24,000
People tend to diagnose autism

7
0:00:25.549,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with really specific check-box descriptions,

8
0:00:28.868,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but in reality, it's a whole variation as to what we're like.

9
0:00:31.916,000 --> 0:00:32,000
For instance, my little brother,

10
0:00:33.649,000 --> 0:00:34,000
he's very severely autistic.

11
0:00:35.426,000 --> 0:00:37,000
He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all.

12
0:00:37.688,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I love to talk.

13
0:00:40.18,000 --> 0:00:43,000
People often associate autism

14
0:00:43.483,000 --> 0:00:45,000
with liking maths and science and nothing else,

15
0:00:46.156,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but I know so many autistic people

16
0:00:47.955,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who love being creative.

17
0:00:50.328,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But that is a stereotype,

18
0:00:52.77,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the stereotypes of things

19
0:00:54.626,000 --> 0:00:57,000
are often, if not always, wrong.

20
0:00:57.888,000 --> 0:00:59,000
For instance, a lot of people

21
0:01:00.306,000 --> 0:01:04,000
think autism and think "Rain Man" immediately.

22
0:01:04.559,000 --> 0:01:05,000
That's the common belief,

23
0:01:06.051,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that every single autistic person is Dustin Hoffman,

24
0:01:09.346,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and that's not true.

25
0:01:12.349,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But that's not just with autistic people, either.

26
0:01:15.15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I've seen it with LGBTQ people,

27
0:01:17.49,000 --> 0:01:19,000
with women, with POC people.

28
0:01:19.91,000 --> 0:01:21,000
People are so afraid of variety

29
0:01:22.428,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that they try to fit everything into a tiny little box

30
0:01:25.229,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with really specific labels.

31
0:01:27.524,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This is something that actually

32
0:01:29.155,000 --> 0:01:31,000
happened to me in real life:

33
0:01:31.833,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I googled "autistic people are ..."

34
0:01:34.521,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and it comes up with suggestions

35
0:01:36.624,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as to what you're going to type.

36
0:01:38.649,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I googled "autistic people are ..."

37
0:01:40.404,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and the top result was "demons."

38
0:01:43.617,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That is the first thing that people think

39
0:01:45.875,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when they think autism.

40
0:01:47.879,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They know.

41
0:01:49.785,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:56.604,000 --> 0:01:58,000
One of the things I can do because I'm autistic —

43
0:01:59.201,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it's an ability rather than a disability —

44
0:02:01.642,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is I've got a very, very vivid imagination.

45
0:02:05.177,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Let me explain it to you a bit.

46
0:02:06.85,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's like I'm walking in two worlds most of the time.

47
0:02:09.1,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There's the real world, the world that we all share,

48
0:02:11.634,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and there's the world in my mind,

49
0:02:13.614,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the world in my mind is often so much more real

50
0:02:16.651,000 --> 0:02:18,000
than the real world.

51
0:02:19.138,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Like, it's very easy for me to let my mind loose

52
0:02:22.509,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because I don't try and fit myself into a tiny little box.

53
0:02:25.38,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That's one of the best things about being autistic.

54
0:02:27.619,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You don't have the urge to do that.

55
0:02:29.588,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You find what you want to do,

56
0:02:32.356,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you find a way to do it, and you get on with it.

57
0:02:35.14,000 --> 0:02:37,000
If I was trying to fit myself into a box,

58
0:02:37.293,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have achieved

59
0:02:39.445,000 --> 0:02:41,000
half the things that I have now.

60
0:02:41.595,000 --> 0:02:42,000
There are problems, though.

61
0:02:43.371,000 --> 0:02:45,000
There are problems with being autistic,

62
0:02:45.536,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and there are problems with having too much imagination.

63
0:02:48.256,000 --> 0:02:5,000
School can be a problem in general,

64
0:02:50.459,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but having also to explain to a teacher

65
0:02:54.49,000 --> 0:02:56,000
on a daily basis

66
0:02:56.672,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that their lesson is inexplicably dull

67
0:03:00.317,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and you are secretly taking refuge

68
0:03:02.938,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in a world inside your head in which you are not in that lesson,

69
0:03:06.9,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that adds to your list of problems.

70
0:03:10.396,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:12.264,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Also, when my imagination takes hold,

72
0:03:16.684,000 --> 0:03:17,000
my body takes on a life of its own.

73
0:03:18.518,000 --> 0:03:2,000
When something very exciting happens in my inner world,

74
0:03:21.476,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I've just got to run.

75
0:03:22.98,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I've got to rock backwards and forwards,

76
0:03:24.896,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or sometimes scream.

77
0:03:26.684,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This gives me so much energy,

78
0:03:28.934,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and I've got to have an outlet for all that energy.

79
0:03:31.555,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But I've done that ever since I was a child,

80
0:03:33.659,000 --> 0:03:34,000
ever since I was a tiny little girl.

81
0:03:35.377,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And my parents thought it was cute, so they didn't bring it up,

82
0:03:38.246,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but when I got into school,

83
0:03:39.864,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they didn't really agree that it was cute.

84
0:03:42.165,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It can be that people don't want to be friends

85
0:03:44.83,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with the girl that starts screaming in an algebra lesson.

86
0:03:47.807,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And this doesn't normally happen in this day and age,

87
0:03:51.713,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but it can be that people don't want to be friends with the autistic girl.

88
0:03:55.29,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It can be that people don't want to associate

89
0:03:58.572,000 --> 0:04:,000
with anyone who won't or can't fit themselves

90
0:04:01.336,000 --> 0:04:03,000
into a box that's labeled normal.

91
0:04:04.306,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But that's fine with me,

92
0:04:06.472,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because it sorts the wheat from the chaff,

93
0:04:08.606,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I can find which people are genuine and true

94
0:04:11.373,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I can pick these people as my friends.

95
0:04:13.929,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But if you think about it, what is normal?

96
0:04:17.349,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What does it mean?

97
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Imagine if that was the best compliment you ever received.

98
0:04:21.94,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"Wow, you are really normal."

99
0:04:24.221,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:25.606,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But compliments are,

101
0:04:29.01,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"you are extraordinary"

102
0:04:30.418,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or "you step outside the box."

103
0:04:32.252,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's "you're amazing."

104
0:04:33.973,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So if people want to be these things,

105
0:04:35.863,000 --> 0:04:37,000
why are so many people striving to be normal?

106
0:04:38.371,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Why are people pouring their brilliant individual light into a mold?

107
0:04:43.385,000 --> 0:04:47,000
People are so afraid of variety that they try and force everyone,

108
0:04:48.14,000 --> 0:04:51,000
even people who don't want to or can't, to become normal.

109
0:04:51.858,000 --> 0:04:53,000
There are camps for LGBTQ people

110
0:04:54.697,000 --> 0:04:57,000
or autistic people to try and make them this "normal,"

111
0:04:58.173,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and that's terrifying that people would do that in this day and age.

112
0:05:02.698,000 --> 0:05:06,000
All in all, I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world.

113
0:05:07.305,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because I am autistic,

114
0:05:09.295,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I've presented documentaries to the BBC,

115
0:05:12.287,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm in the midst of writing a book,

116
0:05:14.526,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I'm doing this — this is fantastic —

117
0:05:16.674,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and one of the best things that I've achieved,

118
0:05:19.925,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that I consider to have achieved,

119
0:05:22.51,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is I've found ways of communicating

120
0:05:24.492,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with my little brother and sister,

121
0:05:26.337,000 --> 0:05:29,000
who as I've said are nonverbal. They can't speak.

122
0:05:29.7,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And people would often write off someone who's nonverbal,

123
0:05:32.56,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but that's silly, because my little brother and sister

124
0:05:35.294,000 --> 0:05:37,000
are the best siblings that you could ever hope for.

125
0:05:37.987,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They're just the best, and I love them so much

126
0:05:40.274,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I care about them more than anything else.

127
0:05:43.829,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I'm going to leave you with one question:

128
0:05:46.507,000 --> 0:05:49,000
If we can't get inside the person's minds,

129
0:05:49.644,000 --> 0:05:51,000
no matter if they're autistic or not,

130
0:05:51.737,000 --> 0:05:54,000
instead of punishing anything that strays from normal,

131
0:05:54.774,000 --> 0:05:55,000
why not celebrate uniqueness

132
0:05:56.529,000 --> 0:06:,000
and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination?

133
0:06:00.59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Thank you.

134
0:06:02.166,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

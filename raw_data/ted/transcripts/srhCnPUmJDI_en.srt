1
0:00:12.708,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I know for sure there's at least one thing I have in common with dentists.

2
0:00:17.792,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I absolutely hate the holiday of Halloween.

3
0:00:22.167,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, this hatred stems not from a dislike of cavities,

4
0:00:25.833,000 --> 0:00:27,000
nor was it a lifetime in the making.

5
0:00:28.207,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Rather, this hatred stems from a particular incident

6
0:00:31.375,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that happened nine years ago.

7
0:00:33.458,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Nine years ago, I was even younger, I was 20 years old,

8
0:00:37.333,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and I was an intern in the White House.

9
0:00:39.5,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The other White House.

10
0:00:40.792,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And my job was to work with mayors and councilors nationwide.

11
0:00:44.042,000 --> 0:00:47,000
November 1, 2010 began just like any other day.

12
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I turned on the computer, went on Google and prepared to write my news clips.

13
0:00:52.75,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I was met with a call from my mother, which isn't that out the norm,

14
0:00:56.083,000 --> 0:00:59,000
my mom likes to text, call, email, Facebook, Instagram, all that.

15
0:01:00.667,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So I answered the phone expecting to hear maybe some church gossip,

16
0:01:04.875,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or maybe something from WorldStarHipHop she had discovered.

17
0:01:08.833,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But when I answered the phone,

18
0:01:11.083,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I was met with a tone that was unlike anything I had ever heard from my mother.

19
0:01:15.625,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My mother's loud.

20
0:01:17.083,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But she spoke in a hush, still, muffled tone

21
0:01:21.375,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that conveyed a sense of sadness.

22
0:01:23.875,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And as she whispered, she said, "Michael,

23
0:01:26.333,000 --> 0:01:29,000
your cousin Donnell was murdered last night,

24
0:01:29.583,000 --> 0:01:3,000
on Halloween,

25
0:01:30.875,000 --> 0:01:32,000
at a house party in Stockton."

26
0:01:33.25,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And like far too many people in this country,

27
0:01:35.708,000 --> 0:01:36,000
particularly from communities like mine,

28
0:01:37.667,000 --> 0:01:38,000
particularly that look like me,

29
0:01:39.375,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I spent the better part of the year dealing with anger, rage, nihilism,

30
0:01:44.417,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I had a choice to make.

31
0:01:46.167,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The choice was one between action and apathy.

32
0:01:49.583,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The choice was what could I do to put purpose to this pain.

33
0:01:54.292,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I spent a year dealing with feelings of survivor's guilt.

34
0:01:57.542,000 --> 0:01:59,000
What was the point of me being at Stanford,

35
0:01:59.583,000 --> 0:02:01,000
what was the point of me being at the White House

36
0:02:01.917,000 --> 0:02:03,000
if I was powerless to help my own family?

37
0:02:04.125,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And my own family was dying, quite literally.

38
0:02:07.958,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I then began to feel a little selfish and say,

39
0:02:10.25,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what's the point of even trying to make the world a better place?

40
0:02:13.333,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Maybe that's just the way it is.

41
0:02:15.292,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Maybe I would be smart to take advantage of all the opportunities given to me

42
0:02:19.083,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and make as much money as possible,

43
0:02:20.792,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so I'm comfortable, and my immediate family is comfortable.

44
0:02:23.917,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But finally, towards the end of that year,

45
0:02:26.042,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I realized I wanted to do something.

46
0:02:28.292,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So I made the crazy decision, as a senior in college,

47
0:02:31.542,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to run for city council.

48
0:02:33.625,000 --> 0:02:36,000
That decision was unlikely for a couple of reasons,

49
0:02:36.708,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and not just my age.

50
0:02:38.292,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You see, my family is far from a political dynasty.

51
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
More men in my family have been incarcerated than in college.

52
0:02:46.25,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In fact, as I speak today, my father is still incarcerated.

53
0:02:50.125,000 --> 0:02:52,000
My mother, she had me as a teenager,

54
0:02:52.5,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and government wasn't something we had warm feelings from.

55
0:02:55.792,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You see, it was the government

56
0:02:57.5,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that red-lined the neighborhoods I grew up in.

57
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Full of liquor stores and no grocery stores,

58
0:03:02.167,000 --> 0:03:05,000
there was a lack of opportunity and concentrated poverty.

59
0:03:05.417,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It was the government and the politicians

60
0:03:07.792,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that made choices,

61
0:03:09.083,000 --> 0:03:1,000
like the war on drugs and three strikes,

62
0:03:11.083,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that have incarcerated far too many people in our country.

63
0:03:14.167,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It was the government and political actors

64
0:03:16.667,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that made the decisions that created the school funding formulas,

65
0:03:19.792,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that made it so the school I went to receive less per pupil spending

66
0:03:23.5,000 --> 0:03:24,000
than schools in more affluent areas.

67
0:03:25.458,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So there was nothing about that background that made it likely for me to choose

68
0:03:29.208,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to be involved in being a government actor.

69
0:03:31.292,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And at the same time, Stockton was a very unlikely place.

70
0:03:34.75,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Stockton is my home town, a city of 320,000 people.

71
0:03:38.542,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But historically, it's been a place people run from, rather than come back to.

72
0:03:42.917,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's a city that's incredibly diverse.

73
0:03:45.042,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Thirty-five percent Latino, 35 percent white,

74
0:03:47.875,000 --> 0:03:49,000
20 percent Asian, 10 percent African American,

75
0:03:50.375,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the oldest Sikh temple in North America.

76
0:03:52.667,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But at the time I ran for office,

77
0:03:54.542,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we were also the largest city in the country at that time

78
0:03:57.792,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to declare bankruptcy.

79
0:03:59.292,000 --> 0:04:01,000
At the time I decided to run for office,

80
0:04:01.333,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we also had more murders per capita than Chicago.

81
0:04:04.583,000 --> 0:04:05,000
At the time I decided to run for office,

82
0:04:06.542,000 --> 0:04:08,000
we had a 23 percent poverty rate,

83
0:04:09.333,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a 17 percent college attainment rate

84
0:04:11.875,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and a host of challenges and issues beyond the scope of any 21-year-old.

85
0:04:17.083,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So after I won my election,

86
0:04:18.625,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I did what I usually do when I feel overwhelmed,

87
0:04:20.917,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I realized the problems of Stockton were far bigger than me

88
0:04:24.667,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and that I might need a little divine intervention.

89
0:04:27.5,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So as I prepared for my first council meeting,

90
0:04:29.666,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I went back to some wisdom my grandmother taught me.

91
0:04:32.708,000 --> 0:04:33,000
A parable I think we all know,

92
0:04:34.583,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that really constitutes the governing frame we're using

93
0:04:37.179,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to reinvent Stockton today.

94
0:04:39.208,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I remember in Sunday school, my grandmother told me

95
0:04:41.625,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that at one time, a guy asked Jesus, "Who was my neighbor?

96
0:04:45.583,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Who was my fellow citizen?

97
0:04:47.5,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Who am I responsible for?"

98
0:04:49.375,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And instead of a short answer, Jesus replied with a parable.

99
0:04:52.583,000 --> 0:04:54,000
He said there was a man on a journey,

100
0:04:55.042,000 --> 0:04:57,000
walking down Jericho Road.

101
0:04:57.25,000 --> 0:04:58,000
As he was walking down the road,

102
0:04:58.833,000 --> 0:05:,000
he was beat up, left on the side of the road,

103
0:05:01.333,000 --> 0:05:02,000
stripped of all his clothes,

104
0:05:02.792,000 --> 0:05:04,000
had everything stolen from and left to die.

105
0:05:05.75,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And then a priest came by, saw the man on the side of the road,

106
0:05:10.167,000 --> 0:05:11,000
maybe said a silent prayer,

107
0:05:12.083,000 --> 0:05:14,000
hopes and prayers, prayers that he gets better.

108
0:05:15.083,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Maybe saw the man on the side of the road

109
0:05:17.125,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and surmised that it was ordained by God

110
0:05:20.083,000 --> 0:05:22,000
for this particular man, this particular group

111
0:05:22.542,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to be on the side of the road, there's nothing I can do to change it.

112
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
After the priest walked by, maybe a politician walked by.

113
0:05:29.25,000 --> 0:05:31,000
A 28-year-old politician, for example.

114
0:05:31.625,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Saw the man on the side of the road and saw how beat up the man was,

115
0:05:36.25,000 --> 0:05:39,000
saw that the man was a victim of violence, or fleeing violence.

116
0:05:39.583,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And the politician decided, "You know what?

117
0:05:41.625,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Instead of welcoming this man in, let's build a wall.

118
0:05:44.167,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Maybe the politician said,

119
0:05:45.542,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"Maybe this man chose to be on the side of the road."

120
0:05:48.75,000 --> 0:05:5,000
That if he just pulled himself up by his bootstraps,

121
0:05:51.333,000 --> 0:05:52,000
despite his boots being stolen,

122
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and got himself back on the horse,

123
0:05:55.167,000 --> 0:05:58,000
he could be successful, and there's nothing I could do."

124
0:05:58.458,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And then finally, my grandmother said, a good Samaritan came by,

125
0:06:02.542,000 --> 0:06:04,000
saw the man on the side of the road

126
0:06:05.25,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and looked and saw not centuries of hatred

127
0:06:07.958,000 --> 0:06:08,000
between Jews and Samaritans,

128
0:06:09.667,000 --> 0:06:13,000
looked and saw not his fears reflected,

129
0:06:14.125,000 --> 0:06:15,000
not economic anxiety,

130
0:06:15.542,000 --> 0:06:17,000
not "what's going to happen to me because things are changing."

131
0:06:18.542,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But looked and saw a reflection of himself.

132
0:06:20.583,000 --> 0:06:22,000
He saw his neighbor, he saw his common humanity.

133
0:06:23.583,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He didn't just see it, he did something about it,

134
0:06:25.893,000 --> 0:06:26,000
my grandmother said.

135
0:06:27.167,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He got down on one knee,

136
0:06:28.5,000 --> 0:06:29,000
he made sure the man was OK,

137
0:06:30.458,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and I heard, even gave him a room at that nice Fairmont,

138
0:06:33.417,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the Pan Pacific one.

139
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:39.333,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And as I prepared to govern,

141
0:06:40.792,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I realized that given the diversity of Stockton,

142
0:06:43.792,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the first step to making change will be to again answer the same question:

143
0:06:48.708,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Who is our neighbor?

144
0:06:50.25,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And realizing that our destiny as a city was tied up in everyone.

145
0:06:55.583,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Particularly those who are left on the side of the road.

146
0:06:59.083,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But then I realized that charity isn't justice,

147
0:07:03.042,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that acts of empathy isn't justice,

148
0:07:05.833,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that being a good neighbor is necessary but not sufficient,

149
0:07:09.042,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and there was more that had to be done.

150
0:07:11.25,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So looking at the story,

151
0:07:12.542,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I realized that the road, Jericho Road, has a nickname.

152
0:07:16.125,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's known as the Bloody Pass, the Ascent of Red,

153
0:07:19.583,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because the road is structured for violence.

154
0:07:22.667,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This Jericho Road is narrow, it's conducive for ambushing.

155
0:07:26.375,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Meaning, a man on the side of the road wasn't abnormal.

156
0:07:29.625,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Wasn't strange.

157
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And in fact, it was something that was structured to happen,

158
0:07:33.875,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it was supposed to happen.

159
0:07:35.417,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And Johan Galtung, a peace theorist,

160
0:07:37.5,000 --> 0:07:39,000
talks about structural violence in our society.

161
0:07:40.458,000 --> 0:07:44,000
He says, "Structural violence is the avoidable impairment

162
0:07:44.542,000 --> 0:07:45,000
of basic human needs."

163
0:07:46.333,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Dr. Paul Farmer talks about structural violence

164
0:07:49.333,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and talks about how it's the way

165
0:07:50.881,000 --> 0:07:53,000
our institutions, our policies, our culture

166
0:07:54.542,000 --> 0:07:58,000
creates outcomes that advantage some people and disadvantage others.

167
0:07:59.042,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And then I realized, much like the road in Jericho,

168
0:08:01.833,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in many ways, Stockton, our society,

169
0:08:04.333,000 --> 0:08:06,000
has been structured for the outcomes we complain about.

170
0:08:07.042,000 --> 0:08:08,000
That we should not be surprised

171
0:08:08.583,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when we see that kids in poverty don't do well in school,

172
0:08:11.333,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that we should not be surprised to see wealth gaps by race and ethnicity.

173
0:08:14.875,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We should not be surprised to see income pay disparities between genders,

174
0:08:18.333,000 --> 0:08:21,000
because that's what our society, historically, has been structured to do,

175
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and it's working accordingly.

176
0:08:24.417,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Applause)

177
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So taking this wisdom,

178
0:08:31.542,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I rolled up my sleeves and began to work.

179
0:08:33.917,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And there's three quick stories I want to share,

180
0:08:36.208,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that point to not that we figured everything out,

181
0:08:38.542,000 --> 0:08:39,000
not that we have arrived,

182
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but we're trending in the right direction.

183
0:08:42.5,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The first story, about the neighbor.

184
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
When I was a city council member,

185
0:08:46.625,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I was working with one of the most conservative members in our community

186
0:08:50.125,000 --> 0:08:53,000
on opening a health clinic for undocumented people

187
0:08:53.542,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in the south part of the city, and I loved it.

188
0:08:56.25,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And as we opened the clinic,

189
0:08:57.833,000 --> 0:08:59,000
we had a resolution to sign,

190
0:09:00.208,000 --> 0:09:01,000
he presented me a gift.

191
0:09:02.167,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It was an O'Reilly Factor lifetime membership pin.

192
0:09:06.833,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:09.5,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Mind you, I didn't ask what he did to get such a gift.

194
0:09:13.792,000 --> 0:09:16,000
What blood oath -- I had no idea how he got it.

195
0:09:17.042,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But I looked at him and I said,

196
0:09:18.583,000 --> 0:09:21,000
"Well, how are we working together to open a health clinic,

197
0:09:22.5,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to provide free health care for undocumented people,

198
0:09:25.792,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and you're an O'Reilly Factor member?"

199
0:09:28.25,000 --> 0:09:29,000
He looked at me and said,

200
0:09:29.542,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"Councilman Tubbs, this is for my neighbors."

201
0:09:32.417,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And he's a great example of what it means

202
0:09:34.667,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to be a good neighbor, at least in that instance.

203
0:09:38.208,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The robbers.

204
0:09:39.5,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So after four years on city council, I decided to run for mayor,

205
0:09:42.75,000 --> 0:09:45,000
realizing that being a part-time councilman wasn't enough

206
0:09:46.125,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to enact the structural changes we need to see in Stockton,

207
0:09:49.583,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and I came to that conclusion by looking at the data.

208
0:09:53.125,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So my old council district, where I grew up,

209
0:09:55.417,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is 10 minutes away from a more affluent district.

210
0:09:58.458,000 --> 0:10:,000
And 10 minutes away in the same city,

211
0:10:00.583,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the difference between zip code 95205 and 95219

212
0:10:05.917,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in life expectancy is 10 years.

213
0:10:09.708,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Ten minutes away, 4.5 miles,

214
0:10:12.75,000 --> 0:10:14,000
10 years life expectancy difference,

215
0:10:14.917,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and not because of the choices people are making.

216
0:10:17.375,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Because no one chose to live in an unsafe community

217
0:10:19.833,000 --> 0:10:2,000
where they can't exercise.

218
0:10:21.125,000 --> 0:10:24,000
No one chose to put more liquor stores than grocery stores in the community.

219
0:10:24.721,000 --> 0:10:26,000
No one chose these things, but that's the reality.

220
0:10:27.083,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I realized, as a councilman,

221
0:10:28.458,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to enact a structural change I wanted to see,

222
0:10:30.625,000 --> 0:10:31,000
where between the same zip codes

223
0:10:32.208,000 --> 0:10:34,000
there's a 30 percent difference in the rate of unemployment,

224
0:10:35.083,000 --> 0:10:37,000
there's a 75,000 dollars a year difference in income,

225
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that being a councilman was not going to cut it.

226
0:10:40.263,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So that's when I decided to run for mayor.

227
0:10:42.333,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And as mayor, we've been focused on the robbers and the road.

228
0:10:46.5,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So in Stockton, as I mentioned,

229
0:10:48.042,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we have historically had problems with violent crime.

230
0:10:50.583,000 --> 0:10:53,000
In fact, that's why I decided to run for office in the first place.

231
0:10:53.792,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And my first job as mayor was helping our community

232
0:10:56.25,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to see ourselves, our neighbors,

233
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
not just in the people victimized by violence

234
0:11:00.375,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but also in the perpetrators.

235
0:11:02.583,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We realized that those who enact pain in our society,

236
0:11:05.917,000 --> 0:11:08,000
those who are committing homicides and contributing to gun violence,

237
0:11:09.132,000 --> 0:11:11,000
are oftentimes victims themselves.

238
0:11:11.333,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They have high rates of trauma, they have been shot at,

239
0:11:13.929,000 --> 0:11:15,000
they've known people who have been shot.

240
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
That doesn't excuse their behavior, but it helps explain it,

241
0:11:18.875,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and as a community, we have to see these folks as us, too.

242
0:11:21.625,000 --> 0:11:22,000
That they too are our neighbors.

243
0:11:23.458,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So for the past three years --

244
0:11:25.5,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

245
0:11:30.292,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So for the past three years, we've been working on two strategies:

246
0:11:33.667,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Ceasefire and Advance Peace,

247
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
where we give these guys as much attention, as much love

248
0:11:38.667,000 --> 0:11:41,000
from social services, from opportunities, from tattoo removals,

249
0:11:41.875,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in some cases even cash,

250
0:11:43.583,000 --> 0:11:44,000
as a gift from law enforcement.

251
0:11:45.167,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And last year, we saw a 40 percent reduction in homicides

252
0:11:49.75,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and a 30 percent reduction in violent crime.

253
0:11:52.875,000 --> 0:11:57,000
(Applause)

254
0:11:58.417,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And now, the road.

255
0:11:59.708,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I mentioned that my community has a 23 percent poverty rate.

256
0:12:03.542,000 --> 0:12:07,000
As someone who comes from poverty, it's a personal issue for me.

257
0:12:07.583,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So I decided that we wouldn't just do a program,

258
0:12:10.5,000 --> 0:12:12,000
or we wouldn't just do something to go around the edges,

259
0:12:13.208,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but we would call into question the very structure

260
0:12:15.583,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that produces poverty in the first place.

261
0:12:17.667,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So starting in February, we launched a basic income demonstration,

262
0:12:20.958,000 --> 0:12:21,000
where for the next 18 months,

263
0:12:22.708,000 --> 0:12:25,000
as a pilot, 130 families, randomly selected,

264
0:12:26.25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
who live in zip codes at or below the median income of the city,

265
0:12:30.042,000 --> 0:12:31,000
are given 500 dollars a month.

266
0:12:31.792,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And we're doing this for a couple of reasons.

267
0:12:33.917,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We're doing it because we realize

268
0:12:35.583,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that something is structurally wrong in America,

269
0:12:37.875,000 --> 0:12:4,000
when one in two Americans can't afford one 400-dollar emergency.

270
0:12:41.292,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We're doing it because we realize that something is structurally wrong

271
0:12:44.667,000 --> 0:12:48,000
when wages have only increased six percent between 1979 and 2013.

272
0:12:48.833,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We're doing it because we realize something is structurally wrong

273
0:12:51.958,000 --> 0:12:52,000
when people working two and three jobs,

274
0:12:53.875,000 --> 0:12:55,000
doing all the jobs no one in here wants to do,

275
0:12:56.083,000 --> 0:12:58,000
can't pay for necessities, like rent,

276
0:12:58.25,000 --> 0:13:01,000
like lights, like health care, like childcare.

277
0:13:01.708,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Applause)

278
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So I would say, Stockton again, we have real issues.

279
0:13:10.417,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I have constituent emails in my phone now, about the homelessness issue,

280
0:13:14.125,000 --> 0:13:16,000
about some of the violent crime we're still experiencing.

281
0:13:16.833,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But I would say, I think as a society, we would be wise to go back

282
0:13:20.958,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to those old Bible stories we were taught growing up,

283
0:13:23.5,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and understand that number one,

284
0:13:25.042,000 --> 0:13:27,000
we have to begin to see each other as neighbors,

285
0:13:27.305,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that when we see someone different from us,

286
0:13:29.375,000 --> 0:13:33,000
they should not reflect our fears, our anxieties, our insecurities,

287
0:13:33.917,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the prejudices we've been taught, our biases -- but we should see ourselves.

288
0:13:38.208,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We should see our common humanity.

289
0:13:39.875,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Because I think once we do that,

290
0:13:41.423,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we can do the more important work of restructuring the road.

291
0:13:44.667,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Because again, I understand some listening are saying,

292
0:13:47.215,000 --> 0:13:5,000
"Well, Mayor Tubbs, you're talking about structural violence and structural this,

293
0:13:51.083,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but you're on the stage.

294
0:13:52.833,000 --> 0:13:55,000
That the structures can't be too bad if you could come up from poverty,

295
0:13:56.417,000 --> 0:13:58,000
have a father in jail, go to Stanford,

296
0:13:58.667,000 --> 0:14:,000
work in the White House and become mayor."

297
0:14:00.708,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And I would respond by saying the term for that is exceptionalism.

298
0:14:05.667,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Meaning that we recognize it's exceptional for people to escape the structures.

299
0:14:09.792,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Meaning by our very language,

300
0:14:11.25,000 --> 0:14:14,000
we understand that the things we're seeing in our world are by design.

301
0:14:14.583,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And I think that task for us, as TEDsters,

302
0:14:17.583,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and as good people, just people, moral people,

303
0:14:20.667,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is really do the hard work necessary of not just joining hands as neighbors,

304
0:14:25.958,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but using our hands to restructure our road,

305
0:14:28.375,000 --> 0:14:31,000
a road that in this country has been rooted in things like white supremacy.

306
0:14:32.375,000 --> 0:14:35,000
A road like in this country has been rooted in things like misogyny.

307
0:14:35.792,000 --> 0:14:37,000
A road that's not working for far too many people.

308
0:14:38.542,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And I think today, tomorrow and 2020 we have a chance to change that.

309
0:14:43.542,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So as I prepare to close,

310
0:14:46.708,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I started with a story from nine years ago and I'll end with one.

311
0:14:50.083,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So after my cousin was murdered,

312
0:14:51.631,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I was lucky enough to go on the Freedom Rides

313
0:14:54.25,000 --> 0:14:56,000
with some of the original freedom riders.

314
0:14:56.542,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And they taught me a lot about restructuring the road.

315
0:15:00.167,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And one guy in particular, Bob Singleton, asked me a question

316
0:15:03.417,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I'm going to leave with us today.

317
0:15:05.542,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We were going to Anniston, Alabama, and he said, "Michael,"

318
0:15:10.125,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and I said, "Yes, sir."

319
0:15:11.542,000 --> 0:15:15,000
He said, "I was arrested on August 4, 1961.

320
0:15:15.75,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Now why is that day important?"

321
0:15:18.583,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And I said, "Well, you were arrested,

322
0:15:21.208,000 --> 0:15:23,000
if you weren't arrested, we wouldn't be on this bus.

323
0:15:23.667,000 --> 0:15:26,000
if we weren't on this bus, we wouldn't have the rights we enjoy."

324
0:15:26.75,000 --> 0:15:27,000
He rolled his eyes and said, "No, son."

325
0:15:28.632,000 --> 0:15:3,000
He said, "On that day, Barack Obama was born."

326
0:15:32.333,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And then he said he had no idea that the choice he made

327
0:15:36.042,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to restructure the road

328
0:15:37.625,000 --> 0:15:38,000
would pave the way,

329
0:15:38.917,000 --> 0:15:41,000
so a child born as a second class citizen,

330
0:15:42.417,000 --> 0:15:45,000
who wouldn't be able to even get a cup of water at a counter,

331
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
would have the chance, 50 years later, to be president.

332
0:15:49.083,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Then he looked at me and he said,

333
0:15:50.708,000 --> 0:15:53,000
"What are you prepared to do today

334
0:15:53.917,000 --> 0:15:54,000
so that 50 years from now

335
0:15:55.583,000 --> 0:15:57,000
a child born has a chance to be president?"

336
0:15:57.667,000 --> 0:16:,000
And I think, TED, that's the question before us today.

337
0:16:01.083,000 --> 0:16:03,000
We know things are jacked up.

338
0:16:03.667,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I think what we've seen recently isn't abnormal

339
0:16:06.042,000 --> 0:16:09,000
but a reflection of a system that's been structured

340
0:16:09.167,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to produce such crazy outcomes.

341
0:16:11.292,000 --> 0:16:13,000
But I think it's also an opportunity.

342
0:16:13.458,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Because these structures we inherit aren't acts of God

343
0:16:16.083,000 --> 0:16:18,000
but acts of men and women, they're policy choices,

344
0:16:18.441,000 --> 0:16:2,000
they're by politicians like me, approved by voters like you.

345
0:16:21.292,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And we have the chance and the awesome opportunity

346
0:16:23.958,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to do something about it.

347
0:16:25.708,000 --> 0:16:28,000
So my question is: What are we prepared to do today,

348
0:16:29.708,000 --> 0:16:32,000
so that a child born today, 50 years from now

349
0:16:33.25,000 --> 0:16:37,000
isn't born in a society rooted in white supremacy;

350
0:16:37.542,000 --> 0:16:4,000
isn't born into a society riddled with misogyny;

351
0:16:41.5,000 --> 0:16:44,000
isn't born into a society riddled with homophobia and transphobia

352
0:16:45.5,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and ableism,

353
0:16:48.292,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and all the phobias and -isms?

354
0:16:49.833,000 --> 0:16:51,000
What are we prepared to do today,

355
0:16:52.583,000 --> 0:16:53,000
so that 50 years from now

356
0:16:54.417,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we have a road in our society that's structured

357
0:16:57.25,000 --> 0:17:,000
to reflect what we hold to be self-evident?

358
0:17:00.875,000 --> 0:17:02,000
That all men, that all women,

359
0:17:03.833,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that even all trans people

360
0:17:05.958,000 --> 0:17:06,000
are created equal

361
0:17:07.5,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and are endowed by your Creator with certain unalienable rights,

362
0:17:11.292,000 --> 0:17:15,000
including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
0:17:15.708,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Thank you.

364
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:23,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I read poetry all the time

2
0:00:15.462,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and write about it frequently

3
0:00:17.022,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and take poems apart

4
0:00:18.63,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to see how they work

5
0:00:20.273,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because I'm a word person.

6
0:00:21.98,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I understand the world best, most fully,

7
0:00:24.757,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,

8
0:00:27.65,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and when I have a new experience or a new feeling,

9
0:00:30.218,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm a little frustrated

10
0:00:31.368,000 --> 0:00:34,000
until I can try to put it into words.

11
0:00:34.563,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I think I've always been that way.

12
0:00:36.874,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.

13
0:00:39.72,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I found poems by Andrew Marvell

14
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson

15
0:00:43.718,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and William Butler Yeats

16
0:00:45.122,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because they were quoted in science fiction,

17
0:00:47.402,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I loved their sounds

18
0:00:48.563,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I went on to read about ottava rima

19
0:00:51.97,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and medial caesuras and enjambment

20
0:00:54.979,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and all that other technical stuff

21
0:00:56.81,000 --> 0:01:,000
that you care about if you already care about poems,

22
0:01:00.93,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because poems already made me happier

23
0:01:04.176,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and sadder and more alive.

24
0:01:06.259,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I became a poetry critic

25
0:01:08.088,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because I wanted to know how and why.

26
0:01:12.828,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose

27
0:01:17.62,000 --> 0:01:2,000
any more than music or computer programming

28
0:01:20.724,000 --> 0:01:21,000
serve one purpose.

29
0:01:22.586,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The greek word poem, it just means "a made thing,"

30
0:01:26.554,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and poetry is a set of techniques,

31
0:01:28.567,000 --> 0:01:29,000
ways of making patterns

32
0:01:30.518,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that put emotions into words.

33
0:01:32.607,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The more techniques you know,

34
0:01:34.617,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the more things you can make,

35
0:01:37.069,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and the more patterns you can recognize

36
0:01:40.289,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in things you might already like or love.

37
0:01:44.454,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That said, poetry does seem to be

38
0:01:47.491,000 --> 0:01:49,000
especially good at certain things.

39
0:01:50.425,000 --> 0:01:56,000
For example, we are all going to die.

40
0:01:56.93,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Poetry can help us live with that.

41
0:01:59.653,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Poems are made of words, nothing but words.

42
0:02:02.226,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The particulars in poems are like

43
0:02:04.618,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the particularities, the personalities,

44
0:02:06.114,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that distinguish people from one another.

45
0:02:09.391,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Poems are easy to share, easy to pass on,

46
0:02:12.162,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and when you read a poem, you can imagine

47
0:02:13.982,000 --> 0:02:17,000
someone's speaking to you or for you,

48
0:02:17.99,000 --> 0:02:18,000
maybe even someone far away

49
0:02:19.905,000 --> 0:02:23,000
or someone made up or someone deceased.

50
0:02:24.337,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's why we can go to poems when we want to

51
0:02:28.782,000 --> 0:02:3,000
remember something or someone,

52
0:02:31.22,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to celebrate or to look beyond death

53
0:02:34.332,000 --> 0:02:35,000
or to say goodbye,

54
0:02:36.192,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and that's one reason poems can seem important,

55
0:02:40.012,000 --> 0:02:42,000
even to people who aren't me,

56
0:02:42.035,000 --> 0:02:46,000
who don't so much live in a world of words.

57
0:02:46.74,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The poet Frank O'Hara said,

58
0:02:48.836,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"If you don't need poetry, bully for you,"

59
0:02:52.09,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but he also said when he didn't want to be alive anymore,

60
0:02:55.722,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems

61
0:02:58.232,000 --> 0:02:59,000
had stopped him.

62
0:03:00.1,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Poetry helps me want to be alive,

63
0:03:02.137,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and I want to show you why by showing you how,

64
0:03:05.256,000 --> 0:03:08,000
how a couple of poems react to the fact that

65
0:03:08.334,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we're alive in one place at one time in one culture,

66
0:03:11.27,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and in another we won't be alive at all.

67
0:03:16.646,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So here's one of the first poems I memorized.

68
0:03:20.71,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It could address a child or an adult.

69
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:28,000
"From far, from eve and morning

70
0:03:28.551,000 --> 0:03:3,000
From yon twelve-winded sky,

71
0:03:31.377,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The stuff of life to knit me

72
0:03:33.477,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Blew hither; here am I.

73
0:03:35.647,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now — for a breath I tarry

74
0:03:37.913,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Nor yet disperse apart —

75
0:03:40.033,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Take my hand quick and tell me,

76
0:03:42.109,000 --> 0:03:44,000
What have you in your heart.

77
0:03:44.212,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Speak now, and I will answer;

78
0:03:46.669,000 --> 0:03:48,000
How shall I help you, say;

79
0:03:49.249,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Ere to the wind's twelve quarters

80
0:03:51.413,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I take my endless way."

81
0:03:54.508,000 --> 0:03:56,000
[A. E. Housman]

82
0:03:56.677,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, this poem has appealed

83
0:03:58.121,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to science fiction writers.

84
0:03:59.524,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's furnished at least three science fiction titles,

85
0:04:02.693,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I think because it says poems can brings us news

86
0:04:05.421,000 --> 0:04:06,000
from the future or the past

87
0:04:07.414,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or across the world,

88
0:04:10.221,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because their patterns can seem to tell you

89
0:04:12.926,000 --> 0:04:13,000
what's in somebody's heart.

90
0:04:14.677,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It says poems can bring people together temporarily,

91
0:04:17.549,000 --> 0:04:19,000
which I think is true,

92
0:04:19.629,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes

93
0:04:23.166,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but for how it rhymes,

94
0:04:24.604,000 --> 0:04:26,000
cleanly and simply on the two and four,

95
0:04:26.991,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"say" and "way,"

96
0:04:28.228,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with anticipatory hints on the one and three,

97
0:04:31.035,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"answer" and "quarters,"

98
0:04:32.66,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as if the poem itself were coming together.

99
0:04:36.535,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It plays up the fact that we die

100
0:04:38.547,000 --> 0:04:4,000
by exaggerating the speed of our lives.

101
0:04:40.85,000 --> 0:04:42,000
A few years on Earth become

102
0:04:43.128,000 --> 0:04:45,000
one speech, one breath.

103
0:04:45.367,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's a poem about loneliness --

104
0:04:47.526,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the "I" in the poem feels no connection will last —

105
0:04:50.629,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and it might look like a plea for help

106
0:04:52.541,000 --> 0:04:54,000
'til you get to the word "help,"

107
0:04:55.051,000 --> 0:04:57,000
where this "I" facing you, taking your hand,

108
0:04:57.593,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is more like a teacher or a genie,

109
0:04:59.574,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or at least that's what he wants to believe.

110
0:05:02.298,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It would not be the first time a poet had

111
0:05:05.413,000 --> 0:05:09,000
written the poem that he wanted to hear.

112
0:05:10.275,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, this next poem really changed

113
0:05:13.018,000 --> 0:05:14,000
what I liked and what I read

114
0:05:15.014,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and what I felt I could read as an adult.

115
0:05:17.373,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It might not make any sense to you

116
0:05:19.012,000 --> 0:05:22,000
if you haven't seen it before.

117
0:05:22.942,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"The Garden"

118
0:05:25.15,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"Oleander: coral

119
0:05:27.541,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from lipstick ads in the 50's.

120
0:05:30.101,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Fruit of the tree of such knowledge

121
0:05:33.069,000 --> 0:05:34,000
To smack (thin air)

122
0:05:35.013,000 --> 0:05:37,000
meaning kiss or hit.

123
0:05:37.111,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It appears

124
0:05:38.23,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in the guise of outworn usages

125
0:05:40.249,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because we are bad?

126
0:05:43.12,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Big masculine threat,

127
0:05:44.957,000 --> 0:05:46,000
insinuating and slangy."

128
0:05:47.507,000 --> 0:05:49,000
[Rae Armantrout]

129
0:05:49.705,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now, I found this poem in an anthology

130
0:05:52.453,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of almost equally confusing poems in 1989.

131
0:05:55.275,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I just heard that there were these scandalous writers

132
0:05:57.293,000 --> 0:05:59,000
called Language poets who didn't make any sense,

133
0:05:59.92,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like,

134
0:06:02.188,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and some of them didn't do much for me,

135
0:06:03.878,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but this writer, Rae Armantrout,

136
0:06:05.43,000 --> 0:06:07,000
did an awful lot, and I kept reading her

137
0:06:08.037,000 --> 0:06:11,000
until I felt I knew what was going on,

138
0:06:11.228,000 --> 0:06:12,000
as I do with this poem.

139
0:06:12.493,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall

140
0:06:15.614,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and the Biblical story of the Fall,

141
0:06:19.17,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in which sex as we know it

142
0:06:21.322,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and death and guilt

143
0:06:22.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
come into the world at the same time.

144
0:06:24.609,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's also about how appearances deceive,

145
0:06:26.818,000 --> 0:06:28,000
how our culture can sweep us along

146
0:06:29.242,000 --> 0:06:31,000
into doing and saying things we didn't intend

147
0:06:31.61,000 --> 0:06:33,000
or don't like, and Armantrout's style

148
0:06:34.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is trying to help us stop or slow down.

149
0:06:37.518,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"Smack" can mean "kiss" as in air kisses,

150
0:06:41.952,000 --> 0:06:41,000
as in lip-smacking,

151
0:06:42.917,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but that can lead to "smack" as in "hit"

152
0:06:45.279,000 --> 0:06:47,000
as in domestic abuse,

153
0:06:47.394,000 --> 0:06:5,000
because sexual attraction can seem threatening.

154
0:06:51.202,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The red that means fertility

155
0:06:53.468,000 --> 0:06:54,000
can also mean poison.

156
0:06:55.17,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Oleander is poisonous.

157
0:06:56.263,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And outworn usages like "smack" for "kiss"

158
0:06:59.95,000 --> 0:07:01,000
or "hit" can help us see

159
0:07:02.607,000 --> 0:07:04,000
how our unacknowledged assumptions

160
0:07:04.925,000 --> 0:07:05,000
can make us believe we are bad,

161
0:07:06.92,000 --> 0:07:08,000
either because sex is sinful

162
0:07:08.962,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or because we tolerate so much sexism.

163
0:07:11.802,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We let guys tell women what to do.

164
0:07:14.898,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The poem reacts to old lipstick ads,

165
0:07:17.511,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and its edginess about statement,

166
0:07:19.572,000 --> 0:07:21,000
its reversals and halts, have everything to do

167
0:07:21.894,000 --> 0:07:23,000
with resisting the language of ads

168
0:07:24.115,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that want to tell us so easily what to want,

169
0:07:27.323,000 --> 0:07:28,000
what to do, what to think.

170
0:07:28.723,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem,

171
0:07:31.267,000 --> 0:07:33,000
which shows me, Armantrout shows me

172
0:07:33.435,000 --> 0:07:34,000
what it's like to hear grave threats

173
0:07:35.401,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and mortal dishonesty in the language

174
0:07:37.949,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of everyday life, and once she's done that,

175
0:07:40.516,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I think she can show other people, women and men,

176
0:07:44.976,000 --> 0:07:45,000
what it's like to feel that way

177
0:07:46.451,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and say to other people, women and men

178
0:07:49.157,000 --> 0:07:51,000
who feel so alienated or so threatened

179
0:07:52.07,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that they're not alone.

180
0:07:54.011,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now, how do I know that I'm right

181
0:07:57.479,000 --> 0:07:58,000
about this somewhat confusing poem?

182
0:07:59.457,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Well in this case, I emailed the poet a draft of my talk

183
0:08:02.198,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and she said, "Yeah, yeah, that's about it."

184
0:08:05.034,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Yeah. (Laughter) (Applause)

185
0:08:08.949,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But usually, you can't know. You never know.

186
0:08:11.875,000 --> 0:08:13,000
You can't be sure, and that's okay.

187
0:08:14.429,000 --> 0:08:15,000
All we can do we is listen to poems

188
0:08:16.03,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and look at poems and guess

189
0:08:17.689,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and see if they can bring us what we need,

190
0:08:20.171,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and if you're wrong about some part of a poem,

191
0:08:23.14,000 --> 0:08:26,000
nothing bad will happen.

192
0:08:27.071,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now, this next poem is older than Armantrout's,

193
0:08:29.854,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but a little younger than A. E. Housman's.

194
0:08:33.618,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"The Brave Man"

195
0:08:35.486,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"The sun, that brave man,

196
0:08:38.17,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Comes through boughs that lie in wait,

197
0:08:40.89,000 --> 0:08:42,000
That brave man.

198
0:08:43.315,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Green and gloomy eyes

199
0:08:44.9,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In dark forms of the grass

200
0:08:46.728,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Run away.

201
0:08:48.245,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The good stars,

202
0:08:49.97,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Pale helms and spiky spurs,

203
0:08:52.657,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Run away.

204
0:08:54.047,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Fears of my bed,

205
0:08:55.402,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Fears of life and fears of death,

206
0:08:57.88,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Run away.

207
0:08:59.36,000 --> 0:09:01,000
That brave man comes up

208
0:09:01.656,000 --> 0:09:03,000
From below and walks without meditation,

209
0:09:04.576,000 --> 0:09:05,000
That brave man."

210
0:09:06.353,000 --> 0:09:08,000
[Wallace Stevens]

211
0:09:09.343,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now, the sun in this poem,

212
0:09:11.696,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in Wallace Stevens' poem, seems so grave

213
0:09:14.185,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because the person in the poem is so afraid.

214
0:09:17.656,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The sun comes up in the morning through branches,

215
0:09:20.143,000 --> 0:09:22,000
dispels the dew, the eyes, on the grass,

216
0:09:23.082,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and defeats stars envisioned as armies.

217
0:09:26.487,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"Brave" has its old sense of showy

218
0:09:28.456,000 --> 0:09:3,000
as well as its modern sense, courage.

219
0:09:30.7,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This sun is not afraid to show his face.

220
0:09:34.04,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But the person in the poem is afraid.

221
0:09:37.392,000 --> 0:09:38,000
He might have been up all night.

222
0:09:38.931,000 --> 0:09:41,000
That is the reveal Stevens saves for that fourth stanza,

223
0:09:42.913,000 --> 0:09:44,000
where run away has become a refrain.

224
0:09:45.691,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This person might want to run away too,

225
0:09:47.883,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but fortified by the sun's example,

226
0:09:50.173,000 --> 0:09:52,000
he might just rise.

227
0:09:52.898,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Stevens saves that sonically odd word "meditation"

228
0:09:57.176,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for the end.

229
0:09:58.85,000 --> 0:10:,000
Unlike the sun, human beings think.

230
0:10:01.751,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We meditate on past and future, life and death,

231
0:10:05.848,000 --> 0:10:07,000
above and below.

232
0:10:08.394,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And it can make us afraid.

233
0:10:12.178,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Poems, the patterns in poems,

234
0:10:14.248,000 --> 0:10:15,000
show us not just what somebody thought

235
0:10:16.19,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or what someone did or what happened

236
0:10:17.862,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but what it was like to be a person like that,

237
0:10:22.658,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive,

238
0:10:26.348,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so goofy, so preposterous, so brave.

239
0:10:32.234,000 --> 0:10:35,000
That's why poems can seem at once so durable,

240
0:10:35.88,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so personal, and so ephemeral,

241
0:10:37.921,000 --> 0:10:4,000
like something inside and outside you at once.

242
0:10:41.048,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry

243
0:10:44.383,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to a needle, a sliver of outside I cradle inside,

244
0:10:48.501,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and the American poet Terrance Hayes

245
0:10:50.909,000 --> 0:10:53,000
wrote six poems called "Wind in a Box."

246
0:10:53.992,000 --> 0:10:54,000
One of them asks, "Tell me,

247
0:10:55.428,000 --> 0:10:57,000
what am I going to do when I'm dead?"

248
0:10:58.062,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the answer is that he'll stay with us

249
0:11:00.792,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or won't stay with us inside us as wind,

250
0:11:03.668,000 --> 0:11:06,000
as air, as words.

251
0:11:06.89,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It is easier than ever to find poems

252
0:11:09.548,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that might stay inside you, that might stay with you,

253
0:11:13.14,000 --> 0:11:15,000
from long, long ago, or from right this minute,

254
0:11:15.598,000 --> 0:11:17,000
from far away or from right close to where you live,

255
0:11:18.172,000 --> 0:11:21,000
almost no matter where you live.

256
0:11:21.498,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Poems can help you say, help you show how you're feeling,

257
0:11:24.967,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but they can also introduce you

258
0:11:27.407,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to feelings, ways of being in the world,

259
0:11:29.69,000 --> 0:11:31,000
people, very much unlike you,

260
0:11:32.067,000 --> 0:11:36,000
maybe even people from long, long ago.

261
0:11:36.648,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Some poems even tell you

262
0:11:38.735,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that that is what they can do.

263
0:11:43.286,000 --> 0:11:45,000
That's what John Keats is doing

264
0:11:45.956,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.

265
0:11:50.324,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished,

266
0:11:54.236,000 --> 0:11:56,000
he probably left it unfinished,

267
0:11:56.565,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and because it might be meant

268
0:11:58.162,000 --> 0:12:,000
for a character in a play,

269
0:12:00.788,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but it might just be Keats' thinking

270
0:12:02.465,000 --> 0:12:03,000
about what his own writing,

271
0:12:04.1,000 --> 0:12:06,000
his handwriting, could do,

272
0:12:06.3,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality,

273
0:12:10.19,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and I hear the power of older poetic techniques,

274
0:12:13.719,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and I have the feeling, you might have the feeling,

275
0:12:16.25,000 --> 0:12:18,000
of meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,

276
0:12:19.236,000 --> 0:12:2,000
someone else from long ago,

277
0:12:20.758,000 --> 0:12:22,000
someone quite memorable.

278
0:12:23.473,000 --> 0:12:26,000
"This living hand, now warm and capable

279
0:12:26.649,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold

280
0:12:30.359,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And in the icy silence of the tomb,

281
0:12:32.75,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights

282
0:12:36.326,000 --> 0:12:39,000
That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood

283
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So in my veins red life might stream again,

284
0:12:43.911,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And thou be conscience-calm’d -- see here it is --

285
0:12:48.81,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I hold it towards you."

286
0:12:53.11,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Thanks.

287
0:12:55.417,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.917,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Last summer, I was hiking through the Austrian mountains.

2
0:00:17.875,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And there, on top, I saw this beautiful, stone, remote hut,

3
0:00:22.583,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it had solar panels on it.

4
0:00:24.792,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And every time I see solar panels, I get very enthusiastic.

5
0:00:28.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's this technology that takes sunlight, which is free and available,

6
0:00:32.625,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and turns that into electricity.

7
0:00:35.333,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So this hut, in the middle of nowhere, on a beautiful location,

8
0:00:39.667,000 --> 0:00:4,000
was self-sufficient.

9
0:00:42.208,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But why do solar panels always have to be so ugly?

10
0:00:45.5,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:47.708,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My name is Marjan Van Aubel and I'm a solar designer.

12
0:00:50.708,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I work in the triangle of design, sustainability and technology.

13
0:00:55.375,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I strive for extreme efficiency,

14
0:00:58.75,000 --> 0:01:01,000
meaning that I develop materials that expand in size

15
0:01:01.833,000 --> 0:01:04,000
or work with solar cells that use the properties of colors

16
0:01:05.708,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to generate electricity.

17
0:01:08.167,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My work is in museums all over the world, such as MoMA.

18
0:01:11.375,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And, I mean, it all went quite well,

19
0:01:14.875,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but it always felt that something was missing.

20
0:01:18.583,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And it was, until I read the book called the "Solar Revolution,"

21
0:01:22.875,000 --> 0:01:26,000
where it says that within one hour we receive enough sunlight

22
0:01:27.417,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to provide the world with enough electricity

23
0:01:29.708,000 --> 0:01:3,000
for an entire year.

24
0:01:32.167,000 --> 0:01:33,000
One hour.

25
0:01:34.083,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And since then, I realized I just want to focus on solar.

26
0:01:38.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Scientists all over the world

27
0:01:39.875,000 --> 0:01:43,000
have been focusing on making solar panels more efficient and cheaper.

28
0:01:44.625,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So the price of solar has dropped enormously.

29
0:01:47.5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And this is because China started producing them on a large scale.

30
0:01:53.667,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And also their efficiency has increased a lot.

31
0:01:56.042,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They now even have an efficiency of 44.5 percent.

32
0:02:01.292,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But if you think about the image of solar cells,

33
0:02:04.583,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it's kind of stayed the same for the last 60 years.

34
0:02:09.333,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's still this technology just stacked onto something.

35
0:02:13.708,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And solar cells need to be much better integrated into our environment.

36
0:02:19.292,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Climate change is the biggest problem of our time.

37
0:02:22.792,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And we can't rely on the others -- the government, the engineers --

38
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to make positive changes.

39
0:02:27.375,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We all can contribute towards change.

40
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Like I said, I'm a designer

41
0:02:32.542,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I would like to change things through design.

42
0:02:36.458,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Let me give you some examples of my work.

43
0:02:39.208,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I'm collaborating with Swarovski, the crystal company.

44
0:02:42.667,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And if you cut crystals in a certain way,

45
0:02:45.042,000 --> 0:02:49,000
you are able to bend and direct the light onto a certain place.

46
0:02:49.292,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So I use these crystals to focus the light onto a solar panel,

47
0:02:53.292,000 --> 0:02:55,000
making them more efficient, but using aesthetics.

48
0:02:57.125,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So you take the solar crystal with you in the light,

49
0:02:59.625,000 --> 0:03:01,000
there's a battery in the solar cell,

50
0:03:01.75,000 --> 0:03:02,000
you put it in a docking station

51
0:03:03.5,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and you are able to power these chandeliers.

52
0:03:05.917,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So you're literally bringing the light indoors.

53
0:03:10.5,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I got completely hooked on solar when I came across this technology

54
0:03:14.042,000 --> 0:03:17,000
called dye-sensitized solar cells,

55
0:03:17.292,000 --> 0:03:18,000
colored solar cells,

56
0:03:18.583,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and they are based on photosynthesis in plants.

57
0:03:22.667,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Where the green chlorophyl converts light into sugar for plants,

58
0:03:26.083,000 --> 0:03:28,000
these cells convert light into electricity.

59
0:03:31.042,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The best thing is, they even work indoors.

60
0:03:34.792,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So different colors have different efficiency,

61
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
depending on their place on the color spectrum.

62
0:03:39.215,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So, for example, red is more efficient than blue.

63
0:03:44.708,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So if I hear this as a designer:

64
0:03:46.708,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a colored surface, a glass colored surface,

65
0:03:49.75,000 --> 0:03:51,000
color that's mostly just used for esthetics,

66
0:03:52.458,000 --> 0:03:56,000
now gets an extra function and is able to harvest electricity,

67
0:03:56.875,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I think, where can we apply this, then?

68
0:04:00.083,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This is Current Table,

69
0:04:01.875,000 --> 0:04:04,000
where the whole tabletop consists of these colored solar cells.

70
0:04:06.667,000 --> 0:04:07,000
There are batteries in the legs

71
0:04:08.375,000 --> 0:04:1,000
where you can charge your phone through USB ports.

72
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And in my work, it's always very important,

73
0:04:15.083,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the balance between efficiency and aesthetics.

74
0:04:17.417,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So that's why the table is orange,

75
0:04:19.061,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because it is a very stable color for indoors.

76
0:04:24.042,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And this is always the most asked question I get:

77
0:04:26.417,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"OK, great, but how many phones can I charge from this, then?"

78
0:04:30.5,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And before I go to this complicated answer of like,

79
0:04:32.958,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"Well, where is the table, does it have enough light,

80
0:04:35.5,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is it next to a window?"

81
0:04:37.083,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The table now has sensors that read the light intensity of the room.

82
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So through an app we developed

83
0:04:42.958,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you can literally follow how much light it's getting,

84
0:04:45.5,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and how full the battery is.

85
0:04:48.75,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'm actually proud, because yesterday we installed a table

86
0:04:52.25,000 --> 0:04:54,000
at Stichting Doen's offices in Amsterdam

87
0:04:54.958,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and, right at this moment,

88
0:04:56.25,000 --> 0:04:59,000
our Queen Maxima is charging a phone from this table.

89
0:05:00.042,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It's cool.

90
0:05:01.375,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

91
0:05:06.292,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So the more surface you have, the more energy you can harvest.

92
0:05:10.5,000 --> 0:05:11,000
These are Current Windows,

93
0:05:12.125,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where we replaced all windows in a gallery in London, in Soho,

94
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
with this modern version of stained glass.

95
0:05:20.125,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So people from the street could come and charge their phones

96
0:05:23.125,000 --> 0:05:24,000
through the window ledges.

97
0:05:25.833,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So I'm giving extra functions to objects.

98
0:05:28.083,000 --> 0:05:3,000
A window doesn't have to be just a window anymore.

99
0:05:30.625,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It can also function as a little power station.

100
0:05:35.583,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So, here I am, talking about how much I love solar,

101
0:05:40.333,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but I don't have solar panels on my roof.

102
0:05:43.292,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I live in the center of Amsterdam,

103
0:05:45.042,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I don't own the house and it's a monument,

104
0:05:47.083,000 --> 0:05:49,000
so it's not possible and not allowed.

105
0:05:50.542,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So how can you make solar cells more accessible and for everyone,

106
0:05:54.708,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and not only for the people that can afford a sustainable lifestyle?

107
0:05:59.708,000 --> 0:06:,000
We now have the opportunity

108
0:06:01.208,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to integrate solar on the place where we directly need it.

109
0:06:04.5,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And there are so many amazing technologies out there.

110
0:06:07.958,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If I look around now, I see every surface as an opportunity.

111
0:06:13.167,000 --> 0:06:15,000
For example, I was driving in the train through the Westland,

112
0:06:16.125,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the area in the Netherlands with all the greenhouses.

113
0:06:19.458,000 --> 0:06:21,000
There I saw all this glass and thought,

114
0:06:22.042,000 --> 0:06:25,000
what if we integrate those with transparent solar glass?

115
0:06:25.75,000 --> 0:06:27,000
What if we integrate traditional farming

116
0:06:28.583,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that requires a lot of energy

117
0:06:31.333,000 --> 0:06:34,000
together with high-tech and combine those?

118
0:06:35.333,000 --> 0:06:37,000
With this idea in mind, I created Power Plant.

119
0:06:40.542,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I had a team of architects and engineers,

120
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but let me first explain how it works.

121
0:06:47.333,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We use transparent solar glass

122
0:06:49.833,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to power its indoor climate.

123
0:06:52.167,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We use hydroponics that pumps around nutrified water,

124
0:06:55.167,000 --> 0:06:57,000
saving 90 percent of water usage.

125
0:06:58.75,000 --> 0:07:01,000
By stacking up in layers, you are able to grow more yield per square meter.

126
0:07:03.375,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Extra light, besides sunlight, coming from these colored LED lights

127
0:07:07.833,000 --> 0:07:08,000
also enhances plant growth.

128
0:07:11.542,000 --> 0:07:13,000
As more and more people will live in big cities,

129
0:07:14.208,000 --> 0:07:16,000
by placing Power Plants on the rooftops

130
0:07:16.792,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you don't have to fly it in from the other side of the world,

131
0:07:19.708,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you are able to grow it on the location itself.

132
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Well, the big dream is to build these in off-grid places --

133
0:07:25.958,000 --> 0:07:27,000
where there's no access to water, electricity --

134
0:07:28.625,000 --> 0:07:29,000
as an independent ecosystem.

135
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
For this year's Design Biennial,

136
0:07:35.083,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I created the first four-meter high model of the power plant,

137
0:07:39.167,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so you could come in and experience how plants grow.

138
0:07:43.75,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So it's a double harvest of sunlight,

139
0:07:46.042,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so both for the solar cells and for the plants.

140
0:07:51.083,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's like a future botanical garden,

141
0:07:54.667,000 --> 0:07:57,000
where we celebrate all these modern technologies.

142
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And the biggest compliment I got was, "But where are the solar panels?"

143
0:08:03.5,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And that's when I think design really works,

144
0:08:05.625,000 --> 0:08:07,000
when it becomes invisible and you don't notice it.

145
0:08:10.333,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I believe in solar democracy:

146
0:08:12.417,000 --> 0:08:15,000
solar energy for everyone, everywhere.

147
0:08:16.083,000 --> 0:08:19,000
My aim is to make all surfaces productive.

148
0:08:19.417,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I want to build houses where all the windows, curtains, walls,

149
0:08:23.125,000 --> 0:08:26,000
even floors are harvesting electricity.

150
0:08:26.167,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Think about this on a big scale:

151
0:08:27.75,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in cities, there are so many surfaces.

152
0:08:32.792,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The sun is still available for everyone.

153
0:08:35.708,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And by integrating solar on the place where we need it,

154
0:08:38.333,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we now have the opportunity to make solar cells accessible for everyone.

155
0:08:43.958,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I want to bring solar close to the people with you,

156
0:08:47.707,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but beautiful and well designed.

157
0:08:51.25,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Thank you.

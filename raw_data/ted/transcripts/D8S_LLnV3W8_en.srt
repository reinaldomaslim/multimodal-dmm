1
0:00:12.78,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today, more than half of the world's population lives in cities.

2
0:00:17.82,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The urbanization process started in the late 1700s

3
0:00:21.7,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and has been increasing since then.

4
0:00:24.02,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The prediction is that by 2050,

5
0:00:27.1,000 --> 0:00:3,000
66 percent of the population will live in cities

6
0:00:30.14,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and the United Nations, the World Health Organization,

7
0:00:33.7,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the World Economic Forum, are warning us,

8
0:00:37.18,000 --> 0:00:39,000
if we don't plan for the increased density,

9
0:00:39.9,000 --> 0:00:44,000
current problems in our cities, like inequality, congestion, crime

10
0:00:45.02,000 --> 0:00:46,000
can only get worse.

11
0:00:46.42,000 --> 0:00:48,000
As a result, urban planners and city developers

12
0:00:49.06,000 --> 0:00:52,000
are putting a lot of effort and creativity

13
0:00:52.62,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in designing our future, denser, bigger cities.

14
0:00:57.54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I have a different opinion.

15
0:00:59.42,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I think urbanization is actually reaching the end of its cycle,

16
0:01:03.46,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and now people are going to start moving back to the countryside.

17
0:01:07.62,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And you may think, "But what about the trend?"

18
0:01:10.66,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Well, let me tell you,

19
0:01:12.66,000 --> 0:01:14,000
socioeconomic trends don't last forever.

20
0:01:16.059,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You know, 12,000 years ago

21
0:01:17.78,000 --> 0:01:2,000
everybody was perfectly happy

22
0:01:20.82,000 --> 0:01:23,000
roaming the land, hunting and gathering.

23
0:01:23.86,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And then, the trend changes,

24
0:01:26.54,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the new thing is to live in a farm and have cattle,

25
0:01:30.02,000 --> 0:01:31,000
until it changes again.

26
0:01:31.86,000 --> 0:01:33,000
When we get to the industrial revolution.

27
0:01:35.34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Actually, that is what started the urbanization process.

28
0:01:38.94,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And you know what triggered it?

29
0:01:41.34,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Steam power, machines,

30
0:01:44.62,000 --> 0:01:45,000
new chemical processes --

31
0:01:46.46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in two words, technological innovation.

32
0:01:51.18,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I believe technology can also bring the end of this cycle.

33
0:01:55.34,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I've been working on innovation for most of my career.

34
0:01:58.3,000 --> 0:02:,000
I love it. I love my job.

35
0:02:00.46,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It allows me to work with drones, with 3D printers and smart glasses,

36
0:02:04.58,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and not just those you can buy in the shop but also prototypes.

37
0:02:08.66,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's a lot of fun sometimes.

38
0:02:11.82,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now, some of these technologies

39
0:02:13.7,000 --> 0:02:16,000
are opening new possibilities that will radically change

40
0:02:16.82,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the way we did things before

41
0:02:18.62,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and in a few years,

42
0:02:20.62,000 --> 0:02:23,000
they may allow us to enjoy the benefits of city life

43
0:02:24.54,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from anywhere.

44
0:02:26.22,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Think about it.

45
0:02:27.46,000 --> 0:02:3,000
If you could live in a place with a lower crime rate

46
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and more space

47
0:02:32.62,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and a lower cost of living

48
0:02:34.38,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and less traffic,

49
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of course many people would want that,

50
0:02:38.78,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but they feel they don't have a choice.

51
0:02:41.5,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You have to live in the city.

52
0:02:44.94,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Well, in the past, people moved to the cities

53
0:02:47.62,000 --> 0:02:49,000
not because they loved the city itself

54
0:02:50.22,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but for the things you could have in a city,

55
0:02:52.9,000 --> 0:02:53,000
more job opportunities,

56
0:02:54.74,000 --> 0:02:56,000
easier access to services and goods

57
0:02:56.82,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and a rich social life.

58
0:02:58.86,000 --> 0:03:,000
So let's dive deeper.

59
0:03:01.62,000 --> 0:03:03,000
More jobs and career opportunities.

60
0:03:04.94,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Is that still true today,

61
0:03:06.3,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because the office people are starting to realize

62
0:03:09.5,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that working in the office and being in the office

63
0:03:13.5,000 --> 0:03:14,000
may not be the same thing anymore.

64
0:03:16.1,000 --> 0:03:19,000
According to a study by Global Workplace Analytics,

65
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
more than 80 percent of the US workforce would like to work from home.

66
0:03:24.5,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And do you know how much it costs for a company to even have an office?

67
0:03:29.06,000 --> 0:03:32,000
11,000 dollars per employee per year.

68
0:03:33.62,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If only half of those workers

69
0:03:36.42,000 --> 0:03:38,000
would telework even 50 percent of the time,

70
0:03:39.86,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the savings in the states would exceed 500 billion dollars,

71
0:03:44.7,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and it could reduce greenhouse gases by 54 million tons.

72
0:03:49.5,000 --> 0:03:5,000
That is the equivalent

73
0:03:50.78,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of 10 million cars off the streets for a whole year.

74
0:03:56.14,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But even though most people would want to telework,

75
0:03:59.42,000 --> 0:04:02,000
current technology makes the experience isolating.

76
0:04:02.98,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's not comfortable.

77
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It doesn't feel like being there.

78
0:04:06.62,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But that is going to change

79
0:04:09.22,000 --> 0:04:11,000
by the convergence of two technologies:

80
0:04:11.54,000 --> 0:04:14,000
augmented reality and telepresence robots.

81
0:04:15.42,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Augmented reality already today

82
0:04:17.42,000 --> 0:04:2,000
allows you to take your office environment everywhere with you.

83
0:04:20.98,000 --> 0:04:23,000
All you need is a wearable computer, a pair of smart glasses,

84
0:04:24.5,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and you can take your emails and your spreadsheets

85
0:04:26.9,000 --> 0:04:27,000
with you wherever you go.

86
0:04:29.06,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And video conferences and video calls have become very common these days,

87
0:04:33.7,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but they still need improvement.

88
0:04:36.14,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I mean, all those little faces on a flat screen,

89
0:04:39.9,000 --> 0:04:41,000
sometimes you don't even know who is talking.

90
0:04:42.42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now, we already have something way better than static videocalls:

91
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
your average telepresence robot.

92
0:04:49.94,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I call it tablet on a stick.

93
0:04:52.926,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:54.1,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You can control, you can move around,

95
0:04:56.86,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you can control what you're looking at.

96
0:04:59.06,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's way better, but far from perfect.

97
0:05:02.98,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You know how they say

98
0:05:04.22,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that most human communication is nonverbal?

99
0:05:07.82,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, the robot doesn't give you any of that.

100
0:05:10.58,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It looks like an alien.

101
0:05:14.02,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But with advances in augmented reality,

102
0:05:16.86,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it will be easy to wrap the robot in a nice hologram

103
0:05:20.34,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that actually looks and moves like a person.

104
0:05:24.34,000 --> 0:05:25,000
That will do it.

105
0:05:26.18,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Or else, forget the robot.

106
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We go full VR,

107
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and everybody meets in cyberspace.

108
0:05:33.22,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Give it a couple of years and that will feel so real,

109
0:05:36.74,000 --> 0:05:37,000
you won't tell the difference.

110
0:05:39.1,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So what was the next reason why people move to cities?

111
0:05:42.9,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Access to services and goods.

112
0:05:45.66,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But today you can do all that online.

113
0:05:48.9,000 --> 0:05:5,000
According to a study made by comScore,

114
0:05:52.22,000 --> 0:05:54,000
online shoppers in the US last year

115
0:05:54.62,000 --> 0:05:57,000
did more than half of their retail purchases online,

116
0:05:59.02,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and the global market for e-commerce

117
0:06:02.38,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is estimated to be at two trillion dollars.

118
0:06:06.38,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And it's expected to reach 2.38 by the end of 2017,

119
0:06:11.62,000 --> 0:06:12,000
according to eMarketer.

120
0:06:14.42,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, from a logistics standpoint,

121
0:06:17.06,000 --> 0:06:18,000
density is good for deliveries.

122
0:06:20.34,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Supplying goods to a shopping mall is easy.

123
0:06:23.66,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You can send big shipments to the shop,

124
0:06:26.34,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and people will go there, pick it up and take it home themselves.

125
0:06:29.5,000 --> 0:06:31,000
E-commerce means we need to ship onesies

126
0:06:32.18,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and have them home delivered.

127
0:06:33.98,000 --> 0:06:34,000
That's more expensive.

128
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's like the difference between having a birthday party for 20 people

129
0:06:38.98,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or bringing a piece of the cake

130
0:06:41.1,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to each of your 20 friends at their place.

131
0:06:45.06,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But at least in the city,

132
0:06:47.22,000 --> 0:06:48,000
they live close to each other.

133
0:06:48.7,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Density helps.

134
0:06:50.74,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, e-commerce deliveries in the countryside,

135
0:06:54.98,000 --> 0:06:55,000
those take forever.

136
0:06:57.5,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The truck sometimes needs to drive miles between one address and the next one.

137
0:07:01.98,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Those are the most expensive deliveries of all.

138
0:07:06.86,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But we already have a solution for that:

139
0:07:09.46,000 --> 0:07:1,000
drones.

140
0:07:10.9,000 --> 0:07:13,000
A vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.

141
0:07:14.3,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The driver does some of the deliveries

142
0:07:16.18,000 --> 0:07:19,000
while the drones are flying back and forth from the truck as it moves.

143
0:07:19.54,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That way, the average cost for delivery is reduced,

144
0:07:22.1,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and voila:

145
0:07:24.62,000 --> 0:07:27,000
affordable e-commerce services in the countryside.

146
0:07:28.66,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You will see:

147
0:07:30.02,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the new homes of our teleworkers

148
0:07:31.78,000 --> 0:07:33,000
will probably have a drone pod in the yard.

149
0:07:35.46,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So once the final mile delivery is not a problem,

150
0:07:38.06,000 --> 0:07:4,000
you don't need to be in the city to buy things anymore.

151
0:07:41.9,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So that's two.

152
0:07:43.14,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now, what was the third reason why people move to cities?

153
0:07:46.38,000 --> 0:07:47,000
A rich social life.

154
0:07:48.62,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They would need to be in the city for that these days.

155
0:07:51.18,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Because people these days,

156
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
they make friends, they chat, gossip and flirt

157
0:07:56.66,000 --> 0:07:57,000
from the comfort of their sofa.

158
0:07:58.5,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:59.86,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And while wearing their favorite pajamas.

160
0:08:02.3,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:03.62,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There are over two billion active social media users in the world.

162
0:08:08.38,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In a way, that makes you think like we are connected

163
0:08:11.7,000 --> 0:08:12,000
no matter where we are.

164
0:08:12.94,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But OK, not completely.

165
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Sometimes you still need some real human contact.

166
0:08:19.7,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Ironically, the city, with its population density,

167
0:08:23.62,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is not always the best for that.

168
0:08:26.58,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Actually, as social groups become smaller,

169
0:08:29.62,000 --> 0:08:3,000
they grow stronger.

170
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
A recent study made in the UK

171
0:08:33.5,000 --> 0:08:35,000
by the Office for National Statistics

172
0:08:35.66,000 --> 0:08:37,000
showed a higher life satisfaction rating

173
0:08:38.54,000 --> 0:08:39,000
among people living in rural areas.

174
0:08:41.86,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So as people settle in the countryside,

175
0:08:45.14,000 --> 0:08:47,000
well, they will buy local groceries,

176
0:08:48.14,000 --> 0:08:49,000
fresh groceries, foodstuff,

177
0:08:49.979,000 --> 0:08:5,000
maintenance services.

178
0:08:52.1,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So handymen, small workshops, service companies will thrive.

179
0:08:57.82,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Maybe some of the industrial workers from the cities

180
0:09:00.3,000 --> 0:09:01,000
displaced by the automation

181
0:09:02.58,000 --> 0:09:04,000
will find a nice alternative job here,

182
0:09:04.94,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and they will move too.

183
0:09:07.7,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And as people move to the countryside,

184
0:09:09.58,000 --> 0:09:1,000
how is that going to be?

185
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Think about autonomous,

186
0:09:14.06,000 --> 0:09:16,000
off-the-grid houses with solar panels,

187
0:09:16.14,000 --> 0:09:19,000
with wind turbines and waste recycling utilities,

188
0:09:20.7,000 --> 0:09:25,000
our new homes producing their own energy and using it to also power the family car.

189
0:09:25.94,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I mean, cities have always been regarded as being more energy-efficient,

190
0:09:30.06,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but let me tell you,

191
0:09:31.34,000 --> 0:09:33,000
repopulating the countryside can be eco too.

192
0:09:36.5,000 --> 0:09:39,000
By now, you're probably thinking of all the advantages of country living.

193
0:09:40.86,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:43.1,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I did it myself.

195
0:09:44.38,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Six years ago, my wife and I, we packed our stuff,

196
0:09:47.94,000 --> 0:09:48,000
we sold our little apartment in Spain,

197
0:09:49.9,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and for the same money we bought a house with a garden

198
0:09:55.02,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and little birds that come singing in the morning.

199
0:09:57.62,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:59.1,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's so nice there.

201
0:10:01.7,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And we live in a small village, not really the countryside yet.

202
0:10:04.7,000 --> 0:10:06,000
That is going to be my next move:

203
0:10:06.9,000 --> 0:10:08,000
a refurbished farmhouse,

204
0:10:09.14,000 --> 0:10:11,000
not too far from a city, not too close.

205
0:10:12.02,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And now we'll make sure to have a good spot for drones to land.

206
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:16.46,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But hey, that's me.

208
0:10:18.22,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It doesn't have to be you,

209
0:10:19.5,000 --> 0:10:21,000
because it would seem like I'm trying to convince somebody

210
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to come join us in the country.

211
0:10:23.78,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I'm not.

212
0:10:25.02,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:26.42,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I don't need more people to come.

214
0:10:28.1,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:29.94,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I just think they will

216
0:10:31.74,000 --> 0:10:34,000
once they realize they can have the same benefits the city has.

217
0:10:35.896,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But if you don't like the country,

218
0:10:37.54,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I have good news for you, too.

219
0:10:39.7,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Cities will not disappear.

220
0:10:42.46,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But as people move out,

221
0:10:43.74,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a lower density will help them recover a better flow and balance.

222
0:10:49.1,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Anyway, I guess now you have some thinking to do.

223
0:10:53.78,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Do you still think you need to live in the city?

224
0:10:56.1,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And more importantly,

225
0:10:58.34,000 --> 0:10:59,000
do you want to?

226
0:11:00.62,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Thank you very much.

227
0:11:01.86,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Applause)

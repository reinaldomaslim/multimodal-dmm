1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So, here we go: a flyby of play.

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's got to be serious if the New York Times

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.

4
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
At the bottom of this, it says, "It's deeper than gender.

5
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Seriously, but dangerously fun.

6
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."

7
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?

8
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You see any adults?

9
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Well, lets go back to the 15th century.

10
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is a courtyard in Europe,

11
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play.

12
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
All ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.

13
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture

14
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of what it was like in a courtyard then.

15
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I think we may have lost something in our culture.

16
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So I'm gonna take you through

17
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
what I think is a remarkable sequence.

18
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
North of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,

19
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
there's no ice on Hudson Bay.

20
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,

21
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
he's wild and fairly hungry.

22
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,

23
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.

24
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,

25
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
with a predatory gaze.

26
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,

27
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze

28
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that you know you're in trouble.

29
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But on the other side of that predatory gaze

30
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.

31
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And something very unusual happens.

32
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped

33
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and ends up with a meal -- changes.

34
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this polar bear

35
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
stands over the husky,

36
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.

37
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And they begin an incredible ballet.

38
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
A play ballet.

39
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature

40
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.

41
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,

42
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.

43
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They're in a state of play.

44
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And it's that state

45
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that allows these two creatures to explore the possible.

46
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done

47
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
without the play signals.

48
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And it is a marvelous example

49
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of how a differential in power

50
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us.

51
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now how did I get involved in this?

52
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.

53
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes,

54
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder,

55
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to the importance of play,

56
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in that that individual, by deep study,

57
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
was found to have severe play deprivation.

58
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Charles Whitman was his name.

59
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists,

60
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
did feel at the end of that study

61
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play

62
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated.

63
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And that finding has stood the test of time --

64
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
unfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech.

65
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And other studies of populations at risk

66
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
sensitized me to the importance of play,

67
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but I didn't really understand what it was.

68
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals

69
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.

70
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.

71
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But there are ways of looking at it

72
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that I think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.

73
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And this image is, for humans, the beginning point of play.

74
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
When that mother and infant lock eyes,

75
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and the infant's old enough to have a social smile,

76
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.

77
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby.

78
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram,

79
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the right brain of each of them becomes attuned,

80
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes

81
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.

82
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play

83
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
builds on this base for us humans.

84
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,

85
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but it's never just singularly one thing.

86
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We're going to look at body play,

87
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.

88
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This is a mountain goat.

89
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
If you're having a bad day, try this:

90
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
jump up and down, wiggle around -- you're going to feel better.

91
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And you may feel like this character,

92
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
who is also just doing it for its own sake.

93
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It doesn't have a particular purpose, and that's what's great about play.

94
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
If its purpose is more important

95
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
than the act of doing it, it's probably not play.

96
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And there's a whole other type of play, which is object play.

97
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,

98
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and he or she's going to roll down a hill.

99
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And -- they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful.

100
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The human hand, in manipulation of objects,

101
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is the hand in search of a brain;

102
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the brain is in search of a hand;

103
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.

104
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
JPL we heard this morning -- JPL is an incredible place.

105
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
They have located two consultants,

106
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson,

107
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.

108
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,

109
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.

110
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,

111
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,

112
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
hadn't worked with their hands.

113
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Frank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand."

114
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They got together -- JPL hired them.

115
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Now JPL, NASA and Boeing,

116
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
before they will hire a research and development problem solver --

117
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech --

118
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,

119
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.

120
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So play is practical, and it's very important.

121
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration. (Laughter)

122
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But it has to be safe exploration.

123
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy

124
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good.

125
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene.

126
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
If you want to belong, you need social play.

127
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And social play is part of what we're about here today,

128
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and is a byproduct of the play scene.

129
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Rough and tumble play.

130
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
These lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.

131
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky:

132
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
no claws, flat fur, soft eyes,

133
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,

134
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
curvilinear movements -- all specific to play.

135
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.

136
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Preschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,

137
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
scream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation

138
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive, emotional and physical --

139
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that come as a part of rough and tumble play.

140
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Spectator play, ritual play -- we're involved in some of that.

141
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare --

142
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
where the Red Sox won the World Series.

143
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody

144
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.

145
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Imaginative play.

146
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,

147
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,

148
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.

149
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
A really important part of being a player

150
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is imaginative solo play.

151
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I love this one, because it's also what we're about.

152
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.

153
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story.

154
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I'm telling you a story today about play.

155
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long,

156
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but it's a fundamental part of the play scene.

157
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So what does play do for the brain?

158
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Well, a lot.

159
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain,

160
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play.

161
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.

162
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician

163
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
for the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record,

164
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play,

165
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious.

166
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past,

167
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and the play wave is cresting,

168
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because there is some good science.

169
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Nothing lights up the brain like play.

170
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum,

171
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe --

172
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed,

173
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and -- and, and, and.

174
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So it's -- for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure

175
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people

176
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.

177
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.

178
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And this is one of the ways you can study play --

179
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.

180
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,

181
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
which has limited the actual study of play.

182
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And we've got a mother-infant play scenario

183
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.

184
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The reason I put this here is also to queue up

185
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
my thoughts about objectifying what play does.

186
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The animal world has objectified it.

187
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
In the animal world, if you take rats,

188
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years

189
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle,

190
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they pin each other, that's part of their play.

191
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,

192
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,

193
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and then you present those rats

194
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
with a cat odor-saturated collar,

195
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
they're hardwired to flee and hide.

196
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat.

197
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So what happens?

198
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
They both hide out.

199
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The non-players never come out --

200
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
they die.

201
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The players slowly explore the environment,

202
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and begin again to test things out.

203
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
That says to me, at least in rats --

204
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do

205
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and a similar cortical architecture --

206
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that play may be pretty important for our survival.

207
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And, and, and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about.

208
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now, this is a consequence of play deprivation. (Laughter)

209
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
This took a long time --

210
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT

211
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.

212
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And we do know that in domestic animals

213
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and others, when they're play deprived,

214
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal.

215
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Now, the program says that the opposite of play is not work,

216
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
it's depression.

217
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I think if you think about life without play --

218
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
no humor, no flirtation, no movies,

219
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
no games, no fantasy and, and, and.

220
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Try and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise

221
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
without play.

222
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And the thing that's so unique about our species

223
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.

224
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And we all have capacity to play signal.

225
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.

226
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
What's going to follow from that behavior

227
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
is play.

228
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And you can trust it.

229
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The basis of human trust is established through play signals.

230
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.

231
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
That's a shame.

232
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I think we've got a lot of learning to do.

233
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Now, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.

234
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So part of the signaling system of play

235
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.

236
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play,

237
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety

238
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
through their own sharing of play signals.

239
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
You may not know this word,

240
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
but it should be your biological first name and last name.

241
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.

242
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And we are, by physical anthropologists,

243
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
by many, many studies, the most neotenous,

244
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures.

245
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And therefore, the most playful.

246
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And this gives us a leg up on adaptability.

247
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Now, there is a way of looking at play

248
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that I also want to emphasize here,

249
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
which is the play history.

250
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Your own personal play history is unique,

251
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and often is not something we think about particularly.

252
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
This is a book written by a consummate player

253
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
by the name of Kevin Carroll.

254
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances:

255
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia,

256
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
black, had to take care of a younger brother.

257
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Found that when he looked at a playground

258
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
out of a window into which he had been confined,

259
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
he felt something different.

260
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And so he followed up on it.

261
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And his life -- the transformation of his life

262
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
from deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death --

263
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
he become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker.

264
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And he gives play as a transformative force

265
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
over his entire life.

266
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress.

267
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Those of you who remember Al Gore,

268
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
during the first term and then during his successful

269
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but unelected run for the presidency,

270
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person,

271
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
at least in public.

272
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And looking at his history, which is common in the press,

273
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
it seems to me, at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view --

274
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that a lot of his life was programmed.

275
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Summers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers.

276
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.

277
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play --

278
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
because I do know something about that --

279
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is

280
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
by paying attention to what is his own passion

281
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and his own inner drive,

282
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.

283
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
So what I would encourage on an individual level to do,

284
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
is to explore backwards as far as you can go

285
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,

286
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.

287
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And begin to build to build from the emotion of that

288
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
into how that connects with your life now.

289
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And you'll find, you may change jobs --

290
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this --

291
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
in order to be more empowered through their play.

292
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it

293
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and paying attention to it.

294
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Most of us work with groups, and I put this up because

295
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
the d.school, the design school at Stanford,

296
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others

297
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
who have been visionary about its establishment,

298
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
has allowed a group of us to get together

299
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and create a course called "From Play to Innovation."

300
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And you'll see this course is to investigate

301
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
the human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state

302
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and its importance to creative thinking:

303
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;

304
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
to apply those principles, through design thinking,

305
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
to promote innovation in the corporate world;

306
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and the students will work with real-world partners

307
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
on design projects with widespread application."

308
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
This is our maiden voyage in this.

309
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.

310
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
There is our star pupil, this labrador,

311
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
who taught a lot of us what a state of play is,

312
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.

313
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
And Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall -- and on the far right is, I think, a person who

314
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize -- Stuart Thompson,

315
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
in neuroscience.

316
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,

317
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students

318
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
as they put play principles into practice in the classroom.

319
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And one of their projects was to

320
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
see what makes meetings boring,

321
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and to try and do something about it.

322
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
So what will follow is a student-made film

323
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
about just that.

324
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Narrator: Flow is the mental state of apparition

325
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.

326
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Characterized by a feeling of energized focus,

327
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
full involvement and success in the process of the activity.

328
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
An important key insight that we learned about meetings

329
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
is that people pack them in one after another,

330
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
disruptive to the day.

331
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task

332
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
that they left at their desk.

333
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
But it doesn't have to be that way.

334
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
(Music)

335
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
Some sage and repeatedly furry monks

336
0:21:08.16,000 --> 0:21:1,000
at this place called the d.school

337
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.

338
0:21:15.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.

339
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:22,000
Because when you need it again,

340
0:21:22.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
the meeting is literally hanging in your closet.

341
0:21:28.16,000 --> 0:21:3,000
The Wearable Meeting.

342
0:21:30.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need

343
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:37,000
to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.

344
0:21:37.16,000 --> 0:21:4,000
But when you take it off --

345
0:21:40.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
that's when the real action happens.

346
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:48,000
(Music)

347
0:21:48.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

348
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:54,000
Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you all

349
0:21:57.16,000 --> 0:21:59,000
to engage

350
0:21:59.16,000 --> 0:22:02,000
not in the work-play differential --

351
0:22:02.16,000 --> 0:22:05,000
where you set aside time to play --

352
0:22:05.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
but where your life becomes infused

353
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
minute by minute, hour by hour,

354
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:14,000
with body,

355
0:22:14.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
object,

356
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:21,000
social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.

357
0:22:21.16,000 --> 0:22:25,000
And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.

358
0:22:25.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
Thank You.

359
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
(Applause)

360
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:37,000
John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that

361
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:41,000
there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work

362
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
and go --

363
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:48,000
I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,

364
0:22:48.16,000 --> 0:22:5,000
that somehow,

365
0:22:50.16,000 --> 0:22:53,000
the way animals and humans deal with play,

366
0:22:53.16,000 --> 0:22:56,000
is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.

367
0:22:56.16,000 --> 0:22:59,000
Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.

368
0:22:59.16,000 --> 0:23:02,000
SB: Yeah, I don't think that's accurate,

369
0:23:02.16,000 --> 0:23:05,000
and I think probably because animals have taught us that.

370
0:23:05.16,000 --> 0:23:09,000
If you stop a cat from playing --

371
0:23:09.16,000 --> 0:23:13,000
which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff --

372
0:23:13.16,000 --> 0:23:18,000
they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.

373
0:23:18.16,000 --> 0:23:2,000
And if you imagine a kid

374
0:23:20.16,000 --> 0:23:23,000
pretending to be King Kong,

375
0:23:23.16,000 --> 0:23:26,000
or a race car driver, or a fireman,

376
0:23:26.16,000 --> 0:23:29,000
they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.

377
0:23:30.16,000 --> 0:23:35,000
So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future --

378
0:23:35.16,000 --> 0:23:38,000
which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as --

379
0:23:38.16,000 --> 0:23:42,000
and thinking of it as a separate biological entity.

380
0:23:42.16,000 --> 0:23:47,000
And this is where my chasing animals for four, five years

381
0:23:47.16,000 --> 0:23:52,000
really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,

382
0:23:52.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
which is that play has a biological place,

383
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:23:59,000
just like sleep and dreams do.

384
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:04,000
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,

385
0:24:04.16,000 --> 0:24:06,000
animals sleep and dream,

386
0:24:06.16,000 --> 0:24:09,000
and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory

387
0:24:09.16,000 --> 0:24:12,000
and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.

388
0:24:12.16,000 --> 0:24:15,000
The next step of evolution in mammals and

389
0:24:15.16,000 --> 0:24:19,000
creatures with divinely superfluous neurons

390
0:24:19.16,000 --> 0:24:22,000
will be to play.

391
0:24:22.16,000 --> 0:24:25,000
And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear

392
0:24:25.16,000 --> 0:24:31,000
or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience

393
0:24:31.16,000 --> 0:24:34,000
sets play aside as something separate.

394
0:24:34.16,000 --> 0:24:38,000
And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.

395
0:24:38.16,000 --> 0:24:41,000
So it's not just something you do in your spare time.

396
0:24:41.16,000 --> 0:24:44,000
JH: How do you keep -- and I know you're part of the scientific research community,

397
0:24:44.16,000 --> 0:24:49,000
and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else --

398
0:24:49.16,000 --> 0:24:51,000
how do you prevent --

399
0:24:51.16,000 --> 0:24:57,000
and some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.

400
0:24:57.16,000 --> 0:25:01,000
How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work

401
0:25:01.16,000 --> 0:25:07,000
or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,

402
0:25:07.16,000 --> 0:25:1,000
kind of like the Mozart metaphor,

403
0:25:10.16,000 --> 0:25:13,000
where, "Oh, MRIs show

404
0:25:13.16,000 --> 0:25:16,000
that play enhances your intelligence.

405
0:25:16.16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
Well, let's round these kids up, put them in pens

406
0:25:18.16,000 --> 0:25:22,000
and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."

407
0:25:22.16,000 --> 0:25:25,000
How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action

408
0:25:25.16,000 --> 0:25:27,000
on the data that you're developing?

409
0:25:27.16,000 --> 0:25:3,000
SB: Well, I think the only way I know to do it

410
0:25:30.16,000 --> 0:25:33,000
is to have accumulated the advisers that I have

411
0:25:33.16,000 --> 0:25:35,000
who go from practitioners --

412
0:25:35.16,000 --> 0:25:39,000
who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever --

413
0:25:39.16,000 --> 0:25:41,000
a state of play.

414
0:25:41.16,000 --> 0:25:43,000
So people know that it's there.

415
0:25:43.16,000 --> 0:25:47,000
And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,

416
0:25:47.16,000 --> 0:25:52,000
and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.

417
0:25:52.16,000 --> 0:25:58,000
And you get them into a group together focused on play,

418
0:25:58.16,000 --> 0:26:02,000
and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.

419
0:26:02.16,000 --> 0:26:05,000
Unfortunately, that hasn't been done sufficiently

420
0:26:05.16,000 --> 0:26:08,000
for the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health

421
0:26:08.16,000 --> 0:26:11,000
or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.

422
0:26:11.16,000 --> 0:26:17,000
I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease

423
0:26:17.16,000 --> 0:26:19,000
associated with play.

424
0:26:19.16,000 --> 0:26:24,000
And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival -- long term --

425
0:26:24.16,000 --> 0:26:28,000
as learning some of the basic things about public health.

426
0:26:28.16,000 --> 0:26:3,000
JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much.

427
0:26:30.16,000 --> 0:26:32,000
(Applause)

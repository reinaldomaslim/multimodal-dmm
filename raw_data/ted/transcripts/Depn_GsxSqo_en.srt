1
0:00:13.523,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Twice a week,

2
0:00:14.984,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I drive from my home near Tijuana, Mexico,

3
0:00:17.516,000 --> 0:00:2,000
over the US border, to my office in San Diego.

4
0:00:20.698,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The stark contrast between the poverty and desperation on one side of the border

5
0:00:24.878,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and the conspicuous wealth on the other

6
0:00:26.761,000 --> 0:00:27,000
always feels jarring.

7
0:00:28.473,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But what makes this contrast feel even starker

8
0:00:31.227,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is when I pass by the building that those of us who work on the border

9
0:00:34.538,000 --> 0:00:36,000
unaffectionately refer to as the black hole.

10
0:00:36.879,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The black hole is the Customs and Border Protection,

11
0:00:39.34,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or CBP facility,

12
0:00:40.665,000 --> 0:00:41,000
at the San Ysidro port of entry,

13
0:00:42.49,000 --> 0:00:44,000
right next to a luxury outlet mall.

14
0:00:44.903,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's also where, at any one time,

15
0:00:46.999,000 --> 0:00:47,000
there's likely 800 immigrants

16
0:00:48.815,000 --> 0:00:51,000
locked in freezing, filthy, concrete cells below the building.

17
0:00:52.609,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Up top: shopping bags and frappuccinos.

18
0:00:55.315,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Downstairs: the reality of the US immigration system.

19
0:00:59.117,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And it's where, one day in September of 2018,

20
0:01:02.236,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I found myself trying to reach Anna,

21
0:01:04.489,000 --> 0:01:07,000
a woman who CBP had recently separated from her seven-year-old son.

22
0:01:09.101,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I'm an immigration attorney

23
0:01:10.436,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and the policy and litigation director of Al Otro Lado,

24
0:01:13.244,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a binational nonprofit helping immigrants on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

25
0:01:17.982,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We'd met Anna several weeks earlier at our Tijuana office,

26
0:01:21.212,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where she explained that she feared she and her son would be killed in Mexico.

27
0:01:25.22,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So we prepared her for the process of turning herself over to CBP

28
0:01:28.895,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to ask for asylum.

29
0:01:31.109,000 --> 0:01:34,000
A few days after she'd gone to the port of entry to ask for help,

30
0:01:34.365,000 --> 0:01:35,000
we received a frantic phone call

31
0:01:35.971,000 --> 0:01:37,000
from her family members in the United States,

32
0:01:38.389,000 --> 0:01:41,000
telling us that CBP officials had taken Anna's son from her.

33
0:01:42.357,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, not that this should matter,

34
0:01:44.267,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but I knew that Anna's son had special needs.

35
0:01:46.815,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And once again,

36
0:01:47.997,000 --> 0:01:49,000
this news filled me with the sense of panic and foreboding

37
0:01:50.768,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that has unfortunately become a hallmark of my daily work.

38
0:01:54.02,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I had a signed authorization to act as Anna's attorney,

39
0:01:56.981,000 --> 0:01:58,000
so I rushed over to the port of entry

40
0:01:59.013,000 --> 0:02:,000
to see if I could speak with my client.

41
0:02:01.259,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Not only would CBP officials not let me speak to Anna,

42
0:02:04.373,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but they wouldn't even tell me if she was there.

43
0:02:07.063,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I went from supervisor to supervisor,

44
0:02:09.293,000 --> 0:02:12,000
begging to submit evidence of Anna's son's special needs,

45
0:02:12.5,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but no one would even talk to me about the case.

46
0:02:15.133,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It felt surreal to watch the shoppers strolling idly by

47
0:02:18.264,000 --> 0:02:2,000
what felt like a life-and-death situation.

48
0:02:21.49,000 --> 0:02:24,000
After several hours of being stonewalled by CBP,

49
0:02:24.53,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I left.

50
0:02:25.942,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Several days later,

51
0:02:27.125,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I found Anna's son in the foster-care system.

52
0:02:29.728,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But I didn't know what happened to Anna

53
0:02:31.784,000 --> 0:02:32,000
until over a week later,

54
0:02:33.157,000 --> 0:02:35,000
when she turned up at a detention camp a few miles east.

55
0:02:36.458,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, Anna didn't have a criminal record,

56
0:02:38.895,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and she followed the law when asking for asylum.

57
0:02:41.696,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Still, immigration officials held her for three more months,

58
0:02:45.377,000 --> 0:02:46,000
until we could win her release

59
0:02:47.274,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and help her reunify with her son.

60
0:02:49.893,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Anna's story is not the only story I could tell you.

61
0:02:53.186,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There's Mateo, an 18-month-old boy,

62
0:02:56.061,000 --> 0:02:58,000
who was ripped from his father's arms

63
0:02:58.149,000 --> 0:03:,000
and sent to a government shelter thousands of miles away,

64
0:03:00.855,000 --> 0:03:02,000
where they failed to properly bathe him for months.

65
0:03:03.796,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There's Amadou,

66
0:03:04.992,000 --> 0:03:05,000
an unaccompanied African child,

67
0:03:06.692,000 --> 0:03:11,000
who was held with adults for 28 days in CBP's horrific facilities.

68
0:03:12.581,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Most disturbingly, there's Maria,

69
0:03:14.823,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a pregnant refugee who begged for medical attention for eight hours

70
0:03:19.132,000 --> 0:03:21,000
before she miscarried in CBP custody.

71
0:03:21.926,000 --> 0:03:24,000
CBP officials held her for three more weeks

72
0:03:25.006,000 --> 0:03:27,000
before they sent her back to Mexico,

73
0:03:27.093,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where she is being forced to wait months

74
0:03:29.054,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for an asylum hearing in the United States.

75
0:03:32.331,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Seeing these horrors day in and day out has changed me.

76
0:03:35.68,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I used to be fun at parties,

77
0:03:37.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but now, I inevitably find myself telling people

78
0:03:41.367,000 --> 0:03:43,000
about how our government tortures refugees at the border

79
0:03:44.272,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and in the detention camps.

80
0:03:46.288,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now, people try to change the subject

81
0:03:48.098,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and congratulate me for the great work I'm doing in helping people like Anna.

82
0:03:52.512,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But I don't know how to make them understand

83
0:03:54.623,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that unless they start fighting, harder than they ever thought possible,

84
0:03:58.203,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we don't know which of us will be the next to suffer Anna's fate.

85
0:04:02.337,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Trump's mass separations of refugee families

86
0:04:05.046,000 --> 0:04:06,000
at the southern border

87
0:04:06.226,000 --> 0:04:07,000
shocked the conscience of the world

88
0:04:08.021,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and woke many to the cruelties of the US immigration system.

89
0:04:11.307,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It seems like today,

90
0:04:12.49,000 --> 0:04:15,000
more people than ever are involved in the fight for immigrant rights.

91
0:04:15.815,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But unfortunately, the situation is just not getting better.

92
0:04:19.749,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Thousands protested to end family separations,

93
0:04:22.709,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but the government is still separating families.

94
0:04:25.209,000 --> 0:04:27,000
More than 900 children have been taken from their parents

95
0:04:28.074,000 --> 0:04:29,000
since June of 2018.

96
0:04:30.188,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Thousands more refugee children have been taken from their grandparents,

97
0:04:34.058,000 --> 0:04:36,000
siblings and other family members at the border.

98
0:04:36.847,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Since 2017,

99
0:04:38.456,000 --> 0:04:41,000
at least two dozen people have died in immigration custody.

100
0:04:42.046,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And more will die, including children.

101
0:04:46.006,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, we lawyers can and will keep filing lawsuits

102
0:04:49.411,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to stop the government from brutalizing our clients,

103
0:04:52.561,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but we can't keep tinkering around the edges of the law

104
0:04:55.289,000 --> 0:04:57,000
if we want migrants to be treated humanely.

105
0:04:58.614,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This administration would have you believe that we have to separate families

106
0:05:02.744,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and we have to detain children,

107
0:05:04.482,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because it will stop more refugees from coming to our borders.

108
0:05:07.577,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But we know that this isn't true.

109
0:05:09.244,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In fact, in 2019,

110
0:05:11.173,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the number of apprehensions at our southern border

111
0:05:13.601,000 --> 0:05:14,000
has actually gone up.

112
0:05:15.236,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And we tell people every day at the border,

113
0:05:17.371,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"If you seek asylum in the United States,

114
0:05:19.538,000 --> 0:05:2,000
you risk family separation,

115
0:05:21.236,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and you risk being detained indefinitely."

116
0:05:23.584,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But for many of them, the alternative is even worse.

117
0:05:27.862,000 --> 0:05:31,000
People seek refuge in the United States for a lot of different reasons.

118
0:05:32.004,000 --> 0:05:34,000
In Tijuana, we've met refugees from over 50 countries,

119
0:05:34.965,000 --> 0:05:35,000
speaking 14 different languages.

120
0:05:37.267,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We meet LGBT migrants from all over the world

121
0:05:40.204,000 --> 0:05:42,000
who have never been in a country in which they feel safe.

122
0:05:43.418,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We meet women from all over the world

123
0:05:45.347,000 --> 0:05:47,000
whose own governments refuse to protect them

124
0:05:47.665,000 --> 0:05:5,000
from brutal domestic violence or repressive social norms.

125
0:05:51.619,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Of course, we meet Central American families

126
0:05:53.691,000 --> 0:05:54,000
who are fleeing gang violence.

127
0:05:55.508,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But we also meet Russian dissidents,

128
0:05:57.548,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Venezuelan activists,

129
0:05:59.056,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Christians from China, Muslims from China,

130
0:06:03.04,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and thousands and thousands of other refugees

131
0:06:05.46,000 --> 0:06:07,000
fleeing all types of persecution and torture.

132
0:06:08.563,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now, a lot of these people would qualify as refugees

133
0:06:12.127,000 --> 0:06:14,000
under the international legal definition.

134
0:06:14.871,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The Refugee Convention was created after World War II

135
0:06:18.22,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to give protection to people fleeing persecution

136
0:06:21.087,000 --> 0:06:25,000
based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion

137
0:06:25.551,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or membership in a particular social group.

138
0:06:28.115,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But even those who would be refugees under the international definition

139
0:06:32.004,000 --> 0:06:34,000
are not going to win asylum in the United States.

140
0:06:34.831,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And that's because since 2017,

141
0:06:37.053,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the US Attorneys General have made sweeping changes to asylum law,

142
0:06:41.133,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to make sure that less people qualify for protection in the United States.

143
0:06:45.474,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Now these laws are mostly aimed at Central Americans

144
0:06:48.268,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and keeping them out of the country,

145
0:06:50.125,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but they affect other types of refugees as well.

146
0:06:53.498,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The result is that the US frequently deports refugees

147
0:06:57.474,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to their persecution and death.

148
0:07:00.689,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The US is also using detention to try to deter refugees

149
0:07:04.863,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and make it harder for them to win their cases.

150
0:07:07.472,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Today, there are over 55,000 immigrants detained in the United States,

151
0:07:12.345,000 --> 0:07:14,000
many in remote detention facilities,

152
0:07:14.821,000 --> 0:07:15,000
far from any type of legal help.

153
0:07:16.575,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And this is very important.

154
0:07:18.601,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Because it's civil and not criminal detention,

155
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:23,000
there is no public defender system,

156
0:07:23.942,000 --> 0:07:25,000
so most detained immigrants are not going to have an attorney

157
0:07:26.855,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to help them with their cases.

158
0:07:28.768,000 --> 0:07:3,000
An immigrant who has an attorney

159
0:07:30.847,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is up to 10 times more likely to win their case

160
0:07:33.887,000 --> 0:07:34,000
than one who doesn't.

161
0:07:35.76,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And as you've seen, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

162
0:07:38.886,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but the situation is even worse for refugee families today

163
0:07:42.244,000 --> 0:07:44,000
than it was during family separation.

164
0:07:44.697,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Since January of 2019,

165
0:07:47.213,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the US has implemented a policy

166
0:07:49.015,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that's forced over 40,000 refugees to wait in Mexico

167
0:07:53.062,000 --> 0:07:55,000
for asylum hearings in the United States.

168
0:07:56.024,000 --> 0:07:58,000
These refugees, many of whom are families,

169
0:07:58.873,000 --> 0:08:01,000
are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world,

170
0:08:02.023,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where they're being raped, kidnapped

171
0:08:04.009,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and extorted by criminal groups.

172
0:08:06.204,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And if they survive for long enough to make it to their asylum hearing,

173
0:08:09.839,000 --> 0:08:12,000
less than one percent of them are able to find an attorney

174
0:08:13.203,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to help them with their cases.

175
0:08:16.363,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The US government will point to the lowest asylum approval rates

176
0:08:20.947,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to argue that these people are not really refugees,

177
0:08:23.479,000 --> 0:08:26,000
when in fact, US asylum law is an obstacle course

178
0:08:27.209,000 --> 0:08:28,000
designed to make them fail.

179
0:08:29.018,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now not every migrant at the border is a refugee.

180
0:08:31.991,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I meet plenty of economic migrants.

181
0:08:34.102,000 --> 0:08:37,000
For example, people who want to go to the United States to work,

182
0:08:37.221,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to pay medical bills for a parent

183
0:08:39.031,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or school fees for a child back home.

184
0:08:41.698,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Increasingly, I'm also meeting climate refugees.

185
0:08:44.733,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In particular, I'm meeting a lot of indigenous Central Americans

186
0:08:48.567,000 --> 0:08:5,000
who can no longer sustain themselves by farming,

187
0:08:51.337,000 --> 0:08:53,000
due to catastrophic drought in the region.

188
0:08:54.061,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We know that today,

189
0:08:55.823,000 --> 0:08:57,000
people are migrating because of climate change,

190
0:08:58.585,000 --> 0:09:,000
and that more will do so in the future,

191
0:09:00.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but we simply don't have a legal system to deal with this type of migration.

192
0:09:05.522,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So, it would make sense, as a start,

193
0:09:08.865,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to expand the refugee definition

194
0:09:10.728,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to include climate refugees, for example.

195
0:09:13.609,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But those of us in a position to advocate for those changes

196
0:09:16.514,000 --> 0:09:17,000
are too busy suing our government

197
0:09:18.395,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to keep the meager legal protections that refugees enjoy under the current law.

198
0:09:22.434,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And we are exhausted,

199
0:09:24.491,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and it's almost too late to help.

200
0:09:27.76,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And we know now

201
0:09:28.942,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that this isn't America's problem alone.

202
0:09:31.245,000 --> 0:09:34,000
From Australia's brutal offshore detention camps

203
0:09:34.514,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to Italy's criminalization of aid to migrants drowning in the Mediterranean,

204
0:09:39.831,000 --> 0:09:41,000
first-world countries have gone to deadly lengths

205
0:09:42.665,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to keep refugees from reaching our shores.

206
0:09:45.64,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But they've done more than restrict the refugee definition.

207
0:09:49.009,000 --> 0:09:52,000
They've created parallel, fascist-style legal systems

208
0:09:52.374,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in which migrants have none of the rights that form the basis of a democracy,

209
0:09:56.493,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the alleged foundation of the countries in which they're seeking refuge.

210
0:10:00.776,000 --> 0:10:01,000
History shows us that the first group

211
0:10:02.745,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to be vilified and stripped of their rights is rarely the last,

212
0:10:06.562,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and many Americans and Europeans

213
0:10:09.078,000 --> 0:10:13,000
seem to accept an opaque and unjust legal system for noncitizens,

214
0:10:13.263,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because they think they are immune.

215
0:10:15.025,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But eventually,

216
0:10:16.255,000 --> 0:10:19,000
these authoritarian ideals bleed over and affect citizens as well.

217
0:10:20.644,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I learned this firsthand

218
0:10:22.173,000 --> 0:10:24,000
when the US government placed me on an illegal watch list

219
0:10:25.196,000 --> 0:10:27,000
for my work helping immigrants at the border.

220
0:10:28.411,000 --> 0:10:29,000
One day, in January of 2019,

221
0:10:30.387,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I was leaving my office in San Diego

222
0:10:32.322,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and crossing the border to go back to my home in Mexico.

223
0:10:35.609,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Mexican officials, although they had given me a valid visa,

224
0:10:38.936,000 --> 0:10:4,000
stopped me and told me that I couldn't enter the country

225
0:10:41.699,000 --> 0:10:44,000
because a foreign government had placed a travel alert on my passport,

226
0:10:45.547,000 --> 0:10:47,000
designating me as a national security risk.

227
0:10:48.253,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I was detained and interrogated in a filthy room for hours.

228
0:10:52.017,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I begged the Mexican officials

229
0:10:53.517,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to let me go back to Mexico and pick up my son,

230
0:10:56.413,000 --> 0:10:58,000
who was only 10 months old at the time.

231
0:10:59.515,000 --> 0:11:,000
But they refused,

232
0:11:00.699,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and instead, they turned me over to CBP officials,

233
0:11:03.165,000 --> 0:11:05,000
where I was forced back into the United States.

234
0:11:05.934,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It took me weeks to get another visa so that I could go back to Mexico,

235
0:11:09.43,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and I went to the border, visa in hand.

236
0:11:12.089,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But again, I was detained and interrogated

237
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because there was still a travel alert on my passport.

238
0:11:17.597,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Shortly after,

239
0:11:18.895,000 --> 0:11:2,000
leaked internal CBP documents

240
0:11:20.952,000 --> 0:11:22,000
confirmed that my own government

241
0:11:23.03,000 --> 0:11:26,000
had been complicit in issuing this travel alert against me.

242
0:11:26.538,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And since then, I haven't traveled to any other countries,

243
0:11:29.53,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because I'm afraid I'll be detained

244
0:11:31.427,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and deported from those countries as well.

245
0:11:34.228,000 --> 0:11:36,000
These travel restrictions, detentions

246
0:11:36.538,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and separation from my infant son

247
0:11:38.649,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are things I never thought I would experience as a US citizen,

248
0:11:42.751,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but I'm far from the only person being criminalized for helping immigrants.

249
0:11:46.727,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The US and other countries have made it a crime to save lives,

250
0:11:50.513,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and those of us who are simply trying to do our jobs

251
0:11:53.466,000 --> 0:11:56,000
are being forced to choose between our humanity and our freedom.

252
0:11:57.498,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And the thing that makes me so desperate

253
0:11:59.434,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is that all of you are facing the same choice,

254
0:12:02.022,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but you don't understand it yet.

255
0:12:04.553,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I know there are good people out there.

256
0:12:06.919,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I saw thousands of you in the streets,

257
0:12:08.855,000 --> 0:12:09,000
protesting family separation.

258
0:12:11.268,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And that largely helped bring about an end to the official policy.

259
0:12:15.588,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But we know that the government is still separating children.

260
0:12:18.485,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And things are actually getting worse.

261
0:12:20.549,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Today, the US government is fighting for the right

262
0:12:23.392,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to detain refugee children indefinitely in prison camps.

263
0:12:27.538,000 --> 0:12:28,000
This isn't over.

264
0:12:28.982,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We cannot allow ourselves to become numb or look away.

265
0:12:33.077,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Those of us who are citizens of countries

266
0:12:35.315,000 --> 0:12:38,000
whose policies cause detention, separation and death,

267
0:12:39.244,000 --> 0:12:41,000
need to very quickly decide which side we're on.

268
0:12:42.401,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We need to demand that our laws respect the inherent dignity of all human beings,

269
0:12:47.283,000 --> 0:12:5,000
especially refugees seeking help at our borders,

270
0:12:50.608,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but including economic migrants and climate refugees.

271
0:12:54.719,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We need to demand that refugees get a fair shot

272
0:12:57.525,000 --> 0:12:59,000
at seeking protection in our countries

273
0:12:59.704,000 --> 0:13:01,000
by ensuring that they have access to council

274
0:13:02.1,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and by creating independent courts

275
0:13:03.95,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that are not subject to the political whims of the president.

276
0:13:08.069,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I know it's overwhelming,

277
0:13:09.871,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and I know this sounds cliché, but ...

278
0:13:13.267,000 --> 0:13:15,000
we need to call our elected representatives

279
0:13:15.746,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and demand these changes.

280
0:13:18.094,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I know you've heard this before,

281
0:13:19.698,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but have you made the call?

282
0:13:21.611,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We know these calls make a difference.

283
0:13:24.897,000 --> 0:13:27,000
The dystopian immigration systems being built up in first-world countries

284
0:13:28.659,000 --> 0:13:3,000
are a test of citizens

285
0:13:31.247,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to see how far you're willing to let the government go

286
0:13:34.569,000 --> 0:13:37,000
in taking away other people's rights when you think it won't happen to you.

287
0:13:39.427,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But when you let the government take people's children

288
0:13:41.99,000 --> 0:13:42,000
without due process

289
0:13:43.649,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and detain people indefinitely without access to council,

290
0:13:46.855,000 --> 0:13:47,000
you are failing the test.

291
0:13:49.109,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What's happening to immigrants now

292
0:13:51.3,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is a preview of where we're all headed if we fail to act.

293
0:13:55.442,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Thank you.

294
0:13:56.634,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Applause)

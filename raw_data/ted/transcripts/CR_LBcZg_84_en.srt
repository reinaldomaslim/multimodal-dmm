2
0:00:15.66,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do

3
0:00:18.511,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is almost like the weatherman.

4
0:00:20.677,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We are always chasing storms.

5
0:00:24.193,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We want to see and measure storms -- brainstorms, that is.

6
0:00:29.076,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives,

7
0:00:31.844,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but we rarely see or listen to one.

8
0:00:35.294,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So I always like to start these talks

9
0:00:36.928,000 --> 0:00:38,000
by actually introducing you to one of them.

10
0:00:39.91,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Actually, the first time we recorded more than one neuron --

11
0:00:43.337,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a hundred brain cells simultaneously --

12
0:00:45.56,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we could measure the electrical sparks

13
0:00:48.029,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of a hundred cells in the same animal,

14
0:00:50.709,000 --> 0:00:51,000
this is the first image we got,

15
0:00:52.511,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the first 10 seconds of this recording.

16
0:00:54.826,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So we got a little snippet of a thought,

17
0:00:58.177,000 --> 0:01:,000
and we could see it in front of us.

18
0:01:01.082,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I always tell the students

19
0:01:02.094,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer,

20
0:01:06.2,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because we are dealing with a system

21
0:01:07.826,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that is only comparable in terms of number of cells

22
0:01:10.743,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe.

23
0:01:13.679,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And here we are, out of billions of neurons,

24
0:01:16.709,000 --> 0:01:18,000
just recording, 10 years ago, a hundred.

25
0:01:19.527,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We are doing a thousand now.

26
0:01:21.11,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature.

27
0:01:26.51,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Because, if you don't know yet,

28
0:01:28.442,000 --> 0:01:33,000
everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms,

29
0:01:33.692,000 --> 0:01:37,000
comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains

30
0:01:38.343,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and define our memories, our beliefs,

31
0:01:42.228,000 --> 0:01:44,000
our feelings, our plans for the future.

32
0:01:44.928,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Everything that we ever do,

33
0:01:47.326,000 --> 0:01:52,000
everything that every human has ever done, do or will do,

34
0:01:52.393,000 --> 0:01:57,000
requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms.

35
0:01:57.827,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And the sound of a brainstorm, if you've never heard one,

36
0:02:00.31,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is somewhat like this.

37
0:02:03.659,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You can put it louder if you can.

38
0:02:06.805,000 --> 0:02:12,000
My son calls this "making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned A.M. station."

39
0:02:13.208,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is a brain.

40
0:02:14.693,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker

41
0:02:18.127,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing,

42
0:02:20.993,000 --> 0:02:24,000
your brain will sound like this -- my brain, any brain.

43
0:02:25.615,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time

44
0:02:29.377,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is to actually listen to these symphonies, these brain symphonies,

45
0:02:34.727,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and try to extract from them the messages they carry.

46
0:02:38.127,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In particular, about 12 years ago

47
0:02:40.978,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we created a preparation that we named brain-machine interfaces.

48
0:02:44.026,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And you have a scheme here that describes how it works.

49
0:02:46.728,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The idea is, let's have some sensors that listen to these storms, this electrical firing,

50
0:02:52.294,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and see if you can, in the same time that it takes

51
0:02:55.376,000 --> 0:02:59,000
for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal --

52
0:03:00.345,000 --> 0:03:02,000
about half a second --

53
0:03:03.209,000 --> 0:03:05,000
let's see if we can read these signals,

54
0:03:05.56,000 --> 0:03:08,000
extract the motor messages that are embedded in it,

55
0:03:08.96,000 --> 0:03:1,000
translate it into digital commands

56
0:03:11.232,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and send it to an artificial device

57
0:03:13.118,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time.

58
0:03:19.011,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message

59
0:03:22.859,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when we compare to the way the body does that.

60
0:03:26.377,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And if we can actually provide feedback,

61
0:03:29.243,000 --> 0:03:34,000
sensory signals that go back from this robotic, mechanical, computational actuator

62
0:03:34.977,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that is now under the control of the brain,

63
0:03:37.228,000 --> 0:03:38,000
back to the brain,

64
0:03:38.539,000 --> 0:03:4,000
how the brain deals with that,

65
0:03:40.66,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery.

66
0:03:45.561,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.

67
0:03:47.882,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora

68
0:03:50.843,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that became one of the superstars of this field.

69
0:03:53.311,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And Aurora liked to play video games.

70
0:03:55.61,000 --> 0:03:56,000
As you can see here,

71
0:03:56.983,000 --> 0:04:,000
she likes to use a joystick, like any one of us, any of our kids, to play this game.

72
0:04:01.927,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And as a good primate, she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer.

73
0:04:06.598,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross

74
0:04:10.881,000 --> 0:04:12,000
with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick,

75
0:04:13.731,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Aurora is trying to find the target, no matter where it is.

76
0:04:17.682,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And if she's doing that,

77
0:04:19.151,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor,

78
0:04:22.465,000 --> 0:04:24,000
she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice.

79
0:04:25.415,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And I can tell you, any monkey will do anything for you

80
0:04:28.365,000 --> 0:04:31,000
if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice.

81
0:04:31.465,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Actually any primate will do that.

82
0:04:34.196,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Think about that.

83
0:04:35.53,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Well, while Aurora was playing this game, as you saw,

84
0:04:38.93,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and doing a thousand trials a day

85
0:04:41.365,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice,

86
0:04:45.248,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head

87
0:04:48.647,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and sending them to a robotic arm

88
0:04:50.294,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making.

89
0:04:54.165,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface

90
0:04:57.948,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and have Aurora play the game just by thinking,

91
0:05:02.648,000 --> 0:05:04,000
without interference of her body.

92
0:05:05.265,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Her brainstorms would control an arm

93
0:05:08.181,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that would move the cursor and cross the target.

94
0:05:10.89,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And to our shock, that's exactly what Aurora did.

95
0:05:14.081,000 --> 0:05:18,000
She played the game without moving her body.

96
0:05:18.281,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now,

97
0:05:20.518,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this is the exact first moment she got that.

98
0:05:23.73,000 --> 0:05:24,000
That's the exact first moment

99
0:05:25.514,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate

100
0:05:32.281,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and could act outside, in that outside world,

101
0:05:35.981,000 --> 0:05:37,000
just by controlling an artificial device.

102
0:05:38.947,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And Aurora kept playing the game, kept finding the little target

103
0:05:43.864,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get, that she craved for.

104
0:05:47.781,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Well, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm.

105
0:05:54.482,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later,

106
0:05:57.445,000 --> 0:05:59,000
after the first video that I showed to you,

107
0:06:00.131,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is under the control of Aurora's brain

108
0:06:02.781,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and is moving the cursor to get to the target.

109
0:06:05.949,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm,

110
0:06:09.848,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases.

111
0:06:15.564,000 --> 0:06:19,000
She can scratch her back, she can scratch one of us, she can play another game.

112
0:06:19.631,000 --> 0:06:2,000
By all purposes and means,

113
0:06:21.231,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device

114
0:06:25.347,000 --> 0:06:27,000
as an extension of her body.

115
0:06:28.097,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind

116
0:06:31.63,000 --> 0:06:35,000
has been expanded to get one more arm.

117
0:06:35.714,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, we did that 10 years ago.

118
0:06:38.064,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Just fast forward 10 years.

119
0:06:40.897,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Just last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device.

120
0:06:45.88,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You can just build a computational body, an avatar, a monkey avatar.

121
0:06:51.364,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them,

122
0:06:55.614,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or you can train them to assume in a virtual world

123
0:07:00.053,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the first-person perspective of that avatar

124
0:07:03.097,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs.

125
0:07:08.748,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And what we did basically was to train the animals

126
0:07:11.514,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to learn how to control these avatars

127
0:07:14.564,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and explore objects that appear in the virtual world.

128
0:07:18.463,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And these objects are visually identical,

129
0:07:20.764,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects,

130
0:07:24.647,000 --> 0:07:3,000
they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object

131
0:07:31.047,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that goes back directly to the monkey's brain,

132
0:07:35.063,000 --> 0:07:4,000
informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching.

133
0:07:40.115,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And in just four weeks, the brain learns to process this new sensation

134
0:07:44.88,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and acquires a new sensory pathway -- like a new sense.

135
0:07:51.314,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And you truly liberate the brain now

136
0:07:53.73,000 --> 0:07:57,000
because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar.

137
0:07:58.114,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain

138
0:08:03.114,000 --> 0:08:05,000
without the interference of the skin.

139
0:08:05.547,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So what you see here is this is the design of the task.

140
0:08:08.081,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets.

141
0:08:12.331,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And he has to select one because only one carries the reward,

142
0:08:16.68,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the orange juice that they want to get.

143
0:08:18.547,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm, an arm that doesn't exist.

144
0:08:24.18,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And that's exactly what they do.

145
0:08:26.18,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is a complete liberation of the brain

146
0:08:29.615,000 --> 0:08:33,000
from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task.

147
0:08:33.897,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets.

148
0:08:38.064,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain.

149
0:08:43.715,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward.

150
0:08:47.598,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey.

151
0:08:51.43,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And by the way, they don't read English anyway,

152
0:08:53.914,000 --> 0:08:58,000
so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position.

153
0:08:59.13,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And yet, they can find them by tactile discrimination,

154
0:09:03.064,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and they can press it and select it.

155
0:09:06.281,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So when we look at the brains of these animals,

156
0:09:08.963,000 --> 0:09:11,000
on the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells

157
0:09:12.63,000 --> 0:09:16,000
showing what happens with the brain activity, the electrical storms,

158
0:09:16.831,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of this sample of neurons in the brain

159
0:09:18.898,000 --> 0:09:2,000
when the animal is using a joystick.

160
0:09:21.014,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows.

161
0:09:23.614,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions.

162
0:09:28.797,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving

163
0:09:34.48,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar.

164
0:09:40.614,000 --> 0:09:43,000
As fast as we can reset our computers,

165
0:09:43.68,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool,

166
0:09:49.498,000 --> 0:09:54,000
as if this too was a part of that primate's body.

167
0:09:54.748,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The brain is assimilating that too, as fast as we can measure.

168
0:09:59.463,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So that suggests to us that our sense of self

169
0:10:03.081,000 --> 0:10:07,000
does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies,

170
0:10:07.231,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains.

171
0:10:12.949,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Our violins, our cars, our bicycles, our soccer balls, our clothing --

172
0:10:17.713,000 --> 0:10:23,000
they all become assimilated by this voracious, amazing, dynamic system called the brain.

173
0:10:24.564,000 --> 0:10:25,000
How far can we take it?

174
0:10:26.263,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Well, in an experiment that we ran a few years ago, we took this to the limit.

175
0:10:30.481,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We had an animal running on a treadmill

176
0:10:32.963,000 --> 0:10:34,000
at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States,

177
0:10:35.23,000 --> 0:10:37,000
producing the brainstorms necessary to move.

178
0:10:37.93,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And we had a robotic device, a humanoid robot,

179
0:10:42.021,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in Kyoto, Japan at ATR Laboratories

180
0:10:44.415,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain,

181
0:10:50.509,000 --> 0:10:53,000
a human brain, or a primate brain.

182
0:10:53.782,000 --> 0:10:57,000
What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey

183
0:10:58.38,000 --> 0:11:01,000
was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk

184
0:11:01.847,000 --> 0:11:05,000
while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke,

185
0:11:05.914,000 --> 0:11:1,000
so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.

186
0:11:11.147,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So she could be rewarded, not by what her body was doing

187
0:11:15.214,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet

188
0:11:20.175,000 --> 0:11:22,000
controlled by her brain activity.

189
0:11:22.784,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Funny thing, that round trip around the globe took 20 milliseconds less

190
0:11:29.902,000 --> 0:11:33,000
than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head, the head of the monkey,

191
0:11:34.052,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and reach its own muscle.

192
0:11:37.922,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger, across the planet.

193
0:11:43.952,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously.

194
0:11:50.352,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan

195
0:11:55.619,000 --> 0:11:58,000
under the control of the brain activity of a primate.

196
0:11:59.319,000 --> 0:12:,000
So where are we taking all this?

197
0:12:01.308,000 --> 0:12:03,000
What are we going to do with all this research,

198
0:12:03.651,000 --> 0:12:08,000
besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears?

199
0:12:09.319,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology

200
0:12:14.152,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world.

201
0:12:19.636,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms

202
0:12:24.219,000 --> 0:12:26,000
into action, into movement.

203
0:12:26.335,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements,

204
0:12:31.569,000 --> 0:12:36,000
they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord.

205
0:12:36.736,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So our idea is to create a bypass,

206
0:12:39.186,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is to use these brain-machine interfaces to read these signals,

207
0:12:43.218,000 --> 0:12:47,000
larger-scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again,

208
0:12:47.268,000 --> 0:12:5,000
bypass the lesion using computational microengineering

209
0:12:51.237,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and send it to a new body, a whole body called an exoskeleton,

210
0:12:58.351,000 --> 0:13:03,000
a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients.

211
0:13:03.918,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And you can see an image produced by this consortium.

212
0:13:08.044,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project

213
0:13:12.103,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that is putting together scientists from Europe,

214
0:13:14.886,000 --> 0:13:15,000
from here in the United States, and in Brazil

215
0:13:16.751,000 --> 0:13:2,000
together to work to actually get this new body built --

216
0:13:21.268,000 --> 0:13:24,000
a body that we believe, through the same plastic mechanisms

217
0:13:24.602,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain-machine interface

218
0:13:30.404,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life.

219
0:13:36.034,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients,

220
0:13:39.718,000 --> 0:13:42,000
not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make

221
0:13:43.486,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and translate them into movements of this new body,

222
0:13:46.693,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls.

223
0:13:53.451,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So I was told about 10 years ago

224
0:13:57.302,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that this would never happen, that this was close to impossible.

225
0:14:02.368,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And I can only tell you that as a scientist,

226
0:14:04.819,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid-'60s

227
0:14:07.805,000 --> 0:14:12,000
watching a few crazy guys telling [us] that they would go to the Moon.

228
0:14:12.853,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And I was five years old,

229
0:14:14.314,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job;

230
0:14:18.554,000 --> 0:14:2,000
after all, they were very proficient --

231
0:14:20.986,000 --> 0:14:23,000
but just seeing that as a kid

232
0:14:24.436,000 --> 0:14:26,000
made me believe, as my grandmother used to tell me,

233
0:14:27.421,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that "impossible is just the possible

234
0:14:29.266,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true."

235
0:14:33.17,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk.

236
0:14:36.969,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice.

237
0:14:40.22,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Thank you.

238
0:14:41.67,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm here to spread the word about the

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
magnificence of spiders

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and how much we can learn from them.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Spiders are truly global citizens.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
You can find spiders in nearly

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
every terrestrial habitat.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This red dot marks

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the Great Basin of North America,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
project there with some collaborators.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Here's one of our field sites,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and just to give you a sense of perspective,

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
this little blue smudge here,

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that's one of my collaborators.

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This is a rugged and barren landscape,

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
yet there are quite a few spiders here.

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
grappling with a beetle.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Spiders are not just everywhere,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but they're extremely diverse.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There are over 40,000 described species

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of spiders.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
To put that number into perspective,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
here's a graph comparing the 40,000

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
species of spiders

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to the 400 species of primates.

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
There are two orders of magnitude more

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
spiders than primates.

29
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Spiders are also extremely old.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
On the bottom here,

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
this is the geologic timescale,

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and the numbers on it indicate millions

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of years from the present, so the zero here,

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that would be today.

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So what this figure shows is that spiders

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
date back to almost 380 million years.

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
To put that into perspective, this red

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
vertical bar here marks the divergence time

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of humans from chimpanzees,

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
a mere seven million years ago.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
All spiders make silk

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
at some point in their life.

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Most spiders use copious amounts of silk,

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and silk is essential to their survival

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and reproduction.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Even fossil spiders can make silk,

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as we can see from this impression of

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a spinneret on this fossil spider.

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So this means that both spiders

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and spider silk have been around

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for 380 million years.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It doesn't take long from working with spiders

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to start noticing how essential silk is

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to just about every aspect of their life.

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Spiders use silk for many purposes, including

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the trailing safety dragline,

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
wrapping eggs for reproduction,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
protective retreats

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and catching prey.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
There are many kinds of spider silk.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
For example, this garden spider can make

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
seven different kinds of silks.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
When you look at this orb web, you're actually

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
seeing many types of silk fibers.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The frame and radii of this web

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is made up of one type of silk,

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
while the capture spiral is a composite

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of two different silks:

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the filament and the sticky droplet.

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
How does an individual spider

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
make so many kinds of silk?

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
To answer that, you have to look a lot closer

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
at the spinneret region of a spider.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
those of us spider silk biologists, this is what

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we call the "business end" of the spider. (Laughter)

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We spend long days ...

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We spend long days and nights

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
staring at this part of the spider.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And this is what we see.

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You can see multiple fibers

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
coming out of the spinnerets, because

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
each spinneret has many spigots on it.

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and if you were to trace the fiber back

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
into the spider, what you would find is that

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
each spigot connects to its own individual

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
an orb-web-weaving spider,

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I hope you do,

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
what you would find is a bounty

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
of beautiful, translucent silk glands.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Inside each spider, there are hundreds

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of silk glands, sometimes thousands.

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
These can be grouped into seven categories.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They differ by size, shape,

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and sometimes even color.

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
In an orb-web-weaving spider,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you can find seven types of silk glands,

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and what I have depicted here in this picture,

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
let's start at the one o'clock position,

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to make the outer silk of an egg sac.

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
glands which combine to make the sticky

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
capture spiral of an orb web.

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Pyriform silk glands make the attachment

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
silk lines to a substrate.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There's also aciniform silk,

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which is used to wrap prey.

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction.

117
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And the most studied silk line

118
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
of them all: major ampullate silk.

119
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This is the silk that's used to make the frame

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and radii of an orb web, and also

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the safety trailing dragline.

122
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But what, exactly, is spider silk?

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Spider silk is almost entirely protein.

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Nearly all of these proteins can be explained

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
by a single gene family,

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so this means that the diversity of silk types

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we see today is encoded by one gene family,

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so presumably the original spider ancestor

129
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
made one kind of silk,

130
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and over the last 380 million years,

131
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that one silk gene has duplicated

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and then diverged, specialized,

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
over and over and over again, to get

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the large variety of flavors of spider silks

135
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that we have today.

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There are several features that all these silks

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
have in common. They all have a common

138
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
design, such as they're all very long --

139
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they're sort of outlandishly long

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
compared to other proteins.

141
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They're very repetitive, and they're very rich

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in the amino acids glycine and alanine.

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
To give you an idea of what

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
a spider silk protein looks like,

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
this is a dragline silk protein,

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it's just a portion of it,

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
from the black widow spider.

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This is the kind of sequence that I love

149
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
looking at day and night. (Laughter)

150
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So what you're seeing here is the one letter

151
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored

152
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in the glycines with green,

153
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and the alanines in red, and so

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You can also see that there's a lot of short

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
sequence motifs that repeat over and over

157
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and over again, so for example there's a lot of

158
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,

159
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You can think of these short motifs

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that repeat over and over again as words,

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and these words occur in sentences.

163
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So for example this would be one sentence,

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and you would get this sort of green region

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and the red polyalanine, that repeats

166
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
over and over and over again,

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and you can have that hundreds and

168
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
hundreds and hundreds of times within

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
an individual silk molecule.

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Silks made by the same spider can have

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
dramatically different repeat sequences.

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
At the top of the screen, you're seeing

173
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the repeat unit from the dragline silk

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of a garden argiope spider.

175
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's short. And on the bottom,

176
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
this is the repeat sequence for the

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
egg case, or tubuliform silk protein,

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
for the exact same spider. And you can see

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
how dramatically different

180
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
these silk proteins are -- so this is

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
sort of the beauty of the diversification

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of the spider silk gene family.

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You can see that the repeat units differ

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in length. They also differ in sequence.

185
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So I've colored in the glycines again

186
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in green, alanine in red, and the serines,

187
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the letter S, in purple. And you can see

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that the top repeat unit can be explained

189
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
almost entirely by green and red,

190
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the bottom repeat unit has

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
a substantial amount of purple.

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
What silk biologists do is we try to relate

193
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
these sequences, these amino acid

194
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
sequences, to the mechanical properties

195
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of the silk fibers.

196
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
completely outside their body.

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This makes testing spider silk really, really

199
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
easy to do in the laboratory, because

200
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we're actually, you know, testing it in air

201
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that's exactly the environment that

202
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
spiders are using their silk proteins.

203
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So this makes quantifying silk properties by

204
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
methods such as tensile testing, which is

205
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
basically, you know, tugging on one end

206
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of the fiber, very amenable.

207
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Here are stress-strain curves

208
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
generated by tensile testing

209
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
five fibers made by the same spider.

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So what you can see here is that

211
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the five fibers have different behaviors.

212
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis,

213
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that's stress. If you look at the maximum

214
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
stress value for each of these fibers,

215
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
you can see that there's a lot of variation,

216
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is the strongest of these fibers.

218
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We think that's because the dragline silk,

219
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which is used to make the frame and radii

220
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
for a web, needs to be very strong.

221
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
On the other hand, if you were to look at

222
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
strain -- this is how much a fiber can be

223
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
extended -- if you look at the maximum value

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
here, again, there's a lot of variation

225
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and the clear winner is flagelliform,

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or the capture spiral filament.

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
In fact, this flagelliform fiber can

228
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
actually stretch over twice its original length.

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So silk fibers vary in their strength

230
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and also their extensibility.

231
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In the case of the capture spiral,

232
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
it needs to be so stretchy to absorb

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the impact of flying prey.

234
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
basically when an insect hit the web,

236
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it would just trampoline right off of it.

237
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So if the web was made entirely out of

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
bounce right off. But by having really, really

240
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually

241
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
able to absorb the impact

242
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
of that intercepted prey.

243
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
There's quite a bit of variation within

244
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the fibers that an individual spider can make.

245
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We call that the tool kit of a spider.

246
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
That's what the spider has

247
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to interact with their environment.

248
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But how about variation among spider

249
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
species, so looking at one type of silk

250
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and looking at different species of spiders?

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This is an area that's largely unexplored

252
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but here's a little bit of data I can show you.

253
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is the comparison of the toughness

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of the dragline spilk spun

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
by 21 species of spiders.

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.

258
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's been hypothesized that

259
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
should have the toughest dragline silks

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because they must intercept flying prey.

262
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
What you see here on this toughness graph

263
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is the higher the black dot is on the graph,

264
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the higher the toughness.

265
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The 21 species are indicated here by this

266
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows

267
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
their genetic relationships, and I've colored

268
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.

269
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
If you look right here at the two red arrows,

270
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
they point to the toughness values

271
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
for the draglines of nephila clavipes and

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
araneus diadematus.

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
These are the two species of spiders

274
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for which the vast majority of time and money

275
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
on synthetic spider silk research has been

276
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to replicate their dragline silk proteins.

277
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.

278
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey

279
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is this one right here in this white region,

280
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
a non orb-web-weaving spider.

281
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
This is the dragline spun by scytodes,

282
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the spitting spider.

283
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Scytodes doesn't use a web at all

284
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to catch prey. Instead, scytodes

285
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
sort of lurks around and waits for prey

286
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey

287
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.

288
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Think of hunting with silly string.

289
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
That's how scytodes forages.

290
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We don't really know why scytodes

291
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
needs such a tough dragline,

292
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but it's unexpected results like this that make

293
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.

294
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It frees us from the constraints

295
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
of our imagination.

296
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Now I'm going to mark on

297
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the toughness values for nylon fiber,

298
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk --

299
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.

300
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And what you can see is that nearly

301
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
all the spider draglines surpass them.

302
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's the combination of strength, extensibility

303
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and toughness that makes spider silk so

304
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
special, and that has attracted the attention

305
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
of biomimeticists, so people that turn

306
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to nature to try to find new solutions.

307
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And the strength, extensibility and toughness

308
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
of spider silks combined with the fact that

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
silks do not elicit an immune response,

310
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
have attracted a lot of interest in the use

311
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
of spider silks in biomedical applications,

312
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
for example, as a component of

313
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
artificial tendons, for serving as

314
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
guides to regrow nerves, and for

315
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
scaffolds for tissue growth.

316
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Spider silks also have a lot of potential

317
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
for their anti-ballistic capabilities.

318
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Silks could be incorporated into body

319
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and equipment armor that would be more

320
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
lightweight and flexible

321
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
than any armor available today.

322
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
In addition to these biomimetic

323
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
applications of spider silks,

324
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
personally, I find studying spider silks

325
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
just fascinating in and of itself.

326
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I love when I'm in the laboratory,

327
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
a new spider silk sequence comes in.

328
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
That's just the best. (Laughter)

329
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It's like the spiders are sharing

330
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
an ancient secret with me, and that's why

331
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I'm going to spend the rest of my life

332
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
studying spider silk.

333
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The next time you see a spider web,

334
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
please, pause and look a little closer.

335
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
You'll be seeing one of the most

336
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
high-performance materials known to man.

337
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
To borrow from the writings

338
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
of a spider named Charlotte,

339
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
silk is terrific.

340
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Thank you. (Applause)

341
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Applause)

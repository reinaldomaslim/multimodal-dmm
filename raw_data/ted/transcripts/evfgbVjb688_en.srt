1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If you really want to understand

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the problem that we're facing with the oceans,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you have to think about the biology

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at the same time you think about the physics.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We can't solve the problems

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
unless we start studying the ocean

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in a very much more interdisciplinary way.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I'm going to demonstrate that through

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We'll look at sea level rise.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We'll look at ocean warming.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification --

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
if you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
What frightens you?"

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for me, it's ocean acidification.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So I will spend a little time at the end.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was in Copenhagen in December

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
like a number of you in this room.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I think we all found it, simultaneously,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
an eye-opening

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and a very frustrating experience.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I sat in this large negotiation hall,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
at one point, for three or four hours,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
without hearing the word "oceans" one time.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It really wasn't on the radar screen.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The nations that brought it up

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
when we had the speeches of the national leaders --

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it tended to be the leaders of the small island states,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the low-lying island states.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And by this weird quirk

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of alphabetical order of the nations,

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a lot of the low-lying states,

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
like Kiribati and Nauru,

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
You know, they were marginalized

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in the negotiation room.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One of the problems

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is coming up with the right target.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's not clear what the target should be.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And how can you figure out how to fix something

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
if you don't have a clear target?

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, you've heard about "two degrees":

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But there's not a lot of science behind that number.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We've also talked about

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Should it be 450? Should it be 400?

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There's not a lot of science behind that one either.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Most of the science that is behind these numbers,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
these potential targets,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is based on studies on land.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I would say, for the people that work in the ocean

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and think about what the targets should be,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we would argue that they must be much lower.

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You know, from an oceanic perspective,

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
450 is way too high.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now there's compelling evidence

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that it really needs to be 350.

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We are, right now, at 390 parts per million

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450,

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot,

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and the discussion as we go forward

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
has to focus on how far the overshoot goes

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and what's the pathway back to 350.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, why is this so complicated?

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better?

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Well, the problem is that

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we've got very complicated forces in the climate system.

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There's air-sea interactions.

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Here in Galapagos,

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina.

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That changes our climate.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So anything that influences

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
changes the ocean of the planet.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And we know the solar output's not constant through time.

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So those are all natural causes of climate change.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And then we have the human-induced causes

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of climate change as well.

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land,

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the reflectivity.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere,

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide --

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it's methane, ozone,

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
oxides of sulfur and nitrogen.

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question.

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Is CO2 produced by man's activities

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
causing the planet to warm up?

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
But to answer that question,

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide,

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
you have to know something about

98
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
all of these other agents of change.

99
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things.

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You know, thousands of scientists

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
have been working on understanding

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
all of these man-made causes

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and the natural causes.

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And we've got it worked out, and we can say,

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
"Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now."

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now, we have many ways to study natural variability.

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I'll show you a few examples of this now.

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic.

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's a scientific drilling vessel.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to recover sediments

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that tell us stories of climate change, right.

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is to drill down in time

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to the last period

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
where we had CO2 double what it is today.

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And so that's what we've done with this ship.

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle.

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
It looks downright tropical there.

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
One day where we had calm seas and sun,

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
which was the reason I could get off the ship.

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Most of the time it looked like this.

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We had a waves up to 50 ft.

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and winds averaging

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
about 40 knots for most of the voyage

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and up to 70 or 80 knots.

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So that trip just ended,

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and I can't show you too many results from that right now,

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but we'll go back one more year,

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to another drilling expedition I've been involved in.

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's the ANDRILL project.

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And we made the very first bore hole

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to keep everybody warm,

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
drilling at temperatures of minus 40.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And we drilled in the Ross Sea.

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So, this huge floating ice shelf

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the size of Alaska

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
comes from West Antarctica.

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
where the ice is grounded on sea floor

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
as much as 2,000 meters deep.

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So that ice sheet is partly floating,

147
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat.

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.

149
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Because it's partly floating, you can imagine,

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is sea level rises a little bit,

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters.

153
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened,

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and exactly how fast that ice can melt.

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Here's the cartoon on the left there.

156
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
then through 900 meters of water

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.

159
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled.

160
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It took about 10 years to put this project together.

161
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And here's what we found.

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project,

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and people are doing all kinds of really complicated

164
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and expensive analyses.

165
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story

166
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
was this simple visual description.

167
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.

168
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We saw these alternations

169
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
between sediments that look like this --

170
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
there's gravel and cobbles in there

171
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and a bunch of sand.

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
That's the kind of material in the deep sea.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It can only get there if it's carried out by ice.

174
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So we know there's an ice shelf overhead.

175
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this.

176
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is absolutely beautiful stuff.

177
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This sediment is 100 percent made up

178
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of the shells of microscopic plants.

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And these plants need sunlight,

180
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so we know when we find that sediment

181
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
there's no ice overhead.

182
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And we saw about 35 alternations

183
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
between open water and ice-covered water,

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
between gravels and these plant sediments.

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So what that means is, what it tells us

186
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf,

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
melted back and formed anew

188
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
about 35 times.

189
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And this is in the past four million years.

190
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This was completely unexpected.

191
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet

192
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
was this dynamic.

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
In fact, the lore for many years has been,

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
"The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago,

195
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and it's been there ever since."

196
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And now we know that in our recent past

197
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it melted back and formed again,

198
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and sea level went up and down, six meters at a time.

199
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
What caused it?

200
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes

201
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica,

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth.

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But here's the key thing:

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you know, the other thing we found out

205
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
is that the ice sheet passed a threshold,

206
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that the planet warmed up enough --

207
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade --

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the planet warmed up enough that it became ...

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that ice sheet became very dynamic

210
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and was very easily melted.

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And you know what?

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We've actually changed the temperature in the last century

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
just the right amount.

214
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So many of us are convinced now

215
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt.

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We do expect to see a sea-level rise

217
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.

218
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it could be larger than that.

219
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This is a serious consequence

220
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
for nations like Kiribati,

221
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
you know, where the average elevation

222
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is about a little over a meter above sea level.

223
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Okay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos.

224
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is a bleached coral,

225
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
coral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino.

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is from Champion Island.

227
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.

228
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.

229
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
When these things die,

230
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
immediately, organisms come in

231
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and encrust and live on that dead surface.

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And so, when a coral colony is killed

233
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
by an El Nino event,

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it leaves this indelible record.

235
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You can go then and study corals

236
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and figure out how often do you see this.

237
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So one of the things thought of in the '80s

238
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
was to go back and take cores

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of coral heads throughout the Galapagos

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and find out how often was there a devastating event.

241
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And just so you know, 1982-'83,

242
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that El Nino killed 95 percent

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of all the corals here in Galapagos.

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98.

245
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And what we found

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
after drilling back in time two to 400 years

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
was that these were unique events.

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We saw no other mass mortality events.

249
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So these events in our recent past really are unique.

250
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So they're either just truly monster El Ninos,

251
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or they're just very strong El Ninos

252
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that occurred against a backdrop of global warming.

253
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Either case, it's bad news

254
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
for the corals of the Galapagos Islands.

255
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Here's how we sample the corals.

256
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster.

257
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This coral is eight meters tall, right.

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And it been growing for about 600 years.

259
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.

260
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And she was diving here with John Lauret -- I think it was 1994 --

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and collected a little nugget and sent it to me.

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And we started working on it,

263
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean

264
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
from analyzing a coral like this.

265
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So we have a diamond drill.

266
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.

267
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone.

268
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it.

269
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right.

270
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific.

271
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay.

274
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
That the place where,

275
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
during an earthquake in 1954,

276
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
this marine terrace was lifted up

277
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
out of the ocean very quickly,

278
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and it was lifted up about six to seven meters.

279
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet.

280
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
If you go on the ground there, it looks like this,

281
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and this is the grandaddy coral.

282
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's 11 meters in diameter,

283
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and we know that it started growing

284
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in the year 1584.

285
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Imagine that.

286
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters,

287
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
until 1954, when the earthquake happened.

288
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now the reason we know it's 1584

289
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is that these corals have growth bands.

290
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
When you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them,

291
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you see these light and dark bands.

292
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Each one of those is a year.

293
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year.

294
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And we just count on down to the bottom.

295
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Then their other attribute is

296
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that they have this great chemistry.

297
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We can analyze the carbonate

298
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that makes up the coral,

299
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and there's a whole bunch of things we can do.

300
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen.

301
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Their ratio tells us the water temperature.

302
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
In this example here,

303
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we had monitored this reef in Galapagos

304
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
with temperature recorders,

305
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.

306
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Then after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio,

307
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and now you can see, those curves match perfectly.

308
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
In this case, at these islands,

309
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
you know, corals

310
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water.

311
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And of course, our thermometers

312
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
only take us back 50 years or so here.

313
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
The coral can take us back

314
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
hundreds and thousands of years.

315
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So, what we do:

316
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
we've merged a lot of different data sets.

317
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this.

318
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records

319
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of temperature change that go back hundreds of years,

320
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and we put them together.

321
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Here's a synthetic diagram.

322
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
There's a whole family of curves here.

323
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years

324
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
of temperature on the planet.

325
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And there's five or six different compilations there,

326
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But each one of those compilations reflects input

327
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals.

328
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We do similar things with ice cores.

329
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We work with tree rings.

330
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And that's how we discover

331
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
what is truly natural

332
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and how different is the last century, right?

333
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And I chose this one

334
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
because it's complicated and messy looking, right.

335
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
This is as messy as it gets.

336
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
You can see there's some signals there.

337
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Some of the records

338
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
show lower temperatures than others.

339
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Some of them show greater variability.

340
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But they all tell us

341
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
what the natural variability is.

342
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere;

343
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
some are from the entire globe.

344
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But here's what we can say:

345
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.

346
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It was cooling down

347
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
until about 1900 or so.

348
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And there is natural variability

349
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
caused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos.

350
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
A century-scale, decadal-scale variability,

351
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and we know the magnitude;

352
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.

353
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But then at the very end is where

354
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
we have the instrumental record in black.

355
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And there's the temperature up there in 2009.

356
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
You know, we've warmed the globe

357
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
about a degree Centigrade in the last century,

358
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and there's nothing

359
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
in the natural part of that record

360
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that resembles what we've seen in the last century.

361
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You know, that's the strength of our argument,

362
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that we are doing something that's truly different.

363
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So I'll close with a short discussion

364
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
of ocean acidification.

365
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I like it as a component of global change to talk about,

366
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
because, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic,

367
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
and I talk to that community fairly often,

368
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
you cannot deny

369
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
the simple physics

370
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
of CO2 dissolving in the ocean.

371
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere,

372
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
from fossil fuels, from cement production.

373
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide

374
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is dissolving straight into the sea, right?

375
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And as it does so,

376
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it makes the ocean more acidic.

377
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So, you cannot argue with that.

378
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
That is what's happening right now,

379
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and it's a very different issue

380
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
than the global warming issue.

381
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It has many consequences.

382
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
There's consequences for carbonate organisms.

383
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
There are many organisms

384
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that build their shells out of calcium carbonate --

385
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
plants and animals both.

386
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The main framework material of coral reefs

387
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is calcium carbonate.

388
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
That material is more soluble

389
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
in acidic fluid.

390
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So one of the things we're seeing

391
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
is organisms are having

392
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
to spend more metabolic energy

393
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
to build and maintain their shells.

394
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
At some point, as this transience,

395
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues,

396
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that material's actually going to start to dissolve.

397
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And on coral reefs,

398
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
where some of the main framework organisms disappear,

399
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
we will see a major loss

400
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
of marine biodiversity.

401
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.

402
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
There's many physiological processes

403
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean.

404
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins

405
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.

406
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So, all of these things --

407
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
greater metabolic demands,

408
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
reduced reproductive success,

409
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
changes in respiration and metabolism.

410
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons

411
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to expect to see stressed

412
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
caused by this transience.

413
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So we figured out some pretty interesting ways

414
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere,

415
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
going back millions of years.

416
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We used to do it just with ice cores,

417
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
but in this case, we're going back 20 million years.

418
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
And we take samples of the sediment,

419
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean,

420
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere.

421
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And here's the thing:

422
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
you have to go back about 15 million years

423
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to find a time when CO2 levels

424
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
were about what they are today.

425
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
You have to go back about 30 million years

426
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
to find a time when CO2 levels

427
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
were double what they are today.

428
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Now, what that means is

429
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
that all of the organisms that live in the sea

430
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
have evolved in this chemostatted ocean,

431
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
with CO2 levels lower than they are today.

432
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt

433
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to this rapid acidification

434
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
that's going on right now.

435
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
So, Charlie Veron

436
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
came up with this statement last year:

437
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
"The prospect of ocean acidification

438
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
may well be the most serious

439
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
of all of the predicted outcomes

440
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
of anthropogenic CO2 release."

441
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And I think that may very well be true,

442
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
so I'll close with this.

443
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely,

444
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
but for the sake of the oceans,

445
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions

446
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
as soon as possible.

447
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Thank you very much.

448
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
(Applause)

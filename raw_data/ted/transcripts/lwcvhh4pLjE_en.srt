1
0:00:12.924,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Tiq Milan: Our first conversation was on Facebook,

2
0:00:15.283,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and it was three days long.

3
0:00:17.257,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:19.127,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We shared over 3,000 messages between us,

5
0:00:21.861,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it was during those 72 hours that I knew she was going to be my wife.

6
0:00:26.068,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We didn't wait any prerequisite amount of time for our courtship;

7
0:00:29.258,000 --> 0:00:31,000
we told each other the vulnerable truths up front:

8
0:00:32.167,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I am a transgender man,

9
0:00:33.905,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which means the F on my birth certificate should have stood for "False,"

10
0:00:37.339,000 --> 0:00:38,000
instead of "Female."

11
0:00:38.543,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:39.902,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Walking around as a woman in the world

13
0:00:41.81,000 --> 0:00:43,000
felt like walking with pebbles in my shoes.

14
0:00:44.156,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It took the rhythm out of my swagger,

15
0:00:46.271,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it threw me off balance,

16
0:00:47.555,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it pained me with every step I took forward.

17
0:00:49.688,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But today I'm a man of my own intention;

18
0:00:52.316,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a man of my own design.

19
0:00:54.67,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Kim Katrin Milan: I am a cisgender queer woman.

20
0:00:57.03,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Cisgender means the gender I was assigned at birth

21
0:00:59.822,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is still and has always been female.

22
0:01:02.574,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This doesn't make me natural or normal,

23
0:01:05.079,000 --> 0:01:07,000
this is just one way of describing the many different ways

24
0:01:08.039,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we exist in this world.

25
0:01:10.155,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And queer is a cultural term,

26
0:01:12.008,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but in this case,

27
0:01:13.229,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it refers to the way that I'm not restricted by gender

28
0:01:15.876,000 --> 0:01:16,000
when it comes to choosing partners.

29
0:01:17.605,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I've identified in a few different ways --

30
0:01:19.66,000 --> 0:01:2,000
as a bisexual, as a lesbian --

31
0:01:21.294,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but for me,

32
0:01:22.395,000 --> 0:01:26,000
queerness encompasses all of the layers of who I am and how I've loved.

33
0:01:27.617,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm layers, and not fractions.

34
0:01:30.198,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And for me,

35
0:01:31.373,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the fact that he was queer

36
0:01:32.73,000 --> 0:01:35,000
meant that I could trust his courtship from the very beginning.

37
0:01:36.136,000 --> 0:01:37,000
As queer and trans people,

38
0:01:37.798,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we're so often excluded from institutions and traditions.

39
0:01:41.769,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We create spaces outside of convention,

40
0:01:44.767,000 --> 0:01:46,000
including the conventions of time.

41
0:01:46.903,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And in those 3,000 messages between us,

42
0:01:49.98,000 --> 0:01:5,000
we collapsed time;

43
0:01:51.242,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we queered it;

44
0:01:52.425,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we laid it all on the table.

45
0:01:54.211,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

46
0:01:55.271,000 --> 0:01:56,000
With no pretense at all.

47
0:01:57.513,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And this meant that we were able to commit to each other

48
0:02:00.336,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in a profoundly different way.

49
0:02:02.496,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So often what we're told is this idea of the "Golden Rule,"

50
0:02:06.588,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that we should treat other people the way we want to be treated.

51
0:02:10.053,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But the problem with that

52
0:02:11.433,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is that it assumes that we are the standard for other people,

53
0:02:14.688,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and we're not.

54
0:02:15.932,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We need to treat other people the way they want to be treated,

55
0:02:19.446,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which means we had to ask.

56
0:02:21.239,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I couldn't assume that the kind of love that Tiq needed

57
0:02:23.926,000 --> 0:02:24,000
was the same kind of love that I needed.

58
0:02:25.912,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So I asked him everything -- about his fears, his insecurities --

59
0:02:30.104,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and we started from there.

60
0:02:31.919,000 --> 0:02:33,000
TM: I didn't know what kind of love I needed.

61
0:02:34.196,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I had just come out of a year-long fog

62
0:02:36.42,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of being rejected and utterly depleted.

63
0:02:38.983,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I had someone look me in my eyes

64
0:02:40.835,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and tell me that I was unworthy of their love because I was trans.

65
0:02:44.811,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And there's a culture of lovelessness

66
0:02:46.62,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that we've created around transgender people.

67
0:02:48.776,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's reasoned, justified and often signed into law.

68
0:02:51.752,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I was a heartbeat away from internalizing that message,

69
0:02:54.791,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that I wasn't worthy.

70
0:02:56.357,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But Kim said that I was her ideal --

71
0:02:58.149,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the heartbroken mess that I was.

72
0:02:59.778,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:01.349,000 --> 0:03:02,000
KKM: He totally was my ideal.

74
0:03:03.03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:04.166,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In more ways than one.

76
0:03:05.869,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Both poets, writers, creatives

77
0:03:08.27,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with a long history of community work behind us,

78
0:03:10.775,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and big, huge dreams of a family in front of us,

79
0:03:13.982,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we shared a lot of things in common,

80
0:03:15.738,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but we were also incredibly different.

81
0:03:17.606,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I've been a lifelong traveler and a bit of an orphan,

82
0:03:20.202,000 --> 0:03:22,000
whereas he comes from a huge family,

83
0:03:22.368,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and definitely stays grounded.

84
0:03:24.533,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I often kind of sum up the differences in our strengths

85
0:03:27.308,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by saying, "Keep me safe,

86
0:03:28.89,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I'll keep you wild."

87
0:03:30.354,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:34.804,000 --> 0:03:37,000
TM: We have marginalized identities but we don't live marginalized lives.

89
0:03:39.09,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Being queer and trans is about creating new ways of existing.

90
0:03:42.914,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's about loving people as they are,

91
0:03:44.721,000 --> 0:03:45,000
not as they're supposed to be.

92
0:03:46.597,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Kim is unapologetically feminine

93
0:03:48.598,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in a world that is often cruel and violent

94
0:03:51.44,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to women who are too proud and too freeing.

95
0:03:53.747,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I didn't enter into this union

96
0:03:55.392,000 --> 0:03:58,000
under the auspices that she was going to be my helper or my rib,

97
0:03:58.921,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but a fully complex --

98
0:04:00.687,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:01.726,000 --> 0:04:03,000
KKM: Right? That's not right.

100
0:04:04.044,000 --> 0:04:05,000
TM: But a fully complex human being

101
0:04:05.764,000 --> 0:04:08,000
whose femininity wasn't for me to rein in, control or critique.

102
0:04:09.397,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's her brilliance,

103
0:04:10.943,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the way she leads with compassion,

104
0:04:12.611,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and how she never loses sight of her empathy.

105
0:04:14.78,000 --> 0:04:16,000
She has been my hero since day one.

106
0:04:18.987,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Applause)

107
0:04:21.625,000 --> 0:04:24,000
KKM: Our relationship has always been about setting each other free.

108
0:04:25.327,000 --> 0:04:26,000
One of the first questions I asked him

109
0:04:27.184,000 --> 0:04:29,000
was what dreams he had left to accomplish,

110
0:04:29.379,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and how would I help him get there.

111
0:04:31.463,000 --> 0:04:32,000
His dreams to live as a poet,

112
0:04:33.431,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to adopt and raise a family together,

113
0:04:35.645,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to live a life that he was proud of,

114
0:04:37.385,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and one that would live up to his mother's incredible legacy.

115
0:04:41.212,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I really appreciated that we were able to start from that place,

116
0:04:44.621,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and not from a place that was around figuring out

117
0:04:47.551,000 --> 0:04:49,000
how to make each other work together.

118
0:04:49.72,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I think this really allowed us to grow into the people that we were

119
0:04:53.317,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in a way that was incredibly different.

120
0:04:55.573,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I love him whole;

121
0:04:57.382,000 --> 0:04:59,000
pre-transition, now and in the future.

122
0:04:59.829,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And it's this love that had us committed to each other

123
0:05:02.645,000 --> 0:05:04,000
before we'd even seen each other's faces.

124
0:05:06.797,000 --> 0:05:08,000
TM: My mother's biggest concern when I transitioned

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
was who was going to love me as I am.

126
0:05:11.735,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Had being transgender somehow precluded me from love and monogamy

127
0:05:17.755,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because I was supposedly born in the wrong body?

128
0:05:20.704,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But it's this type of structuring that has to be reframed

129
0:05:23.903,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in order to let love in.

130
0:05:25.579,000 --> 0:05:26,000
My body never betrayed me,

131
0:05:27.496,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and my body was never wrong.

132
0:05:29.208,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's this restrictive, binary thinking on gender

133
0:05:32.53,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that said that I didn't exist.

134
0:05:34.368,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But when we met,

135
0:05:35.693,000 --> 0:05:37,000
she loved me for exactly how I showed up.

136
0:05:38.17,000 --> 0:05:4,000
She would trace her fingers along the numb keloid scars

137
0:05:41.145,000 --> 0:05:42,000
left by my top surgery.

138
0:05:42.905,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Scars that run from the middle of my chest all the way out to my outer torso.

139
0:05:46.945,000 --> 0:05:48,000
She said that these were reminders of my strength

140
0:05:49.719,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and everything that I went through

141
0:05:51.424,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and nothing for me to be ashamed of.

142
0:05:53.226,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So sprinting towards her hand in marriage

143
0:05:55.258,000 --> 0:05:56,000
was the queerest thing that I could do.

144
0:05:57.208,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

145
0:05:59.993,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It flew in the face of more conventional trajectories

146
0:06:02.791,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of love and relationships,

147
0:06:04.647,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because God was never supposed to bless a union for folks like us,

148
0:06:07.817,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and the law was never supposed to recognize it.

149
0:06:10.557,000 --> 0:06:13,000
KKM: So on May 5, 2014,

150
0:06:14.072,000 --> 0:06:17,000
just about three months after meeting online,

151
0:06:17.177,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we were married on the steps of City Hall in Manhattan,

152
0:06:21.781,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and it was beautiful in every conceivable way.

153
0:06:25.817,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's safe to say that we reimagined some traditions,

154
0:06:29.128,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but we also kept some old ones that we worked in,

155
0:06:31.966,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we created something that worked for us.

156
0:06:34.101,000 --> 0:06:39,000
My bouquet and corsage was actually filled with wildflowers from Brooklyn --

157
0:06:39.425,000 --> 0:06:43,000
also added in a little bit of lavender and sage to keep us grounded

158
0:06:43.558,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because we were so nervous.

159
0:06:45.289,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And it was put together by a sweet sister healer friend of ours.

160
0:06:48.843,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I never wanted a diamond ring,

161
0:06:50.506,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because conflict and convention are not my thing,

162
0:06:52.998,000 --> 0:06:53,000
so my ring is the deepest purple,

163
0:06:54.827,000 --> 0:06:55,000
like the color of my crown chakra,

164
0:06:56.495,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and set in place with my birthstones.

165
0:06:59.133,000 --> 0:07:,000
The gift of queerness is options.

166
0:07:01.545,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I never had to choose his last name,

167
0:07:03.285,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it was never an exception,

168
0:07:04.931,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but I did because I am my father's bastard child,

169
0:07:08.284,000 --> 0:07:12,000
someone who has always been an apology, a secret, an imposition.

170
0:07:12.31,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And it was incredibly freeing

171
0:07:14.387,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to choose the name of a man who chose me first.

172
0:07:17.963,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Applause)

173
0:07:24.931,000 --> 0:07:27,000
TM: So we told some family and some close friends,

174
0:07:27.999,000 --> 0:07:3,000
many of whom were still in disbelief as we took our vows.

175
0:07:32.026,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding photos on Facebook,

176
0:07:35.139,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where we met --

177
0:07:36.364,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and Instagram, of course.

178
0:07:38.642,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And we quickly realized

179
0:07:40.198,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that our coming together was more than just a union of two people,

180
0:07:43.42,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but was a model of possibility for the millions of LGBTQ folks

181
0:07:47.426,000 --> 0:07:48,000
who have been sold this lie

182
0:07:48.779,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that family and matrimony is antithetical to who they are --

183
0:07:51.732,000 --> 0:07:53,000
for those of us who rarely get to see ourselves

184
0:07:54.486,000 --> 0:07:55,000
reflected in love and happiness.

185
0:07:56.438,000 --> 0:07:57,000
KKM: And the thing is,

186
0:07:57.613,000 --> 0:07:59,000
absolutely we are marginalized because of our identities,

187
0:08:00.359,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but it also emboldens us to be the people that we are.

188
0:08:04.049,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Queerness is our major key;

189
0:08:05.973,000 --> 0:08:06,000
blackness is our magic.

190
0:08:07.899,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's because of these things

191
0:08:09.519,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that we are able to be hopeful, open, receptive and shape-shifting.

192
0:08:14.726,000 --> 0:08:15,000
These are the things that give us,

193
0:08:16.523,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and are such an incredible source of, our strength.

194
0:08:19.159,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Our queerness is a source of that strength.

195
0:08:21.451,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I think of the words of Ottawa-based poet Brandon Wint:

196
0:08:25.054,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Not queer like gay; queer like escaping definition.

197
0:08:29.19,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Queer like some sort of fluidity and limitlessness all at once.

198
0:08:33.72,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Queer like a freedom too strange to be conquered.

199
0:08:36.722,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Queer like the fearlessness to imagine what love can look like,

200
0:08:40.013,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and to pursue it."

201
0:08:42.114,000 --> 0:08:44,000
TM: We are part of a community of folks --

202
0:08:44.417,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Yeah, that's good right?

203
0:08:45.613,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

204
0:08:48.843,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We are part of a community of folks who are living their authentic selves

205
0:08:52.657,000 --> 0:08:54,000
all along the gender spectrum,

206
0:08:54.696,000 --> 0:08:56,000
despite the ubiquitous threat of violence,

207
0:08:57.224,000 --> 0:09:,000
despite the undercurrent of anxiety that always is present

208
0:09:00.281,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for people who live on their own terms.

209
0:09:02.573,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Globally, a transgender person is murdered every 21 hours.

210
0:09:07.153,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And the United States has had more trans murders on record this year

211
0:09:13.776,000 --> 0:09:14,000
than any year to date.

212
0:09:15.217,000 --> 0:09:19,000
However, our stories are much more than this rigid dichotomy

213
0:09:19.306,000 --> 0:09:2,000
of strength and resilience.

214
0:09:20.782,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We are expanding the human complexity on these margins,

215
0:09:24.923,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and we are creating freedom on these margins.

216
0:09:28.288,000 --> 0:09:3,000
KKM: And we don't have any blueprints.

217
0:09:30.508,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We're creating a world that we have literally never seen before;

218
0:09:34.386,000 --> 0:09:37,000
organizing families based on love and not by blood,

219
0:09:38.031,000 --> 0:09:41,000
guiding by a compassion that so few of us have been shown ourselves.

220
0:09:42.493,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So many of us have not received love from our families --

221
0:09:46.531,000 --> 0:09:48,000
have been betrayed by the people that we trust most.

222
0:09:49.67,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So what we do here is we create entirely new languages of love.

223
0:09:54.477,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Ones that are about creating the space for us to be our authentic selves

224
0:09:58.898,000 --> 0:10:,000
and not imposing this standard

225
0:10:00.968,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of what masculinity or femininity is supposed to be.

226
0:10:04.719,000 --> 0:10:06,000
TM: We are interested in love and inclusion

227
0:10:07.039,000 --> 0:10:09,000
as a tool of revolutionary change, right?

228
0:10:10.12,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And the idea is simply,

229
0:10:11.778,000 --> 0:10:13,000
if we drop all our preconceived notions

230
0:10:13.928,000 --> 0:10:15,000
about how somebody is supposed to be --

231
0:10:16.012,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in their body, in their gender, in their skin --

232
0:10:19.211,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if we take the intentional steps to unlearn these deep-seated biases

233
0:10:22.991,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and create space for people to be self-determined,

234
0:10:25.607,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and embrace who they are,

235
0:10:26.959,000 --> 0:10:29,000
then we will definitely create a better world than the one we were born into.

236
0:10:30.754,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Applause)

237
0:10:37.954,000 --> 0:10:39,000
KKM: We want to mark this time in history

238
0:10:39.98,000 --> 0:10:41,000
by leaving evidence of the fact that we were here.

239
0:10:43.134,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We open up little windows into our relationship

240
0:10:46.156,000 --> 0:10:47,000
for our community to bear witness,

241
0:10:47.853,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and we do this because we want to make maps to the future

242
0:10:50.904,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and not monuments to ourselves.

243
0:10:53.475,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Our experience does not invalidate other peoples' experience,

244
0:10:57.277,000 --> 0:11:,000
but it should and necessarily does complicate this idea

245
0:11:00.881,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of what love and marriage are supposed to be.

246
0:11:04.691,000 --> 0:11:05,000
TM: OK, now for all the talking,

247
0:11:06.691,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and inspiring,

248
0:11:08.155,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and possibility-modeling we've done,

249
0:11:09.911,000 --> 0:11:1,000
we've been nowhere near perfect.

250
0:11:11.66,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And we've had to hold a mirror up to ourselves.

251
0:11:14.32,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And I saw that I wasn't always the best listener,

252
0:11:17.159,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and that my ego got in the way of our progress as a couple.

253
0:11:20.468,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And I've had to really assess these deep-seated, sexist ideas

254
0:11:23.86,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that I've had about the value of a woman's experience in the world.

255
0:11:27.185,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I've had to reevaluate what it means to be in allyship with my wife.

256
0:11:31.61,000 --> 0:11:34,000
KKM: And I had to remind myself of a lot of things, too.

257
0:11:34.819,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What it means to be hard on the issues,

258
0:11:36.827,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but soft on the person.

259
0:11:38.603,000 --> 0:11:41,000
While we were writing this, we got into a massive fight.

260
0:11:42.459,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Laughter)

261
0:11:45.806,000 --> 0:11:46,000
For so many different reasons,

262
0:11:47.748,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but based on the content about our values and our lived experiences --

263
0:11:52.103,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and we were really hurt, you know?

264
0:11:53.875,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Because what we do and how we love puts ourselves entirely on the line.

265
0:11:59.489,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But even though the fight lasted over the course of two days --

266
0:12:02.952,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

267
0:12:04.265,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We were able to come back together to each other,

268
0:12:07.108,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and recommit to ourselves, to each other and to our marriage.

269
0:12:11.285,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And that really yielded some of the most passionate parts

270
0:12:14.03,000 --> 0:12:15,000
of what we share with you here today.

271
0:12:16.444,000 --> 0:12:18,000
TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,

272
0:12:18.7,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which I think doesn't happen enough.

273
0:12:20.924,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I've had to interrogate masculinity;

274
0:12:23.138,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the toxic privileges that come with being a man don't define me,

275
0:12:26.654,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but I have to be accountable for how it shows up in my life every day.

276
0:12:30.484,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I have allowed my wife to do all of the emotional labor

277
0:12:33.875,000 --> 0:12:37,000
of prying open the lines of communication when I'd rather clam up and run away.

278
0:12:38.137,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

279
0:12:39.288,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I've stripped away emotional support instead of facing my own vulnerabilities,

280
0:12:43.561,000 --> 0:12:46,000
particularly around the heartbreaking miscarriage we suffered last year,

281
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and I'm sorry for that.

282
0:12:48.888,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Sometimes as men, we get to take the easy way out.

283
0:12:51.77,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And so my journey as a trans person is about reimagining masculinity.

284
0:12:56.838,000 --> 0:12:58,000
About creating a manhood that isn't measured

285
0:12:59.377,000 --> 0:13:02,000
by the power it wields, by the entitlements afforded to it,

286
0:13:02.945,000 --> 0:13:04,000
or any simulacrum of control that it can muster,

287
0:13:05.474,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but works in tandem with femininity,

288
0:13:07.316,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and is guided by my spirit.

289
0:13:10.924,000 --> 0:13:11,000
KKM: Y'all ...

290
0:13:12.099,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Applause)

291
0:13:16.033,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And this has created the space for my femininity to flourish

292
0:13:19.935,000 --> 0:13:22,000
in a way I had never experienced before.

293
0:13:24.042,000 --> 0:13:27,000
He never is threatened by my sexuality,

294
0:13:27.716,000 --> 0:13:3,000
he never polices what I wear or how I act.

295
0:13:31.696,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I cook but he does way more of the cleaning than I do.

296
0:13:34.914,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And when we're rushing to get out of the house

297
0:13:37.13,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and we have so much to handle,

298
0:13:38.656,000 --> 0:13:39,000
he handles everything,

299
0:13:40.273,000 --> 0:13:42,000
so I have time to do my hair and makeup.

300
0:13:42.484,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Laughter)

301
0:13:44.279,000 --> 0:13:46,000
He understands that this is my armor,

302
0:13:46.754,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and he never treats femininity as though it is frivolous or superficial,

303
0:13:51.287,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and this, and him --

304
0:13:53.127,000 --> 0:13:56,000
he grows my experience of gender every single day.

305
0:13:56.81,000 --> 0:13:58,000
TM: I love to watch her get dressed in the morning.

306
0:13:59.895,000 --> 0:14:,000
Watching her in the closet,

307
0:14:01.261,000 --> 0:14:03,000
looking for something comfortable and colorful, and tight,

308
0:14:04.17,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and safe --

309
0:14:05.626,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter)

310
0:14:07.093,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But it's challenging to watch her negotiate her decisions

311
0:14:09.911,000 --> 0:14:12,000
looking for something that's going to get the least amount of attention,

312
0:14:13.423,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but at the same time be an expression of the vibrant and sexy woman she is.

313
0:14:17.068,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And all I want to do is celebrate her for her beauty,

314
0:14:19.83,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and the things that make her beautiful and special and free,

315
0:14:22.751,000 --> 0:14:23,000
from her long acrylic nails,

316
0:14:24.226,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to her uncompromising black feminism.

317
0:14:26.27,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Applause)

318
0:14:31.315,000 --> 0:14:32,000
KKM: I love you. TM: I love you.

319
0:14:32.99,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Laughter)

320
0:14:34.788,000 --> 0:14:36,000
KKM: There are so many queer and trans people

321
0:14:37.056,000 --> 0:14:38,000
who have come before us,

322
0:14:38.473,000 --> 0:14:4,000
whose stories we will never get to hear.

323
0:14:41.547,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We constantly experience this retelling of history

324
0:14:44.847,000 --> 0:14:46,000
where we are conspicuously left out.

325
0:14:47.527,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And it's really hard to not see ourselves there.

326
0:14:50.891,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And so living out loud for us is about that representation.

327
0:14:54.798,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It's about having possibility models,

328
0:14:57.141,000 --> 0:15:,000
and having hope that love is part of our inheritance in this world, too.

329
0:15:01.792,000 --> 0:15:03,000
TM: The possibility that we are practicing

330
0:15:03.822,000 --> 0:15:05,000
is about reinventing time, love and institutions.

331
0:15:07.093,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We are creating a future of multiplicity.

332
0:15:09.724,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We are expanding the spectrum of gender and sexuality,

333
0:15:12.823,000 --> 0:15:13,000
imagining ourselves into existence,

334
0:15:15.167,000 --> 0:15:18,000
imagining a world where gender is self-determined and not imposed,

335
0:15:18.795,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and where who we are is a kaleidoscope of possibility

336
0:15:21.736,000 --> 0:15:25,000
without the narrow-minded limitations masquerading as science or justice.

337
0:15:27.193,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Applause)

338
0:15:31.84,000 --> 0:15:32,000
KKM: And I can't lie:

339
0:15:33.209,000 --> 0:15:35,000
it is really, really hard.

340
0:15:35.643,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry

341
0:15:38.36,000 --> 0:15:4,000
with an open heart and a smile on my face.

342
0:15:40.749,000 --> 0:15:43,000
It is really hard to face the injustice that exists in the world,

343
0:15:44.004,000 --> 0:15:48,000
while still believing in the ability of people to really change.

344
0:15:48.591,000 --> 0:15:51,000
That takes an enormous amount of faith and dedication.

345
0:15:52.058,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And beyond that,

346
0:15:53.368,000 --> 0:15:55,000
marriage is hard work.

347
0:15:55.501,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Laughter)

348
0:15:56.676,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Piles of dirty socks on the floor,

349
0:15:59.268,000 --> 0:16:02,000
more boring sports shows than I ever thought possible --

350
0:16:03.053,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Laughter)

351
0:16:04.743,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And fights that bring me to tears

352
0:16:06.511,000 --> 0:16:08,000
when it feels like we're not speaking the same language.

353
0:16:09.4,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But there is not a day that goes by

354
0:16:11.543,000 --> 0:16:14,000
where I am not so grateful to be married to this man;

355
0:16:14.8,000 --> 0:16:17,000
where I'm not so grateful for the possibility of changing minds,

356
0:16:18.65,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and rewarding conversations,

357
0:16:20.216,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and creating a world where love belongs to us all.

358
0:16:23.658,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I think about our acronym:

359
0:16:25.139,000 --> 0:16:28,000
LGBTQ2SIA.

360
0:16:31.145,000 --> 0:16:34,000
A seemingly endless evolution of self and a community,

361
0:16:34.822,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but also this really deep desire not to leave anyone behind.

362
0:16:39.525,000 --> 0:16:4,000
We've learned how to love each other,

363
0:16:41.411,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and we've committed to loving each other throughout changes to gender

364
0:16:45.274,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and changes in spirit.

365
0:16:47.319,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And we learned this love in our chat rooms,

366
0:16:49.966,000 --> 0:16:52,000
in our clubs, in our bars and in our community centers.

367
0:16:53.67,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We've learned how to love each other for the long haul.

368
0:16:56.932,000 --> 0:16:57,000
TM & KKM: Thank you.

369
0:16:58.128,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Applause)

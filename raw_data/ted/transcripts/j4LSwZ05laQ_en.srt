1
0:00:13.396,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The creative process -- you know this --

2
0:00:15.596,000 --> 0:00:17,000
from the first idea to the final product,

3
0:00:17.831,000 --> 0:00:18,000
is a long process.

4
0:00:19.648,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's super-iterative, lots of refinement,

5
0:00:22.411,000 --> 0:00:24,000
blood, sweat, tears and years.

6
0:00:24.508,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And we're not saying you're going to go out for a walk

7
0:00:27.091,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and come back with the Sistine Chapel in your left hand.

8
0:00:29.806,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So what frame of the creative process did we focus on?

9
0:00:32.518,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Just this first part.

10
0:00:34.008,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Just brainstorming, coming up with a new idea.

11
0:00:38.178,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We actually ran four studies with a variety of people.

12
0:00:42.008,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You were either walking indoors or outdoors.

13
0:00:44.45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And all of these studies found the same conclusion.

14
0:00:48.062,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm only going to tell you about one of them today.

15
0:00:51.156,000 --> 0:00:55,000
One of the tests we used for creativity was alternate uses.

16
0:00:55.345,000 --> 0:00:56,000
In this test, you have four minutes.

17
0:00:57.104,000 --> 0:01:,000
Your job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects

18
0:01:01.005,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as you can think of.

19
0:01:02.24,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So, for example, what else would you do with a key,

20
0:01:05.176,000 --> 0:01:07,000
other than to use it for opening up a lock?

21
0:01:08.238,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Clearly, you could use it as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right?

22
0:01:12.839,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Maybe. That's sort of interesting, kind of new. But is it creative?

23
0:01:17.765,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So people came up with as many ideas as they could,

24
0:01:20.476,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and we had to decide:

25
0:01:21.665,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Is this creative or not?

26
0:01:24.849,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The definition of creativity that a lot of people go with

27
0:01:27.747,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is "appropriate novelty."

28
0:01:29.416,000 --> 0:01:32,000
For something to be appropriate, it has to be realistic,

29
0:01:32.511,000 --> 0:01:35,000
so unfortunately, you can't use a key as an eyeball.

30
0:01:36.4,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Boo!

31
0:01:37.592,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But "novel," the second thing, is that nobody had to have said it.

32
0:01:42.463,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So for us, it had to be appropriate first,

33
0:01:45.391,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and then for novelty,

34
0:01:46.958,000 --> 0:01:49,000
nobody else in the entire population that we surveyed could have said it.

35
0:01:50.767,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So you might think you could use a key to scratch somebody's car,

36
0:01:54.49,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but if somebody else said that, you didn't get credit for it.

37
0:01:57.429,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Neither of you did.

38
0:01:58.628,000 --> 0:02:,000
However, only one person said this:

39
0:02:02.592,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"If you were dying and it were a murder mystery,

40
0:02:05.498,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and you had to carve the name of the murderer into the ground

41
0:02:08.516,000 --> 0:02:09,000
with your dying words."

42
0:02:10.127,000 --> 0:02:11,000
One person said this.

43
0:02:11.834,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:12.959,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And it's a creative idea, because it's appropriate and it's novel.

45
0:02:16.268,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You either did this test and came up with ideas while you were seated

46
0:02:19.696,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or while you were walking on a treadmill.

47
0:02:22.272,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:24.185,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They did the test twice, with different objects.

49
0:02:26.964,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Three groups: the first group sat first

50
0:02:30.071,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and then sat again for the second test.

51
0:02:32.938,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The second group sat first

52
0:02:35.52,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and then did the second test while walking on a treadmill.

53
0:02:38.887,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The third group -- and this is interesting --

54
0:02:41.06,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they walked on the treadmill first, and then they sat.

55
0:02:44.762,000 --> 0:02:47,000
OK, so the two groups that sat together for the first test,

56
0:02:48.544,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they looked pretty similar to each other,

57
0:02:50.629,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and they averaged about 20 creative ideas per person.

58
0:02:54.157,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The group that was walking on the treadmill

59
0:02:56.598,000 --> 0:02:57,000
did almost twice as well.

60
0:02:59.071,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And they were just walking on a treadmill in a windowless room.

61
0:03:04.556,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Remember, they took the test twice.

62
0:03:06.812,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The people who sat twice for that second test didn't get any better;

63
0:03:10.53,000 --> 0:03:11,000
practice didn't help.

64
0:03:12.313,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But these same people who were sitting and then went on the treadmill

65
0:03:15.672,000 --> 0:03:16,000
got a boost from walking.

66
0:03:17.325,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Here's the interesting thing.

67
0:03:19.565,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The people who were walking on the treadmill

68
0:03:21.647,000 --> 0:03:23,000
still had a residue effect of the walking,

69
0:03:24.432,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and they were still creative afterwards.

70
0:03:26.362,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So the implication of this is that you should go for a walk

71
0:03:29.511,000 --> 0:03:32,000
before your next big meeting and just start brainstorming right away.

72
0:03:34.673,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We have five tips for you

73
0:03:36.209,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that will help make this the best effect possible.

74
0:03:39.992,000 --> 0:03:43,000
First, you want to pick a problem or a topic to brainstorm.

75
0:03:44.536,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So, this is not the shower effect,

76
0:03:46.669,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when you're in the shower and all of a sudden,

77
0:03:48.885,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a new idea pops out of the shampoo bottle.

78
0:03:50.948,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is something you're thinking about ahead of time.

79
0:03:53.551,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They're intentionally thinking about brainstorming a different perspective

80
0:03:57.138,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on the walk.

81
0:03:58.492,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Secondly -- I get asked this a lot:

82
0:04:00.382,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Is this OK while running?

83
0:04:02.377,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, the answer for me is that if I were running,

84
0:04:05.219,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the only new idea I would have would be to stop running, so ...

85
0:04:09.569,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:10.885,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But if running for you is a comfortable pace, good.

87
0:04:14.03,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It turns out, whatever physical activity is not taking a lot of attention.

88
0:04:18.612,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So just walking at a comfortable pace is a good choice.

89
0:04:22.576,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Also, you want to come up with as many ideas as you can.

90
0:04:25.366,000 --> 0:04:28,000
One key of creativity is to not lock on that first idea.

91
0:04:28.838,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Keep going.

92
0:04:30.113,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Keep coming up with new ones, until you pick one or two to pursue.

93
0:04:35.007,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You might worry that you don't want to write them down,

94
0:04:38.128,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because what if you forget them?

95
0:04:39.987,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So the idea here is to speak them.

96
0:04:41.896,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Everybody was speaking their new ideas.

97
0:04:43.872,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So you can put your headphones on and record through your phone

98
0:04:47.636,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then just pretend you're having a creative conversation, right?

99
0:04:50.923,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Because the act of writing your idea down is already a filter.

100
0:04:54.009,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You're going to be like, "Is this good enough to write down?"

101
0:04:56.977,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And then you write it down.

102
0:04:58.328,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So just speak as many as you can, record them and think about them later.

103
0:05:01.912,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And finally: don't do this forever. Right?

104
0:05:04.378,000 --> 0:05:06,000
If you're on the walk and that idea's not coming to you,

105
0:05:07.288,000 --> 0:05:09,000
come back to it later at another time.

106
0:05:10.349,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I think we're coming up on a break right now,

107
0:05:12.865,000 --> 0:05:13,000
so I have an idea:

108
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Why don't you grab a leash

109
0:05:16.064,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and take your thoughts for a walk?

110
0:05:19.775,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Thank you.

111
0:05:20.961,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.252,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Looking deeply inside nature,

2
0:00:15.982,000 --> 0:00:18,000
through the magnifying glass of science,

3
0:00:19.095,000 --> 0:00:22,000
designers extract principles, processes and materials

4
0:00:22.7,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that are forming the very basis of design methodology.

5
0:00:27.252,000 --> 0:00:32,000
From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials,

6
0:00:32.352,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to computational methods that emulate neural processes,

7
0:00:35.743,000 --> 0:00:37,000
nature is driving design.

8
0:00:39.398,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Design is also driving nature.

9
0:00:42.128,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In realms of genetics, regenerative medicine and synthetic biology,

10
0:00:45.887,000 --> 0:00:47,000
designers are growing novel technologies,

11
0:00:48.616,000 --> 0:00:51,000
not foreseen or anticipated by nature.

12
0:00:53.14,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design.

13
0:00:59.107,000 --> 0:01:01,000
As you can see, my legs are bionic.

14
0:01:02.99,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Today, I will tell human stories of bionic integration;

15
0:01:08.538,000 --> 0:01:13,000
how electromechanics attached to the body, and implanted inside the body

16
0:01:14.261,000 --> 0:01:18,000
are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability,

17
0:01:18.999,000 --> 0:01:22,000
between human limitation and human potential.

18
0:01:24.681,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Bionics has defined my physicality.

19
0:01:28.228,000 --> 0:01:3,000
In 1982, both of my legs were amputated

20
0:01:30.704,000 --> 0:01:32,000
due to tissue damage from frostbite,

21
0:01:32.832,000 --> 0:01:34,000
incurred during a mountain-climbing accident.

22
0:01:35.95,000 --> 0:01:38,000
At that time, I didn't view my body as broken.

23
0:01:40.417,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I reasoned that a human being can never be "broken."

24
0:01:45.655,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Technology is broken.

25
0:01:48.409,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Technology is inadequate.

26
0:01:51.638,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms,

27
0:01:56.12,000 --> 0:02:,000
to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability,

28
0:02:00.651,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and ultimately, the disability of others.

29
0:02:04.46,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I began by developing specialized limbs

30
0:02:07.442,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that allowed me to return to the vertical world

31
0:02:09.927,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of rock and ice climbing.

32
0:02:11.418,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable;

33
0:02:16.06,000 --> 0:02:2,000
able to take on any form, any function --

34
0:02:20.434,000 --> 0:02:22,000
a blank slate for which to create,

35
0:02:23.397,000 --> 0:02:28,000
perhaps, structures that could extend beyond biological capability.

36
0:02:29.391,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I made my height adjustable.

37
0:02:30.765,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like.

38
0:02:33.469,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:35.922,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So when I was feeling bad about myself,

40
0:02:39.296,000 --> 0:02:4,000
insecure, I would jack my height up.

41
0:02:41.157,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:43.062,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But when I was feeling confident and suave,

43
0:02:45.283,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I would knock my height down a notch, just to give the competition a chance.

44
0:02:49.076,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:51.195,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Applause)

46
0:02:53.322,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Narrow-edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures,

47
0:02:56.615,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where the human foot cannot penetrate,

48
0:02:59.241,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls,

49
0:03:03.447,000 --> 0:03:05,000
without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue.

50
0:03:07.399,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Through technological innovation,

51
0:03:09.613,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I returned to my sport, stronger and better.

52
0:03:12.478,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Technology had eliminated my disability,

53
0:03:15.085,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and allowed me a new climbing prowess.

54
0:03:17.451,000 --> 0:03:2,000
As a young man, I imagined a future world where technology so advanced

55
0:03:21.038,000 --> 0:03:22,000
could rid the world of disability,

56
0:03:22.844,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a world in which neural implants would allow

57
0:03:24.964,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the visually impaired to see.

58
0:03:27.026,000 --> 0:03:31,000
A world in which the paralyzed could walk, via body exoskeletons.

59
0:03:32.645,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Sadly, because of deficiencies in technology,

60
0:03:35.447,000 --> 0:03:36,000
disability is rampant in the world.

61
0:03:37.205,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This gentleman is missing three limbs.

62
0:03:39.903,000 --> 0:03:42,000
As a testimony to current technology, he is out of the wheelchair,

63
0:03:43.75,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but we need to do a better job in bionics, to allow, one day, full rehabilitation

64
0:03:49.695,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for a person with this level of injury.

65
0:03:53.876,000 --> 0:03:56,000
At the MIT Media Lab, we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics.

66
0:03:57.479,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science

67
0:04:02.051,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and technological capability

68
0:04:03.911,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans,

69
0:04:07.682,000 --> 0:04:11,000
across a broad range of brain and body disabilities.

70
0:04:13.707,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Today, I'm going to tell you how my legs function, how they work,

71
0:04:17.468,000 --> 0:04:2,000
as a case in point for this center.

72
0:04:20.77,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now, I made sure to shave my legs last night,

73
0:04:22.921,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because I knew I'd be showing them off.

74
0:04:24.892,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:26.365,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces.

76
0:04:29.619,000 --> 0:04:31,000
There's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs:

77
0:04:32.515,000 --> 0:04:36,000
mechanical, how my limbs are attached to my biological body;

78
0:04:36.619,000 --> 0:04:39,000
dynamic, how they move like flesh and bone;

79
0:04:39.942,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and electrical, how they communicate with my nervous system.

80
0:04:42.856,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I'll begin with mechanical interface.

81
0:04:45.904,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In the area of design, we still do not understand

82
0:04:49.071,000 --> 0:04:51,000
how to attach devices to the body mechanically.

83
0:04:53.185,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's extraordinary to me that in this day and age,

84
0:04:56.352,000 --> 0:04:58,000
one of the most mature, oldest technologies

85
0:04:58.701,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in the human timeline, the shoe, still gives us blisters.

86
0:05:03.121,000 --> 0:05:04,000
How can this be?

87
0:05:04.602,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies.

88
0:05:08.364,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is the beautifully lyrical design work

89
0:05:11.293,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab,

90
0:05:13.738,000 --> 0:05:16,000
showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances,

91
0:05:17.186,000 --> 0:05:21,000
shown here by color variation in this 3D-printed model.

92
0:05:21.811,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it,

93
0:05:26.359,000 --> 0:05:29,000
when you need it, for optimal support and flexibility,

94
0:05:29.913,000 --> 0:05:3,000
without ever causing discomfort.

95
0:05:32.112,000 --> 0:05:35,000
My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body

96
0:05:35.558,000 --> 0:05:39,000
via synthetic skins with stiffness variations,

97
0:05:39.644,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics.

98
0:05:44.359,000 --> 0:05:47,000
To achieve that mirroring, we first developed a mathematical model

99
0:05:47.557,000 --> 0:05:48,000
of my biological limb.

100
0:05:49.129,000 --> 0:05:52,000
To that end, we used imaging tools such as MRI,

101
0:05:52.435,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to look inside my body,

102
0:05:54.023,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues.

103
0:05:57.752,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We also took robotic tools --

104
0:05:59.163,000 --> 0:06:03,000
here's a 14-actuator circle that goes around the biological limb.

105
0:06:04.891,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The actuators come in, find the surface of the limb,

106
0:06:07.463,000 --> 0:06:09,000
measure its unloaded shape,

107
0:06:09.732,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and then they push on the tissues

108
0:06:11.407,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point.

109
0:06:15.542,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We combine these imaging and robotic data

110
0:06:17.813,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to build a mathematical description of my biological limb, shown on the left.

111
0:06:21.479,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You see a bunch of points, or nodes?

112
0:06:23.257,000 --> 0:06:26,000
At each node, there's a color that represents tissue compliance.

113
0:06:26.431,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin,

114
0:06:30.397,000 --> 0:06:31,000
shown on the right.

115
0:06:32.088,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And we've discovered optimality is:

116
0:06:34.516,000 --> 0:06:36,000
where the body is stiff, the synthetic skin should be soft,

117
0:06:37.397,000 --> 0:06:4,000
where the body is soft, the synthetic skin is stiff,

118
0:06:40.881,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances.

119
0:06:44.72,000 --> 0:06:46,000
With this framework, we've produced bionic limbs

120
0:06:47.505,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn.

121
0:06:51.077,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Clearly, in the future, our clothing, our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,

122
0:06:57.19,000 --> 0:07:,000
will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies,

123
0:07:00.87,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but rather, data-driven quantitative frameworks.

124
0:07:04.098,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In that future, our shoes will no longer give us blisters.

125
0:07:09.04,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We're also embedding sensing and smart materials

126
0:07:11.961,000 --> 0:07:12,000
into the synthetic skins.

127
0:07:13.556,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This is a material developed by SRI International, California.

128
0:07:18.048,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Under electrostatic effect, it changes stiffness.

129
0:07:21.349,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So under zero voltage, the material is compliant,

130
0:07:24.698,000 --> 0:07:25,000
it's floppy like paper.

131
0:07:26.096,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Then the button's pushed, a voltage is applied,

132
0:07:28.588,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and it becomes stiff as a board.

133
0:07:30.604,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Tapping sounds)

134
0:07:33.666,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We embed this material into the synthetic skin

135
0:07:36.338,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body.

136
0:07:39.888,000 --> 0:07:41,000
When I walk here, it's no voltage.

137
0:07:42.342,000 --> 0:07:44,000
My interface is soft and compliant.

138
0:07:44.423,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The button's pushed, voltage is applied, and it stiffens,

139
0:07:47.438,000 --> 0:07:5,000
offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb.

140
0:07:50.915,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We're also building exoskeletons.

141
0:07:53.327,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft

142
0:07:55.607,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in just the right areas of the running cycle,

143
0:07:58.569,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation.

144
0:08:02.847,000 --> 0:08:04,000
In the future, we'll all be wearing exoskeletons

145
0:08:05.657,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in common activities, such as running.

146
0:08:08.966,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Next, dynamic interface.

147
0:08:10.474,000 --> 0:08:12,000
How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone?

148
0:08:13.799,000 --> 0:08:16,000
At my MIT lab, we study how humans with normal physiologies

149
0:08:17.808,000 --> 0:08:18,000
stand, walk and run.

150
0:08:19.338,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What are the muscles doing,

151
0:08:20.753,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and how are they controlled by the spinal cord?

152
0:08:23.697,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This basic science motivates what we build.

153
0:08:26.166,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We're building bionic ankles, knees and hips.

154
0:08:28.528,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We're building body parts from the ground up.

155
0:08:31.854,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs.

156
0:08:35.041,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They've been fitted to nearly 1,000 patients,

157
0:08:39.019,000 --> 0:08:41,000
400 of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers.

158
0:08:42.005,000 --> 0:08:43,000
How does it work?

159
0:08:43.187,000 --> 0:08:45,000
At heel strike, under computer control,

160
0:08:45.226,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the system controls stiffness,

161
0:08:47.226,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground.

162
0:08:50.287,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers

163
0:08:54.407,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to lift the person into the walking stride,

164
0:08:56.786,000 --> 0:08:59,000
comparable to how muscles work in the calf region.

165
0:09:01.096,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients.

166
0:09:04.85,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So on the left, you see the bionic device worn by a lady,

167
0:09:07.928,000 --> 0:09:09,000
on the right, a passive device worn by the same lady,

168
0:09:10.887,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that fails to emulate normal muscle function,

169
0:09:13.737,000 --> 0:09:16,000
enabling her to do something everyone should be able to do:

170
0:09:17.439,000 --> 0:09:18,000
go up and down their steps at home.

171
0:09:19.634,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats.

172
0:09:23.149,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Here's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway.

173
0:09:27.784,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is Steve Martin -- not the comedian --

174
0:09:30.633,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan.

175
0:09:34.327,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles,

176
0:09:39.218,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that wrap around the biological limb.

177
0:09:42.311,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This gentleman does not have any leg condition, any disability.

178
0:09:47.922,000 --> 0:09:48,000
He has a normal physiology,

179
0:09:49.826,000 --> 0:09:53,000
so these exoskeletons are applying muscle-like torques and powers,

180
0:09:54.419,000 --> 0:09:57,000
so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers.

181
0:09:59.079,000 --> 0:10:04,000
This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking.

182
0:10:04.501,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It significantly reduces metabolic cost.

183
0:10:07.668,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's so profound in its augmentation,

184
0:10:10.406,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that when a normal, healthy person wears the device for 40 minutes

185
0:10:13.579,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and then takes it off,

186
0:10:15.302,000 --> 0:10:19,000
their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward.

187
0:10:20.039,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies

188
0:10:23.474,000 --> 0:10:26,000
will make us stronger and faster and more efficient.

189
0:10:27.699,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Moving on to electrical interface:

190
0:10:29.47,000 --> 0:10:32,000
How do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system?

191
0:10:32.651,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Across my residual limb are electrodes

192
0:10:34.517,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles.

193
0:10:37.286,000 --> 0:10:38,000
That's communicated to the bionic limb,

194
0:10:39.229,000 --> 0:10:42,000
so when I think about moving my phantom limb,

195
0:10:42.306,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the robot tracks those movement desires.

196
0:10:46.02,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled.

197
0:10:50.67,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So we model the missing biological limb,

198
0:10:53.099,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and we've discovered what reflexes occurred,

199
0:10:55.937,000 --> 0:10:58,000
how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles.

200
0:10:59.302,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb.

201
0:11:05.009,000 --> 0:11:08,000
What we've done, then, is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex,

202
0:11:08.993,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the modeled spinal reflex, with the neural signal,

203
0:11:12.112,000 --> 0:11:15,000
so when I relax my muscles in my residual limb,

204
0:11:15.565,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I get very little torque and power,

205
0:11:18.436,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but the more I fire my muscles, the more torque I get,

206
0:11:21.181,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and I can even run.

207
0:11:24.014,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command.

208
0:11:28.982,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Feels great.

209
0:11:30.158,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

210
0:11:36.149,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We want to go a step further.

211
0:11:37.558,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We want to actually close the loop

212
0:11:40.629,000 --> 0:11:43,000
between the human and the bionic external limb.

213
0:11:44.407,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We're doing experiments

214
0:11:45.582,000 --> 0:11:47,000
where we're growing nerves, transected nerves,

215
0:11:48.075,000 --> 0:11:5,000
through channels, or micro-channel arrays.

216
0:11:50.129,000 --> 0:11:51,000
On the other side of the channel,

217
0:11:51.847,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the nerve then attaches to cells,

218
0:11:54.2,000 --> 0:11:55,000
skin cells and muscle cells.

219
0:11:56.926,000 --> 0:12:,000
In the motor channels, we can sense how the person wishes to move.

220
0:12:01.07,000 --> 0:12:04,000
That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb,

221
0:12:04.731,000 --> 0:12:06,000
then [sensory information] on the bionic limb

222
0:12:07.137,000 --> 0:12:1,000
can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels,

223
0:12:10.662,000 --> 0:12:11,000
sensory channels.

224
0:12:11.918,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So when this is fully developed and for human use,

225
0:12:15.97,000 --> 0:12:17,000
persons like myself will not only have

226
0:12:18.63,000 --> 0:12:21,000
synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone,

227
0:12:22.187,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but actually feel like flesh and bone.

228
0:12:26.187,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This video shows Lisa Mallette,

229
0:12:28.201,000 --> 0:12:3,000
shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs.

230
0:12:31.471,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Indeed, bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives.

231
0:12:34.988,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.

232
0:12:39.519,000 --> 0:12:42,000
LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!

233
0:12:42.678,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Video) (Laughter)

234
0:12:44.145,000 --> 0:12:46,000
LM: It's just like I've got a real leg!

235
0:12:49.237,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Woman: Now, don't start running.

236
0:12:50.855,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Man: Now turn around, and do the same thing walking up,

237
0:12:53.673,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but get on your heel to toe, like you would normally just walk on level ground.

238
0:12:57.426,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Try to walk right up the hill.

239
0:13:01.411,000 --> 0:13:03,000
LM: Oh my God.

240
0:13:04.037,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Man: Is it pushing you up?

241
0:13:05.307,000 --> 0:13:09,000
LM: Yes! I'm not even -- I can't even describe it.

242
0:13:10.286,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Man: It's pushing you right up.

243
0:13:12.608,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Hugh Herr: Next week, I'm visiting the Center --

244
0:13:15.18,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Thank you. Thank you.

245
0:13:16.356,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

246
0:13:19.886,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Thank you.

247
0:13:21.193,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Next week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

248
0:13:25.042,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and I'm going to try to convince CMS

249
0:13:27.669,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to grant appropriate code language and pricing,

250
0:13:30.248,000 --> 0:13:33,000
so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it.

251
0:13:34.003,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

252
0:13:35.05,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Thank you.

253
0:13:36.234,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Applause)

254
0:13:39.873,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It's not well appreciated, but over half of the world's population

255
0:13:43.841,000 --> 0:13:47,000
suffers from some form of cognitive, emotional, sensory or motor condition,

256
0:13:48.632,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and because of poor technology, too often, conditions result in disability

257
0:13:53.066,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and a poorer quality of life.

258
0:13:55.113,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights.

259
0:14:00.077,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Every person should have the right to live life without disability

260
0:14:04.057,000 --> 0:14:05,000
if they so choose --

261
0:14:05.978,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the right to live life without severe depression;

262
0:14:08.724,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the right to see a loved one, in the case of seeing-impaired;

263
0:14:12.129,000 --> 0:14:13,000
or the right to walk or to dance,

264
0:14:14.042,000 --> 0:14:16,000
in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation.

265
0:14:17.633,000 --> 0:14:2,000
As a society, we can achieve these human rights,

266
0:14:21.323,000 --> 0:14:26,000
if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled.

267
0:14:27.794,000 --> 0:14:28,000
A person can never be broken.

268
0:14:30.5,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Our built environment, our technologies,

269
0:14:33.199,000 --> 0:14:34,000
are broken and disabled.

270
0:14:35.444,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We the people need not accept our limitations,

271
0:14:38.5,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but can transcend disability through technological innovation.

272
0:14:42.599,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Indeed, through fundamental advances in bionics in this century,

273
0:14:46.583,000 --> 0:14:5,000
we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience,

274
0:14:50.765,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and we will end disability.

275
0:14:53.456,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I'd like to finish up with one more story, a beautiful story.

276
0:14:57.613,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.

277
0:15:00.36,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack.

278
0:15:04.766,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I met Adrianne when this photo was taken, at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.

279
0:15:08.745,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.

280
0:15:11.245,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Adrianne breathes and lives dance.

281
0:15:14.366,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It is her expression. It is her art form.

282
0:15:16.66,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Naturally, when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack,

283
0:15:20.683,000 --> 0:15:22,000
she wanted to return to the dance floor.

284
0:15:23.828,000 --> 0:15:25,000
After meeting her and driving home in my car,

285
0:15:26.011,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I thought, I'm an MIT professor. I have resources.

286
0:15:29.888,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Let's build her a bionic limb,

287
0:15:31.45,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to enable her to go back to her life of dance.

288
0:15:35.396,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics,

289
0:15:38.896,000 --> 0:15:4,000
robotics, machine learning and biomechanics,

290
0:15:41.229,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and over a 200-day research period, we studied dance.

291
0:15:45.389,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We brought in dancers with biological limbs,

292
0:15:49.31,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and we studied how they move,

293
0:15:51.969,000 --> 0:15:54,000
what forces they apply on the dance floor,

294
0:15:55.166,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and we took those data,

295
0:15:56.717,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and we put forth fundamental principles of dance,

296
0:16:00.516,000 --> 0:16:01,000
reflexive dance capability,

297
0:16:02.327,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb.

298
0:16:05.992,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster.

299
0:16:09.761,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Our expression, our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics.

300
0:16:15.52,000 --> 0:16:2,000
It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack.

301
0:16:21.733,000 --> 0:16:26,000
In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor.

302
0:16:27.86,000 --> 0:16:29,000
In 200 days, we put her back.

303
0:16:30.495,000 --> 0:16:34,000
We will not be intimidated, brought down, diminished, conquered or stopped

304
0:16:35.492,000 --> 0:16:36,000
by acts of violence.

305
0:16:37.061,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Applause)

306
0:16:45.046,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,

307
0:16:49.372,000 --> 0:16:51,000
her first performance since the attack.

308
0:16:52.38,000 --> 0:16:54,000
She's dancing with Christian Lightner.

309
0:16:54.541,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Applause)

310
0:17:05.579,000 --> 0:17:11,000
(Music: "Ring My Bell" performed by Enrique Iglesias)

311
0:17:51.267,000 --> 0:17:57,000
(Applause)

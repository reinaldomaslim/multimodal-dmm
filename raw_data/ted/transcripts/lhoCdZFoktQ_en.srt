1
0:00:13.087,000 --> 0:00:16,000
There are three words that explain why I am here.

2
0:00:17.4,000 --> 0:00:21,000
They are "Amy Krouse Rosenthal."

3
0:00:23.32,000 --> 0:00:24,000
At the end of Amy's life,

4
0:00:24.84,000 --> 0:00:26,000
hyped up on morphine and home in hospice,

5
0:00:28.239,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the "New York Times" published an article she wrote

6
0:00:30.84,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for the "Modern Love" column on March 3, 2017.

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It was read worldwide by over five million people.

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The piece was unbearably sad,

9
0:00:42.68,000 --> 0:00:43,000
ironically funny

10
0:00:44.439,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and brutally honest.

11
0:00:47.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
While it was certainly about our life together,

12
0:00:49.88,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the focus of the piece was me.

13
0:00:53.44,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was called, "You May Want to Marry My Husband."

14
0:00:56.6,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It was a creative play on a personal ad for me.

15
0:01:00.44,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Amy quite literally left an empty space for me to fill

16
0:01:04.2,000 --> 0:01:05,000
with another love story.

17
0:01:07.52,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Amy was my wife for half my life.

18
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:14,000
She was my partner in raising three wonderful, now grown children,

19
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and really, she was my girl, you know?

20
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We had so much in common.

21
0:01:20.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We loved the same art,

22
0:01:21.92,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the same documentaries, the same music.

23
0:01:24.56,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Music was a huge part of our life together.

24
0:01:27.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And we shared the same values.

25
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We were in love,

26
0:01:31.6,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and our love grew stronger up until her last day.

27
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Amy was a prolific author.

28
0:01:39.08,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In addition to two groundbreaking memoirs,

29
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:43,000
she published over 30 children's books.

30
0:01:45.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Posthumously, the book she wrote with our daughter Paris,

31
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:48,000
called "Dear Girl,"

32
0:01:49.52,000 --> 0:01:52,000
reached the number one position on the "New York Times" bestseller list.

33
0:01:54.24,000 --> 0:01:56,000
She was a self-described tiny filmmaker.

34
0:01:57.64,000 --> 0:02:,000
She was 5'1" and her films were not that long.

35
0:02:00.8,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:01.84,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Her films exemplified her natural ability to gather people together.

37
0:02:07.24,000 --> 0:02:09,000
She was also a terrific public speaker,

38
0:02:09.68,000 --> 0:02:12,000
talking with children and adults of all ages

39
0:02:12.84,000 --> 0:02:13,000
all over the world.

40
0:02:15.52,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, my story of grief is only unique in the sense of it being rather public.

41
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:23,000
However, the grieving process itself was not my story alone.

42
0:02:25.92,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Amy gave me permission to move forward, and I'm so grateful for that.

43
0:02:30.04,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, just a little over a year into my new life,

44
0:02:33.08,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I've learned a few things.

45
0:02:35.64,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I'm here to share with you part of the process of moving forward

46
0:02:38.68,000 --> 0:02:4,000
through and with grief.

47
0:02:42.24,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But before I do that, I think it would be important

48
0:02:44.68,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to talk a little bit about the end of life,

49
0:02:46.76,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because it forms how I have been emotionally since then.

50
0:02:50.8,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Death is such a taboo subject, right?

51
0:02:54.44,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Amy ate her last meal on January 9, 2017.

52
0:02:58.92,000 --> 0:03:,000
She somehow lived an additional two months

53
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:02,000
without solid food.

54
0:03:03.48,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Her doctors told us we could do hospice at home

55
0:03:07.64,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or in the hospital.

56
0:03:09.96,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They did not tell us that Amy would shrink to half her body weight,

57
0:03:13.96,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that she would never lay with her husband again,

58
0:03:16.72,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that walking upstairs to our bedroom would soon feel like running a marathon.

59
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Home hospice does have an aura of being a beautiful environment to die in.

60
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
How great that you don't have the sounds of machines beeping

61
0:03:30.6,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and going on and off all the time,

62
0:03:33.24,000 --> 0:03:36,000
no disruptions for mandatory drug administration,

63
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
home with your family to die.

64
0:03:42.64,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We did our best to make those weeks as meaningful as we could.

65
0:03:46.72,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We talked often about death.

66
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Everybody knows it's going to happen to them, like, for sure,

67
0:03:52.32,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but being able to talk openly about it was liberating.

68
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We talked about subjects like parenting.

69
0:04:00.08,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I asked Amy how I could be the best parent possible to our children in her absence.

70
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In those conversations, she gave me confidence

71
0:04:08.6,000 --> 0:04:11,000
by stressing what a great relationship I had with each one of them,

72
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and that I can do it.

73
0:04:15.4,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I know there will be many times

74
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
where I wish she and I can make decisions together.

75
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We were always so in sync.

76
0:04:24.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
May I be so audacious as to suggest

77
0:04:26.84,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that you have these conversations now,

78
0:04:30.64,000 --> 0:04:31,000
when healthy.

79
0:04:32.279,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Please don't wait.

80
0:04:36.24,000 --> 0:04:4,000
As part of our hospice experience, we organized groups of visitors.

81
0:04:40.28,000 --> 0:04:44,000
How brave of Amy to receive them, even as she began her physical decline.

82
0:04:45.48,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We had a Krouse night,

83
0:04:47.04,000 --> 0:04:49,000
her parents and three siblings.

84
0:04:49.44,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Friends and family were next.

85
0:04:51.8,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Each told beautiful stories of Amy and of us.

86
0:04:55.56,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Amy made an immense impact on her loyal friends.

87
0:05:00.96,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But home hospice is not so beautiful for the surviving family members.

88
0:05:05.8,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I want to get a little personal here and tell you that to this date,

89
0:05:09.52,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I have memories of those final weeks that haunt me.

90
0:05:14.56,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I remember walking backwards to the bathroom,

91
0:05:18.76,000 --> 0:05:2,000
assisting Amy with each step.

92
0:05:21.76,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I felt so strong.

93
0:05:23.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I'm not such a big guy,

94
0:05:25.2,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but my arms looked and felt so healthy compared to Amy's frail body.

95
0:05:31.72,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And that body failed in our house.

96
0:05:36.64,000 --> 0:05:38,000
On March 13 of last year,

97
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed.

98
0:05:46.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I carried her lifeless body

99
0:05:50.36,000 --> 0:05:51,000
down our stairs,

100
0:05:53.52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
through our dining room

101
0:05:56.08,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and our living room

102
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to a waiting gurney

103
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to have her body cremated.

104
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I will never get that image out of my head.

105
0:06:07.24,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If you know someone who has been through the hospice experience,

106
0:06:10.36,000 --> 0:06:11,000
acknowledge that.

107
0:06:11.64,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Just say you heard this guy Jason

108
0:06:13.28,000 --> 0:06:15,000
talk about how tough it must be to have those memories

109
0:06:15.92,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and that you're there if they ever want to talk about it.

110
0:06:18.76,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They may not want to talk,

111
0:06:20.8,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but it's nice to connect with someone living each day with those lasting images.

112
0:06:27.28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I know this sounds unbelievable, but I've never been asked that question.

113
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Amy's essay caused me to experience grief in a public way.

114
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Many of the readers who reached out to me wrote beautiful words of reflection.

115
0:06:41.52,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The scope of Amy's impact was deeper and richer

116
0:06:44.92,000 --> 0:06:46,000
than even us and her family knew.

117
0:06:48.4,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Some of the responses I received helped me with the intense grieving process

118
0:06:52.24,000 --> 0:06:53,000
because of their humor,

119
0:06:54.44,000 --> 0:06:56,000
like this email I received from a woman reader

120
0:06:56.64,000 --> 0:06:58,000
who read the article, declaring,

121
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"I will marry you when you are ready --

122
0:07:02.08,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

123
0:07:03.68,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"provided you permanently stop drinking.

124
0:07:07.04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
No other conditions.

125
0:07:09.56,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I promise to outlive you.

126
0:07:11.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Thank you very much."

127
0:07:14.68,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now, I do like a good tequila, but that really is not my issue.

128
0:07:19.04,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Yet how could I say no to that proposal?

129
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

130
0:07:23.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I laughed through the tears when I read this note from a family friend:

131
0:07:28.2,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"I remember Shabbat dinners at your home

132
0:07:30.92,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and Amy teaching me how to make cornbread croutons.

133
0:07:34.88,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Only Amy could find creativity in croutons."

134
0:07:38.58,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:42.52,000 --> 0:07:45,000
On July 27, just a few months after Amy's death,

136
0:07:46.24,000 --> 0:07:47,000
my dad died of complications

137
0:07:47.88,000 --> 0:07:5,000
related to a decades-long battle with Parkinson's disease.

138
0:07:52.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I had to wonder: How much can the human condition handle?

139
0:07:56.68,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What makes us capable of dealing with this intense loss

140
0:07:59.92,000 --> 0:08:,000
and yet carry on?

141
0:08:02.36,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Was this a test?

142
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Why my family and my amazing children?

143
0:08:08.32,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Looking for answers, I regret to say, is a lifelong mission,

144
0:08:12.44,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but the key to my being able to persevere

145
0:08:16.44,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is Amy's expressed and very public edict

146
0:08:20.04,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that I must go on.

147
0:08:23.52,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Throughout this year, I have done just that.

148
0:08:26.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I have attempted to step out and seek the joy and the beauty

149
0:08:30.8,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that I know this life is capable of providing.

150
0:08:36.32,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But here's the reality:

151
0:08:38.76,000 --> 0:08:39,000
those family gatherings,

152
0:08:40.08,000 --> 0:08:42,000
attending weddings and events honoring Amy,

153
0:08:42.56,000 --> 0:08:44,000
as loving as they are,

154
0:08:44.6,000 --> 0:08:46,000
have all been very difficult to endure.

155
0:08:48.24,000 --> 0:08:49,000
People say I'm amazing.

156
0:08:49.52,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"How do you handle yourself that way during those times?"

157
0:08:52.24,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They say, "You do it with such grace."

158
0:08:56.56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Well, guess what?

159
0:08:58.32,000 --> 0:09:,000
I really am sad a lot of the time.

160
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I often feel like I'm kind of a mess,

161
0:09:05.24,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and I know these feelings apply to other surviving spouses,

162
0:09:09.4,000 --> 0:09:11,000
children, parents

163
0:09:12.72,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and other family members.

164
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
In Japanese Zen, there is a term "Shoji,"

165
0:09:18.72,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which translates as "birth death."

166
0:09:21.92,000 --> 0:09:23,000
There is no separation between life and death

167
0:09:24.72,000 --> 0:09:26,000
other than a thin line that connects the two.

168
0:09:28.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Birth, or the joyous, wonderful, vital parts of life,

169
0:09:32.88,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and death, those things we want to get rid of,

170
0:09:35.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
are said to be faced equally.

171
0:09:38.68,000 --> 0:09:4,000
In this new life that I find myself in,

172
0:09:40.88,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I am doing my best to embrace this concept as I move forward with grieving.

173
0:09:47.48,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In the early months following Amy's death, though,

174
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I was sure that the feeling of despair would be ever-present,

175
0:09:53.72,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that it would be all-consuming.

176
0:09:56.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Soon I was fortunate to receive some promising advice.

177
0:10:01.68,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Many members of the losing-a-spouse club

178
0:10:03.88,000 --> 0:10:04,000
reached out to me.

179
0:10:05.68,000 --> 0:10:09,000
One friend in particular who had also lost her life partner kept repeating,

180
0:10:10.36,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"Jason, you will find joy."

181
0:10:14.56,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I didn't even know what she was talking about.

182
0:10:16.8,000 --> 0:10:17,000
How was that possible?

183
0:10:19.76,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But because Amy gave me very public permission

184
0:10:22.48,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to also find happiness,

185
0:10:25.36,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I now have experienced joy from time to time.

186
0:10:29.88,000 --> 0:10:33,000
There it was, dancing the night away at an LCD Soundsystem concert,

187
0:10:35.4,000 --> 0:10:38,000
traveling with my brother and best friend or with a college buddy on a boys' trip

188
0:10:39.36,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to meet a group of great guys I never met before.

189
0:10:42.84,000 --> 0:10:46,000
From observing that my deck had sun beating down on it on a cold day,

190
0:10:47.72,000 --> 0:10:49,000
stepping out in it, laying there,

191
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the warmth consuming my body.

192
0:10:54.68,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The joy comes from my three stunning children.

193
0:11:00.92,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There was my son Justin,

194
0:11:02.56,000 --> 0:11:04,000
texting me a picture of himself with an older gentleman

195
0:11:05.2,000 --> 0:11:09,000
with a massive, strong forearm and the caption, "I just met Popeye,"

196
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
with a huge grin on his face.

197
0:11:11.88,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

198
0:11:13.36,000 --> 0:11:15,000
There was his brother Miles, walking to the train

199
0:11:15.92,000 --> 0:11:17,000
for his first day of work after graduating college,

200
0:11:19.4,000 --> 0:11:21,000
who stopped and looked back at me and asked,

201
0:11:21.52,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"What am I forgetting?"

202
0:11:23.32,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I assured him right away, "You are 100 percent ready. You got this."

203
0:11:28.04,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And my daughter Paris,

204
0:11:29.88,000 --> 0:11:32,000
walking together through Battersea Park in London,

205
0:11:32.92,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the leaves piled high,

206
0:11:34.76,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the sun glistening in the early morning on our way to yoga.

207
0:11:40.88,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I would add that beauty is also there to discover,

208
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and I mean beauty of the wabi-sabi variety

209
0:11:46.6,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but beauty nonetheless.

210
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
On the one hand, when I see something in this category, I want to say,

211
0:11:52.52,000 --> 0:11:54,000
"Amy, did you see that? Did you hear that?

212
0:11:54.96,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's too beautiful for you not to share with me."

213
0:12:00.32,000 --> 0:12:01,000
On the other hand,

214
0:12:02.8,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I now experience these moments

215
0:12:04.92,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in an entirely new way.

216
0:12:08.6,000 --> 0:12:1,000
There was the beauty I found in music,

217
0:12:11.36,000 --> 0:12:14,000
like the moment in the newest Manchester Orchestra album,

218
0:12:14.92,000 --> 0:12:15,000
when the song "The Alien"

219
0:12:16.24,000 --> 0:12:18,000
seamlessly transitions into "The Sunshine,"

220
0:12:19.84,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or the haunting beauty of Luke Sital-Singh's "Killing Me,"

221
0:12:24.4,000 --> 0:12:25,000
whose chorus reads,

222
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"And it's killing me that you're not here with me.

223
0:12:30.08,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I'm living happily, but I'm feeling guilty."

224
0:12:35.8,000 --> 0:12:39,000
There is beauty in the simple moments that life has to offer,

225
0:12:40.12,000 --> 0:12:44,000
a way of seeing that world that was so much a part of Amy's DNA,

226
0:12:44.52,000 --> 0:12:46,000
like on my morning commute,

227
0:12:46.56,000 --> 0:12:49,000
looking at the sun reflecting off of Lake Michigan,

228
0:12:49.8,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or stopping and truly seeing how the light shines

229
0:12:53.32,000 --> 0:12:55,000
at different times of the day

230
0:12:55.56,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in the house we built together;

231
0:12:59.4,000 --> 0:13:02,000
even after a Chicago storm, noticing the fresh buildup of snow

232
0:13:03.36,000 --> 0:13:04,000
throughout the neighborhood;

233
0:13:05.12,000 --> 0:13:08,000
or peeking into my daughter's room

234
0:13:08.48,000 --> 0:13:1,000
as she's practicing the bass guitar.

235
0:13:13.28,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Listen, I want to make it clear that I'm a very fortunate person.

236
0:13:18.2,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I have the most amazing family that loves and supports me.

237
0:13:22.84,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I have the resources for personal growth during my time of grief.

238
0:13:27.68,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But whether it's a divorce,

239
0:13:30.44,000 --> 0:13:32,000
losing a job you worked so hard at

240
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
or having a family member die suddenly

241
0:13:35.28,000 --> 0:13:37,000
or of a slow-moving and painful death,

242
0:13:38.88,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I would like to offer you

243
0:13:40.88,000 --> 0:13:41,000
what I was given:

244
0:13:43.32,000 --> 0:13:45,000
a blank of sheet of paper.

245
0:13:47.32,000 --> 0:13:5,000
What will you do with your intentional empty space,

246
0:13:51.92,000 --> 0:13:54,000
with your fresh start?

247
0:13:55.88,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Thank you.

248
0:13:57.12,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

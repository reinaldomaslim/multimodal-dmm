1
0:00:12.887,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm an artist and an engineer.

2
0:00:15.307,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And lately, I've been thinking a lot about how technology mediates

3
0:00:21.105,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the way we perceive reality.

4
0:00:23.653,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And it's being done in a superinvisible and nuanced way.

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality

6
0:00:32.93,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by masking itself as the actual experience of the world.

7
0:00:37.43,000 --> 0:00:41,000
As a result, we are becoming unconscious and unaware

8
0:00:42.14,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that it is happening at all.

9
0:00:45.36,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Take the glasses I usually wear, for example.

10
0:00:47.872,000 --> 0:00:51,000
These have become part of the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings.

11
0:00:52.352,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I barely notice them,

12
0:00:53.866,000 --> 0:00:57,000
even though they are constantly framing reality for me.

13
0:00:58.447,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The technology I am talking about is designed to do the same thing:

14
0:01:02.487,000 --> 0:01:04,000
change what we see and think

15
0:01:04.949,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but go unnoticed.

16
0:01:07.78,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, the only time I do notice my glasses

17
0:01:11.073,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is when something happens to draw my attention to it,

18
0:01:14.355,000 --> 0:01:17,000
like when it gets dirty or my prescription changes.

19
0:01:18.481,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I asked myself, "As an artist, what can I create

20
0:01:23.113,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to draw the same kind of attention

21
0:01:25.584,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to the ways digital media -- like news organizations, social media platforms,

22
0:01:31.779,000 --> 0:01:33,000
advertising and search engines --

23
0:01:34.064,000 --> 0:01:36,000
are shaping our reality?"

24
0:01:36.798,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I created a series of perceptual machines

25
0:01:41.594,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to help us defamiliarize and question

26
0:01:45.184,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the ways we see the world.

27
0:01:48.859,000 --> 0:01:54,000
For example, nowadays, many of us have this kind of allergic reaction

28
0:01:54.916,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to ideas that are different from ours.

29
0:01:57.945,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy.

30
0:02:04.596,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So I created a helmet that creates this artificial allergy to the color red.

31
0:02:10.263,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It simulates this hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger

32
0:02:14.74,000 --> 0:02:15,000
when you are wearing it.

33
0:02:16.73,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It has two modes: nocebo and placebo.

34
0:02:21.272,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In nocebo mode, it creates this sensorial experience of hyperallergy.

35
0:02:26.653,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Whenever I see red, the red expands.

36
0:02:30.062,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's similar to social media's amplification effect,

37
0:02:33.617,000 --> 0:02:35,000
like when you look at something that bothers you,

38
0:02:36.238,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you tend to stick with like-minded people

39
0:02:39.19,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and exchange messages and memes, and you become even more angry.

40
0:02:44.274,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Sometimes, a trivial discussion gets amplified

41
0:02:47.96,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and blown way out of proportion.

42
0:02:51.038,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Maybe that's even why we are living in the politics of anger.

43
0:02:56.756,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In placebo mode, it's an artificial cure for this allergy.

44
0:03:00.575,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Whenever you see red, the red shrinks.

45
0:03:03.617,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's a palliative, like in digital media.

46
0:03:06.516,000 --> 0:03:08,000
When you encounter people with different opinions,

47
0:03:09.439,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we will unfollow them,

48
0:03:10.94,000 --> 0:03:12,000
remove them completely out of our feeds.

49
0:03:14.343,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It cures this allergy by avoiding it.

50
0:03:17.57,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing ideas

51
0:03:22.141,000 --> 0:03:26,000
makes human community hyperfragmented and separated.

52
0:03:27.343,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The device inside the helmet reshapes reality

53
0:03:30.426,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses

54
0:03:33.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to create an augmented reality.

55
0:03:35.935,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional,

56
0:03:40.741,000 --> 0:03:41,000
it has high visibility

57
0:03:42.723,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and it's political.

58
0:03:44.39,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So what if we take a look

59
0:03:45.677,000 --> 0:03:48,000
at the last American presidential election map

60
0:03:48.75,000 --> 0:03:49,000
through the helmet?

61
0:03:49.939,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:50.971,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican,

63
0:03:54.568,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because the mediation alters our perceptions.

64
0:03:58.581,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The allergy exists on both sides.

65
0:04:03.134,000 --> 0:04:04,000
In digital media,

66
0:04:04.478,000 --> 0:04:07,000
what we see every day is often mediated,

67
0:04:07.635,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but it's also very nuanced.

68
0:04:09.758,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If we are not aware of this,

69
0:04:11.777,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies.

70
0:04:18.9,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Our perception is not only part of our identities,

71
0:04:22.434,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but in digital media, it's also a part of the value chain.

72
0:04:27.992,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Our visual field is packed with so much information

73
0:04:31.591,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value.

74
0:04:38.035,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Designs are used to exploit our unconscious biases,

75
0:04:41.588,000 --> 0:04:44,000
algorithms favor content that reaffirms our opinions,

76
0:04:45.092,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so that every little corner of our field of view is being colonized

77
0:04:49.307,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to sell ads.

78
0:04:51.402,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Like, when this little red dot comes out in your notifications,

79
0:04:55.443,000 --> 0:04:59,000
it grows and expands, and to your mind, it's huge.

80
0:05:00.571,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I started to think of ways to put a little dirt,

81
0:05:03.956,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or change the lenses of my glasses,

82
0:05:06.678,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and came up with another project.

83
0:05:09.423,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, keep in mind this is conceptual. It's not a real product.

84
0:05:13.676,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's a web browser plug-in

85
0:05:15.773,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore.

86
0:05:20.709,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Like the helmet, the plug-in reshapes reality,

87
0:05:24.503,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but this time, directly into the digital media itself.

88
0:05:29.066,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It shouts out the hidden filtered voices.

89
0:05:32.246,000 --> 0:05:33,000
What you should be noticing now

90
0:05:33.843,000 --> 0:05:35,000
will be bigger and vibrant,

91
0:05:36.376,000 --> 0:05:4,000
like here, this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of cats.

92
0:05:40.695,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:42.74,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The plug-in could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm.

94
0:05:48.831,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Like, here in this comment section,

95
0:05:50.551,000 --> 0:05:53,000
there are lots of people shouting about the same opinions.

96
0:05:54.111,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The plug-in makes their comments super small.

97
0:05:57.005,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:58.037,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen

99
0:06:03.312,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is proportional to the actual value they are contributing to the conversation.

100
0:06:07.89,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:11.345,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

102
0:06:16.919,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The plug-in also shows the real estate value of our visual field

103
0:06:21.004,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and how much of our perception is being commoditized.

104
0:06:24.912,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Different from ad blockers,

105
0:06:26.525,000 --> 0:06:28,000
for every ad you see on the web page,

106
0:06:29.021,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it shows the amount of money you should be earning.

107
0:06:32.452,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

108
0:06:34.356,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We are living in a battlefield between reality

109
0:06:36.672,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and commercial distributed reality,

110
0:06:39.329,000 --> 0:06:44,000
so the next version of the plug-in could strike away that commercial reality

111
0:06:44.439,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and show you things as they really are.

112
0:06:47.262,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:50.335,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

114
0:06:55.179,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Well, you can imagine how many directions this could really go.

115
0:06:58.815,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Believe me, I know the risks are high if this were to become a real product.

116
0:07:04.006,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I created this with good intentions

117
0:07:06.969,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to train our perception and eliminate biases.

118
0:07:10.83,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But the same approach could be used with bad intentions,

119
0:07:14.582,000 --> 0:07:17,000
like forcing citizens to install a plug-in like that

120
0:07:17.811,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to control the public narrative.

121
0:07:20.768,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's challenging to make it fair and personal

122
0:07:23.529,000 --> 0:07:26,000
without it just becoming another layer of mediation.

123
0:07:27.933,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So what does all this mean for us?

124
0:07:31.23,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Even though technology is creating this isolation,

125
0:07:34.987,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we could use it to make the world connected again

126
0:07:38.613,000 --> 0:07:41,000
by breaking the existing model and going beyond it.

127
0:07:42.508,000 --> 0:07:45,000
By exploring how we interface with these technologies,

128
0:07:45.87,000 --> 0:07:5,000
we could step out of our habitual, almost machine-like behavior

129
0:07:51.079,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and finally find common ground between each other.

130
0:07:54.915,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Technology is never neutral.

131
0:07:57.191,000 --> 0:08:,000
It provides a context and frames reality.

132
0:08:00.234,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's part of the problem and part of the solution.

133
0:08:03.624,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception

134
0:08:09.949,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and consequently, choose how we see each other.

135
0:08:13.892,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Thank you.

136
0:08:15.107,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

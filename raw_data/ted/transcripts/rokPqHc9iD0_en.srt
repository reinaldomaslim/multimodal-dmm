1
0:00:12.64,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We can cut violent deaths around the world

2
0:00:17.87,000 --> 0:00:2,000
by 50 percent in the next three decades.

3
0:00:22.12,000 --> 0:00:27,000
All we have to do is drop killing by 2.3 percent a year,

4
0:00:27.191,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and we'll hit that target.

5
0:00:29.644,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You don't believe me?

6
0:00:31.339,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Well, the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world

7
0:00:34.613,000 --> 0:00:36,000
seem to think we can, and so do I,

8
0:00:37.004,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but only if we focus on our cities, especially the most fragile ones.

9
0:00:42.139,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You see, I've been thinking about this a lot.

10
0:00:46.408,000 --> 0:00:47,000
For the last 20 years, I've been working

11
0:00:48.32,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in countries and cities ripped apart by conflict,

12
0:00:51.888,000 --> 0:00:55,000
violence, terrorism, or some insidious combination of all.

13
0:00:55.905,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia,

14
0:00:59.411,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo,

15
0:01:02.583,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I've counted cadavers in Colombia, in Haiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea.

16
0:01:08.285,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You don't need to be on the front line, though,

17
0:01:10.535,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control, right?

18
0:01:13.847,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There's this feeling that international instability is the new normal.

19
0:01:18.396,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But I want you to take a closer look,

20
0:01:20.527,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing,

21
0:01:23.739,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime

22
0:01:27.547,000 --> 0:01:34,000
as our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.

23
0:01:35.071,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Violence is migrating to the metropole.

24
0:01:38.196,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And maybe this is to be expected, right?

25
0:01:40.921,000 --> 0:01:43,000
After all, most people today, they live in cities, not the countryside.

26
0:01:44.868,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Just 600 cities, including 30 megacities, account for two thirds of global GDP.

27
0:01:50.704,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But when it comes to cities,

28
0:01:52.463,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the conversation is dominated by the North,

29
0:01:55.122,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that is, North America, Western Europe, Australia and Japan,

30
0:01:58.521,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where violence is actually at historic lows.

31
0:02:01.668,000 --> 0:02:05,000
As a result, city enthusiasts, they talk about the triumph of the city,

32
0:02:06.369,000 --> 0:02:09,000
of the creative classes, and the mayors that will rule the world.

33
0:02:10.315,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, I hope that mayors do one day rule the world,

34
0:02:13.801,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but, you know, the fact is,

35
0:02:15.838,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we don't hear any conversation, really, about what is happening in the South.

36
0:02:20.207,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And by South, I mean Latin America, Africa, Asia,

37
0:02:24.584,000 --> 0:02:26,000
where violence in some cases is accelerating,

38
0:02:27.312,000 --> 0:02:29,000
where infrastructure is overstretched,

39
0:02:29.913,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality.

40
0:02:34.268,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, some diplomats and development experts and specialists,

41
0:02:38.591,000 --> 0:02:4,000
they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states

42
0:02:41.256,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that will shape security in the 21st century.

43
0:02:44.878,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder.

44
0:02:50.063,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's because warfare and humanitarian action

45
0:02:53.414,000 --> 0:02:55,000
are going to be concentrated in our cities,

46
0:02:55.628,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the fight for development,

47
0:02:57.201,000 --> 0:02:59,000
whether you define that as eradicating poverty,

48
0:02:59.892,000 --> 0:03:01,000
universal healthcare, beating back climate change,

49
0:03:02.325,000 --> 0:03:07,000
will be won or lost in the shantytowns, slums and favelas of our cities.

50
0:03:07.996,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I want to talk to you about four megarisks

51
0:03:10.552,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that I think will define fragility in our time,

52
0:03:13.801,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and if we can get to grips with these,

53
0:03:16.03,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I think we can do something with that lethal violence problem.

54
0:03:18.975,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So let me start with some good news.

55
0:03:21.347,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Fact is, we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history.

56
0:03:26.778,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Steven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict

57
0:03:30.959,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is actually at an all-time low.

58
0:03:33.699,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine,

59
0:03:37.345,000 --> 0:03:4,000
as ghastly as these conflicts are, and they are horrific,

60
0:03:41.176,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they represent a relatively small blip upwards

61
0:03:43.916,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in a 50-year-long secular decline.

62
0:03:46.911,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What's more, we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide.

63
0:03:51.218,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Manuel Eisner and others have shown

64
0:03:53.435,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that for centuries, we've seen this incredible drop in murder,

65
0:03:57.145,000 --> 0:03:58,000
especially in the West.

66
0:03:59.09,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Most Northern cities today are 100 times safer than they were just 100 years ago.

67
0:04:04.526,000 --> 0:04:07,000
These two facts -- the decline in armed conflict and the decline in murder --

68
0:04:08.271,000 --> 0:04:09,000
are amongst the most extraordinary,

69
0:04:09.95,000 --> 0:04:11,000
if unheralded, accomplishments of human history,

70
0:04:12.527,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and we should be really excited, right?

71
0:04:15.827,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Well, yeah, we should.

72
0:04:17.655,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There's just one problem: These two scourges are still with us.

73
0:04:22.044,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You see, 525,000 people -- men, women, boys and girls --

74
0:04:28.148,000 --> 0:04:31,000
die violently every single year.

75
0:04:31.329,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Research I've been doing with Keith Krause and others

76
0:04:33.929,000 --> 0:04:38,000
has shown that between 50,000 and 60,000 people are dying in war zones violently.

77
0:04:39.386,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The rest, almost 500,000 people, are dying outside of conflict zones.

78
0:04:44.4,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In other words, 10 times more people are dying outside of war than inside war.

79
0:04:50.393,000 --> 0:04:53,000
What's more, violence is moving south,

80
0:04:53.488,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to Latin America and the Caribbean,

81
0:04:56.196,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to parts of Central and Southern Africa,

82
0:04:58.477,000 --> 0:05:,000
and to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia.

83
0:05:01.351,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Forty of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world

84
0:05:04.12,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are right here in Latin America,

85
0:05:05.658,000 --> 0:05:06,000
13 in Brazil,

86
0:05:07.528,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and the most dangerous of all, it's San Pedro Sula, Honduras' second city,

87
0:05:12.765,000 --> 0:05:16,000
with a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people.

88
0:05:17.581,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's 23 times the global average.

89
0:05:20.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, if violence is re-concentrating geographically,

90
0:05:23.447,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography,

91
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because when it comes to cities, the world ain't flat,

92
0:05:28.799,000 --> 0:05:3,000
like Thomas Friedman likes to say.

93
0:05:31.077,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's spiky.

94
0:05:32.413,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living

95
0:05:36.327,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history,

96
0:05:40.614,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and it all happened so fast.

97
0:05:43.702,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You all know the figures, right?

98
0:05:45.227,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There's 7.3 billion people in the world today;

99
0:05:47.469,000 --> 0:05:49,000
there will be 9.6 billion by 2050.

100
0:05:49.858,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But consider this one fact:

101
0:05:51.922,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In the 1800s, one in 30 people lived in cities,

102
0:05:55.114,000 --> 0:05:57,000
today it's one in two,

103
0:05:57.634,000 --> 0:06:,000
and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there.

104
0:06:00.792,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable.

105
0:06:04.878,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The vast majority, 90 percent,

106
0:06:06.521,000 --> 0:06:1,000
will be happening in the South, in cities of the South.

107
0:06:10.737,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So urban geographers and demographers,

108
0:06:13.864,000 --> 0:06:17,000
they tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities

109
0:06:18.159,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that predicts violence, no.

110
0:06:20.249,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Tokyo, with 35 million people,

111
0:06:22.501,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is one of the largest, and some might say safest, urban metropolises in the world.

112
0:06:27.229,000 --> 0:06:3,000
No, it's the speed of urbanization that matters.

113
0:06:30.976,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's one of the key drivers of fragility.

114
0:06:36.823,000 --> 0:06:4,000
When you think about the incredible expansion of these cities,

115
0:06:41.611,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and you think about turbo-urbanization, think about Karachi.

116
0:06:45.218,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Karachi was about 500,000 people in 1947, a hustling, bustling city.

117
0:06:51.127,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Today, it's 21 million people,

118
0:06:54.824,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and apart from accounting for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP,

119
0:06:58.769,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia.

120
0:07:01.863,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Dhaka, Lagos, Kinshasa,

121
0:07:04.667,000 --> 0:07:08,000
these cities are now 40 times larger than they were in the 1950s.

122
0:07:09.542,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now take a look at New York.

123
0:07:11.44,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The Big Apple, it took 150 years to get to eight million people.

124
0:07:16.636,000 --> 0:07:2,000
São Paulo, Mexico City, took 15 to reach that same interval.

125
0:07:21.947,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Now, what do these medium, large, mega-, and hypercities look like?

126
0:07:25.84,000 --> 0:07:26,000
What is their profile?

127
0:07:27.379,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Well, for one thing, they're young.

128
0:07:29.214,000 --> 0:07:32,000
What we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge.

129
0:07:32.836,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now, this is actually a good news story.

130
0:07:34.748,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's a function of reductions in child mortality rates.

131
0:07:37.338,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But the youth bulge is something we've got to watch.

132
0:07:39.795,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What it basically means

133
0:07:41.226,000 --> 0:07:43,000
is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities

134
0:07:44.125,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is much larger than those living in our healthier and wealthier ones.

135
0:07:47.627,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In some fragile cities,

136
0:07:49.146,000 --> 0:07:52,000
75 percent of the population is under the age of 30.

137
0:07:52.727,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Think about that: Three in four people are under 30.

138
0:07:57.479,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's like Palo Alto on steroids.

139
0:08:00.324,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now, if you look at Mogadishu for example,

140
0:08:03.064,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old.

141
0:08:07.174,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Ditto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul.

142
0:08:10.076,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And Tokyo? It's 46.

143
0:08:12.828,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Same for most Western European cities.

144
0:08:16.229,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Now, it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence.

145
0:08:19.409,000 --> 0:08:21,000
That's one factor among many,

146
0:08:21.453,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but youthfulness combined with unemployment, lack of education,

147
0:08:24.429,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and -- this is the kicker -- being male, is a deadly proposition.

148
0:08:28.535,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They're statistically correlated, all those risk factors, with youth,

149
0:08:32.036,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and they tend to relate to increases in violence.

150
0:08:36.033,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now, for those of you who are parents of teenage sons,

151
0:08:39.358,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you know what I'm talking about, right?

152
0:08:41.304,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Just imagine your boy without any structure

153
0:08:44.214,000 --> 0:08:47,000
with those unruly friends of his, out there cavorting about.

154
0:08:47.915,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now, take away the parents,

155
0:08:50.106,000 --> 0:08:54,000
take away the education, limit the education possibilities,

156
0:08:54.476,000 --> 0:08:57,000
sprinkle in a little bit of drugs, alcohol and guns,

157
0:08:57.721,000 --> 0:09:,000
and sit back and watch the fireworks.

158
0:09:00.924,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The implications are disconcerting.

159
0:09:03.021,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Right here in Brazil, the life expectancy is 73.6 years.

160
0:09:06.536,000 --> 0:09:09,000
If you live in Rio, I'm sorry, shave off two right there.

161
0:09:10.211,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But if you're young, you're uneducated,

162
0:09:12.498,000 --> 0:09:14,000
you lack employment, you're black, and you're male,

163
0:09:15.012,000 --> 0:09:18,000
your life expectancy drops to less than 60 years old.

164
0:09:18.224,000 --> 0:09:22,000
There's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers

165
0:09:23.081,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in this country.

166
0:09:25.422,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Okay, so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities.

167
0:09:28.696,000 --> 0:09:3,000
After all, cities are hubs of innovation,

168
0:09:31.064,000 --> 0:09:34,000
dynamism, prosperity, excitement, connectivity.

169
0:09:34.653,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They're where the smart people gather.

170
0:09:36.905,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And those young people I just mentioned,

171
0:09:38.846,000 --> 0:09:41,000
they're more digitally savvy and tech-aware than ever before.

172
0:09:42.49,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And this explosion, the Internet, and mobile technology,

173
0:09:46.064,000 --> 0:09:49,000
means that the digital divide separating the North and the South

174
0:09:49.779,000 --> 0:09:52,000
between countries and within them, is shrinking.

175
0:09:53.029,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But as we've heard so many times,

176
0:09:54.644,000 --> 0:09:56,000
these new technologies are dual-edged, right?

177
0:09:57.376,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Take the case of law enforcement.

178
0:09:59.519,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data

179
0:10:03.106,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to anticipate crime.

180
0:10:04.701,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Some cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens.

181
0:10:09.121,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The future crime scenario, it's here today,

182
0:10:12.526,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and we've got to be careful.

183
0:10:14.026,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We have to manage the issues of the public safety

184
0:10:16.321,000 --> 0:10:18,000
against rights to individual privacy.

185
0:10:18.987,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But it's not just the cops who are innovating.

186
0:10:21.138,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups

187
0:10:23.982,000 --> 0:10:26,000
who are engaging in local and global collective action,

188
0:10:27.117,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution.

189
0:10:31.74,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But most worrying of all are criminal gangs

190
0:10:35.136,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace.

191
0:10:38.045,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico, where I've been working,

192
0:10:41.177,000 --> 0:10:43,000
groups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel

193
0:10:43.531,000 --> 0:10:44,000
are hijacking social media.

194
0:10:45.152,000 --> 0:10:47,000
They're using it to recruit, to sell their products,

195
0:10:47.736,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to coerce, to intimidate and to kill.

196
0:10:49.966,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Violence is going virtual.

197
0:10:53.149,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So this is just a partial sketch

198
0:10:55.282,000 --> 0:10:57,000
of a fast-moving and dynamic and complex situation.

199
0:10:57.958,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I mean, there are many other megarisks

200
0:10:59.807,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that are going to define fragility in our time,

201
0:11:02.242,000 --> 0:11:03,000
not least income inequality,

202
0:11:04.141,000 --> 0:11:07,000
poverty, climate change, impunity.

203
0:11:07.879,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But we're facing a stark dilemma

204
0:11:10.224,000 --> 0:11:14,000
where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth

205
0:11:14.283,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards.

206
0:11:17.219,000 --> 0:11:2,000
If we're going to change course, we need to start a conversation.

207
0:11:20.445,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We can't only focus on those cities that work,

208
0:11:23.436,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs,

209
0:11:25.944,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the Dubais, the Shanghais.

210
0:11:27.824,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation.

211
0:11:32.028,000 --> 0:11:34,000
One way to do this might be to start twinning

212
0:11:34.558,000 --> 0:11:36,000
our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones,

213
0:11:37.298,000 --> 0:11:39,000
kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration

214
0:11:39.811,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and sharing of practices, of what works and what doesn't.

215
0:11:44.05,000 --> 0:11:47,000
A wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles,

216
0:11:47.642,000 --> 0:11:51,000
where the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating

217
0:11:51.802,000 --> 0:11:54,000
on getting ex-gang members to work with current gang members,

218
0:11:55.755,000 --> 0:11:57,000
offering tutoring, education,

219
0:11:58.543,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and in the process are helping incubate cease-fires and truces,

220
0:12:01.863,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador,

221
0:12:04.41,000 --> 0:12:05,000
once the world's most violent city,

222
0:12:06.233,000 --> 0:12:07,000
by 50 percent.

223
0:12:07.877,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We can also focus on hot cities, but also hot spots.

224
0:12:10.426,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities.

225
0:12:14.728,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Did you know that between one and two percent

226
0:12:17.283,000 --> 0:12:19,000
of street addresses in any fragile city

227
0:12:19.348,000 --> 0:12:22,000
can predict up to 99 percent of violent crime?

228
0:12:23.05,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Take the case of São Paulo, where I've been working.

229
0:12:25.614,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest,

230
0:12:29.367,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and it did this by doubling down

231
0:12:31.326,000 --> 0:12:34,000
on information collection, hot spot mapping, and police reform,

232
0:12:34.557,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and in the process, it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years.

233
0:12:39.595,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We also got to focus on those hot people.

234
0:12:42.05,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's tragic, but being young, unemployed, uneducated, male,

235
0:12:46.139,000 --> 0:12:49,000
increases the risks of being killed and killing.

236
0:12:50.136,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We have to break this cycle of violence

237
0:12:52.821,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and get in there early with our children, our youngest children,

238
0:12:56.155,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and valorize them, not stigmatize them.

239
0:12:59.214,000 --> 0:13:02,000
There's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with

240
0:13:02.584,000 --> 0:13:04,000
in Kingston, Jamaica and right here in Rio,

241
0:13:04.875,000 --> 0:13:07,000
which is putting education, employment, recreation

242
0:13:08.173,000 --> 0:13:1,000
up front for these high-risk groups,

243
0:13:10.329,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and as a result, we're seeing violence going down in their communities.

244
0:13:13.684,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We've also got to make our cities safer, more inclusive, and livable for all.

245
0:13:17.362,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The fact is, social cohesion matters.

246
0:13:21.129,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Mobility matters in our cities.

247
0:13:23.609,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We've got to get away from this model of segregation, exclusion,

248
0:13:26.679,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and cities with walls.

249
0:13:28.095,000 --> 0:13:3,000
My favorite example of how to do this comes from Medellín.

250
0:13:30.905,000 --> 0:13:32,000
When I lived in Colombia in the late 1990s,

251
0:13:32.91,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Medellín was the murder capital of the world, but it changed course,

252
0:13:36.541,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and it did this by deliberately investing in its low-income and most violent areas

253
0:13:40.8,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and integrating them with the middle-class ones

254
0:13:43.208,000 --> 0:13:44,000
through a network of cable cars,

255
0:13:44.88,000 --> 0:13:46,000
of public transport, and first-class infrastructure,

256
0:13:47.527,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and in the process, it dropped homicide by 79 percent in just under two decades.

257
0:13:52.349,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And finally, there's technology.

258
0:13:55.119,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Technology has enormous promise but also peril.

259
0:13:57.901,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation,

260
0:14:00.449,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and much of it coming from this room,

261
0:14:02.242,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The police are engaging in predictive analytics.

262
0:14:04.61,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions.

263
0:14:07.2,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Even my own group is involved in developing applications

264
0:14:09.847,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens.

265
0:14:14.199,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But we need to be careful.

266
0:14:17.687,000 --> 0:14:2,000
If I have one single message for you, it's this:

267
0:14:21.076,000 --> 0:14:24,000
There is nothing inevitable about lethal violence,

268
0:14:24.561,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and we can make our cities safer.

269
0:14:29.312,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Folks, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence

270
0:14:35.358,000 --> 0:14:37,000
in half within our lifetime.

271
0:14:38.005,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So I have just one question:

272
0:14:39.738,000 --> 0:14:4,000
What are we waiting for?

273
0:14:41.283,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Thank you.

274
0:14:43.067,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

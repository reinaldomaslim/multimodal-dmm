1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
One of the things that

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
defines a TEDster

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is you've taken your passion,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and you've turned it into stewardship.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
You actually put action to the issues you care about.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But what you're going to find eventually is

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
you may need to actually get elected officials

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to help you out.

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So, how do you do that?

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
One of the things I should probably tell you is,

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and that sort of warped my framework.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So, when you start to think about politicians,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
you've got to realize these are strange creatures.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and they have very strange breeding habits,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
how do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
What we need to understand is:

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
What drives the political creature?

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
One is reputation and influence.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
These are the primary tools by which

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a politician can do his job.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The second one -- unlike most animals,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which is survival of the species --

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
this is preservation of self.

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now you may think it's money,

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but that's actually sort of a proxy

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to what I can do to preserve myself.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You can send them an email.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Viagra ads coming at me,

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
your email is lost.

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It doesn't matter, it's spam.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How about you get on the phone?

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
That doesn't move.

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Face to face would work,

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but it's hard to set it up.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Yes, contributions actually do make a difference

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and they set a context for having a conversation,

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but it takes some time to build up.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So what actually works?

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the answer is rather strange.

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's a letter.

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We live in a digital world,

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but we're fairly analog creatures.

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Letters actually work.

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Even the top dog himself

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
takes time every day to read 10 letters

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that are picked out by staff.

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with

58
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
will tell you about the letters they get

59
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and what they mean.

60
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So, how are you going to write your letter?

61
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
getting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but this is actually critical.

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And it is critical that

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you actually handwrite your letter.

67
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It is so novel to see this,

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that somebody actually picked up an analog device

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and has written to me.

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
you get into a proactive stance

72
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and write to your elected officials at least once a month.

73
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Here's my promise to you:

74
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
If you are consistent and do this,

75
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
within three months the elected official will start calling you

76
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"

77
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, I'm going to give you

78
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
a four paragraph format to work with.

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, when you approach these animals,

80
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and you also need to approach them

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.

83
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So in paragraph number one,

84
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You appreciate them.

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.

88
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.

89
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.

90
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So, here you go. (Laughter)

91
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Paragraph number two:

92
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You may actually have to just get very blunt

93
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and say what's really on your mind.

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
When you do this,

95
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
don't attack people;

96
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you attack tactics.

97
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.

98
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Paragraph number three:

99
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
When animals are attacked or cornered,

100
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they will fight to the death,

101
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so you have to give them an exit.

102
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.

103
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Obviously, you're intelligent.

104
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If you had the right information,

105
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you would have done the right thing." (Laughter)

106
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.

107
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You're the safe place to come in to.

108
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, in paragraph number four,

109
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you're going to tell people,

110
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter)

111
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Animals do displays. They do two things:

112
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They warn you or they try to attract you

113
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and say, "We need to mate."

114
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.

115
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You do a number of things: you're a vice president,

116
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you volunteer, you do something else.

117
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Why is is this important?

118
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Because this establishes the two

119
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
primary criteria for the political creature:

120
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that you have influence in a large sphere,

121
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and that my preservation depends on you.

122
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Here is one very quick hack,

123
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
especially for the feds in the audience.

124
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Here's how you mail your letter.

125
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
First of all, you send the original to the district office.

126
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So, you send the copy to the main office.

127
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"

128
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler

129
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."

130
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And you actually get into the folder

131
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that the elected official actually has to read.

132
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, what your letter means:

133
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,

134
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and political officials are the pinatas.

135
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

136
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We are harangued, lectured to,

137
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
sold, marketed,

138
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but a letter is actually one of the few times

139
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that we have honest communication.

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I got this letter when I was first elected,

141
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and I still carry it to

142
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
every council meeting I go to.

143
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is an opportunity at real dialogue,

144
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and if you have stewardship

145
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and want to communicate,

146
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that dialogue is incredibly powerful.

147
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So when you do that, here's what I can promise:

148
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.

149
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Get writing.

150
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

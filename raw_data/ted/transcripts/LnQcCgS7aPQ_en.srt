1
0:00:16.91,000 --> 0:00:2,000
at least I've discovered what it is we

2
0:00:18.74,000 --> 0:00:24,000
put our speakers through sweaty palms

3
0:00:21.529,000 --> 0:00:28,000
sleepless nights a wholly unnatural fear

4
0:00:25.07,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of clocks I mean it's it's quite brutal

5
0:00:28.96,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I'm also a little nervous about this

6
0:00:32.53,000 --> 0:00:38,000
there are 9 billion humans coming our

7
0:00:35.57,000 --> 0:00:41,000
way now the most optimistic dreams can

8
0:00:39.019,000 --> 0:00:46,000
get dented by the prospect of people

9
0:00:42.379,000 --> 0:00:48,000
plundering the planet but recently I've

10
0:00:46.37,000 --> 0:00:5,000
become intrigued by a different way of

11
0:00:48.41,000 --> 0:00:52,000
thinking of large human crowds because

12
0:00:50.719,000 --> 0:00:53,000
there are circumstances where they can

13
0:00:52.489,000 --> 0:00:55,000
do something really cool it's a

14
0:00:54.5,000 --> 0:00:59,000
phenomenon that I think any organization

15
0:00:56.02,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or individual can tap into it's

16
0:00:59.51,000 --> 0:01:03,000
certainly impacted the way we think

17
0:01:01.55,000 --> 0:01:06,000
about Ted's future and perhaps the

18
0:01:04.369,000 --> 0:01:08,000
world's future overall so let's explore

19
0:01:06.77,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the story starts with just a single

20
0:01:09.02,000 --> 0:01:14,000
person a child behaving a little

21
0:01:11.21,000 --> 0:01:17,000
strangely this kids known online as

22
0:01:14.9,000 --> 0:01:17,000
little demon he's doing tricks here

23
0:01:17.39,000 --> 0:01:2,000
dance tricks that probably no

24
0:01:18.619,000 --> 0:01:23,000
six-year-old in history never managed

25
0:01:20.9,000 --> 0:01:25,000
before how did he learn them and what

26
0:01:23.869,000 --> 0:01:36,000
drove him to spend the hundreds of hours

27
0:01:26.15,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of practice this must have taken so that

28
0:01:37.759,000 --> 0:01:41,000
was sent me by this man a filmmaker

29
0:01:39.71,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Jonathan choo who told me that was the

30
0:01:42.14,000 --> 0:01:47,000
moment he realized the Internet was

31
0:01:43.939,000 --> 0:01:49,000
causing dance to evolve this is what he

32
0:01:47.39,000 --> 0:01:52,000
said at Ted in February I mean in

33
0:01:50.659,000 --> 0:01:54,000
essence dancers were challenging each

34
0:01:53.18,000 --> 0:01:57,000
other online to get better incredible

35
0:01:55.52,000 --> 0:01:58,000
new dance skills were being invented

36
0:01:57.56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
even the six-year-olds were joining in

37
0:01:59.27,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and it felt like a revolution and so

38
0:02:01.969,000 --> 0:02:06,000
John had a brilliant idea he went out to

39
0:02:05.45,000 --> 0:02:1,000
recruit the best of the best dancers off

40
0:02:07.189,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of YouTube to create this dance troupe

41
0:02:11.18,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the league of extraordinary dancers the

42
0:02:13.19,000 --> 0:02:17,000
lxd I mean these kids were web taught

43
0:02:15.98,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but they were so good they got to play

44
0:02:17.989,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the Oscars this year and at Ted here in

45
0:02:21.5,000 --> 0:02:25,000
February that passion and brilliance

46
0:02:23.03,000 --> 0:02:3,000
just took our breath away

47
0:02:25.9,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so this story of the evolution of dance

48
0:02:30.19,000 --> 0:02:35,000
seems strangely familiar you know a

49
0:02:33.019,000 --> 0:02:38,000
while after TED talks started taking off

50
0:02:35.209,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we noticed that speakers were starting

51
0:02:38.12,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to spend a lot more time in preparation

52
0:02:40.03,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it was resulting an incredible new talk

53
0:02:42.59,000 --> 0:02:47,000
like these two months of preparation

54
0:02:45.29,000 --> 0:02:5,000
crammed into 18 minutes raising the bar

55
0:02:48.53,000 --> 0:02:51,000
cruelly for the next generation of

56
0:02:50.419,000 --> 0:02:53,000
speakers with the effects that we've

57
0:02:51.62,000 --> 0:02:56,000
seen this week and it's not as if JJ and

58
0:02:54.35,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Jill actually ended their talk saying

59
0:02:56.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
step your game up

60
0:02:58.1,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but they might as well have so in both

61
0:03:00.829,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of these cases you've got these cycles

62
0:03:04.13,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of improvement apparently driven by

63
0:03:05.959,000 --> 0:03:09,000
people watching web video what is going

64
0:03:08.66,000 --> 0:03:12,000
on here well I think it's the latest

65
0:03:10.82,000 --> 0:03:17,000
iteration of the phenomenon we can call

66
0:03:13.239,000 --> 0:03:19,000
crowd accelerated innovation and there

67
0:03:17.9,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are just three things you need for this

68
0:03:19.79,000 --> 0:03:22,000
thing to kick into gear you could think

69
0:03:21.47,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of them as three dials and a giant wheel

70
0:03:23.66,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you turn up the dials the wheel starts

71
0:03:26.66,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to turn and the first thing you need is

72
0:03:28.729,000 --> 0:03:33,000
a crowd a group of people who share a

73
0:03:31.85,000 --> 0:03:36,000
common interest the bigger the crowd the

74
0:03:34.269,000 --> 0:03:38,000
more potential innovators there are

75
0:03:37.25,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that's important but actually most

76
0:03:38.87,000 --> 0:03:42,000
people in the crowd occupied these other

77
0:03:40.609,000 --> 0:03:46,000
roles they're creating the ecosystem

78
0:03:43.729,000 --> 0:03:48,000
from which innovation emerges the second

79
0:03:46.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
thing you need is light you need clear

80
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
open visibility of what the best people

81
0:03:51.109,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in that crowd are capable of because

82
0:03:52.94,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that is how you will learn how you will

83
0:03:55.31,000 --> 0:04:,000
be empowered to participate and third

84
0:03:58.419,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you need desire you know

85
0:04:01.1,000 --> 0:04:04,000
innovations hard work it's based on

86
0:04:02.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
hundreds of hours of research of

87
0:04:05.06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
practice absent desire not going to

88
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
happen now here's an example

89
0:04:09.62,000 --> 0:04:14,000
pre-internet of this machine in action

90
0:04:12.59,000 --> 0:04:16,000
dancers at a street corner you know it's

91
0:04:14.989,000 --> 0:04:17,000
a crowd a small one but they can all

92
0:04:17.12,000 --> 0:04:21,000
obviously see what each other can do and

93
0:04:18.979,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the desire part comes I guess from

94
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:25,000
social status right

95
0:04:23.35,000 --> 0:04:27,000
best answer walk store gets the best aid

96
0:04:25.84,000 --> 0:04:3,000
there's probably going to be some

97
0:04:27.58,000 --> 0:04:33,000
innovation happening here but on the web

98
0:04:30.94,000 --> 0:04:34,000
all three dials are ratcheted right up

99
0:04:33.91,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the dance community is now global

100
0:04:35.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there's millions connected and amazingly

101
0:04:38.2,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you can still see what the best can do

102
0:04:41.46,000 --> 0:04:47,000
because the crowd itself shines a light

103
0:04:44.11,000 --> 0:04:5,000
on them either directly through comments

104
0:04:47.62,000 --> 0:04:53,000
ratings email Facebook Twitter you know

105
0:04:50.29,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or indirectly through numbers of views

106
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:57,000
through links that point Google there so

107
0:04:56.71,000 --> 0:04:59,000
it's easy to find the good stuff when

108
0:04:58.69,000 --> 0:05:,000
you found it you can watch it in

109
0:04:59.77,000 --> 0:05:02,000
close-up repeatedly and read what

110
0:05:01.57,000 --> 0:05:05,000
hundreds of people have written about it

111
0:05:02.89,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that's a lot of life but the desire

112
0:05:06.43,000 --> 0:05:12,000
element is really you know dialed way up

113
0:05:09.85,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I mean you might just be a kid with a

114
0:05:12.76,000 --> 0:05:17,000
webcam but if you can do something that

115
0:05:15.64,000 --> 0:05:2,000
goes viral you get to be seen by the

116
0:05:18.58,000 --> 0:05:22,000
equivalent of sports stadiums crammed

117
0:05:20.89,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with people you get hundreds of

118
0:05:23.08,000 --> 0:05:27,000
strangers writing exactly about you and

119
0:05:26.02,000 --> 0:05:32,000
even if it's not that eloquent and it's

120
0:05:27.91,000 --> 0:05:35,000
not it can still really make your day so

121
0:05:32.07,000 --> 0:05:39,000
this possibility of a new type of global

122
0:05:36.28,000 --> 0:05:41,000
recognition I think it's driving huge

123
0:05:39.55,000 --> 0:05:43,000
amounts of effort and it's important to

124
0:05:42.22,000 --> 0:05:45,000
note that it's not just the stars who

125
0:05:43.66,000 --> 0:05:48,000
are benefiting because you can see the

126
0:05:45.67,000 --> 0:05:5,000
best everyone can learn also the system

127
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is self fueling you know it's the crowd

128
0:05:51.25,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that shines the light and fuels the

129
0:05:53.35,000 --> 0:05:57,000
desire but the Lightning desire are a

130
0:05:55.6,000 --> 0:05:59,000
lethal one-two combination that attract

131
0:05:57.49,000 --> 0:06:02,000
new people to the crowd so this is a

132
0:06:00.34,000 --> 0:06:06,000
model pretty much any organization could

133
0:06:03.19,000 --> 0:06:08,000
use to try and nurture its own cycle of

134
0:06:06.34,000 --> 0:06:11,000
crowd accelerated innovation invite the

135
0:06:09.04,000 --> 0:06:14,000
crowd letting the light dial up the

136
0:06:11.89,000 --> 0:06:16,000
desire and the hardest part about that

137
0:06:14.8,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is probably the light because it means

138
0:06:17.29,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you have to open up now you have to show

139
0:06:19.66,000 --> 0:06:25,000
your stuff to the world it's by giving

140
0:06:23.98,000 --> 0:06:27,000
away what you think is your deepest

141
0:06:26.14,000 --> 0:06:31,000
secret that maybe millions of people are

142
0:06:28.66,000 --> 0:06:32,000
empowered to help improve it and very

143
0:06:31.48,000 --> 0:06:35,000
happily there's one class of people who

144
0:06:33.25,000 --> 0:06:36,000
really can't make use of this tool you

145
0:06:35.77,000 --> 0:06:38,000
know the dark side of the way

146
0:06:37.09,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is allergic to the light I don't think

147
0:06:39.37,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we're gonna see terrorists for example

148
0:06:41.32,000 --> 0:06:43,000
publishing their plans online and same

149
0:06:42.76,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to the world please could you help us to

150
0:06:44.05,000 --> 0:06:5,000
actually make them work this time but

151
0:06:47.29,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you can publish your stuff online and if

152
0:06:50.38,000 --> 0:06:53,000
you can get that wheel to turn you know

153
0:06:52.36,000 --> 0:06:57,000
look out

154
0:06:53.79,000 --> 0:06:58,000
so at EDD we've become a little obsessed

155
0:06:57.669,000 --> 0:07:,000
with this idea of openness that my

156
0:06:59.62,000 --> 0:07:03,000
colleague Jim Kahn's taken to calling it

157
0:07:01.54,000 --> 0:07:06,000
radical openness because it works for us

158
0:07:04.15,000 --> 0:07:08,000
each time we opened up our talks to the

159
0:07:07.21,000 --> 0:07:1,000
world and suddenly there are millions of

160
0:07:08.979,000 --> 0:07:11,000
people out there helping spread our

161
0:07:10.36,000 --> 0:07:13,000
speaker's ideas and thereby making it

162
0:07:12.7,000 --> 0:07:15,000
easier for us to recruit and motivate

163
0:07:14.139,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the next generation of speakers by

164
0:07:16.54,000 --> 0:07:2,000
opening up our translation program

165
0:07:18.18,000 --> 0:07:22,000
thousands of heroic volunteers some of

166
0:07:21.04,000 --> 0:07:25,000
them watching online right now and thank

167
0:07:22.69,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you have translated our talks into more

168
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
than 70 languages thereby tripling our

169
0:07:28.66,000 --> 0:07:32,000
viewership in non-english speaking

170
0:07:29.83,000 --> 0:07:35,000
countries by giving away our TEDx brand

171
0:07:32.919,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we suddenly have a thousand plus live

172
0:07:36.729,000 --> 0:07:4,000
experiments in the art of spreading

173
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
ideas and these organizers they're

174
0:07:41.53,000 --> 0:07:44,000
seeing each other they're learning from

175
0:07:43.18,000 --> 0:07:47,000
each other we are learning from them

176
0:07:45.49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we're getting great talks back from them

177
0:07:47.74,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the wheel is turning okay step back a

178
0:07:51.789,000 --> 0:07:56,000
minute I mean it's really not news for

179
0:07:54.19,000 --> 0:07:58,000
me to tell you that innovation emerges

180
0:07:57.13,000 --> 0:08:01,000
out of groups you know we've heard that

181
0:07:58.69,000 --> 0:08:02,000
this week this romantic notion of the

182
0:08:01.15,000 --> 0:08:06,000
lone genius with a Eureka moment that

183
0:08:03.13,000 --> 0:08:09,000
changes the world is misleading even he

184
0:08:06.76,000 --> 0:08:12,000
said that and he wouldn't know where our

185
0:08:09.97,000 --> 0:08:15,000
social species we spark off each other

186
0:08:13.289,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it's also not news to say that the

187
0:08:16.93,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Internet has accelerated innovation you

188
0:08:19.09,000 --> 0:08:22,000
know for the past 15 years powerful

189
0:08:20.979,000 --> 0:08:24,000
communities have been connecting online

190
0:08:22.99,000 --> 0:08:26,000
sparking off each other if you take

191
0:08:25.3,000 --> 0:08:29,000
programmers you know the whole

192
0:08:27.25,000 --> 0:08:31,000
open-source movement is a fantastic

193
0:08:30.039,000 --> 0:08:34,000
instance of crowd accelerator innovation

194
0:08:31.979,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but what's key here is that the reason

195
0:08:34.69,000 --> 0:08:38,000
these groups have been able to connect

196
0:08:36.459,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is because their work output is of the

197
0:08:38.8,000 --> 0:08:46,000
type that can be easily shared digitally

198
0:08:41.979,000 --> 0:08:49,000
a picture music file software

199
0:08:47.22,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and that's why you know what I'm excited

200
0:08:50.38,000 --> 0:08:54,000
about or what I think is underreported

201
0:08:52.779,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is the significance of the rise of

202
0:08:55.089,000 --> 0:09:01,000
online video this is the technology

203
0:08:59.339,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that's going to allow the rest of the

204
0:09:01.69,000 --> 0:09:05,000
world's talents to be shared digitally

205
0:09:03.399,000 --> 0:09:08,000
thereby launching a whole new cycle of

206
0:09:06.519,000 --> 0:09:1,000
crowd accelerated innovation the first

207
0:09:09.37,000 --> 0:09:13,000
few years of the web we're pretty much

208
0:09:11.079,000 --> 0:09:15,000
video free for this reason video files

209
0:09:13.63,000 --> 0:09:17,000
are huge the web couldn't handle them

210
0:09:15.31,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but in the last 10 years bandwidth has

211
0:09:18.19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
exploded a hundredfold suddenly here we

212
0:09:21.43,000 --> 0:09:23,000
are

213
0:09:21.579,000 --> 0:09:25,000
humanity watches 80 million hours of

214
0:09:23.709,000 --> 0:09:28,000
YouTube every day Cisco actually

215
0:09:26.139,000 --> 0:09:3,000
estimates that within 4 years more than

216
0:09:28.87,000 --> 0:09:33,000
90 percent of the web's data will be

217
0:09:30.97,000 --> 0:09:34,000
video if it's all puppies porn and

218
0:09:34.269,000 --> 0:09:39,000
piracy we're doomed

219
0:09:35.47,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I don't think it will be video is high

220
0:09:40.18,000 --> 0:09:44,000
bandwidth for a reason it packs a huge

221
0:09:42.94,000 --> 0:09:47,000
amount of data and our brains are

222
0:09:44.92,000 --> 0:09:49,000
uniquely wired to decode it here let me

223
0:09:48.339,000 --> 0:09:54,000
introduce you to Sam Hebert

224
0:09:49.99,000 --> 0:09:54,000
he's a unicyclist before YouTube there

225
0:09:54.399,000 --> 0:09:58,000
was no way for him to discover his

226
0:09:55.959,000 --> 0:10:,000
sports true potential because he can't

227
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
communicate this stuff in words right

228
0:10:00.97,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but looking at video clips posted by

229
0:10:03.85,000 --> 0:10:07,000
strangers a world of possibility opens

230
0:10:06.459,000 --> 0:10:1,000
up for him suddenly he starts to emulate

231
0:10:08.8,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and then to innovate and a global

232
0:10:10.839,000 --> 0:10:13,000
community of unicyclists discover each

233
0:10:12.67,000 --> 0:10:15,000
other online inspire each other to

234
0:10:14.17,000 --> 0:10:18,000
greatness and there are thousands of

235
0:10:16.6,000 --> 0:10:2,000
other examples of this happening of

236
0:10:18.67,000 --> 0:10:22,000
video driven evolution of skills ranging

237
0:10:21.19,000 --> 0:10:25,000
from the you know the physical to the

238
0:10:23.079,000 --> 0:10:27,000
artful and I have to tell you as a

239
0:10:25.3,000 --> 0:10:29,000
former publisher of hobbyist magazines I

240
0:10:27.519,000 --> 0:10:3,000
find this strangely beautiful I mean

241
0:10:29.74,000 --> 0:10:34,000
there's a lot of passion right here on

242
0:10:31.06,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the screen but if Rube Goldberg machines

243
0:10:35.41,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and video poetry aren't quite your cup

244
0:10:37.66,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of tea

245
0:10:38.04,000 --> 0:10:45,000
how about this job is a website that was

246
0:10:43.87,000 --> 0:10:47,000
founded to encourage scientists to

247
0:10:45.67,000 --> 0:10:49,000
publish their peer-reviewed research on

248
0:10:47.949,000 --> 0:10:51,000
video there's a problem with the

249
0:10:50.17,000 --> 0:10:54,000
traditional scientific paper it could

250
0:10:52.51,000 --> 0:10:56,000
take months for a scientist in another

251
0:10:54.579,000 --> 0:10:58,000
lab to figure out how to replicate the

252
0:10:57.04,000 --> 0:11:01,000
experiments that are described in print

253
0:10:59.1,000 --> 0:11:03,000
here's one such frustrated scientist

254
0:11:01.14,000 --> 0:11:04,000
mosh pits further the under of Jove he

255
0:11:03.6,000 --> 0:11:07,000
told me that the world's wasting

256
0:11:04.95,000 --> 0:11:1,000
billions of dollars on this but look at

257
0:11:07.77,000 --> 0:11:13,000
this video I mean know if you can show

258
0:11:11.64,000 --> 0:11:15,000
us instead of just describing that

259
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
problem goes away so it's not

260
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
far-fetched to say that at some point

261
0:11:18.92,000 --> 0:11:23,000
online video is when a dramatically

262
0:11:21.15,000 --> 0:11:25,000
accelerate scientific advance here's

263
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:29,000
another example that's close to our

264
0:11:26.04,000 --> 0:11:31,000
hearts our Ted where video is sometimes

265
0:11:29.07,000 --> 0:11:35,000
more powerful than print the sharing of

266
0:11:31.53,000 --> 0:11:35,000
an idea why do people like watching TED

267
0:11:35.97,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Talks

268
0:11:36.42,000 --> 0:11:41,000
all those ideas already out there in

269
0:11:39.15,000 --> 0:11:44,000
print it's actually faster to read them

270
0:11:42.39,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to view why would someone bother well we

271
0:11:44.97,000 --> 0:11:47,000
see there's some showing as well as

272
0:11:46.08,000 --> 0:11:51,000
telling but even leaving the screen out

273
0:11:48.72,000 --> 0:11:52,000
of it there's still a lot more being

274
0:11:51.66,000 --> 0:11:54,000
transferred than just words and it's in

275
0:11:53.4,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that non verbal portion there's some

276
0:11:55.17,000 --> 0:12:01,000
serious magic somewhere hidden in the

277
0:11:58.83,000 --> 0:12:03,000
physical gestures the vocal cadence the

278
0:12:01.2,000 --> 0:12:07,000
facial expressions that eye contact

279
0:12:04.34,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the passion kind of awkward British body

280
0:12:07.98,000 --> 0:12:12,000
language the you know the sense of how

281
0:12:11.13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the audience are reacting that there are

282
0:12:12.99,000 --> 0:12:16,000
hundreds of subconscious clues that go

283
0:12:15.24,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to how well you will understand and

284
0:12:17.37,000 --> 0:12:23,000
whether you are inspired light if you

285
0:12:20.61,000 --> 0:12:25,000
like and desire and credibly all of this

286
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
can be communicated on just a few square

287
0:12:26.28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
inches of a screen reading and writing

288
0:12:29.46,000 --> 0:12:32,000
are actually relatively recent

289
0:12:31.02,000 --> 0:12:35,000
inventions face-to-face communication

290
0:12:33.42,000 --> 0:12:36,000
has been fine-tuned by millions of years

291
0:12:35.55,000 --> 0:12:38,000
of evolution that's what's made it into

292
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
this mysterious powerful thing it is

293
0:12:39.12,000 --> 0:12:43,000
someone speaks there's resonance in all

294
0:12:41.76,000 --> 0:12:45,000
these receding brains the whole group

295
0:12:43.77,000 --> 0:12:46,000
acts together I mean this is the

296
0:12:45.99,000 --> 0:12:48,000
connective tissue of the humans super

297
0:12:47.76,000 --> 0:12:51,000
organism in action it's probably driven

298
0:12:49.89,000 --> 0:12:53,000
our culture for millennia five hundred

299
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
years ago it ran into a competitor with

300
0:12:54.39,000 --> 0:13:01,000
a lethal advantage it's right here print

301
0:12:57.83,000 --> 0:13:02,000
scaled the world's ambitious innovators

302
0:13:02.19,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and influencers now could get their

303
0:13:03.69,000 --> 0:13:07,000
ideas to spread far and wide and so you

304
0:13:06.57,000 --> 0:13:09,000
know the art of the spoken word pretty

305
0:13:07.98,000 --> 0:13:11,000
much withered on the vine

306
0:13:10.05,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but now in the blink of an eye the game

307
0:13:12.839,000 --> 0:13:17,000
has changed again it's not too much to

308
0:13:16.05,000 --> 0:13:21,000
say that what Gutenberg did for writing

309
0:13:18.529,000 --> 0:13:24,000
online video can now do for face-to-face

310
0:13:21.54,000 --> 0:13:27,000
communication so that primal medium

311
0:13:24.72,000 --> 0:13:32,000
which your brain is exquisitely yi4 that

312
0:13:28.35,000 --> 0:13:35,000
just went global now this is big we we

313
0:13:33.45,000 --> 0:13:39,000
may have to reinvent an ancient art form

314
0:13:35.64,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I mean today one person speaking can be

315
0:13:39.81,000 --> 0:13:45,000
seen by millions shedding bright light

316
0:13:43.32,000 --> 0:13:48,000
on potent ideas creating intense desire

317
0:13:46.47,000 --> 0:13:52,000
for learning and to respond and in his

318
0:13:49.17,000 --> 0:13:56,000
case intense desire to laugh for the

319
0:13:52.769,000 --> 0:13:58,000
first time in human history talented

320
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:01,000
students don't have to have their

321
0:13:59.3,000 --> 0:14:03,000
potential in their dreams written out of

322
0:14:01.29,000 --> 0:14:06,000
history by lousy teachers they can sit

323
0:14:04.29,000 --> 0:14:1,000
two feet in front of the world's finest

324
0:14:06.35,000 --> 0:14:11,000
now Ted is just a small part of this I

325
0:14:10.529,000 --> 0:14:13,000
mean the world's universities are

326
0:14:12.18,000 --> 0:14:16,000
opening up their curricula thousands of

327
0:14:14.22,000 --> 0:14:18,000
individuals and organizations are

328
0:14:16.68,000 --> 0:14:19,000
showing their knowledge and data online

329
0:14:18.329,000 --> 0:14:23,000
thousands of people are figuring out new

330
0:14:20.279,000 --> 0:14:26,000
ways to learn and crucially to respond

331
0:14:24.149,000 --> 0:14:29,000
completing the cycle and so as we've

332
0:14:27.12,000 --> 0:14:32,000
thought about this you know it's become

333
0:14:29.76,000 --> 0:14:34,000
clear to us what the next stage of Ted's

334
0:14:32.279,000 --> 0:14:38,000
evolution has to be TED Talks can't be a

335
0:14:34.98,000 --> 0:14:4,000
one-way process one too many our future

336
0:14:38.67,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is many too many so we're dreaming of

337
0:14:41.97,000 --> 0:14:45,000
ways to make it easier for you the

338
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
global tech community to respond to

339
0:14:46.74,000 --> 0:14:51,000
speakers to contribute your own ideas

340
0:14:49.23,000 --> 0:14:54,000
maybe even your own TED Talks and to

341
0:14:52.5,000 --> 0:14:55,000
help shine a light on the very best of

342
0:14:54.27,000 --> 0:14:57,000
what's out there because if we can

343
0:14:56.13,000 --> 0:15:02,000
bubble up the very best from a vastly

344
0:14:58.11,000 --> 0:15:05,000
larger pool this wheel turns now is it

345
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:07,000
possible to imagine a similar process to

346
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:1,000
this happening to global education

347
0:15:07.47,000 --> 0:15:14,000
overall I mean does it have to be this

348
0:15:10.49,000 --> 0:15:16,000
painful top-down process why not a self

349
0:15:15.3,000 --> 0:15:17,000
fueling cycle in which we all can

350
0:15:17.13,000 --> 0:15:21,000
participate

351
0:15:17.73,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it's the participation age right schools

352
0:15:21.959,000 --> 0:15:27,000
can't be silos

353
0:15:23.58,000 --> 0:15:31,000
can't stop learning age 21 what if in

354
0:15:28.44,000 --> 0:15:35,000
the coming proud of 9 billion what if

355
0:15:32.279,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that crowd could learn enough to be net

356
0:15:35.49,000 --> 0:15:41,000
contributors instead of net plunderers

357
0:15:38.69,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that changes everything right I mean

358
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that would take more teachers than we've

359
0:15:43.29,000 --> 0:15:48,000
ever had but the good news is they are

360
0:15:45.839,000 --> 0:15:49,000
out there they're in the crowd and the

361
0:15:48.72,000 --> 0:15:51,000
crowd is switching on lights and we can

362
0:15:50.399,000 --> 0:15:55,000
see them for the first time not was an

363
0:15:52.56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
undifferentiated mass of strangers but

364
0:15:55.62,000 --> 0:16:06,000
as individuals we can learn from who's

365
0:16:00.48,000 --> 0:16:08,000
the teacher you're the teacher you're

366
0:16:07.23,000 --> 0:16:11,000
part of the crowd that may be about to

367
0:16:09.36,000 --> 0:16:14,000
launch the biggest learning cycle in

368
0:16:12.209,000 --> 0:16:17,000
human history a cycle capable of

369
0:16:14.49,000 --> 0:16:22,000
carrying all of us to a smarter wiser

370
0:16:17.459,000 --> 0:16:24,000
more beautiful place here's a group of

371
0:16:23.339,000 --> 0:16:27,000
kids in a village in Pakistan near where

372
0:16:25.35,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I grew up well in five years each of

373
0:16:27.42,000 --> 0:16:3,000
these kids is gonna have access to a

374

cell phone capable a full-on web video

375
0:16:30.93,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and capable of uploading video to the

376
0:16:33.39,000 --> 0:16:37,000
web and is it crazy to think that this

377
0:16:35.64,000 --> 0:16:39,000
girl on the back of the right in 15

378
0:16:37.77,000 --> 0:16:4,000

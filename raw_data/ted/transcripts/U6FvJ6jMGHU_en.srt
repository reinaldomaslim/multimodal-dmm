2
0:00:15.985,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.

3
0:00:19.096,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.

4
0:00:22.496,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.

5
0:00:26.734,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.

6
0:00:30.528,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,

7
0:00:34.377,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.

8
0:00:38.178,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.

9
0:00:42.298,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,

10
0:00:45.433,000 --> 0:00:47,000
education is just not readily accessible.

11
0:00:48.138,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed

12
0:00:51.113,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in the days of apartheid for the white minority.

13
0:00:53.986,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots

14
0:00:56.686,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.

15
0:01:00.538,000 --> 0:01:03,000
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year

16
0:01:04.418,000 --> 0:01:05,000
at the University of Johannesburg.

17
0:01:06.254,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There were a handful of positions left open

18
0:01:08.385,000 --> 0:01:1,000
from the standard admissions process, and the night before

19
0:01:11.354,000 --> 0:01:13,000
they were supposed to open that for registration,

20
0:01:13.914,000 --> 0:01:17,000
thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,

21
0:01:17.966,000 --> 0:01:2,000
hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.

22
0:01:21.846,000 --> 0:01:23,000
When the gates opened, there was a stampede,

23
0:01:24.154,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and 20 people were injured and one woman died.

24
0:01:27.806,000 --> 0:01:28,000
She was a mother who gave her life

25
0:01:29.746,000 --> 0:01:33,000
trying to get her son a chance at a better life.

26
0:01:33.809,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But even in parts of the world like the United States

27
0:01:36.966,000 --> 0:01:4,000
where education is available, it might not be within reach.

28
0:01:41.322,000 --> 0:01:43,000
There has been much discussed in the last few years

29
0:01:43.994,000 --> 0:01:44,000
about the rising cost of health care.

30
0:01:45.983,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What might not be quite as obvious to people

31
0:01:48.625,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition

32
0:01:52.647,000 --> 0:01:54,000
has been increasing at almost twice the rate,

33
0:01:55.127,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for a total of 559 percent since 1985.

34
0:01:59.407,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This makes education unaffordable for many people.

35
0:02:03.941,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,

36
0:02:07.742,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the doors of opportunity might not open.

37
0:02:10.367,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Only a little over half of recent college graduates

38
0:02:13.574,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in the United States who get a higher education

39
0:02:15.887,000 --> 0:02:18,000
actually are working in jobs that require that education.

40
0:02:19.35,000 --> 0:02:2,000
This, of course, is not true for the students

41
0:02:21.19,000 --> 0:02:22,000
who graduate from the top institutions,

42
0:02:23.142,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but for many others, they do not get the value

43
0:02:25.774,000 --> 0:02:28,000
for their time and their effort.

44
0:02:29.31,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,

45
0:02:32.34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.

46
0:02:36.708,000 --> 0:02:39,000
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen

47
0:02:39.828,000 --> 0:02:42,000
when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.

48
0:02:43.727,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.

49
0:02:46.348,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.

50
0:02:48.86,000 --> 0:02:51,000
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by

51
0:02:51.979,000 --> 0:02:52,000
three big Stanford classes,

52
0:02:53.547,000 --> 0:02:56,000
each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.

53
0:02:57.427,000 --> 0:03:,000
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,

54
0:03:00.811,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague

55
0:03:02.731,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and cofounder Andrew Ng.

56
0:03:04.46,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.

57
0:03:06.779,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's a Machine Learning class,

58
0:03:07.988,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.

59
0:03:11.506,000 --> 0:03:14,000
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,

60
0:03:14.771,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it had 100,000 people registered.

61
0:03:17.387,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So to put that number in perspective,

62
0:03:19.396,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for Andrew to reach that same size audience

63
0:03:21.755,000 --> 0:03:22,000
by teaching a Stanford class,

64
0:03:23.581,000 --> 0:03:26,000
he would have to do that for 250 years.

65
0:03:27.507,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Of course, he'd get really bored.

66
0:03:30.993,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So, having seen the impact of this,

67
0:03:33.73,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,

68
0:03:36.858,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.

69
0:03:40.978,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So we formed Coursera,

70
0:03:42.473,000 --> 0:03:45,000
whose goal is to take the best courses

71
0:03:45.61,000 --> 0:03:48,000
from the best instructors at the best universities

72
0:03:48.927,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and provide it to everyone around the world for free.

73
0:03:52.955,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We currently have 43 courses on the platform

74
0:03:55.555,000 --> 0:03:58,000
from four universities across a range of disciplines,

75
0:03:58.754,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and let me show you a little bit of an overview

76
0:04:00.587,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of what that looks like.

77
0:04:03.865,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Video) Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.

78
0:04:05.078,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.

79
0:04:06.958,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.

80
0:04:10.229,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We get unbelievable segregation.

81
0:04:12.637,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future,

82
0:04:14.429,000 --> 0:04:16,000
you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.

83
0:04:16.807,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...

84
0:04:21.061,000 --> 0:04:24,000
RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.

85
0:04:24.726,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.

86
0:04:27.797,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.

87
0:04:30.774,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.

88
0:04:34.397,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.

89
0:04:38.013,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...

90
0:04:41.7,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Applause)

91
0:04:47.309,000 --> 0:04:49,000
DK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly,

92
0:04:49.583,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that students like getting the best content

93
0:04:51.821,000 --> 0:04:53,000
from the best universities for free.

94
0:04:54.708,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Since we opened the website in February,

95
0:04:57.23,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.

96
0:05:01.588,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We have 1.5 million enrollments,

97
0:05:03.74,000 --> 0:05:05,000
6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched

98
0:05:06.59,000 --> 0:05:1,000
so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.

99
0:05:11.506,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But it's not just about the numbers,

100
0:05:14.024,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it's also about the people.

101
0:05:15.665,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India

102
0:05:18.641,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and would never have access in this case

103
0:05:20.816,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to a Stanford-quality course

104
0:05:22.305,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and would never be able to afford it.

105
0:05:24.82,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two

106
0:05:26.858,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and wants to hone her skills

107
0:05:28.825,000 --> 0:05:31,000
so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.

108
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Or Ryan, who can't go to school,

109
0:05:35.096,000 --> 0:05:36,000
because his immune deficient daughter

110
0:05:36.961,000 --> 0:05:39,000
can't be risked to have germs come into the house,

111
0:05:40.344,000 --> 0:05:41,000
so he couldn't leave the house.

112
0:05:42.184,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I'm really glad to say --

113
0:05:43.816,000 --> 0:05:45,000
recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan --

114
0:05:46.068,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that this story had a happy ending.

115
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left --

116
0:05:49.903,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is doing much better now,

117
0:05:51.254,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.

118
0:05:55.452,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So what made these courses so different?

119
0:05:57.696,000 --> 0:06:,000
After all, online course content has been available for a while.

120
0:06:01.416,000 --> 0:06:04,000
What made it different was that this was real course experience.

121
0:06:05.128,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It started on a given day,

122
0:06:06.854,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis

123
0:06:10.488,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and do homework assignments.

124
0:06:12.343,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And these would be real homework assignments

125
0:06:14.134,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for a real grade, with a real deadline.

126
0:06:17.438,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.

127
0:06:19.494,000 --> 0:06:21,000
These are the spikes showing

128
0:06:21.582,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that procrastination is global phenomenon.

129
0:06:25.371,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:27.947,000 --> 0:06:28,000
At the end of the course,

131
0:06:29.619,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the students got a certificate.

132
0:06:31.475,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They could present that certificate

133
0:06:33.635,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to a prospective employer and get a better job,

134
0:06:35.788,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and we know many students who did.

135
0:06:37.848,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Some students took their certificate

136
0:06:39.767,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled

137
0:06:42.889,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for actual college credit.

138
0:06:44.73,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So these students were really getting something meaningful

139
0:06:46.944,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for their investment of time and effort.

140
0:06:49.778,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components

141
0:06:52.333,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that go into these courses.

142
0:06:54.225,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The first component is that when you move away

143
0:06:56.853,000 --> 0:06:58,000
from the constraints of a physical classroom

144
0:06:59.15,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and design content explicitly for an online format,

145
0:07:01.99,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you can break away from, for example,

146
0:07:04.518,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the monolithic one-hour lecture.

147
0:07:06.933,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You can break up the material, for example,

148
0:07:08.718,000 --> 0:07:11,000
into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,

149
0:07:12.094,000 --> 0:07:14,000
each of which represents a coherent concept.

150
0:07:15.068,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Students can traverse this material in different ways,

151
0:07:17.638,000 --> 0:07:2,000
depending on their background, their skills or their interests.

152
0:07:21.342,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So, for example, some students might benefit

153
0:07:23.862,000 --> 0:07:25,000
from a little bit of preparatory material

154
0:07:26.622,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that other students might already have.

155
0:07:28.693,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Other students might be interested in a particular

156
0:07:31.133,000 --> 0:07:34,000
enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.

157
0:07:34.219,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So this format allows us to break away

158
0:07:37.454,000 --> 0:07:39,000
from the one-size-fits-all model of education,

159
0:07:40.278,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.

160
0:07:44.27,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Of course, we all know as educators

161
0:07:46.613,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.

162
0:07:49.973,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort

163
0:07:52.918,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is that we need to have students

164
0:07:55.51,000 --> 0:07:57,000
who practice with the material

165
0:07:57.919,000 --> 0:08:,000
in order to really understand it.

166
0:08:01.075,000 --> 0:08:04,000
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.

167
0:08:04.343,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example,

168
0:08:06.875,000 --> 0:08:08,000
demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,

169
0:08:09.707,000 --> 0:08:11,000
where students are just supposed to repeat

170
0:08:12.499,000 --> 0:08:13,000
what they already learned

171
0:08:13.899,000 --> 0:08:14,000
gives considerably improved results

172
0:08:15.819,000 --> 0:08:17,000
on various achievement tests down the line

173
0:08:18.088,000 --> 0:08:22,000
than many other educational interventions.

174
0:08:22.392,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,

175
0:08:25.354,000 --> 0:08:27,000
as well as other forms of practice in many ways.

176
0:08:27.608,000 --> 0:08:31,000
For example, even our videos are not just videos.

177
0:08:31.752,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Every few minutes, the video pauses

178
0:08:33.795,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and the students get asked a question.

179
0:08:35.946,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,

180
0:08:38.167,000 --> 0:08:41,000
status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.

181
0:08:41.259,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.

182
0:08:44.026,000 --> 0:08:45,000
DK: So here the video pauses,

183
0:08:45.65,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and the student types in the answer into the box

184
0:08:47.906,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.

185
0:08:51.144,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:52.013,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So they get to try again,

187
0:08:54.023,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and this time they got it right.

188
0:08:56.559,000 --> 0:08:58,000
There's an optional explanation if they want.

189
0:08:58.752,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.

190
0:09:03.009,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This is a kind of simple question

191
0:09:04.887,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that I as an instructor might ask in class,

192
0:09:06.968,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but when I ask that kind of a question in class,

193
0:09:09.468,000 --> 0:09:1,000
80 percent of the students

194
0:09:10.768,000 --> 0:09:11,000
are still scribbling the last thing I said,

195
0:09:12.634,000 --> 0:09:15,000
15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,

196
0:09:15.955,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and then there's the smarty pants in the front row

197
0:09:18.411,000 --> 0:09:19,000
who blurts out the answer

198
0:09:19.77,000 --> 0:09:21,000
before anyone else has had a chance to think about it,

199
0:09:21.977,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and I as the instructor am terribly gratified

200
0:09:24.849,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that somebody actually knew the answer.

201
0:09:26.497,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so the lecture moves on before, really,

202
0:09:29.289,000 --> 0:09:32,000
most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.

203
0:09:32.818,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Here, every single student

204
0:09:35.425,000 --> 0:09:37,000
has to engage with the material.

205
0:09:38.209,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And of course these simple retrieval questions

206
0:09:40.145,000 --> 0:09:41,000
are not the end of the story.

207
0:09:41.807,000 --> 0:09:43,000
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,

208
0:09:44.777,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and one also needs to provide the students with feedback

209
0:09:47.13,000 --> 0:09:48,000
on those questions.

210
0:09:48.793,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students

211
0:09:51.681,000 --> 0:09:54,000
if you do not have 10,000 TAs?

212
0:09:54.763,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The answer is, you need to use technology

213
0:09:57.117,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to do it for you.

214
0:09:58.612,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way,

215
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.

216
0:10:04.528,000 --> 0:10:05,000
In addition to multiple choice

217
0:10:06.055,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,

218
0:10:09.208,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we can also grade math, mathematical expressions

219
0:10:12.468,000 --> 0:10:13,000
as well as mathematical derivations.

220
0:10:14.42,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We can grade models, whether it's

221
0:10:17.294,000 --> 0:10:19,000
financial models in a business class

222
0:10:19.47,000 --> 0:10:21,000
or physical models in a science or engineering class

223
0:10:22.454,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.

224
0:10:26.198,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple

225
0:10:28.117,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but fairly visual.

226
0:10:29.597,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,

227
0:10:32.074,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and the students are supposed to color-correct

228
0:10:33.678,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that blurry red image.

229
0:10:35.27,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They're typing their program into the browser,

230
0:10:37.288,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.

231
0:10:41.346,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,

232
0:10:45.102,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and they can move on to the next assignment.

233
0:10:47.461,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This ability to interact actively with the material

234
0:10:50.609,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and be told when you're right or wrong

235
0:10:52.293,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is really essential to student learning.

236
0:10:55.419,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now, of course we cannot yet grade

237
0:10:57.694,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the range of work that one needs for all courses.

238
0:11:00.528,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work

239
0:11:03.829,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that is so essential in such disciplines

240
0:11:05.751,000 --> 0:11:08,000
as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.

241
0:11:09.348,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So we tried to convince, for example,

242
0:11:11.597,000 --> 0:11:12,000
some of our humanities faculty

243
0:11:13.213,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.

244
0:11:15.909,000 --> 0:11:17,000
That didn't go over really well.

245
0:11:18.1,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So we had to come up with a different solution.

246
0:11:20.533,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.

247
0:11:23.607,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It turns out that previous studies show,

248
0:11:26.029,000 --> 0:11:27,000
like this one by Saddler and Good,

249
0:11:27.701,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy

250
0:11:30.189,000 --> 0:11:33,000
for providing reproducible grades.

251
0:11:33.403,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It was tried only in small classes,

252
0:11:35.173,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but there it showed, for example,

253
0:11:36.66,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis

254
0:11:39.142,000 --> 0:11:4,000
are actually very well correlated

255
0:11:40.453,000 --> 0:11:42,000
with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.

256
0:11:42.749,000 --> 0:11:45,000
What's even more surprising is that self-grades,

257
0:11:45.909,000 --> 0:11:47,000
where the students grade their own work critically --

258
0:11:48.22,000 --> 0:11:49,000
so long as you incentivize them properly

259
0:11:49.957,000 --> 0:11:5,000
so they can't give themselves a perfect score --

260
0:11:51.895,000 --> 0:11:54,000
are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.

261
0:11:55.086,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And so this is an effective strategy

262
0:11:56.693,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that can be used for grading at scale,

263
0:11:58.797,000 --> 0:12:,000
and is also a useful learning strategy for the students,

264
0:12:01.533,000 --> 0:12:03,000
because they actually learn from the experience.

265
0:12:03.788,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,

266
0:12:08.437,000 --> 0:12:1,000
where tens of thousands of students

267
0:12:10.941,000 --> 0:12:11,000
are grading each other's work,

268
0:12:12.139,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and quite successfully, I have to say.

269
0:12:15.208,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But this is not just about students

270
0:12:17.468,000 --> 0:12:2,000
sitting alone in their living room working through problems.

271
0:12:20.509,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Around each one of our courses,

272
0:12:22.316,000 --> 0:12:24,000
a community of students had formed,

273
0:12:24.476,000 --> 0:12:25,000
a global community of people

274
0:12:26.356,000 --> 0:12:28,000
around a shared intellectual endeavor.

275
0:12:28.888,000 --> 0:12:3,000
What you see here is a self-generated map

276
0:12:31.54,000 --> 0:12:33,000
from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,

277
0:12:34.501,000 --> 0:12:36,000
where they have put themselves on a world map,

278
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.

279
0:12:40.22,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.

280
0:12:44.787,000 --> 0:12:46,000
First of all, there was a question and answer forum,

281
0:12:47.426,000 --> 0:12:49,000
where students would pose questions,

282
0:12:49.57,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and other students would answer those questions.

283
0:12:51.994,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And the really amazing thing is,

284
0:12:53.707,000 --> 0:12:54,000
because there were so many students,

285
0:12:55.377,000 --> 0:12:57,000
it means that even if a student posed a question

286
0:12:57.742,000 --> 0:12:58,000
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

287
0:12:59.374,000 --> 0:13:,000
somewhere around the world,

288
0:13:00.956,000 --> 0:13:02,000
there would be somebody who was awake

289
0:13:03.03,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and working on the same problem.

290
0:13:05.343,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And so, in many of our courses,

291
0:13:07.301,000 --> 0:13:09,000
the median response time for a question

292
0:13:09.63,000 --> 0:13:12,000
on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.

293
0:13:13.048,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.

294
0:13:17.625,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Laughter)

295
0:13:18.966,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And you can see from the student testimonials

296
0:13:20.908,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that students actually find

297
0:13:22.595,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that because of this large online community,

298
0:13:25.116,000 --> 0:13:27,000
they got to interact with each other in many ways

299
0:13:27.715,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.

300
0:13:31.908,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Students also self-assembled,

301
0:13:34.252,000 --> 0:13:35,000
without any kind of intervention from us,

302
0:13:36.115,000 --> 0:13:37,000
into small study groups.

303
0:13:38.018,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Some of these were physical study groups

304
0:13:40.38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
along geographical constraints

305
0:13:42.206,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.

306
0:13:44.928,000 --> 0:13:45,000
This is the San Francisco study group,

307
0:13:46.828,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but there were ones all over the world.

308
0:13:49.147,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Others were virtual study groups,

309
0:13:51.179,000 --> 0:13:53,000
sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,

310
0:13:54.168,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and on the bottom left there,

311
0:13:55.612,000 --> 0:13:58,000
you see our multicultural universal study group

312
0:13:59.408,000 --> 0:14:,000
where people explicitly wanted to connect

313
0:14:01.171,000 --> 0:14:04,000
with people from other cultures.

314
0:14:04.177,000 --> 0:14:06,000
There are some tremendous opportunities

315
0:14:06.288,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to be had from this kind of framework.

316
0:14:09.613,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The first is that it has the potential of giving us

317
0:14:13.267,000 --> 0:14:15,000
a completely unprecedented look

318
0:14:15.701,000 --> 0:14:17,000
into understanding human learning.

319
0:14:17.99,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.

320
0:14:21.453,000 --> 0:14:25,000
You can collect every click, every homework submission,

321
0:14:25.462,000 --> 0:14:29,000
every forum post from tens of thousands of students.

322
0:14:29.825,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So you can turn the study of human learning

323
0:14:32.168,000 --> 0:14:33,000
from the hypothesis-driven mode

324
0:14:34.101,000 --> 0:14:36,000
to the data-driven mode, a transformation that,

325
0:14:36.959,000 --> 0:14:39,000
for example, has revolutionized biology.

326
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions

327
0:14:43.424,000 --> 0:14:44,000
like, what are good learning strategies

328
0:14:45.304,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that are effective versus ones that are not?

329
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And in the context of particular courses,

330
0:14:50.24,000 --> 0:14:51,000
you can ask questions

331
0:14:51.777,000 --> 0:14:54,000
like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common

332
0:14:55.032,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and how do we help students fix them?

333
0:14:57.209,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So here's an example of that,

334
0:14:58.633,000 --> 0:15:,000
also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.

335
0:15:00.649,000 --> 0:15:02,000
This is a distribution of wrong answers

336
0:15:02.857,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to one of Andrew's assignments.

337
0:15:04.467,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers,

338
0:15:06.36,000 --> 0:15:08,000
so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.

339
0:15:08.631,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.

340
0:15:12.409,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The big cross at the top left

341
0:15:14.815,000 --> 0:15:16,000
is where 2,000 students

342
0:15:16.963,000 --> 0:15:19,000
gave the exact same wrong answer.

343
0:15:20.008,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Now, if two students in a class of 100

344
0:15:22.335,000 --> 0:15:23,000
give the same wrong answer,

345
0:15:23.622,000 --> 0:15:24,000
you would never notice.

346
0:15:24.973,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,

347
0:15:27.533,000 --> 0:15:28,000
it's kind of hard to miss.

348
0:15:29.23,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So Andrew and his students went in,

349
0:15:31.422,000 --> 0:15:32,000
looked at some of those assignments,

350
0:15:32.942,000 --> 0:15:36,000
understood the root cause of the misconception,

351
0:15:37.03,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and then they produced a targeted error message

352
0:15:39.55,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that would be provided to every student

353
0:15:41.799,000 --> 0:15:43,000
whose answer fell into that bucket,

354
0:15:43.978,000 --> 0:15:45,000
which means that students who made that same mistake

355
0:15:46.062,000 --> 0:15:48,000
would now get personalized feedback

356
0:15:48.088,000 --> 0:15:52,000
telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.

357
0:15:52.487,000 --> 0:15:55,000
So this personalization is something that one can then build

358
0:15:56.298,000 --> 0:15:59,000
by having the virtue of large numbers.

359
0:15:59.438,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Personalization is perhaps

360
0:16:01.75,000 --> 0:16:03,000
one of the biggest opportunities here as well,

361
0:16:04.173,000 --> 0:16:06,000
because it provides us with the potential

362
0:16:06.518,000 --> 0:16:08,000
of solving a 30-year-old problem.

363
0:16:09.208,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,

364
0:16:12.557,000 --> 0:16:14,000
posed what's called the 2 sigma problem,

365
0:16:14.808,000 --> 0:16:17,000
which he observed by studying three populations.

366
0:16:17.87,000 --> 0:16:2,000
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.

367
0:16:21.478,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The second is a population of students that studied

368
0:16:24.255,000 --> 0:16:25,000
using a standard lecture-based classroom,

369
0:16:25.974,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but with a mastery-based approach,

370
0:16:28.054,000 --> 0:16:29,000
so the students couldn't move on to the next topic

371
0:16:29.974,000 --> 0:16:32,000
before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.

372
0:16:33.328,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And finally, there was a population of students

373
0:16:35.622,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.

374
0:16:40.15,000 --> 0:16:43,000
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,

375
0:16:43.422,000 --> 0:16:45,000
or sigma, in achievement scores better

376
0:16:45.71,000 --> 0:16:47,000
than the standard lecture-based class,

377
0:16:48.104,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma

378
0:16:50.248,000 --> 0:16:51,000
improvement in performance.

379
0:16:52.078,000 --> 0:16:53,000
To understand what that means,

380
0:16:53.541,000 --> 0:16:54,000
let's look at the lecture-based classroom,

381
0:16:55.374,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.

382
0:16:58.293,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So in a lecture-based class,

383
0:16:59.631,000 --> 0:17:02,000
half the students are above that level and half are below.

384
0:17:03.51,000 --> 0:17:05,000
In the individual tutoring instruction,

385
0:17:05.608,000 --> 0:17:09,000
98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.

386
0:17:10.409,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students

387
0:17:14.329,000 --> 0:17:16,000
would be above average.

388
0:17:16.527,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.

389
0:17:19.95,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Because we cannot afford, as a society,

390
0:17:22.349,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to provide every student with an individual human tutor.

391
0:17:25.421,000 --> 0:17:27,000
But maybe we can afford to provide each student

392
0:17:27.67,000 --> 0:17:29,000
with a computer or a smartphone.

393
0:17:29.689,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So the question is, how can we use technology

394
0:17:31.878,000 --> 0:17:34,000
to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,

395
0:17:35.253,000 --> 0:17:37,000
to the right side with the green curve?

396
0:17:37.991,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer,

397
0:17:40.328,000 --> 0:17:41,000
because a computer doesn't get tired

398
0:17:41.733,000 --> 0:17:44,000
of showing you the same video five times.

399
0:17:44.806,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,

400
0:17:48.062,000 --> 0:17:51,000
we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.

401
0:17:51.088,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And even personalization

402
0:17:52.942,000 --> 0:17:54,000
is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of,

403
0:17:55.078,000 --> 0:17:58,000
whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum

404
0:17:58.27,000 --> 0:18:01,000
or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.

405
0:18:01.534,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So the goal here is to try and push,

406
0:18:04.022,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and see how far we can get towards the green curve.

407
0:18:07.519,000 --> 0:18:12,000
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?

408
0:18:12.878,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.

409
0:18:15.87,000 --> 0:18:17,000
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes

410
0:18:18.415,000 --> 0:18:19,000
go straight to the students' lecture notes,

411
0:18:20.118,000 --> 0:18:22,000
without passing through the brains of either."

412
0:18:22.494,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Laughter)

413
0:18:26.541,000 --> 0:18:28,000
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.

414
0:18:29.209,000 --> 0:18:31,000
I think what he was complaining about is not

415
0:18:31.874,000 --> 0:18:33,000
universities but rather the lecture-based format

416
0:18:34.624,000 --> 0:18:36,000
that so many universities spend so much time on.

417
0:18:37.408,000 --> 0:18:4,000
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch,

418
0:18:40.567,000 --> 0:18:42,000
who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,

419
0:18:42.794,000 --> 0:18:44,000
but wood that needs igniting."

420
0:18:44.817,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And maybe we should spend less time at universities

421
0:18:47.007,000 --> 0:18:49,000
filling our students' minds with content

422
0:18:49.578,000 --> 0:18:52,000
by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,

423
0:18:53.378,000 --> 0:18:56,000
their imagination and their problem-solving skills

424
0:18:56.633,000 --> 0:18:58,000
by actually talking with them.

425
0:18:59.131,000 --> 0:19:,000
So how do we do that?

426
0:19:00.498,000 --> 0:19:03,000
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.

427
0:19:03.929,000 --> 0:19:05,000
So there's been many studies, including this one,

428
0:19:06.378,000 --> 0:19:08,000
that show that if you use active learning,

429
0:19:08.458,000 --> 0:19:1,000
interacting with your students in the classroom,

430
0:19:10.874,000 --> 0:19:12,000
performance improves on every single metric --

431
0:19:13.57,000 --> 0:19:15,000
on attendance, on engagement and on learning

432
0:19:16.019,000 --> 0:19:18,000
as measured by a standardized test.

433
0:19:18.074,000 --> 0:19:19,000
You can see, for example, that the achievement score

434
0:19:19.938,000 --> 0:19:21,000
almost doubles in this particular experiment.

435
0:19:22.808,000 --> 0:19:26,000
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.

436
0:19:27.209,000 --> 0:19:31,000
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education

437
0:19:31.786,000 --> 0:19:32,000
to everyone around the world for free,

438
0:19:33.689,000 --> 0:19:35,000
what would that do? Three things.

439
0:19:36.51,000 --> 0:19:39,000
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right,

440
0:19:39.931,000 --> 0:19:4,000
where anyone around the world

441
0:19:41.297,000 --> 0:19:42,000
with the ability and the motivation

442
0:19:43.218,000 --> 0:19:44,000
could get the skills that they need

443
0:19:45.169,000 --> 0:19:46,000
to make a better life for themselves,

444
0:19:46.754,000 --> 0:19:48,000
their families and their communities.

445
0:19:48.771,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.

446
0:19:51.402,000 --> 0:19:52,000
It's a shame that for so many people,

447
0:19:53.353,000 --> 0:19:56,000
learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.

448
0:19:56.665,000 --> 0:19:58,000
By having this amazing content be available,

449
0:19:59.146,000 --> 0:20:01,000
we would be able to learn something new

450
0:20:01.889,000 --> 0:20:02,000
every time we wanted,

451
0:20:03.025,000 --> 0:20:04,000
whether it's just to expand our minds

452
0:20:04.354,000 --> 0:20:05,000
or it's to change our lives.

453
0:20:06.313,000 --> 0:20:09,000
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,

454
0:20:09.458,000 --> 0:20:12,000
because amazing talent can be found anywhere.

455
0:20:12.53,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs

456
0:20:15.538,000 --> 0:20:17,000
is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.

457
0:20:18.153,000 --> 0:20:2,000
And if we could offer that person an education,

458
0:20:20.809,000 --> 0:20:22,000
they would be able to come up with the next big idea

459
0:20:23.165,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and make the world a better place for all of us.

460
0:20:25.569,000 --> 0:20:26,000
Thank you very much.

461
0:20:26.729,000 --> 0:20:33,000
(Applause)

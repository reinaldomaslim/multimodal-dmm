2
0:00:15.741,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We live in an incredibly busy world.

3
0:00:18.333,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The pace of life is often frantic, our minds are always busy,

4
0:00:21.854,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and we're always doing something.

5
0:00:24.055,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So with that in mind, I'd like you just to take a moment

6
0:00:26.771,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to think, when did you last take any time to do nothing?

7
0:00:32.079,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?

8
0:00:34.608,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.

9
0:00:36.885,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So that's no emailing, texting, no Internet,

10
0:00:39.505,000 --> 0:00:41,000
no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.

11
0:00:43.563,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Not even sitting there reminiscing about the past

12
0:00:45.873,000 --> 0:00:46,000
or planning for the future.

13
0:00:48.014,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Simply doing nothing.

14
0:00:51.7,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I see a lot of very blank faces.

15
0:00:53.283,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:54.308,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You probably have to go a long way back.

17
0:00:56.251,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And this is an extraordinary thing, right?

18
0:00:58.283,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We're talking about our mind.

19
0:01:00.403,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The mind, our most valuable and precious resource,

20
0:01:03.691,000 --> 0:01:06,000
through which we experience every single moment of our life.

21
0:01:07.707,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The mind that we rely upon

22
0:01:09.883,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to be happy, content, emotionally stable as individuals,

23
0:01:14.381,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and at the same time, to be kind and thoughtful

24
0:01:16.785,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and considerate in our relationships with others.

25
0:01:20.509,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This is the same mind that we depend upon

26
0:01:22.621,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to be focused, creative, spontaneous,

27
0:01:26.117,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and to perform at our very best in everything that we do.

28
0:01:30.172,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And yet, we don't take any time out to look after it.

29
0:01:34.273,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In fact, we spend more time looking after our cars,

30
0:01:37.31,000 --> 0:01:38,000
our clothes and our hair than we --

31
0:01:39.317,000 --> 0:01:4,000
okay, maybe not our hair,

32
0:01:40.588,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:41.613,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but you see where I'm going.

34
0:01:43.387,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The result, of course, is that we get stressed.

35
0:01:46.074,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You know, the mind whizzes away like a washing machine

36
0:01:48.823,000 --> 0:01:51,000
going round and round, lots of difficult, confusing emotions,

37
0:01:52.239,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and we don't really know how to deal with that.

38
0:01:57.572,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the sad fact is that we are so distracted

39
0:02:01.064,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that we're no longer present in the world in which we live.

40
0:02:05.619,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We miss out on the things that are most important to us,

41
0:02:08.951,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes,

42
0:02:11.382,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that's the way life is, so we've just kind of got to get on with it.

43
0:02:14.745,000 --> 0:02:15,000
That's really not how it has to be.

44
0:02:16.979,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class.

45
0:02:21.419,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And trust me, it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine,

46
0:02:24.643,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the sitting cross-legged on the floor,

47
0:02:27.038,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the incense, the herbal tea, the vegetarians, the whole deal,

48
0:02:30.437,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but my mom was going and I was intrigued, so I went along with her.

49
0:02:34.23,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'd also seen a few kung fu movies,

50
0:02:36.235,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly,

51
0:02:39.605,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but I was very young at the time.

52
0:02:42.319,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now as I was there, I guess, like a lot of people,

53
0:02:45.43,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind.

54
0:02:49.094,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You get stressed, you do some meditation.

55
0:02:51.071,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I hadn't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature,

56
0:02:54.916,000 --> 0:02:57,000
until I was about 20, when a number of things happened in my life

57
0:02:58.575,000 --> 0:03:,000
in quite quick succession,

58
0:03:01.009,000 --> 0:03:04,000
really serious things which just flipped my life upside down

59
0:03:04.476,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts,

60
0:03:07.398,000 --> 0:03:1,000
inundated with difficult emotions that I didn't know how to cope with.

61
0:03:10.979,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Every time I sort of pushed one down,

62
0:03:13.019,000 --> 0:03:14,000
another one would pop back up again.

63
0:03:14.844,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It was a really very stressful time.

64
0:03:17.08,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I guess we all deal with stress in different ways.

65
0:03:21.398,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Some people will bury themselves in work, grateful for the distraction.

66
0:03:26.008,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Others will turn to their friends, their family, looking for support.

67
0:03:29.318,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Some people hit the bottle, start taking medication.

68
0:03:33.212,000 --> 0:03:35,000
My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk.

69
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So I quit my degree, I headed off to the Himalayas,

70
0:03:39.917,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I became a monk, and I started studying meditation.

71
0:03:43.433,000 --> 0:03:47,000
People often ask me what I learned from that time.

72
0:03:47.494,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Well, obviously it changed things.

73
0:03:49.73,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Let's face it, becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things.

74
0:03:53.744,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But it was more than that.

75
0:03:56.324,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It taught me -- it gave me a greater appreciation,

76
0:03:59.663,000 --> 0:04:02,000
an understanding for the present moment.

77
0:04:03.322,000 --> 0:04:06,000
By that I mean not being lost in thought,

78
0:04:07.282,000 --> 0:04:08,000
not being distracted,

79
0:04:09.118,000 --> 0:04:12,000
not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions,

80
0:04:12.933,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but instead learning how to be in the here and now,

81
0:04:16.486,000 --> 0:04:18,000
how to be mindful, how to be present.

82
0:04:19.42,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I think the present moment is so underrated.

83
0:04:22.885,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It sounds so ordinary,

84
0:04:24.672,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and yet we spend so little time in the present moment

85
0:04:28.391,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that it's anything but ordinary.

86
0:04:30.756,000 --> 0:04:33,000
There was a research paper that came out of Harvard, just recently,

87
0:04:34.565,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that said on average, our minds are lost in thought

88
0:04:37.355,000 --> 0:04:39,000
almost 47 percent of the time.

89
0:04:40.34,000 --> 0:04:41,000
47 percent.

90
0:04:42.387,000 --> 0:04:44,000
At the same time, this sort of constant mind-wandering

91
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is also a direct cause of unhappiness.

92
0:04:47.919,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now we're not here for that long anyway,

93
0:04:52.987,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought

94
0:04:57.213,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and potentially quite unhappy,

95
0:04:59.219,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I don't know, it just kind of seems tragic, actually,

96
0:05:01.916,000 --> 0:05:03,000
especially when there's something we can do about it,

97
0:05:04.873,000 --> 0:05:07,000
when there's a positive, practical, achievable,

98
0:05:08.521,000 --> 0:05:1,000
scientifically proven technique

99
0:05:11.505,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which allows our mind to be more healthy,

100
0:05:13.731,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to be more mindful and less distracted.

101
0:05:17.879,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And the beauty of it is that even though

102
0:05:20.298,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it need only take about 10 minutes a day,

103
0:05:22.697,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it impacts our entire life.

104
0:05:26.455,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But we need to know how to do it.

105
0:05:28.175,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We need an exercise.

106
0:05:29.435,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful.

107
0:05:32.577,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's essentially what meditation is.

108
0:05:34.5,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment.

109
0:05:37.015,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way

110
0:05:40.07,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to get the best from it.

111
0:05:41.951,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And that's what these are for, in case you've been wondering,

112
0:05:44.921,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because most people assume

113
0:05:47.182,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that meditation is all about stopping thoughts,

114
0:05:49.937,000 --> 0:05:52,000
getting rid of emotions, somehow controlling the mind,

115
0:05:52.998,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but actually it's quite different from that.

116
0:05:55.598,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's more about stepping back,

117
0:05:57.983,000 --> 0:05:59,000
sort of seeing the thought clearly,

118
0:06:00.343,000 --> 0:06:02,000
witnessing it coming and going, emotions coming and going

119
0:06:03.082,000 --> 0:06:07,000
without judgment, but with a relaxed, focused mind.

120
0:06:08.722,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So for example, right now,

121
0:06:10.857,000 --> 0:06:12,000
if I focus too much on the balls,

122
0:06:13.318,000 --> 0:06:16,000
then there's no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time.

123
0:06:16.469,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Equally, if I relax too much talking to you,

124
0:06:18.597,000 --> 0:06:19,000
there's no way I can focus on the balls.

125
0:06:20.527,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I'm going to drop them.

126
0:06:21.733,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Now in life, and in meditation,

127
0:06:24.375,000 --> 0:06:27,000
there'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense,

128
0:06:27.795,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and life starts to feel a bit like this.

129
0:06:31.802,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It's a very uncomfortable way to live life,

130
0:06:33.963,000 --> 0:06:34,000
when you get this tight and stressed.

131
0:06:36.079,000 --> 0:06:39,000
At other times, we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much,

132
0:06:39.584,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and things just become a sort of little bit like this.

133
0:06:42.18,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Of course in meditation --

134
0:06:43.869,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Snores)

135
0:06:44.894,000 --> 0:06:45,000
we're going to end up falling asleep.

136
0:06:46.703,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So we're looking for a balance, a focused relaxation

137
0:06:49.429,000 --> 0:06:52,000
where we can allow thoughts to come and go

138
0:06:52.465,000 --> 0:06:54,000
without all the usual involvement.

139
0:06:55.198,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Now, what usually happens when we're learning to be mindful

140
0:06:58.496,000 --> 0:07:,000
is that we get distracted by a thought.

141
0:07:01.44,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Let's say this is an anxious thought.

142
0:07:03.236,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Everything's going fine, and we see the anxious thought.

143
0:07:05.886,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"Oh, I didn't realize I was worried about that."

144
0:07:08.433,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You go back to it, repeat it.

145
0:07:09.909,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"Oh, I am worried.

146
0:07:11.096,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I really am worried. Wow, there's so much anxiety."

147
0:07:13.555,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And before we know it, right,

148
0:07:15.339,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we're anxious about feeling anxious.

149
0:07:18.301,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:19.333,000 --> 0:07:2,000
You know, this is crazy.

151
0:07:20.674,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We do this all the time, even on an everyday level.

152
0:07:23.837,000 --> 0:07:27,000
If you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth.

153
0:07:29.14,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You know it's wobbly, and you know that it hurts.

154
0:07:32.46,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?

155
0:07:35.997,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Mumbling)

156
0:07:37.902,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It does hurt.

157
0:07:39.095,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And we reinforce the storyline, right?

158
0:07:41.664,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And we just keep telling ourselves, and we do it all the time.

159
0:07:44.645,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way

160
0:07:47.357,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind.

161
0:07:51.789,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way,

162
0:07:54.49,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you might see many different patterns.

163
0:07:56.369,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You might find a mind that's really restless and --

164
0:07:59.026,000 --> 0:08:,000
the whole time.

165
0:08:00.867,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Don't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body

166
0:08:04.041,000 --> 0:08:07,000
when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that.

167
0:08:07.802,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You might find a mind that's very dull

168
0:08:10.202,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and boring, and it's just, almost mechanical,

169
0:08:12.538,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it just seems it's as if you're getting up, going to work,

170
0:08:15.741,000 --> 0:08:16,000
eat, sleep, get up, work.

171
0:08:18.222,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Or it might just be that one little nagging thought

172
0:08:20.746,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that just goes round and round your mind.

173
0:08:25.9,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Well, whatever it is,

174
0:08:27.266,000 --> 0:08:32,000
meditation offers the opportunity, the potential to step back

175
0:08:32.905,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and to get a different perspective,

176
0:08:35.443,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to see that things aren't always as they appear.

177
0:08:40.315,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We can't change every little thing that happens to us in life,

178
0:08:46.053,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but we can change the way that we experience it.

179
0:08:49.484,000 --> 0:08:52,000
That's the potential of meditation, of mindfulness.

180
0:08:53.221,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You don't have to burn any incense,

181
0:08:55.795,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and you definitely don't have to sit on the floor.

182
0:08:58.2,000 --> 0:09:01,000
All you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day

183
0:09:02.113,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to step back, to familiarize yourself with the present moment

184
0:09:05.65,000 --> 0:09:07,000
so that you get to experience a greater sense

185
0:09:08.336,000 --> 0:09:11,000
of focus, calm and clarity in your life.

186
0:09:12.747,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Thank you very much.

187
0:09:13.969,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Applause)

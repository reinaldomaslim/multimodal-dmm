2
0:00:13.809,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal.

3
0:00:19.026,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I don't think anyone in this room would disagree.

4
0:00:22.512,000 --> 0:00:26,000
What worries me is when politicians with money

5
0:00:27.06,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and charismatic rock stars --

6
0:00:29.705,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:31.309,000 --> 0:00:32,000
use the words,

8
0:00:32.65,000 --> 0:00:36,000
" ... it all just sounds so, so simple."

9
0:00:39.073,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now, I've got no bucket of money today

10
0:00:42.189,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and I've got no policy to release,

11
0:00:45.404,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I certainly haven't got a guitar.

12
0:00:47.667,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'll leave that to others.

13
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But I do have an idea,

14
0:00:52.146,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and that idea is called Housing for Health.

15
0:00:55.344,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Housing for Health works with poor people.

16
0:00:58.061,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It works in the places where they live,

17
0:01:01.116,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the work is done to improve their health.

18
0:01:05.049,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Over the last 28 years,

19
0:01:07.228,000 --> 0:01:1,000
this tough, grinding, dirty work

20
0:01:10.68,000 --> 0:01:14,000
has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia

21
0:01:15.165,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and, more recently, overseas,

22
0:01:17.629,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and their work has proven

23
0:01:19.857,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments.

24
0:01:25.331,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It can improve health

25
0:01:26.697,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and it can play a part in reducing, if not eliminating, poverty.

26
0:01:33.256,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm going to start where the story began --

27
0:01:35.331,000 --> 0:01:38,000
1985, in Central Australia.

28
0:01:39.2,000 --> 0:01:41,000
A man called Yami Lester, an Aboriginal man,

29
0:01:41.947,000 --> 0:01:42,000
was running a health service.

30
0:01:44.625,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Eighty percent of what walked in the door, in terms of illness,

31
0:01:48.599,000 --> 0:01:5,000
was infectious disease --

32
0:01:50.812,000 --> 0:01:52,000
third world, developing world infectious disease,

33
0:01:53.684,000 --> 0:01:55,000
caused by a poor living environment.

34
0:01:59.381,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs.

35
0:02:02.977,000 --> 0:02:04,000
He got a medical doctor.

36
0:02:05.466,000 --> 0:02:07,000
He got an environmental health guy.

37
0:02:08.266,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And he hand-selected a team of local Aboriginal people

38
0:02:13.034,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to work on this project.

39
0:02:15.54,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Yami told us at that first meeting,

40
0:02:17.269,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"There's no money," -- always a good start --

41
0:02:21.035,000 --> 0:02:24,000
" ... no money, you have six months,

42
0:02:24.548,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I want you to start on a project --" which, in his language,

43
0:02:27.586,000 --> 0:02:29,000
he called "Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,"

44
0:02:30.338,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which, translated, is "a plan to stop people getting sick" --

45
0:02:35.324,000 --> 0:02:36,000
a profound brief.

46
0:02:39.265,000 --> 0:02:4,000
That was our task.

47
0:02:42.279,000 --> 0:02:46,000
First step, the medical doctor went away for about six months.

48
0:02:46.932,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And he worked on what were to become these nine health goals --

49
0:02:51.387,000 --> 0:02:52,000
what were we aiming at?

50
0:02:55.236,000 --> 0:02:57,000
After six months of work, he came to my office

51
0:02:57.451,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and presented me with those nine words on a piece of paper.

52
0:03:02.046,000 --> 0:03:05,000
[The 9 Healthy Living Practices: Washing, clothes, wastewater, nutrition, crowding,

53
0:03:06.066,000 --> 0:03:07,000
animals, dust, temperature, injury]

54
0:03:07.757,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I was very unimpressed. Big ideas need big words,

55
0:03:11.051,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and preferably a lot of them.

56
0:03:13.45,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This didn't fit the bill.

57
0:03:15.29,000 --> 0:03:19,000
What I didn't see and what you can't see

58
0:03:19.68,000 --> 0:03:23,000
was that he'd assembled thousands of pages

59
0:03:24.018,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of local, national and international health research

60
0:03:27.808,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that filled out the picture as to why these were the health targets.

61
0:03:32.634,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason.

62
0:03:36.81,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The Aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people

63
0:03:40.097,000 --> 0:03:42,000
were most commonly illiterate,

64
0:03:42.463,000 --> 0:03:44,000
so the story had to be told in pictures

65
0:03:44.646,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of what these goals were.

66
0:03:46.371,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We worked with the community,

67
0:03:48.697,000 --> 0:03:49,000
not telling them what was going to happen

68
0:03:50.704,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in a language they didn't understand.

69
0:03:53.593,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So we had the goals and each one of these goals --

70
0:03:56.86,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I won't go through them all --

71
0:03:58.745,000 --> 0:04:02,000
puts at the center the person and their health issue,

72
0:04:02.848,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and it then connects them

73
0:04:04.824,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed

74
0:04:09.333,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to keep their health good.

75
0:04:11.262,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the highest priority, you see on the screen,

76
0:04:13.967,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is washing people once a day, particularly children.

77
0:04:18.31,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And I hope most of you are thinking,

78
0:04:20.088,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"What? That sounds simple."

79
0:04:21.414,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, I'm going to ask you all a very personal question.

80
0:04:25.494,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This morning before you came,

81
0:04:26.899,000 --> 0:04:3,000
who could have had a wash using a shower?

82
0:04:32.198,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I'm not going to ask if you had a shower, because I'm too polite.

83
0:04:35.437,000 --> 0:04:36,000
That's it.

84
0:04:36.612,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:37.637,000 --> 0:04:38,000
All right, I think it's fair to say

86
0:04:39.423,000 --> 0:04:42,000
most people here could have had a shower this morning.

87
0:04:42.494,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I'm going to ask you to do some more work.

88
0:04:44.642,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I want you all to select one of the houses

89
0:04:47.17,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of the 25 houses you see on the screen.

90
0:04:49.246,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I want you to select one of them and note the position of that house

91
0:04:52.676,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and keep that in your head.

92
0:04:54.077,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Have you all got a house?

93
0:04:55.627,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I'm going to ask you to live there for a few months,

94
0:04:58.101,000 --> 0:04:59,000
so make sure you've got it right.

95
0:04:59.731,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's in the northwest of Western Australia, very pleasant place.

96
0:05:02.778,000 --> 0:05:05,000
OK. Let's see if your shower in that house is working.

97
0:05:07.328,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I hear some "Aw!" and I hear some "Ah!"

98
0:05:10.487,000 --> 0:05:12,000
If you get a green tick, your shower's working.

99
0:05:13.291,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You and your kids are fine.

100
0:05:14.601,000 --> 0:05:16,000
If you get a red cross,

101
0:05:16.994,000 --> 0:05:18,000
well, I've looked carefully around the room

102
0:05:19.257,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and it's not going to make much difference to this crew.

103
0:05:22.457,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Why? Because you're all too old.

104
0:05:25.005,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I know that's going to come as a shock to some of you, but you are.

105
0:05:28.241,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And before you get offended and leave,

106
0:05:30.144,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I've got to say that being too old,

107
0:05:31.984,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in this case, means that pretty much everyone in the room, I think,

108
0:05:35.556,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is over five years of age.

109
0:05:39.465,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We're really concerned with kids naught to five.

110
0:05:42.25,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And why?

111
0:05:43.946,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Washing is the antidote to the sort of bugs,

112
0:05:48.771,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the common infectious diseases of the eyes, the ears,

113
0:05:52.018,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the chest and the skin

114
0:05:54.438,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that, if they occur in the first five years of life,

115
0:05:57.334,000 --> 0:06:,000
permanently damage those organs.

116
0:06:01.515,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They leave a lifelong remnant.

117
0:06:05.123,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That means that by the age of five,

118
0:06:07.249,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you can't see as well for the rest of your life.

119
0:06:09.559,000 --> 0:06:11,000
You can't hear as well for the rest of your life.

120
0:06:12.073,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You can't breathe as well.

121
0:06:13.439,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You've lost a third of your lung capacity by the age of five.

122
0:06:16.953,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And even skin infection,

123
0:06:18.82,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which we originally thought wasn't that big a problem,

124
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:24,000
mild skin infections naught to five give you

125
0:06:24.649,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a greatly increased chance of renal failure,

126
0:06:27.129,000 --> 0:06:29,000
needing dialysis at age 40.

127
0:06:30.364,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This is a big deal, so the ticks and crosses on the screen

128
0:06:33.283,000 --> 0:06:35,000
are actually critical for young kids.

129
0:06:36.697,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Those ticks and crosses represent the 7,800 houses

130
0:06:39.83,000 --> 0:06:41,000
we've looked at nationally around Australia,

131
0:06:41.918,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the same proportion.

132
0:06:43.351,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What you see on the screen --

133
0:06:44.83,000 --> 0:06:47,000
35 percent of those not-so-famous houses

134
0:06:48.087,000 --> 0:06:5,000
lived in by 50,000 indigenous people --

135
0:06:50.987,000 --> 0:06:52,000
35 percent had a working shower.

136
0:06:54.167,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Ten percent of those same 7,800 houses had safe electrical systems.

137
0:07:00.52,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And 58 percent of those houses had a working toilet.

138
0:07:07.691,000 --> 0:07:09,000
These are by a simple, standard test.

139
0:07:10.457,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In the case of the shower:

140
0:07:12.882,000 --> 0:07:16,000
does it have hot and cold water, two taps that work,

141
0:07:17.414,000 --> 0:07:21,000
a shower rose to get water onto your head or onto your body,

142
0:07:22.187,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and a drain that takes the water away?

143
0:07:24.045,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Not well-designed, not beautiful, not elegant --

144
0:07:28.117,000 --> 0:07:29,000
just that they function.

145
0:07:29.308,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the same tests for the electrical system

146
0:07:31.555,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and the toilets.

147
0:07:33.811,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Housing for Health projects aren't about measuring failure --

148
0:07:36.767,000 --> 0:07:38,000
they're actually about improving houses.

149
0:07:39.475,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We start on day one of every project.

150
0:07:43.393,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We've learned -- we don't make promises, we don't do reports.

151
0:07:46.656,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We arrive in the morning with tools, tons of equipment, trades,

152
0:07:52.002,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and we train up a local team on the first day to start work.

153
0:07:55.51,000 --> 0:07:56,000
By the evening of the first day,

154
0:07:57.314,000 --> 0:08:01,000
a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning.

155
0:08:01.749,000 --> 0:08:03,000
That work continues for six to 12 months,

156
0:08:04.028,000 --> 0:08:05,000
until all the houses are improved

157
0:08:05.75,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and we've spent our budget of 7,500 dollars total per house.

158
0:08:10.375,000 --> 0:08:11,000
That's our average budget.

159
0:08:12.451,000 --> 0:08:16,000
At the end of six months to a year, we test every house again.

160
0:08:16.771,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It's very easy to spend money.

161
0:08:18.856,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's very difficult to improve

162
0:08:21.198,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the function of all those parts of the house.

163
0:08:23.627,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And for a whole house, the nine healthy living practices,

164
0:08:26.647,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we test, check and fix 250 items in every house.

165
0:08:31.161,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And these are the results we can get with our 7,500 dollars.

166
0:08:35.275,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We can get showers up to 86 percent working,

167
0:08:37.901,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we can get electrical systems up to 77 percent working

168
0:08:41.716,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and we can get 90 percent of toilets working

169
0:08:44.373,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in those 7,500 houses.

170
0:08:47.226,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Applause)

171
0:08:48.431,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Thank you.

172
0:08:49.703,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Applause)

173
0:08:56.021,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The teams do a great job, and that's their work.

174
0:09:00.816,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I think there's an obvious question

175
0:09:02.956,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that I hope you're thinking about.

176
0:09:05.593,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Why do we have to do this work?

177
0:09:08.059,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Why are the houses in such poor condition?

178
0:09:11.271,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance --

179
0:09:14.832,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the sort of things that happen in all our houses.

180
0:09:17.261,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Things wear out, should have been done by state government or local government,

181
0:09:21.168,000 --> 0:09:24,000
simply not done, the house doesn't work.

182
0:09:24.378,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Twenty-one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction --

183
0:09:28.293,000 --> 0:09:31,000
literally things that are built upside down and back to front.

184
0:09:31.318,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They don't work, we have to fix them.

185
0:09:34.081,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And if you've lived in Australia in the last 30 years, the final cause --

186
0:09:39.705,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses.

187
0:09:43.384,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence

188
0:09:46.846,000 --> 0:09:48,000
which I've never seen evidence for,

189
0:09:48.885,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that's always reeled out as "That's the problem with indigenous housing."

190
0:09:52.369,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Well, nine percent of what we spend is damage,

191
0:09:54.563,000 --> 0:09:55,000
misuse or abuse of any sort.

192
0:09:58.12,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We argue strongly that the people living in the house

193
0:10:01.189,000 --> 0:10:02,000
are simply not the problem.

194
0:10:03.384,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And we'll go a lot further than that;

195
0:10:05.206,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution.

196
0:10:09.749,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Seventy-five percent of our national team in Australia --

197
0:10:13.138,000 --> 0:10:15,000
over 75 at the minute --

198
0:10:15.615,000 --> 0:10:19,000
are actually local, indigenous people from the communities we work in.

199
0:10:19.967,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They do all aspects of the work.

200
0:10:22.192,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Applause)

201
0:10:27.953,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In 2010, for example, there were 831,

202
0:10:31.835,000 --> 0:10:33,000
all over Australia, and the Torres Strait Islands,

203
0:10:34.432,000 --> 0:10:38,000
all states, working to improve the houses where they and their families live,

204
0:10:38.915,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and that's an important thing.

205
0:10:41.198,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Our work's always had a focus on health.

206
0:10:44.332,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That's the key.

207
0:10:46.434,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The developing world bug, trachoma, causes blindness.

208
0:10:49.918,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It's a developing-world illness,

209
0:10:52.308,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and yet, the picture you see behind

210
0:10:54.161,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is in an Aboriginal community in the late 1990s,

211
0:10:57.981,000 --> 0:11:01,000
where 95 percent of school-aged kids had active trachoma

212
0:11:02.005,000 --> 0:11:03,000
in their eyes, doing damage.

213
0:11:05.142,000 --> 0:11:06,000
OK, what do we do?

214
0:11:06.442,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Well, first thing we do, we get showers working.

215
0:11:09.769,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Why? Because that flushes the bug out.

216
0:11:11.634,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We put washing facilities in the school as well,

217
0:11:13.999,000 --> 0:11:15,000
so kids can wash their faces many times during the day.

218
0:11:16.76,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We wash the bug out.

219
0:11:18.673,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Second, the eye doctors tell us that dust scours the eye

220
0:11:22.538,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and lets the bug in quick.

221
0:11:23.879,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So what do we do?

222
0:11:25.112,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We call up the doctor of dust, and there is such a person.

223
0:11:28.636,000 --> 0:11:29,000
He was loaned to us by a mining company.

224
0:11:30.586,000 --> 0:11:32,000
He controls dust on mining company sites.

225
0:11:33.28,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And he came out and, within a day,

226
0:11:35.107,000 --> 0:11:37,000
it worked out that most dust in this community

227
0:11:37.322,000 --> 0:11:4,000
was within a meter of the ground, the wind-driven dust --

228
0:11:40.596,000 --> 0:11:42,000
so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust

229
0:11:43.501,000 --> 0:11:46,000
before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids.

230
0:11:47.247,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So we used dirt to stop dust.

231
0:11:50.814,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We did it. He provided us dust monitors.

232
0:11:53.606,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We tested and we reduced the dust.

233
0:11:56.086,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally.

234
0:11:58.311,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So how do we do that?

235
0:11:59.485,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Well, we call up the doctor of flies -- and, yes, there is a doctor of flies.

236
0:12:04.728,000 --> 0:12:05,000
As our Aboriginal mate said,

237
0:12:06.306,000 --> 0:12:08,000
"You white fellows ought to get out more."

238
0:12:08.441,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Laughter)

239
0:12:10.695,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And the doctor of flies very quickly determined

240
0:12:13.824,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that there was one fly that carried the bug.

241
0:12:17.926,000 --> 0:12:19,000
He could give school kids in this community

242
0:12:20.373,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide.

243
0:12:23.575,000 --> 0:12:25,000
They could trap the flies, send them to him in Perth.

244
0:12:26.635,000 --> 0:12:27,000
When the bug was in the gut,

245
0:12:28.112,000 --> 0:12:3,000
he'd send back by return post some dung beetles.

246
0:12:31.103,000 --> 0:12:33,000
The dung beetles ate the camel dung,

247
0:12:33.42,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the flies died through lack of food,

248
0:12:35.19,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and trachoma dropped.

249
0:12:36.523,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And over the year, trachoma dropped radically in this place, and stayed low.

250
0:12:42.36,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We changed the environment, not just treated the eyes.

251
0:12:47.079,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And finally, you get a good eye.

252
0:12:50.81,000 --> 0:12:51,000
All these small health gains

253
0:12:52.729,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference.

254
0:12:55.975,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The New South Wales Department of Health,

255
0:12:57.982,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that radical organization,

256
0:12:59.283,000 --> 0:13:02,000
did an independent trial over three years

257
0:13:02.847,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to look at 10 years of the work we've been doing

258
0:13:05.444,000 --> 0:13:07,000
in these sorts of projects in New South Wales.

259
0:13:07.936,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And they found a 40 percent reduction in hospital admissions

260
0:13:13.504,000 --> 0:13:16,000
for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment --

261
0:13:17.258,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a 40 percent reduction.

262
0:13:19.652,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Applause)

263
0:13:27.845,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Just to show that the principles we've used in Australia

264
0:13:30.591,000 --> 0:13:31,000
can be used in other places,

265
0:13:31.953,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I'm just going to go to one other place, and that's Nepal.

266
0:13:34.715,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And what a beautiful place to go.

267
0:13:36.35,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We were asked by a small village of 600 people

268
0:13:39.735,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to go in and make toilets where none existed.

269
0:13:43.764,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Health was poor.

270
0:13:46.27,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We went in with no grand plan,

271
0:13:47.763,000 --> 0:13:49,000
no grand promises of a great program,

272
0:13:49.914,000 --> 0:13:52,000
just the offer to build two toilets for two families.

273
0:13:53.146,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It was during the design of the first toilet

274
0:13:56.518,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that I went for lunch,

275
0:13:57.801,000 --> 0:14:,000
invited by the family into their main room of the house.

276
0:14:00.874,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It was choking with smoke.

277
0:14:02.898,000 --> 0:14:05,000
People were cooking on their only fuel source, green timber.

278
0:14:06.497,000 --> 0:14:08,000
The smoke coming off that timber is choking,

279
0:14:08.618,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and in an enclosed house, you simply can't breathe.

280
0:14:12.048,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Later we found the leading cause of illness and death

281
0:14:15.962,000 --> 0:14:18,000
in this particular region is through respiratory failure.

282
0:14:19.541,000 --> 0:14:21,000
So all of a sudden, we had two problems.

283
0:14:21.689,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We were there originally to look at toilets

284
0:14:23.777,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and get human waste off the ground, that's fine.

285
0:14:26.099,000 --> 0:14:28,000
But all of a sudden now there was a second problem:

286
0:14:29.037,000 --> 0:14:3,000
How do we actually get the smoke down?

287
0:14:30.886,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So two problems, and design should be about more than one thing.

288
0:14:34.946,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Solution: Take human waste, take animal waste,

289
0:14:38.54,000 --> 0:14:41,000
put it into a chamber, out of that, extract biogas,

290
0:14:41.922,000 --> 0:14:42,000
methane gas.

291
0:14:43.585,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The gas gives three to four hours cooking a day --

292
0:14:47.01,000 --> 0:14:5,000
clean, smokeless and free for the family.

293
0:14:50.674,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Applause)

294
0:14:55.842,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I put it to you: is this eliminating poverty?

295
0:14:58.75,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And the answer from the Nepali team who's working at the minute would say,

296
0:15:03.186,000 --> 0:15:04,000
don't be ridiculous --

297
0:15:04.361,000 --> 0:15:06,000
we have three million more toilets to build

298
0:15:06.457,000 --> 0:15:08,000
before we can even make a stab at that claim.

299
0:15:09.332,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And I don't pretend anything else.

300
0:15:12.315,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But as we all sit here today,

301
0:15:14.997,000 --> 0:15:15,000
there are now over 100 toilets built

302
0:15:16.857,000 --> 0:15:18,000
in this village and a couple nearby.

303
0:15:19.294,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Well over 1,000 people use those toilets.

304
0:15:22.767,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Yami Lama, he's a young boy.

305
0:15:25.966,000 --> 0:15:29,000
He's got significantly less gut infection because he's now got toilets,

306
0:15:30.294,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and there isn't human waste on the ground.

307
0:15:34.04,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Kanji Maya, she's a mother, and a proud one.

308
0:15:37.381,000 --> 0:15:41,000
She's probably right now cooking lunch for her family

309
0:15:41.848,000 --> 0:15:43,000
on biogas, smokeless fuel.

310
0:15:44.317,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Her lungs have got better,

311
0:15:45.587,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and they'll get better as time increases,

312
0:15:47.587,000 --> 0:15:49,000
because she's not cooking in the same smoke.

313
0:15:49.792,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Surya takes the waste out of the biogas chamber

314
0:15:52.418,000 --> 0:15:54,000
when it's shed the gas, he puts it on his crops.

315
0:15:55.359,000 --> 0:15:57,000
He's trebled his crop income,

316
0:15:58.081,000 --> 0:16:,000
more food for the family and more money for the family.

317
0:16:01.02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And finally Bishnu, the leader of the team,

318
0:16:05.798,000 --> 0:16:08,000
has now understood that not only have we built toilets,

319
0:16:08.985,000 --> 0:16:1,000
we've also built a team,

320
0:16:11.161,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and that team is now working in two villages

321
0:16:13.817,000 --> 0:16:15,000
where they're training up the next two villages

322
0:16:16.314,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to keep the work expanding.

323
0:16:18.168,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And that, to me, is the key.

324
0:16:19.817,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Applause)

325
0:16:24.508,000 --> 0:16:26,000
People are not the problem.

326
0:16:28.609,000 --> 0:16:29,000
We've never found that.

327
0:16:30.22,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The problem: poor living environment,

328
0:16:32.939,000 --> 0:16:34,000
poor housing and the bugs that do people harm.

329
0:16:37.137,000 --> 0:16:42,000
None of those are limited by geography, by skin color or by religion.

330
0:16:42.9,000 --> 0:16:43,000
None of them.

331
0:16:45.087,000 --> 0:16:47,000
The common link between all the work we've had to do

332
0:16:47.564,000 --> 0:16:48,000
is one thing, and that's poverty.

333
0:16:51.41,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Nelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s, not too far from here,

334
0:16:55.211,000 --> 0:17:01,000
he said that like slavery and apartheid, "Poverty is not natural.

335
0:17:01.516,000 --> 0:17:04,000
It is man-made and can be overcome and eradicated

336
0:17:05.399,000 --> 0:17:07,000
by the actions of human beings."

337
0:17:08.864,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I want to end by saying

338
0:17:10.197,000 --> 0:17:16,000
it's been the actions of thousands of ordinary human beings

339
0:17:16.378,000 --> 0:17:19,000
doing -- I think -- extraordinary work,

340
0:17:19.627,000 --> 0:17:21,000
that have actually improved health,

341
0:17:22.295,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and, maybe only in a small way, reduced poverty.

342
0:17:25.44,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you very much for your time.

343
0:17:27.136,000 --> 0:17:33,000
(Applause)

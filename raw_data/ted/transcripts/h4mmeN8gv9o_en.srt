1
0:00:13.228,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,

2
0:00:17.262,000 --> 0:00:22,000
fathers are usually known by their sons,

3
0:00:22.487,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but I'm one of the few fathers

4
0:00:25.703,000 --> 0:00:27,000
who is known by his daughter,

5
0:00:27.747,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I am proud of it.

6
0:00:29.373,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:35.81,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Malala started her campaign for education

8
0:00:38.658,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and stood for her rights in 2007,

9
0:00:41.545,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and when her efforts were honored in 2011,

10
0:00:46.103,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and she was given the national youth peace prize,

11
0:00:49.543,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and she became a very famous,

12
0:00:51.412,000 --> 0:00:55,000
very popular young girl of her country.

13
0:00:55.456,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Before that, she was my daughter,

14
0:00:58.784,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but now I am her father.

15
0:01:02.741,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

16
0:01:04.496,000 --> 0:01:07,000
if we glance to human history,

17
0:01:07.643,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the story of women

18
0:01:10.471,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is the story of injustice,

19
0:01:13.847,000 --> 0:01:15,000
inequality,

20
0:01:15.907,000 --> 0:01:2,000
violence and exploitation.

21
0:01:21.218,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You see,

22
0:01:23.053,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in patriarchal societies,

23
0:01:27.204,000 --> 0:01:29,000
right from the very beginning,

24
0:01:29.646,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when a girl is born,

25
0:01:32.652,000 --> 0:01:36,000
her birth is not celebrated.

26
0:01:36.932,000 --> 0:01:38,000
She is not welcomed,

27
0:01:39.096,000 --> 0:01:41,000
neither by father nor by mother.

28
0:01:41.872,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The neighborhood comes

29
0:01:43.557,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and commiserates with the mother,

30
0:01:46.058,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and nobody congratulates the father.

31
0:01:51.152,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And a mother is very uncomfortable

32
0:01:55.467,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for having a girl child.

33
0:01:59.834,000 --> 0:02:02,000
When she gives birth to the first girl child,

34
0:02:03.094,000 --> 0:02:07,000
first daughter, she is sad.

35
0:02:07.183,000 --> 0:02:1,000
When she gives birth to the second daughter,

36
0:02:10.93,000 --> 0:02:11,000
she is shocked,

37
0:02:12.777,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and in the expectation of a son,

38
0:02:16.161,000 --> 0:02:19,000
when she gives birth to a third daughter,

39
0:02:19.367,000 --> 0:02:24,000
she feels guilty like a criminal.

40
0:02:24.906,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Not only the mother suffers,

41
0:02:27.54,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but the daughter, the newly born daughter,

42
0:02:30.277,000 --> 0:02:32,000
when she grows old,

43
0:02:32.412,000 --> 0:02:34,000
she suffers too.

44
0:02:34.547,000 --> 0:02:36,000
At the age of five,

45
0:02:36.6,000 --> 0:02:39,000
while she should be going to school,

46
0:02:39.929,000 --> 0:02:4,000
she stays at home

47
0:02:41.672,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and her brothers are admitted in a school.

48
0:02:46.294,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Until the age of 12, somehow,

49
0:02:48.887,000 --> 0:02:5,000
she has a good life.

50
0:02:51.528,000 --> 0:02:52,000
She can have fun.

51
0:02:53.199,000 --> 0:02:56,000
She can play with her friends in the streets,

52
0:02:56.388,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and she can move around in the streets

53
0:02:58.427,000 --> 0:03:,000
like a butterfly.

54
0:03:01.202,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But when she enters her teens,

55
0:03:05.017,000 --> 0:03:07,000
when she becomes 13 years old,

56
0:03:07.357,000 --> 0:03:1,000
she is forbidden to go out of her home

57
0:03:10.976,000 --> 0:03:13,000
without a male escort.

58
0:03:14.468,000 --> 0:03:19,000
She is confined under the four walls of her home.

59
0:03:19.843,000 --> 0:03:24,000
She is no more a free individual.

60
0:03:25.037,000 --> 0:03:28,000
She becomes the so-called honor

61
0:03:28.057,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of her father and of her brothers

62
0:03:30.538,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and of her family,

63
0:03:33.988,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and if she transgresses

64
0:03:36.676,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the code of that so-called honor,

65
0:03:39.887,000 --> 0:03:43,000
she could even be killed.

66
0:03:44.251,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And it is also interesting that this so-called

67
0:03:48.252,000 --> 0:03:49,000
code of honor,

68
0:03:49.615,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it does not only affect the life of a girl,

69
0:03:53.305,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it also affects the life

70
0:03:55.431,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of the male members of the family.

71
0:04:00.23,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother,

72
0:04:06.823,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and that one brother,

73
0:04:08.645,000 --> 0:04:11,000
he has migrated to the Gulf countries,

74
0:04:12.149,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to earn a living for his seven sisters

75
0:04:14.844,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and parents,

76
0:04:17.192,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because he thinks that it will be humiliating

77
0:04:23.046,000 --> 0:04:25,000
if his seven sisters learn a skill

78
0:04:25.768,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and they go out of the home

79
0:04:28.148,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and earn some livelihood.

80
0:04:32.299,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So this brother,

81
0:04:33.889,000 --> 0:04:36,000
he sacrifices the joys of his life

82
0:04:37.242,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and the happiness of his sisters

83
0:04:40.634,000 --> 0:04:44,000
at the altar of so-called honor.

84
0:04:45.218,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And there is one more norm

85
0:04:46.752,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of the patriarchal societies

86
0:04:49.11,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that is called obedience.

87
0:04:53.56,000 --> 0:04:56,000
A good girl is supposed to be

88
0:04:57.346,000 --> 0:05:02,000
very quiet, very humble

89
0:05:02.594,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and very submissive.

90
0:05:06.565,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It is the criteria.

91
0:05:07.904,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The role model good girl should be very quiet.

92
0:05:11.736,000 --> 0:05:13,000
She is supposed to be silent

93
0:05:14.025,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and she is supposed to accept the decisions

94
0:05:17.196,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of her father and mother

95
0:05:19.416,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and the decisions of elders,

96
0:05:22.641,000 --> 0:05:24,000
even if she does not like them.

97
0:05:25.047,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If she is married to a man she doesn't like

98
0:05:28.376,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or if she is married to an old man,

99
0:05:31.118,000 --> 0:05:32,000
she has to accept,

100
0:05:32.678,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because she does not want to be dubbed

101
0:05:35.196,000 --> 0:05:37,000
as disobedient.

102
0:05:37.819,000 --> 0:05:38,000
If she is married very early,

103
0:05:39.451,000 --> 0:05:4,000
she has to accept.

104
0:05:40.925,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.

105
0:05:44.947,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And what happens at the end?

106
0:05:47.75,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In the words of a poetess,

107
0:05:49.505,000 --> 0:05:51,000
she is wedded, bedded,

108
0:05:52.292,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.

109
0:05:57.463,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And it is the irony of the situation

110
0:06:00.232,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that this mother,

111
0:06:02.564,000 --> 0:06:05,000
she teaches the same lesson of obedience

112
0:06:05.616,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to her daughter

113
0:06:06.676,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and the same lesson of honor to her sons.

114
0:06:11.109,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.

115
0:06:17.997,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

116
0:06:20.524,000 --> 0:06:23,000
this plight of millions of women

117
0:06:23.746,000 --> 0:06:25,000
could be changed

118
0:06:26.578,000 --> 0:06:28,000
if we think differently,

119
0:06:28.953,000 --> 0:06:31,000
if women and men think differently,

120
0:06:32.934,000 --> 0:06:36,000
if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies

121
0:06:37.152,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in the developing countries,

122
0:06:39.135,000 --> 0:06:41,000
if they can break a few norms

123
0:06:42.046,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of family and society,

124
0:06:46.65,000 --> 0:06:51,000
if they can abolish the discriminatory laws

125
0:06:52.13,000 --> 0:06:54,000
of the systems in their states,

126
0:06:54.658,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which go against the basic human rights

127
0:06:56.949,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of the women.

128
0:07:00.743,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,

129
0:07:05.987,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and for the first time,

130
0:07:08.14,000 --> 0:07:09,000
believe me,

131
0:07:09.414,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I don't like newborn children, to be honest,

132
0:07:14.391,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but when I went and I looked into her eyes,

133
0:07:18.173,000 --> 0:07:2,000
believe me,

134
0:07:20.293,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I got extremely honored.

135
0:07:24.274,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And long before she was born,

136
0:07:26.444,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I thought about her name,

137
0:07:29.48,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and I was fascinated with a heroic

138
0:07:32.765,000 --> 0:07:35,000
legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.

139
0:07:36.63,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,

140
0:07:41.639,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and I named my daughter after her.

141
0:07:45.924,000 --> 0:07:47,000
A few days after Malala was born,

142
0:07:48.916,000 --> 0:07:49,000
my daughter was born,

143
0:07:50.655,000 --> 0:07:51,000
my cousin came --

144
0:07:52.313,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and it was a coincidence --

145
0:07:54.281,000 --> 0:07:56,000
he came to my home

146
0:07:56.996,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and he brought a family tree,

147
0:07:59.701,000 --> 0:08:02,000
a family tree of the Yousafzai family,

148
0:08:03.369,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and when I looked at the family tree,

149
0:08:05.925,000 --> 0:08:11,000
it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.

150
0:08:11.978,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But when I looked, all were men,

151
0:08:16.375,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and I picked my pen,

152
0:08:18.797,000 --> 0:08:2,000
drew a line from my name,

153
0:08:20.801,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and wrote, "Malala."

154
0:08:25.585,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And when she grow old,

155
0:08:28.355,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when she was four and a half years old,

156
0:08:31.938,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I admitted her in my school.

157
0:08:35.474,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You will be asking, then, why should I mention about

158
0:08:38.38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the admission of a girl in a school?

159
0:08:40.882,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Yes, I must mention it.

160
0:08:42.937,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It may be taken for granted in Canada,

161
0:08:46.022,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in America, in many developed countries,

162
0:08:49.849,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but in poor countries,

163
0:08:52.307,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,

164
0:08:55.875,000 --> 0:08:58,000
it's a big event for the life of girl.

165
0:08:59.489,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Enrollment in a school means

166
0:09:03.128,000 --> 0:09:08,000
recognition of her identity and her name.

167
0:09:08.877,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Admission in a school means

168
0:09:10.555,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that she has entered the world of dreams

169
0:09:14.237,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and aspirations

170
0:09:15.9,000 --> 0:09:18,000
where she can explore her potentials

171
0:09:19.412,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for her future life.

172
0:09:22.658,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I have five sisters,

173
0:09:24.737,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and none of them could go to school,

174
0:09:28.051,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and you will be astonished,

175
0:09:29.625,000 --> 0:09:33,000
two weeks before,

176
0:09:33.735,000 --> 0:09:37,000
when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,

177
0:09:38.018,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and I was filling out the family part of the form,

178
0:09:42.683,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I could not recall

179
0:09:44.767,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the surnames of some of my sisters.

180
0:09:48.772,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And the reason was

181
0:09:50.621,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that I have never, never seen the names

182
0:09:53.913,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of my sisters written on any document.

183
0:09:59.739,000 --> 0:10:01,000
That was the reason that

184
0:10:02.679,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I valued my daughter.

185
0:10:06.212,000 --> 0:10:1,000
What my father could not give to my sisters

186
0:10:10.525,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and to his daughters,

187
0:10:12.28,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I thought I must change it.

188
0:10:16.521,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I used to appreciate the intelligence

189
0:10:19.528,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and the brilliance of my daughter.

190
0:10:23.2,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I encouraged her to sit with me

191
0:10:25.794,000 --> 0:10:26,000
when my friends used to come.

192
0:10:27.453,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.

193
0:10:32.237,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And all these good values,

194
0:10:33.898,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I tried to inculcate in her personality.

195
0:10:37.108,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And this was not only she, only Malala.

196
0:10:40.771,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I imparted all these good values

197
0:10:43.507,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to my school, girl students and boy students as well.

198
0:10:48.05,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I used education for emancipation.

199
0:10:52.429,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I taught my girls,

200
0:10:54.294,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I taught my girl students,

201
0:10:56.249,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to unlearn the lesson of obedience.

202
0:11:01.318,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I taught my boy students

203
0:11:04.283,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.

204
0:11:13.696,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Dear brothers and sisters,

205
0:11:17.681,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we were striving for more rights for women,

206
0:11:22.264,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and we were struggling to have more,

207
0:11:25.886,000 --> 0:11:29,000
more and more space for the women in society.

208
0:11:30.113,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But we came across a new phenomenon.

209
0:11:33.326,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It was lethal to human rights

210
0:11:35.819,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and particularly to women's rights.

211
0:11:39.267,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It was called Talibanization.

212
0:11:43.944,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It means a complete negation

213
0:11:47.632,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of women's participation

214
0:11:49.842,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in all political, economical and social activities.

215
0:11:56.037,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Hundreds of schools were lost.

216
0:11:59.584,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Girls were prohibited from going to school.

217
0:12:05.815,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Women were forced to wear veils

218
0:12:09.521,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and they were stopped from going to the markets.

219
0:12:13.077,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Musicians were silenced,

220
0:12:15.661,000 --> 0:12:16,000
girls were flogged

221
0:12:17.618,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and singers were killed.

222
0:12:21.101,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Millions were suffering,

223
0:12:22.975,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but few spoke,

224
0:12:26.22,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and it was the most scary thing

225
0:12:28.444,000 --> 0:12:34,000
when you have all around such people

226
0:12:34.53,000 --> 0:12:36,000
who kill and who flog,

227
0:12:36.556,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and you speak for your rights.

228
0:12:37.852,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It's really the most scary thing.

229
0:12:42.059,000 --> 0:12:43,000
At the age of 10,

230
0:12:43.952,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Malala stood, and she stood for the right

231
0:12:48.196,000 --> 0:12:5,000
of education.

232
0:12:50.507,000 --> 0:12:54,000
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,

233
0:12:55.279,000 --> 0:12:57,000
she volunteered herself

234
0:12:57.483,000 --> 0:13:,000
for the New York Times documentaries,

235
0:13:01.077,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and she spoke from every platform she could.

236
0:13:05.993,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And her voice was the most powerful voice.

237
0:13:10.381,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.

238
0:13:16.634,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And that was the reason the Taliban

239
0:13:18.486,000 --> 0:13:22,000
could not tolerate her campaign,

240
0:13:22.817,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and on October 9 2012,

241
0:13:25.666,000 --> 0:13:3,000
she was shot in the head at point blank range.

242
0:13:31.415,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It was a doomsday for my family and for me.

243
0:13:35.56,000 --> 0:13:4,000
The world turned into a big black hole.

244
0:13:41.379,000 --> 0:13:42,000
While my daughter was

245
0:13:43.045,000 --> 0:13:46,000
on the verge of life and death,

246
0:13:46.497,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I whispered into the ears of my wife,

247
0:13:50.336,000 --> 0:13:53,000
"Should I be blamed for what happened

248
0:13:53.438,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to my daughter and your daughter?"

249
0:13:57.114,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And she abruptly told me,

250
0:13:59.635,000 --> 0:14:01,000
"Please don't blame yourself.

251
0:14:02.146,000 --> 0:14:05,000
You stood for the right cause.

252
0:14:05.362,000 --> 0:14:07,000
You put your life at stake

253
0:14:07.497,000 --> 0:14:08,000
for the cause of truth,

254
0:14:08.9,000 --> 0:14:09,000
for the cause of peace,

255
0:14:10.081,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and for the cause of education,

256
0:14:12.189,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and your daughter in inspired from you

257
0:14:14.238,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and she joined you.

258
0:14:16.469,000 --> 0:14:17,000
You both were on the right path

259
0:14:18.144,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and God will protect her."

260
0:14:21.517,000 --> 0:14:24,000
These few words meant a lot to me,

261
0:14:24.863,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and I didn't ask this question again.

262
0:14:28.974,000 --> 0:14:32,000
When Malala was in the hospital,

263
0:14:33.094,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and she was going through the severe pains

264
0:14:36.341,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and she had had severe headaches

265
0:14:38.861,000 --> 0:14:41,000
because her facial nerve was cut down,

266
0:14:42.049,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I used to see a dark shadow

267
0:14:44.501,000 --> 0:14:49,000
spreading on the face of my wife.

268
0:14:50.038,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But my daughter never complained.

269
0:14:56.139,000 --> 0:14:58,000
She used to tell us,

270
0:14:58.2,000 --> 0:15:,000
"I'm fine with my crooked smile

271
0:15:00.251,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and with my numbness in my face.

272
0:15:02.993,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I'll be okay. Please don't worry."

273
0:15:05.072,000 --> 0:15:07,000
She was a solace for us,

274
0:15:07.201,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and she consoled us.

275
0:15:12.12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Dear brothers and sisters,

276
0:15:16.341,000 --> 0:15:18,000
we learned from her how to be resilient

277
0:15:18.963,000 --> 0:15:21,000
in the most difficult times,

278
0:15:22.268,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and I'm glad to share with you

279
0:15:25.276,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that despite being an icon

280
0:15:31.168,000 --> 0:15:33,000
for the rights of children and women,

281
0:15:33.997,000 --> 0:15:38,000
she is like any 16-year old girl.

282
0:15:39.29,000 --> 0:15:44,000
She cries when her homework is incomplete.

283
0:15:44.422,000 --> 0:15:46,000
She quarrels with her brothers,

284
0:15:46.49,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and I am very happy for that.

285
0:15:50.213,000 --> 0:15:52,000
People ask me,

286
0:15:52.616,000 --> 0:15:55,000
what special is in my mentorship

287
0:15:56.108,000 --> 0:15:58,000
which has made Malala so bold

288
0:15:58.648,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and so courageous and so vocal and poised?

289
0:16:03.14,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.

290
0:16:09.415,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Ask me what I did not do.

291
0:16:13.276,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I did not clip her wings, and that's all.

292
0:16:18.533,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Thank you very much.

293
0:16:21.415,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Applause)

294
0:16:26.911,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)

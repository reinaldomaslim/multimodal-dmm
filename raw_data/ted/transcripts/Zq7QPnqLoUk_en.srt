1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a storyteller.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
That's what I do in life -- telling stories,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
writing novels --

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and today I would like to tell you a few stories

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about the art of storytelling

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and also some supernatural creatures

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
called the djinni.

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
glimpses of my personal story.

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I will do so with the help of words, of course,

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but also a geometrical shape, the circle,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
so throughout my talk,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you will come across several circles.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I was born in Strasbourg, France

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to Turkish parents.

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Shortly after, my parents got separated,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I came to Turkey with my mom.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
From then on, I was raised

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
as a single child by a single mother.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara,

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that was a bit unusual.

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Our neighborhood was full of large families,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
where fathers were the heads of households,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in a patriarchal environment.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In fact, I grew up observing

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
two different kinds of womanhood.

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
On the one hand was my mother,

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
On the other hand was my grandmother,

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who also took care of me

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and was more spiritual, less educated

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and definitely less rational.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and melted lead into mysterious shapes

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to fend off the evil eye.

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Many people visited my grandmother,

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
people with severe acne on their faces

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
or warts on their hands.

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic,

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
take a red apple and stab it

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
with as many rose thorns

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
as the number of warts she wanted to remove.

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Then one by one, she would

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
encircle these thorns with dark ink.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
A week later, the patient would come back

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
for a follow-up examination.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in front of an audience of scholars and scientists,

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but the truth is, of all the people

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions,

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I did not see anyone go back

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
unhappy or unhealed.

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective,

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but also beware of the power of circles."

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
From her, I learned, amongst many other things,

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
one very precious lesson --

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that if you want to destroy something in this life,

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
be it an acne, a blemish

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or the human soul,

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It will dry up inside.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We all do.

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We're born into a certain family, nation, class.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But if we have no connection whatsoever

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
then we too run the risk

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of drying up inside.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Our imagination might shrink;

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
our hearts might dwindle,

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and our humanness might wither

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
if we stay for too long

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
inside our cultural cocoons.

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Our friends, neighbors, colleagues, family --

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
if all the people in our inner circle resemble us,

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it means we are surrounded

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
with our mirror image.

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is to cover mirrors with velvet

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's an old Eastern tradition

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
based on the knowledge that it's not healthy

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
for a human being to spend too much time

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
staring at his own reflection.

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is one of the greatest dangers

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of today's globalized world.

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And it's happening everywhere,

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
among liberals and conservatives,

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor,

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
East and West alike.

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We tend to form clusters

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
based on similarity,

96
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and then we produce stereotypes

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
about other clusters of people.

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In my opinion, one way of transcending

99
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
these cultural ghettos

100
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is through the art of storytelling.

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Stories cannot demolish frontiers,

102
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but they can punch holes in our mental walls.

103
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other,

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and sometimes even like what we see.

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I started writing fiction at the age of eight.

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
about my sanity.

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good,

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
except I told this to imaginary friends around me,

112
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which was not so good.

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I was an introverted child,

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to the point of communicating with colored crayons

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and apologizing to objects

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
when I bumped into them,

117
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
so my mother thought it might do me good

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to write down my day-to-day experiences

119
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and emotions.

120
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring,

121
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and the last thing I wanted to do

122
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
was to write about myself.

123
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Instead, I began to write about people other than me

124
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and things that never really happened.

125
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And thus began my life-long passion

126
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
for writing fiction.

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So from the very beginning, fiction for me

128
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
was less of an autobiographical manifestation

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
than a transcendental journey

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
into other lives, other possibilities.

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And please bear with me:

132
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I'll draw a circle and come back to this point.

133
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now one other thing happened around this same time.

134
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
My mother became a diplomat.

135
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So from this small, superstitious,

136
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother,

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I was zoomed into this

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
posh, international school [in Madrid],

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
where I was the only Turk.

140
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It was here that I had my first encounter

141
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
with what I call the "representative foreigner."

142
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities,

143
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
yet this diversity did not necessarily lead

144
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian

145
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
classroom democracy.

146
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Instead, it generated an atmosphere

147
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
in which each child was seen --

148
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
not as an individual on his own,

149
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but as the representative of something larger.

150
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun,

151
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
except whenever something negative,

152
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
with regards to a nation

153
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or a religion, took place.

154
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The child who represented it was mocked,

155
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
ridiculed and bullied endlessly.

156
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school,

157
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a military takeover happened in my country,

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope,

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
during those days.

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I also had my first taste

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of cultural stereotypes there.

165
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The other children asked me about the movie

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"Midnight Express," which I had not seen;

167
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked,

168
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers,

169
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and they wondered at what age

170
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I would start covering my hair.

171
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I came to learn that these were

172
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
the three main stereotypes about my country:

173
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
politics, cigarettes

174
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and the veil.

175
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany

176
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and Ankara again.

177
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Everywhere I went, I felt like

178
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
my imagination was the only suitcase

179
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I could take with me.

180
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Stories gave me a sense of center,

181
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
continuity and coherence,

182
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.

183
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul,

184
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the city I adore.

185
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood

186
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
where I wrote several of my novels.

187
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit

188
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in 1999.

189
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning,

190
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.

191
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
There was the local grocer there --

192
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol

193
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and didn't speak to marginals.

194
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
He was sitting next to a transvestite

195
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
with a long black wig

196
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and mascara running down her cheeks.

197
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes

198
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
with trembling hands

199
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and offer one to her,

200
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and that is the image of the night of the earthquake

201
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in my mind today --

202
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite

203
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
smoking together on the sidewalk.

204
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In the face of death and destruction,

205
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
our mundane differences evaporated,

206
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we all became one

207
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
even if for a few hours.

208
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.

209
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake,

210
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but when we are reading a good novel,

211
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we leave our small, cozy apartments behind,

212
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
go out into the night alone

213
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and start getting to know people we had never met before

214
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and perhaps had even been biased against.

215
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Shortly after, I went

216
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.

217
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift,

218
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as a linguistic one.

219
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I started writing fiction in English.

220
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile --

221
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
they ask me why I do this --

222
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but the commute between languages

223
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
gives me the chance to recreate myself.

224
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I love writing in Turkish,

225
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which to me is very poetic and very emotional,

226
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and I love writing in English, which to me

227
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is very mathematical and cerebral.

228
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So I feel connected to each language in a different way.

229
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
For me, like millions of other people

230
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
around the world today,

231
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
English is an acquired language.

232
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
When you're a latecomer to a language,

233
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
what happens is you live there

234
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
with a continuous

235
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and perpetual frustration.

236
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know,

237
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
crack better jokes, say better things,

238
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but we end up saying less

239
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.

240
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And that gap is very intimidating.

241
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But if we manage not to be frightened by it,

242
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it's also stimulating.

243
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And this is what I discovered in Boston --

244
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that frustration was very stimulating.

245
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
At this stage, my grandmother,

246
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
who had been watching the course of my life

247
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
with increasing anxiety,

248
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
started to include in her daily prayers

249
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that I urgently get married

250
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
so that I could settle down once and for all.

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
And because God loves her, I did get married.

252
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

253
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But instead of settling down,

254
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I went to Arizona.

255
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And since my husband is in Istanbul,

256
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul --

257
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the two places on the surface of earth

258
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that couldn't be more different.

259
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I guess one part of me has always been a nomad,

260
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
physically and spiritually.

261
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Stories accompany me,

262
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
keeping my pieces and memories together,

263
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
like an existential glue.

264
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Yet as much as I love stories,

265
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
recently, I've also begun to think

266
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that they lose their magic

267
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
if and when a story is seen as more than a story.

268
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And this is a subject that I would love

269
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to think about together.

270
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
When my first novel written in English came out in America,

271
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.

272
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."

273
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

274
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I asked him what he meant by that.

275
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many

276
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it,

277
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man."

278
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston,

279
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
so to me, it was normal

280
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that there be more international characters in it

281
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
than Turkish characters,

282
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but I understood what my critic was looking for.

283
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And I also understood that I

284
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
would keep disappointing him.

285
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.

286
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book

287
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
because I happened to be one.

288
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We often talk about how stories change the world,

289
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
but we should also see how the world of identity politics

290
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
affects the way stories

291
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
are being circulated,

292
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
read and reviewed.

293
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Many authors feel this pressure,

294
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.

295
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me,

296
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
then you are expected to write

297
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the stories of Muslim women

298
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and, preferably, the unhappy stories

299
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
of unhappy Muslim women.

300
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
You're expected to write

301
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
informative, poignant and characteristic stories

302
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and leave the experimental and avant-garde

303
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to your Western colleagues.

304
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid

305
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is happening in the literary world today.

306
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Writers are not seen

307
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
as creative individuals on their own,

308
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but as the representatives

309
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
of their respective cultures:

310
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
a few authors from China, a few from Turkey,

311
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
a few from Nigeria.

312
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We're all thought to have something very distinctive,

313
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
if not peculiar.

314
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The writer and commuter James Baldwin

315
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
gave an interview in 1984

316
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.

317
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him

318
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
as a gay writer,

319
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Baldwin stopped and said,

320
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
"But don't you see? There's nothing in me

321
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that is not in everybody else,

322
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and nothing in everybody else

323
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that is not in me."

324
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
When identity politics tries to put labels on us,

325
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.

326
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
There's a fuzzy category called

327
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
multicultural literature

328
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in which all authors from outside the Western world

329
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
are lumped together.

330
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I never forget my first multicultural reading,

331
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.

332
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We were three writers, one from the Philippines,

333
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
one Turkish and one Indonesian --

334
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
like a joke, you know.

335
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter)

336
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And the reason why we were brought together

337
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
was not because we shared an artistic style

338
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or a literary taste.

339
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It was only because of our passports.

340
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories,

341
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
not so much the imaginary.

342
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
A function is attributed to fiction.

343
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
In this way, not only the writers themselves,

344
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but also their fictional characters

345
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
become the representatives of something larger.

346
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But I must quickly add

347
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that this tendency to see a story

348
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
as more than a story

349
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
does not solely come from the West.

350
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It comes from everywhere.

351
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And I experienced this firsthand

352
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
when I was put on trial in 2005

353
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.

354
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I had intended to write

355
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
a constructive, multi-layered novel

356
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
about an Armenian and a Turkish family

357
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
through the eyes of women.

358
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
My micro story became a macro issue

359
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
when I was prosecuted.

360
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Some people criticized, others praised me

361
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.

362
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides

363
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that this was fiction.

364
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It was just a story.

365
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And when I say, "just a story,"

366
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I'm not trying to belittle my work.

367
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I want to love and celebrate fiction

368
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
for what it is,

369
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
not as a means to an end.

370
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Writers are entitled to their political opinions,

371
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and there are good political novels out there,

372
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
but the language of fiction

373
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is not the language of daily politics.

374
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Chekhov said,

375
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
"The solution to a problem

376
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and the correct way of posing the question

377
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
are two completely separate things.

378
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And only the latter is an artist's responsibility."

379
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.

380
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
One is interested in sweeping generalizations.

381
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
The other, in nuances.

382
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
One draws boundaries.

383
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
The other recognizes no frontiers.

384
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Identity politics is made of solid bricks.

385
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Fiction is flowing water.

386
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah."

387
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
They would go to coffee houses,

388
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
where they would tell a story in front of an audience,

389
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
often improvising.

390
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
With each new person in the story,

391
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
the meddah would change his voice,

392
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
impersonating that character.

393
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Everybody could go and listen, you know --

394
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.

395
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Stories cut across all boundaries,

396
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja,"

397
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
which were very popular throughout the Middle East,

398
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
North Africa, the Balkans and Asia.

399
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Today, stories continue

400
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to transcend borders.

401
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk,

402
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
they usually don't listen to each other,

403
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
but a Palestinian reader

404
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
still reads a novel by a Jewish author,

405
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and vice versa, connecting and empathizing

406
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
with the narrator.

407
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Literature has to take us beyond.

408
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
If it cannot take us there,

409
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
it is not good literature.

410
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Books have saved the introverted,

411
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
timid child that I was -- that I once was.

412
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
But I'm also aware of the danger

413
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
of fetishizing them.

414
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
When the poet and mystic, Rumi,

415
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz,

416
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
one of the first things the latter did

417
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
was to toss Rumi's books into water

418
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and watch the letters dissolve.

419
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
The Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself

420
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
is far worse than ignorance."

421
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
The problem with today's cultural ghettos

422
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
is not lack of knowledge --

423
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
we know a lot about each other, or so we think --

424
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves:

425
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
it makes us elitist,

426
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
distant and disconnected.

427
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
There's a metaphor which I love:

428
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
living like a drawing compass.

429
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.

430
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Meanwhile, the other leg

431
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
draws a wide circle, constantly moving.

432
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Like that, my fiction as well.

433
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
One part of it is rooted in Istanbul,

434
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
with strong Turkish roots,

435
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
but the other part travels the world,

436
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
connecting to different cultures.

437
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
In that sense, I like to think of my fiction

438
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
as both local and universal,

439
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
both from here and everywhere.

440
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Now those of you who have been to Istanbul

441
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
have probably seen Topkapi Palace,

442
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
which was the residence of Ottoman sultans

443
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
for more than 400 years.

444
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
In the palace, just outside the quarters

445
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
of the favorite concubines,

446
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.

447
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
It's between buildings.

448
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I'm intrigued by this concept.

449
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
We usually distrust those areas

450
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
that fall in between things.

451
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
We see them as the domain

452
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
of supernatural creatures like the djinn,

453
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
who are made of smokeless fire

454
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and are the symbol of elusiveness.

455
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
But my point is perhaps

456
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that elusive space

457
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
is what writers and artists need most.

458
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
When I write fiction

459
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
I cherish elusiveness and changeability.

460
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.

461
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I like it when my characters surprise me.

462
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I might write about

463
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
a Muslim woman in one novel,

464
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and perhaps it will be a very happy story,

465
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and in my next book, I might write

466
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
about a handsome, gay professor in Norway.

467
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
As long as it comes from our hearts,

468
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
we can write about anything and everything.

469
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Audre Lorde once said,

470
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
"The white fathers taught us to say,

471
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
'I think, therefore I am.'"

472
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
She suggested, "I feel, therefore I am free."

473
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.

474
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And yet, why is it that,

475
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
in creative writing courses today,

476
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
the very first thing we teach students is

477
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
"write what you know"?

478
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.

479
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about

480
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
writing who we are or what we know

481
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
or what our identity is about.

482
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
We should teach young people and ourselves

483
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
to expand our hearts

484
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
and write what we can feel.

485
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
We should get out of our cultural ghetto

486
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and go visit the next one and the next.

487
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes,

488
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
drawing circles beyond circles.

489
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
They connect all humanity,

490
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
regardless of identity politics,

491
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
and that is the good news.

0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem:

493
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
"Come, let us be friends for once;

494
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
let us make life easy on us;

495
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
let us be lovers and loved ones;

496
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
the earth shall be left to no one."

497
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Thank you.

498
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000

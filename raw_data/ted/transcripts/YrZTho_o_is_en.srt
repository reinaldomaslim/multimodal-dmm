2
0:00:12.876,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So, when I was in art school,

3
0:00:14.665,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I developed a shake in my hand,

4
0:00:16.084,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and this was the straightest line I could draw.

5
0:00:19.116,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,

6
0:00:21.767,000 --> 0:00:24,000
like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,

7
0:00:24.956,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but at the time this was really doomsday.

8
0:00:27.654,000 --> 0:00:3,000
This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.

9
0:00:31.271,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The shake developed out of, really,

10
0:00:33.641,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a single-minded pursuit of pointillism,

11
0:00:35.548,000 --> 0:00:37,000
just years of making tiny, tiny dots.

12
0:00:38.102,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round

13
0:00:41.996,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.

14
0:00:45.684,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter,

15
0:00:47.929,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and this progressively made the shake worse,

16
0:00:50.244,000 --> 0:00:52,000
so I'd hold the pen tighter still.

17
0:00:52.516,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And this became a vicious cycle that ended up

18
0:00:54.732,000 --> 0:00:56,000
causing so much pain and joint issues,

19
0:00:56.956,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I had trouble holding anything.

20
0:00:59.172,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And after spending all my life wanting to do art,

21
0:01:02.557,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I left art school, and then I left art completely.

22
0:01:07.168,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art,

23
0:01:09.628,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake

24
0:01:11.92,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and discovered I had permanent nerve damage.

25
0:01:14.78,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And he actually took one look at my squiggly line,

26
0:01:17.509,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?"

27
0:01:20.932,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,

28
0:01:23.542,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.

29
0:01:25.45,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I was making all these scribble pictures.

30
0:01:27.544,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And even though it wasn't the kind of art

31
0:01:29.374,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.

32
0:01:33.03,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And more importantly, once I embraced the shake,

33
0:01:35.509,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I realized I could still make art.

34
0:01:37.884,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I just had to find a different approach

35
0:01:39.154,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to making the art that I wanted.

36
0:01:41.507,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,

37
0:01:44.347,000 --> 0:01:45,000
seeing these little tiny dots come together

38
0:01:46.176,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to make this unified whole.

39
0:01:48.157,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images

40
0:01:51.108,000 --> 0:01:53,000
where the shake wouldn't affect the work,

41
0:01:53.286,000 --> 0:01:57,000
like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,

42
0:01:57.763,000 --> 0:02:,000
or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,

43
0:02:01.461,000 --> 0:02:06,000
creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.

44
0:02:06.924,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,

45
0:02:10.268,000 --> 0:02:12,000
my hand really wouldn't hurt,

46
0:02:12.676,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and after having gone from a single approach to art,

47
0:02:16.276,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I ended up having an approach to creativity

48
0:02:18.527,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that completely changed my artistic horizons.

49
0:02:22.228,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This was the first time I'd encountered this idea

50
0:02:24.148,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.

51
0:02:29.62,000 --> 0:02:31,000
At the time, I was finishing up school,

52
0:02:32.036,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.

53
0:02:35.644,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like

54
0:02:39.405,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I could do so much more with the supplies

55
0:02:41.515,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I thought an artist was supposed to have.

56
0:02:44.047,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.

57
0:02:46.252,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair

58
0:02:48.764,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from the office that I worked at.

59
0:02:51.012,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,

60
0:02:53.944,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I got myself to the art store,

61
0:02:55.598,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I just went nuts buying supplies.

62
0:02:58.712,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And then when I got home, I sat down

63
0:03:00.34,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I set myself to task to really try to create something

64
0:03:03.448,000 --> 0:03:05,000
just completely outside of the box.

65
0:03:06.212,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.

66
0:03:10.636,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The same thing the next day, and then the next,

67
0:03:13.183,000 --> 0:03:16,000
quickly slipping into a creative slump.

68
0:03:16.872,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.

69
0:03:21.12,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able

70
0:03:23.694,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.

71
0:03:28.068,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But as I searched around in the darkness,

72
0:03:30.28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices

73
0:03:33.808,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that I never had before.

74
0:03:36.376,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.

75
0:03:40.099,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Embrace the shake.

76
0:03:42.816,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,

77
0:03:45.492,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box

78
0:03:49.256,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and get back into it.

79
0:03:51.972,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I wondered, could you become more creative, then,

80
0:03:54.058,000 --> 0:03:56,000
by looking for limitations?

81
0:03:56.956,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?

82
0:04:02.137,000 --> 0:04:04,000
At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in --

83
0:04:04.41,000 --> 0:04:06,000
well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks —

84
0:04:07.183,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,

85
0:04:10.391,000 --> 0:04:12,000
so I decided to ask for 50.

86
0:04:12.784,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Surprisingly, they just handed them right over,

87
0:04:14.567,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and then with some pencils I already had,

88
0:04:16.555,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I made this project for only 80 cents.

89
0:04:19.735,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It really became a moment of clarification for me

90
0:04:22.271,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that we need to first be limited

91
0:04:25.151,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in order to become limitless.

92
0:04:28.199,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I took this approach of thinking inside the box

93
0:04:30.207,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of

94
0:04:32.11,000 --> 0:04:35,000
painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?

95
0:04:35.439,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,

96
0:04:38.023,000 --> 0:04:39,000
one on top of another,

97
0:04:39.223,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with each picture representing an influence in my life.

98
0:04:43.723,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Or what if, instead of painting with a brush,

99
0:04:46.375,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter)

100
0:04:49.127,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So I'd dip my hands in paint,

101
0:04:50.603,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and I just attacked the canvas,

102
0:04:52.023,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie

103
0:04:54.732,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.

104
0:04:57.664,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

105
0:05:01.027,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Or, what if instead of relying on myself,

106
0:05:05.232,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I had to rely on other people

107
0:05:07.165,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to create the content for the art?

108
0:05:09.817,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.

109
0:05:12.608,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I slept on the floor and I ate takeout,

110
0:05:15.248,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I asked people to call me and share a story with me

111
0:05:17.553,000 --> 0:05:19,000
about a life-changing moment.

112
0:05:20.236,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Their stories became the art

113
0:05:22.688,000 --> 0:05:25,000
as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.

114
0:05:26.2,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:30.665,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Or what if instead of making art to display,

116
0:05:35.161,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I had to destroy it?

117
0:05:37.424,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This seemed like the ultimate limitation,

118
0:05:39.696,000 --> 0:05:41,000
being an artist without art.

119
0:05:42.188,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project

120
0:05:44.736,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that I called Goodbye Art,

121
0:05:46.089,000 --> 0:05:5,000
where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.

122
0:05:50.785,000 --> 0:05:51,000
In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on

123
0:05:52.276,000 --> 0:05:54,000
forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,

124
0:05:55.003,000 --> 0:05:57,000
made with over 7,000 matches.

125
0:05:57.808,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

126
0:05:58.974,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.

127
0:06:02.163,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I looked for temporary materials,

128
0:06:04.776,000 --> 0:06:06,000
like spitting out food --

129
0:06:06.95,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter) —

130
0:06:11.012,000 --> 0:06:14,000
sidewalk chalk

131
0:06:14.225,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and even frozen wine.

132
0:06:18.761,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The last iteration of destruction

133
0:06:20.822,000 --> 0:06:24,000
was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.

134
0:06:24.865,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,

135
0:06:28.208,000 --> 0:06:31,000
then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,

136
0:06:31.848,000 --> 0:06:34,000
then assembled the videos into the larger image.

137
0:06:35.761,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.

138
0:06:40.28,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It was destroyed before it ever existed.

139
0:06:44.122,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In the course of this Goodbye Art series,

140
0:06:46.608,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I created 23 different pieces

141
0:06:49.44,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with nothing left to physically display.

142
0:06:52.752,000 --> 0:06:54,000
What I thought would be the ultimate limitation

143
0:06:55.176,000 --> 0:06:57,000
actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,

144
0:06:58.104,000 --> 0:07:,000
as each time I created,

145
0:07:00.307,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the destruction brought me back to a neutral place

146
0:07:02.319,000 --> 0:07:06,000
where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.

147
0:07:06.604,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It did not happen overnight.

148
0:07:08.96,000 --> 0:07:1,000
There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,

149
0:07:11.011,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them

150
0:07:13.8,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the end image was kind of embarrassing.

151
0:07:16.312,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But having committed to the process, I continued on,

152
0:07:19.032,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and something really surprising came out of this.

153
0:07:21.043,000 --> 0:07:23,000
As I destroyed each project,

154
0:07:24.009,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I was learning to let go,

155
0:07:26.841,000 --> 0:07:29,000
let go of outcomes, let go of failures,

156
0:07:30.352,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and let go of imperfections.

157
0:07:32.875,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And in return, I found a process of creating art

158
0:07:35.304,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that's perpetual and unencumbered by results.

159
0:07:39.529,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I found myself in a state of constant creation,

160
0:07:41.558,000 --> 0:07:43,000
thinking only of what's next

161
0:07:44.056,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and coming up with more ideas than ever.

162
0:07:46.952,000 --> 0:07:48,000
When I think back to my three years away from art,

163
0:07:49.437,000 --> 0:07:52,000
away from my dream, just going through the motions,

164
0:07:52.688,000 --> 0:07:55,000
instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,

165
0:07:56.44,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I just quit, I gave up.

166
0:07:59.64,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And what if I didn't embrace the shake?

167
0:08:03.256,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Because embracing the shake for me

168
0:08:04.453,000 --> 0:08:06,000
wasn't just about art and having art skills.

169
0:08:07.093,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It turned out to be about life, and having life skills.

170
0:08:11.528,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Because ultimately, most of what we do

171
0:08:14.039,000 --> 0:08:19,000
takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.

172
0:08:19.611,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations

173
0:08:23.28,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is the best hope we have to transform ourselves

174
0:08:27.359,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and, collectively, transform our world.

175
0:08:31.224,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Looking at limitations as a source of creativity

176
0:08:35.392,000 --> 0:08:37,000
changed the course of my life.

177
0:08:38.248,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now, when I run into a barrier

178
0:08:39.939,000 --> 0:08:42,000
or I find myself creatively stumped,

179
0:08:43.048,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I sometimes still struggle,

180
0:08:44.602,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but I continue to show up for the process

181
0:08:46.696,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and try to remind myself of the possibilities,

182
0:08:50.193,000 --> 0:08:54,000
like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,

183
0:08:54.788,000 --> 0:08:58,000
using a pushpin to tattoo a banana,

184
0:08:59.175,000 --> 0:09:05,000
or painting a picture with hamburger grease.

185
0:09:05.198,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:07.052,000 --> 0:09:08,000
One of my most recent endeavors

187
0:09:08.659,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned

188
0:09:12.103,000 --> 0:09:15,000
into something others can replicate.

189
0:09:15.287,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Limitations may be the most unlikely of places

190
0:09:19.144,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to harness creativity, but perhaps

191
0:09:22.538,000 --> 0:09:25,000
one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,

192
0:09:26.208,000 --> 0:09:29,000
rethink categories and challenge accepted norms.

193
0:09:30.111,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And instead of telling each other to seize the day,

194
0:09:33.97,000 --> 0:09:36,000
maybe we can remind ourselves every day

195
0:09:37.933,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to seize the limitation.

196
0:09:40.447,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Thank you.

197
0:09:41.914,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.711,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Six thousand miles of road,

2
0:00:15.531,000 --> 0:00:17,000
600 miles of subway track,

3
0:00:17.734,000 --> 0:00:18,000
400 miles of bike lanes

4
0:00:19.378,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and a half a mile of tram track,

5
0:00:21.199,000 --> 0:00:22,000
if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.

6
0:00:23.152,000 --> 0:00:26,000
These are the numbers that make up the infrastructure of New York City.

7
0:00:26.486,000 --> 0:00:28,000
These are the statistics of our infrastructure.

8
0:00:29.105,000 --> 0:00:32,000
They're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies.

9
0:00:32.811,000 --> 0:00:35,000
For example, the Department of Transportation will probably tell you

10
0:00:36.01,000 --> 0:00:37,000
how many miles of road they maintain.

11
0:00:37.791,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The MTA will boast how many miles of subway track there are.

12
0:00:40.612,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Most city agencies give us statistics.

13
0:00:42.419,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This is from a report this year

14
0:00:43.902,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from the Taxi and Limousine Commission,

15
0:00:45.794,000 --> 0:00:48,000
where we learn that there's about 13,500 taxis here in New York City.

16
0:00:49.07,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Pretty interesting, right?

17
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But did you ever think about where these numbers came from?

18
0:00:53.144,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Because for these numbers to exist, someone at the city agency

19
0:00:56.047,000 --> 0:00:59,000
had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number that somebody might want want to know.

20
0:00:59.927,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Here's a number that our citizens want to know.

21
0:01:02.177,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So they go back to their raw data,

22
0:01:04.007,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they count, they add, they calculate,

23
0:01:05.804,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and then they put out reports,

24
0:01:07.271,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and those reports will have numbers like this.

25
0:01:09.448,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The problem is, how do they know all of our questions?

26
0:01:11.988,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We have lots of questions.

27
0:01:13.231,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In fact, in some ways there's literally an infinite number of questions

28
0:01:16.571,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that we can ask about our city.

29
0:01:18.22,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The agencies can never keep up.

30
0:01:19.695,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So the paradigm isn't exactly working, and I think our policymakers realize that,

31
0:01:23.751,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg signed into law what he called

32
0:01:27.71,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country.

33
0:01:31.547,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In a lot of ways, he's right.

34
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In the last two years, the city has released 1,000 datasets

35
0:01:35.981,000 --> 0:01:36,000
on our open data portal,

36
0:01:37.591,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and it's pretty awesome.

37
0:01:39.355,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So you go and look at data like this,

38
0:01:41.323,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and instead of just counting the number of cabs,

39
0:01:43.612,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we can start to ask different questions.

40
0:01:45.555,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So I had a question.

41
0:01:46.755,000 --> 0:01:47,000
When's rush hour in New York City?

42
0:01:48.456,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It can be pretty bothersome. When is rush hour exactly?

43
0:01:51.037,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And I thought to myself, these cabs aren't just numbers,

44
0:01:53.662,000 --> 0:01:55,000
these are GPS recorders driving around in our city streets

45
0:01:56.373,000 --> 0:01:57,000
recording each and every ride they take.

46
0:01:58.286,000 --> 0:02:,000
There's data there, and I looked at that data,

47
0:02:00.608,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I made a plot of the average speed of taxis in New York City throughout the day.

48
0:02:04.569,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You can see that from about midnight to around 5:18 in the morning,

49
0:02:07.981,000 --> 0:02:1,000
speed increases, and at that point, things turn around,

50
0:02:11.544,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and they get slower and slower and slower until about 8:35 in the morning,

51
0:02:15.506,000 --> 0:02:17,000
when they end up at around 11 and a half miles per hour.

52
0:02:18.199,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The average taxi is going 11 and a half miles per hour on our city streets,

53
0:02:21.761,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and it turns out it stays that way

54
0:02:23.748,000 --> 0:02:26,000
for the entire day.

55
0:02:27.116,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:28.489,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So I said to myself, I guess there's no rush hour in New York City.

57
0:02:31.669,000 --> 0:02:32,000
There's just a rush day.

58
0:02:33.206,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Makes sense. And this is important for a couple of reasons.

59
0:02:36.056,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If you're a transportation planner, this might be pretty interesting to know.

60
0:02:39.693,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But if you want to get somewhere quickly,

61
0:02:41.668,000 --> 0:02:44,000
you now know to set your alarm for 4:45 in the morning and you're all set.

62
0:02:45.136,000 --> 0:02:46,000
New York, right?

63
0:02:46.18,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But there's a story behind this data.

64
0:02:47.942,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This data wasn't just available, it turns out.

65
0:02:50.127,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It actually came from something called a Freedom of Information Law Request,

66
0:02:53.746,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or a FOIL Request.

67
0:02:54.822,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is a form you can find on the Taxi and Limousine Commission website.

68
0:02:58.288,000 --> 0:03:,000
In order to access this data, you need to go get this form,

69
0:03:01.114,000 --> 0:03:02,000
fill it out, and they will notify you,

70
0:03:02.96,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and a guy named Chris Whong did exactly that.

71
0:03:05.09,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Chris went down, and they told him,

72
0:03:06.98,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"Just bring a brand new hard drive down to our office,

73
0:03:09.807,000 --> 0:03:12,000
leave it here for five hours, we'll copy the data and you take it back."

74
0:03:13.231,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that's where this data came from.

75
0:03:15.263,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, Chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public,

76
0:03:18.268,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and so it ended up online for all to use, and that's where this graph came from.

77
0:03:22.052,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And the fact that it exists is amazing. These GPS recorders -- really cool.

78
0:03:25.57,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives

79
0:03:28.688,000 --> 0:03:3,000
picking up data from city agencies to make it public --

80
0:03:31.27,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it was already kind of public, you could get to it,

81
0:03:33.66,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but it was "public," it wasn't public.

82
0:03:35.472,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And we can do better than that as a city.

83
0:03:37.434,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We don't need our citizens walking around with hard drives.

84
0:03:40.19,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now, not every dataset is behind a FOIL Request.

85
0:03:42.527,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Here is a map I made with the most dangerous intersections in New York City

86
0:03:46.329,000 --> 0:03:47,000
based on cyclist accidents.

87
0:03:48.207,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So the red areas are more dangerous.

88
0:03:50.146,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And what it shows is first the East side of Manhattan,

89
0:03:52.699,000 --> 0:03:55,000
especially in the lower area of Manhattan, has more cyclist accidents.

90
0:03:56.31,000 --> 0:03:57,000
That might make sense

91
0:03:57.329,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because there are more cyclists coming off the bridges there.

92
0:04:00.225,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But there's other hotspots worth studying.

93
0:04:02.239,000 --> 0:04:04,000
There's Williamsburg. There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.

94
0:04:04.908,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And this is exactly the kind of data we need for Vision Zero.

95
0:04:07.76,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is exactly what we're looking for.

96
0:04:09.75,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But there's a story behind this data as well.

97
0:04:11.885,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This data didn't just appear.

98
0:04:13.952,000 --> 0:04:15,000
How many of you guys know this logo?

99
0:04:16.343,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Yeah, I see some shakes.

100
0:04:17.695,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a PDF

101
0:04:20.35,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and make sense of it?

102
0:04:21.707,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I see more shakes.

103
0:04:22.767,000 --> 0:04:25,000
More of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo. I like that.

104
0:04:26.112,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So what happened is, the data that you just saw was actually on a PDF.

105
0:04:29.622,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In fact, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of PDF

106
0:04:32.727,000 --> 0:04:34,000
put out by our very own NYPD,

107
0:04:34.886,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and in order to access it, you would either have to copy and paste

108
0:04:38.038,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for hundreds and hundreds of hours,

109
0:04:39.764,000 --> 0:04:4,000
or you could be John Krauss.

110
0:04:41.108,000 --> 0:04:42,000
John Krauss was like,

111
0:04:42.151,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I'm not going to copy and paste this data. I'm going to write a program.

112
0:04:45.564,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,

113
0:04:47.852,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and it goes to the NYPD's website and it would download PDFs.

114
0:04:50.884,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Every day it would search; if it found a PDF, it would download it

115
0:04:54.01,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and then it would run some PDF-scraping program,

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and out would come the text,

117
0:04:57.596,000 --> 0:05:,000
and it would go on the Internet, and then people could make maps like that.

118
0:05:01.161,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And the fact that the data's here, the fact that we have access to it --

119
0:05:04.59,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Every accident, by the way, is a row in this table.

120
0:05:07.04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You can imagine how many PDFs that is.

121
0:05:08.876,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The fact that we have access to that is great,

122
0:05:11.083,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but let's not release it in PDF form,

123
0:05:13.193,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because then we're having our citizens write PDF scrapers.

124
0:05:15.932,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's not the best use of our citizens' time,

125
0:05:18.008,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and we as a city can do better than that.

126
0:05:20.012,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, the good news is that the de Blasio administration

127
0:05:22.748,000 --> 0:05:24,000
actually recently released this data a few months ago,

128
0:05:25.28,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and so now we can actually have access to it,

129
0:05:27.438,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but there's a lot of data still entombed in PDF.

130
0:05:29.974,000 --> 0:05:32,000
For example, our crime data is still only available in PDF.

131
0:05:33.171,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And not just our crime data, our own city budget.

132
0:05:36.926,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Our city budget is only readable right now in PDF form.

133
0:05:40.655,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And it's not just us that can't analyze it --

134
0:05:42.796,000 --> 0:05:44,000
our own legislators who vote for the budget

135
0:05:45.751,000 --> 0:05:46,000
also only get it in PDF.

136
0:05:47.694,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So our legislators cannot analyze the budget that they are voting for.

137
0:05:51.538,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I think as a city we can do a little better than that as well.

138
0:05:55.146,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Now, there's a lot of data that's not hidden in PDFs.

139
0:05:57.634,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is an example of a map I made,

140
0:05:59.334,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and this is the dirtiest waterways in New York City.

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now, how do I measure dirty?

142
0:06:03.769,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Well, it's kind of a little weird,

143
0:06:05.626,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but I looked at the level of fecal coliform,

144
0:06:07.739,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which is a measurement of fecal matter in each of our waterways.

145
0:06:11.245,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The larger the circle, the dirtier the water,

146
0:06:14.519,000 --> 0:06:17,000
so the large circles are dirty water, the small circles are cleaner.

147
0:06:17.876,000 --> 0:06:18,000
What you see is inland waterways.

148
0:06:19.52,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is all data that was sampled by the city over the last five years.

149
0:06:22.924,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And inland waterways are, in general, dirtier.

150
0:06:25.618,000 --> 0:06:26,000
That makes sense, right?

151
0:06:26.836,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And the bigger circles are dirty. And I learned a few things from this.

152
0:06:30.21,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Number one: Never swim in anything that ends in "creek" or "canal."

153
0:06:33.374,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But number two: I also found the dirtiest waterway in New York City,

154
0:06:37.692,000 --> 0:06:38,000
by this measure, one measure.

155
0:06:39.526,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In Coney Island Creek, which is not the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.

156
0:06:43.174,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's on the other side.

157
0:06:44.332,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But Coney Island Creek, 94 percent of samples taken over the last five years

158
0:06:48.21,000 --> 0:06:5,000
have had fecal levels so high

159
0:06:50.367,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that it would be against state law to swim in the water.

160
0:06:53.46,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And this is not the kind of fact that you're going to see

161
0:06:56.189,000 --> 0:06:57,000
boasted in a city report, right?

162
0:06:57.726,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's not going to be the front page on nyc.gov.

163
0:06:59.976,000 --> 0:07:,000
You're not going to see it there,

164
0:07:01.556,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but the fact that we can get to that data is awesome.

165
0:07:04.074,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But once again, it wasn't super easy,

166
0:07:05.847,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because this data was not on the open data portal.

167
0:07:08.205,000 --> 0:07:1,000
If you were to go to the open data portal,

168
0:07:10.218,000 --> 0:07:12,000
you'd see just a snippet of it, a year or a few months.

169
0:07:12.831,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It was actually on the Department of Environmental Protection's website.

170
0:07:16.221,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And each one of these links is an Excel sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.

171
0:07:20.099,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Every heading is different: you copy, paste, reorganize.

172
0:07:22.729,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When you do you can make maps and that's great, but once again,

173
0:07:25.681,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we can do better than that as a city, we can normalize things.

174
0:07:28.65,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And we're getting there, because there's this website that Socrata makes

175
0:07:32.034,000 --> 0:07:33,000
called the Open Data Portal NYC.

176
0:07:33.575,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This is where 1,100 data sets that don't suffer

177
0:07:35.832,000 --> 0:07:36,000
from the things I just told you live,

178
0:07:37.613,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and that number is growing, and that's great.

179
0:07:39.761,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You can download data in any format, be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.

180
0:07:43.173,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Whatever you want, you can download the data that way.

181
0:07:45.72,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The problem is, once you do,

182
0:07:47.072,000 --> 0:07:5,000
you will find that each agency codes their addresses differently.

183
0:07:50.758,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So one is street name, intersection street,

184
0:07:52.899,000 --> 0:07:54,000
street, borough, address, building, building address.

185
0:07:55.39,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So once again, you're spending time, even when we have this portal,

186
0:07:58.57,000 --> 0:08:,000
you're spending time normalizing our address fields.

187
0:08:01.176,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And that's not the best use of our citizens' time.

188
0:08:03.599,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We can do better than that as a city.

189
0:08:05.395,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We can standardize our addresses,

190
0:08:07.04,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and if we do, we can get more maps like this.

191
0:08:09.225,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is a map of fire hydrants in New York City,

192
0:08:11.51,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but not just any fire hydrants.

193
0:08:13.041,000 --> 0:08:17,000
These are the top 250 grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets.

194
0:08:17.767,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:19.753,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So I learned a few things from this map, and I really like this map.

196
0:08:23.111,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Number one, just don't park on the Upper East Side.

197
0:08:25.513,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Just don't. It doesn't matter where you park, you will get a hydrant ticket.

198
0:08:29.1,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Number two, I found the two highest grossing hydrants in all of New York City,

199
0:08:33.253,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and they're on the Lower East Side,

200
0:08:35.139,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and they were bringing in over 55,000 dollars a year in parking tickets.

201
0:08:40.237,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And that seemed a little strange to me when I noticed it,

202
0:08:42.975,000 --> 0:08:45,000
so I did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant

203
0:08:46.244,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and then something called a curb extension,

204
0:08:48.24,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which is like a seven-foot space to walk on,

205
0:08:50.299,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and then a parking spot.

206
0:08:51.455,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And so these cars came along, and the hydrant --

207
0:08:53.709,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"

208
0:08:55.62,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and there was actually a parking spot painted there beautifully for them.

209
0:08:59.094,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They would park there, and the NYPD disagreed with this designation

210
0:09:02.249,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and would ticket them.

211
0:09:03.307,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And it wasn't just me who found a parking ticket.

212
0:09:05.651,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This is the Google Street View car driving by

213
0:09:07.797,000 --> 0:09:08,000
finding the same parking ticket.

214
0:09:09.414,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So I wrote about this on my blog, on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,

215
0:09:13.918,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and they said,

216
0:09:14.938,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"While the DOT has not received any complaints about this location,

217
0:09:18.348,000 --> 0:09:22,000
we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations."

218
0:09:22.89,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And I thought to myself, typical government response,

219
0:09:25.849,000 --> 0:09:26,000
all right, moved on with my life.

220
0:09:27.73,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But then, a few weeks later, something incredible happened.

221
0:09:31.7,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They repainted the spot,

222
0:09:34.22,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and for a second I thought I saw the future of open data,

223
0:09:36.91,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because think about what happened here.

224
0:09:38.91,000 --> 0:09:43,000
For five years, this spot was being ticketed, and it was confusing,

225
0:09:44.01,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and then a citizen found something, they told the city, and within a few weeks

226
0:09:48.316,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the problem was fixed.

227
0:09:49.61,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's amazing. And a lot of people see open data as being a watchdog.

228
0:09:52.81,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's not, it's about being a partner.

229
0:09:54.582,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We can empower our citizens to be better partners for government,

230
0:09:57.72,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and it's not that hard.

231
0:09:59.601,000 --> 0:10:,000
All we need are a few changes.

232
0:10:01.06,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If you're FOILing data,

233
0:10:02.167,000 --> 0:10:04,000
if you're seeing your data being FOILed over and over again,

234
0:10:05.034,000 --> 0:10:08,000
let's release it to the public, that's a sign that it should be made public.

235
0:10:08.608,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And if you're a government agency releasing a PDF,

236
0:10:11.09,000 --> 0:10:14,000
let's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data,

237
0:10:14.739,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because that data is coming from somewhere.

238
0:10:16.767,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I don't know where, but it's coming from somewhere,

239
0:10:19.249,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and you can release it with the PDF.

240
0:10:20.974,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And let's adopt and share some open data standards.

241
0:10:23.385,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Let's start with our addresses here in New York City.

242
0:10:25.866,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Let's just start normalizing our addresses.

243
0:10:27.94,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Because New York is a leader in open data.

244
0:10:30.002,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Despite all this, we are absolutely a leader in open data,

245
0:10:32.791,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and if we start normalizing things, and set an open data standard,

246
0:10:35.912,000 --> 0:10:38,000
others will follow. The state will follow, and maybe the federal government,

247
0:10:39.546,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Other countries could follow,

248
0:10:40.991,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and we're not that far off from a time where you could write one program

249
0:10:44.402,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and map information from 100 countries.

250
0:10:46.292,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's not science fiction. We're actually quite close.

251
0:10:48.779,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And by the way, who are we empowering with this?

252
0:10:51.019,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Because it's not just John Krauss and it's not just Chris Whong.

253
0:10:54.024,000 --> 0:10:57,000
There are hundreds of meetups going on in New York City right now,

254
0:10:57.119,000 --> 0:10:58,000
active meetups.

255
0:10:58.144,000 --> 0:11:,000
There are thousands of people attending these meetups.

256
0:11:00.716,000 --> 0:11:02,000
These people are going after work and on weekends,

257
0:11:03.084,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and they're attending these meetups to look at open data

258
0:11:05.72,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and make our city a better place.

259
0:11:07.36,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week released something called citygram.nyc

260
0:11:11.433,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that allows you to subscribe to 311 complaints

261
0:11:13.58,000 --> 0:11:15,000
around your own home, or around your office.

262
0:11:15.648,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You put in your address, you get local complaints.

263
0:11:18.075,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And it's not just the tech community that are after these things.

264
0:11:21.449,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It's urban planners like the students I teach at Pratt.

265
0:11:24.071,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's policy advocates, it's everyone,

266
0:11:25.99,000 --> 0:11:27,000
it's citizens from a diverse set of backgrounds.

267
0:11:28.553,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And with some small, incremental changes,

268
0:11:31.339,000 --> 0:11:34,000
we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens

269
0:11:34.564,000 --> 0:11:37,000
to harness open data and make our city even better,

270
0:11:37.72,000 --> 0:11:4,000
whether it's one dataset, or one parking spot at a time.

271
0:11:41.346,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Thank you.

272
0:11:43.668,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Applause)

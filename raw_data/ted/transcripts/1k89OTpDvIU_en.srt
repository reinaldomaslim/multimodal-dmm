1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I design engineering projects

2
0:00:14.92,000 --> 0:00:16,000
for middle school and high school students,

3
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:19,000
often using materials that are pretty unexpected.

4
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My inspiration comes from problems in my daily life.

5
0:00:24.88,000 --> 0:00:25,000
For example,

6
0:00:26.12,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one time I needed a costume to go to a comic convention,

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I didn't want to spend too much money,

8
0:00:32.24,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so I made my own ...

9
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with a light-up crown and skirt.

10
0:00:36.72,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:38.64,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Another time,

12
0:00:39.88,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was devastated because my favorite mobile game,

13
0:00:43.84,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Flappy Bird,

14
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:46,000
was being taken off the app store.

15
0:00:46.76,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:48.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So I was faced with the dilemma

17
0:00:50.4,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to either never update my phone or never play Flappy Bird again.

18
0:00:54.32,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:57.24,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Unhappy with both options,

20
0:00:59.28,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I did the only thing that made sense to me.

21
0:01:01.84,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I made a physical version of Flappy Bird

22
0:01:04.04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that could never be taken off the app store.

23
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:09.12,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Music)

25
0:01:14.28,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Beeping)

26
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Music)

27
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So a few of my friends were also pretty addicted to the game,

29
0:01:24.28,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I invited them to play as well.

30
0:01:26.96,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Video) Friend: Ah!

31
0:01:28.2,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Video) Friend: What the heck?

33
0:01:32.64,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:33.68,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game.

35
0:01:37.68,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:39.04,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So I uploaded a demo of this project online,

37
0:01:42.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and to my surprise it went viral.

38
0:01:44.96,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It had over two million views in just a few days.

39
0:01:48.08,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:49.52,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And what's more interesting are people's comments.

41
0:01:52.76,000 --> 0:01:54,000
A lot of people wanted to make it their own,

42
0:01:55.2,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or asked me how it was made.

43
0:01:57.08,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project,

44
0:02:01.4,000 --> 0:02:03,000
we can teach people about engineering.

45
0:02:04.44,000 --> 0:02:06,000
With the money made from the viral video,

46
0:02:06.6,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we were able to let students in our classroom

47
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:1,000
all make their own game in a box.

48
0:02:11.56,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Although it was pretty challenging,

49
0:02:13.44,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they learned a lot of new concepts in engineering and programming.

50
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well.

51
0:02:20.52,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:22.44,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So before Flappy Bird Box,

53
0:02:25.08,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I had the idea of using creative engineering projects to teach students.

54
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
When I was teaching at a middle school,

55
0:02:32.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we asked our students to build a robot from a standard technology kit.

56
0:02:37.76,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I noticed that a lot of them seemed bored.

57
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Then a few of them started taking pieces of paper

58
0:02:43.48,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and decorating their robots.

59
0:02:45.12,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And then more of them got into it,

60
0:02:47.08,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and they became more interested in the project.

61
0:02:49.72,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So I started looking for more creative ways

62
0:02:52.64,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to introduce technology to students.

63
0:02:55.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
What I found was that most technology kits available in school

64
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
look a little intimidating.

65
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They're all made of plastic parts that you can't customize.

66
0:03:05.56,000 --> 0:03:07,000
On top of that, they're all very expensive,

67
0:03:08.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
costing hundreds of dollars per kit.

68
0:03:10.68,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So that's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets.

69
0:03:15.32,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Since I didn't find anything,

70
0:03:16.8,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I decided to make something on my own.

71
0:03:19.04,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I started with paper and fabric.

72
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
After all, we all played with those since we were kids,

73
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and they are also pretty cheap

74
0:03:26.76,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and can be found anywhere around the house.

75
0:03:30.2,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I prototyped a project

76
0:03:31.92,000 --> 0:03:33,000
where students can create a light-up creature

77
0:03:34.52,000 --> 0:03:36,000
using fabric and googly eyes.

78
0:03:37.04,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They were all helping each other in classrooms,

79
0:03:39.28,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and were laughing and discussing the project.

80
0:03:41.72,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And most importantly,

81
0:03:42.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
they were able to insert their own creativity into the project.

82
0:03:46.68,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So because of the success of this project,

83
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I continued to create more engineering projects

84
0:03:51.48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to challenge my students.

85
0:03:53.36,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I also started to take these workshops outside of school

86
0:03:57.28,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and into the community.

87
0:03:58.84,000 --> 0:04:,000
And something really interesting happened.

88
0:04:01.2,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds

89
0:04:04.24,000 --> 0:04:06,000
started coming to our workshops.

90
0:04:06.64,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And specifically,

91
0:04:08.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
there were a lot more women and minorities than I expected,

92
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and that you wouldn't usually see at a traditional engineering workshop.

93
0:04:17.28,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in 2016.

94
0:04:23.2,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Women make up only 19 percent of the technology workforce.

95
0:04:27.28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And underrepresented minorities make up only four percent.

96
0:04:31.44,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This statistic might look familiar

97
0:04:33.519,000 --> 0:04:36,000
if you walked into a high school robotics club,

98
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or a college engineering class.

99
0:04:39.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, there's a wide variety of problems

100
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that contribute to the lack of diversity in the technology force.

101
0:04:48.44,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Perhaps one solution could be

102
0:04:50.52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to introduce technology to students through creative projects.

103
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I'm not saying that this could solve everything,

104
0:04:59.04,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but it could introduce technology

105
0:05:02.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to people who originally wouldn't be interested in it

106
0:05:04.92,000 --> 0:05:06,000
because of how it has been portrayed and taught in school.

107
0:05:08.76,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So how do we start to change the perception of technology?

108
0:05:13.92,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Most students think that it's boring or unwelcoming,

109
0:05:18.56,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so I have always designed projects following three principles.

110
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:24,000
First is having a low floor,

111
0:05:24.88,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and that means this project is easy to get started.

112
0:05:29.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So take a look at this tutorial.

113
0:05:31.88,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The first project we asked students to learn

114
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is to make a circuit on paper.

115
0:05:36.12,000 --> 0:05:38,000
As you can see, it doesn't take very long to learn,

116
0:05:38.64,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it's pretty easy even for beginners.

117
0:05:41.8,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And having a low floor also means that we're removing the financial barrier

118
0:05:46.44,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that prevents people from completing a project.

119
0:05:49.48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So with paper, copper tape, lightbulb and a battery,

120
0:05:53.36,000 --> 0:05:56,000
people can complete this project for under a dollar.

121
0:05:57.28,000 --> 0:06:,000
So second principle is having a high ceiling.

122
0:06:00.76,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This means that there's a lot of room to grow,

123
0:06:03.84,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and students are constantly being challenged.

124
0:06:07.4,000 --> 0:06:09,000
At first it might just be a light-up creature,

125
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but then you can add sensors and microcontrollers,

126
0:06:12.84,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and start to program the creature to interact with its environment.

127
0:06:16.6,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And finally,

129
0:06:19.36,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the third principle is customization.

130
0:06:21.84,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This means that we can make this project relevant to anyone.

131
0:06:26.88,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That's the beauty of using everyday materials;

132
0:06:29.4,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it's very easy to customize using paper and fabric.

133
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So even if you don't like Flappy Bird,

134
0:06:36.36,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you can still make your own game.

135
0:06:39.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Video) Student: So our game is about Justin Bieber,

136
0:06:41.92,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because he's been speeding,

137
0:06:44.64,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the object is to prevent him from getting caught by the LAPD --

138
0:06:49.36,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Video) Student: Yeah, but he's changing so --

140
0:06:54.2,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we're a part of his posse.

141
0:06:56.36,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:58.48,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Thank you.

143
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and actually all the way down into the sewer

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because I want to talk about diarrhea.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And in particular, I want to talk about

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the design of diarrhea.

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And when evolutionary biologists talk about design,

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
they really mean design by natural selection.

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And that brings me to the title of the talk,

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently."

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But I'm not just doing this to be cute.

12
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I really think that this subtitle explains

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
how they actually look at one's role in

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.

16
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You actually see a great potential,

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,

19
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and may actually be very resistant, when one tries

20
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to introduce ideas.

21
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?

23
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And a very closely related question, which is,

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
how can we take control of this situation once we understand

25
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the answer to the first question?

26
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
How can we make the harmful organisms more mild?

27
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said,

28
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
about diarrheal disease organisms.

29
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms

31
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that cause acute infectious disease,

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,

33
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
germ's-eye view.

34
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea

35
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation

36
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in the harmfulness of disease organisms.

37
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,

38
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
disease organisms have to get from one host to another,

39
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host

40
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to move them to another host.

41
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But not always.

42
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Sometimes, you get disease organisms

43
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.

44
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us

45
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that natural selection will favor the more exploitative,

46
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
more predator-like organisms.

47
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So, natural selection will favor organisms

48
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that are more likely to cause damage.

49
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,

50
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then we expect that the winners of the competition

51
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
will be the milder organisms.

52
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,

53
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and actual selection favors pathogens

54
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that take advantage of those hosts,

55
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts

56
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
for their own reproductive success.

57
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,

58
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.

59
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.

60
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.

61
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,

62
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
person-to-food-then-to-person contact,

63
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when somebody eats contaminated food,

64
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or they can be transmitted through the water.

65
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And when they're transmitted through the water,

66
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
unlike the first two modes of transmission,

67
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.

68
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds

69
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of other individuals.

70
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that

71
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
if you've got a sick person in bed,

72
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.

73
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They're going to wash those contaminated materials,

74
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then the water may move into sources of drinking water.

75
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
People will come in to those places where you've got

76
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
contaminated drinking water,

77
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
bring things back to the family,

78
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
may drink right at that point.

79
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The whole point is that a person who can't move

80
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
can still infect many other individuals.

81
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And so, the theory tells us that

82
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,

83
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.

84
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And you can test these ideas.

85
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,

86
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and see whether or not the ones that tend to be

87
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.

88
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the answer is -- yep, they are.

89
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,

90
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but the main point here is that --

91
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
there's a lot of them here, I can tell --

93
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the main point here is that those data points

94
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
all show a very strong, positive association between

95
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,

96
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and how harmful they are,

97
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
how much death they cause per untreated infection.

98
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So this suggests we're on the right track.

99
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But this, to me, suggests that we really need

100
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to ask some additional questions.

101
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was,

102
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
how can we use this knowledge

103
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to make disease organisms evolve to be mild?

104
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,

105
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you could cause disease organisms to shift from

106
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.

107
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But it doesn't tell you how long.

108
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I mean, if this would require thousands of years,

109
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.

110
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But if it could occur in just a few years,

111
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
then it might be a very important way to control

112
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control.

113
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In other words, this suggests that we could

114
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
domesticate these organisms.

115
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.

116
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,

117
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.

118
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And that is the species of organism that is responsible

119
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
for causing cholera.

120
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at

121
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is that we understand why it's so harmful.

122
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's harmful because it produces a toxin,

123
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and that toxin is released when the organism

124
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
gets into our intestinal tract.

125
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine

126
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,

127
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.

128
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors

129
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.

130
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So what happens, if you've got an organism,

131
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it produces a lot of toxin.

132
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
After a few days of infection you end up having --

133
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.

134
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's sort of cloudy water.

135
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And if you took a drop of that water,

136
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you might find a million diarrheal organisms.

137
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
If the organism produced a lot of toxin,

138
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
you might find 10 million, or 100 million.

139
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,

140
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
then you might find a smaller number.

141
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So the task is to try to figure out

142
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this

143
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,

144
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted

145
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by person-to-person contact,

146
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or person-food-person contact --

147
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
both of which would really require that people be

148
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
mobile and fairly healthy for transmission.

149
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, I can think of some possible experiments.

150
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism --

151
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little --

152
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and take those strains and spew them out in different countries.

153
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Some countries that might have clean water supplies,

154
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so that you can't get waterborne transmission:

155
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.

156
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,

157
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
there you expect these organisms to evolve

158
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
towards a high level of harmfulness, right?

159
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
There's a little ethical problem in this experiment.

160
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.

161
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That makes me worry a little bit.

162
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better.

164
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And this ethical problem's a big problem.

165
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.

166
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Here's a girl who's almost dead.

167
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
She got rehydration therapy, she perked up,

168
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
within a few days she was looking like a completely different person.

169
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So, we don't want to run an experiment like that.

170
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.

171
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,

172
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.

173
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now, I don't know how that happened,

174
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.

175
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
I don't think anybody knows,

176
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but I'm not averse to, once that's happened,

177
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to see whether or not the prediction that we would make,

178
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that I did make before, actually holds up.

179
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,

180
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which has some of the most well protected water supplies

181
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in Latin America?

182
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,

183
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which has some of the least well protected?

184
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And Peru's got something sort of in between.

185
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,

186
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I got a lot of strains from these different countries

187
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and we measured their toxin production in the lab.

188
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru

189
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
you had strains entering Chile --

190
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and when you look at those strains,

191
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in the very far left-hand side of this graph,

192
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
you see a lot of variation in the toxin production.

193
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person --

194
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
a lot of variation on which natural selection can act.

195
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,

196
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.

197
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They evolved to produce less toxin.

198
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And to just give you a sense of how important this might be,

199
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,

200
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
on average, reported from Chile every two years.

201
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So, it's controlled.

202
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
That's how much we have in America,

203
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
cholera that's acquired endemically,

204
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and we don't think we've got a problem here.

205
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.

206
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,

207
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.

208
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Well, in Peru it didn't.

209
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And in Ecuador -- remember, this is the place where it has

210
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the highest potential waterborne transmission --

211
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it looked like it got more harmful.

212
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
In every case there's a lot of variation,

213
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
but something about the environment the people are living in,

214
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's

215
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the degree of waterborne transmission,

216
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
favored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.

217
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So, this is very encouraging,

218
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,

219
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.

220
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It would make these organisms evolve to mildness,

221
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so that even though people might be getting infected,

222
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
they'd be infected with mild strains.

223
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It wouldn't be causing severe disease.

224
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But there's another really interesting aspect of this,

225
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,

226
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
evolution of harmfulness,

227
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.

228
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And the idea is very simple.

229
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
If you've got a harmful organism,

230
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,

231
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.

232
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,

233
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
so you get increased virulence leading to

234
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.

235
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And once you get increased antibiotic resistance,

236
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.

237
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So, you've got a higher level of virulence.

238
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So, you get this vicious cycle.

239
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The goal is to turn this around.

240
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence

241
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
by cleaning up the water supply,

242
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease

243
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in antibiotic resistance.

244
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So, we can go to the same countries and look and see.

245
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,

246
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?

247
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
If we look in the beginning of the 1990s,

248
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we see, again, a lot of variation.

249
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --

250
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and I won't go into that.

251
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,

252
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Peru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.

253
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,

254
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.

255
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.

256
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.

257
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.

258
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They got the organism to evolve to mildness,

259
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and they got no development of antibiotic resistance.

260
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Now, these ideas should apply across the board,

261
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.

262
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I want to give you just one more example,

263
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because we've talked a little bit about malaria.

264
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And the example I want to deal with is,

265
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
or the idea I want to deal with, the question is,

266
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?

267
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,

268
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,

269
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.

270
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And you can show, just by looking at data from literature,

271
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that vector-borne diseases are more harmful

272
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
than non-vector-borne diseases.

273
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But I think there's a really fascinating example

274
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.

275
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
In the case of waterborne transmission,

276
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we'd like to clean up the water supplies,

277
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.

278
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.

279
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And the logic's a little more subtle here.

280
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If you mosquito-proof houses,

281
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
when people get sick, they're sitting in bed --

282
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed --

283
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and the mosquitoes can't get to them.

284
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So, if you're a harmful variant

285
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.

286
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The only pathogens that get transmitted

287
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough

288
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to walk outside and get mosquito bites.

289
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So, if you were to mosquito proof houses,

290
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.

291
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done

292
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.

293
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.

294
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Just to give you a little perspective on this,

295
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,

296
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
which is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.

297
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And this really cool experiment was done

298
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,

299
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
by the Tennessee Valley Authority.

300
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.

301
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They'd caused the water to back up,

302
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
they needed electric, hydroelectric power.

303
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.

304
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
They found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams --

305
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,

306
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
about a third to half of them were infected with malaria.

307
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This shows you the positions of some of these dams.

308
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
OK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.

309
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
There wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?

310
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.

311
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,

312
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and within three years, about 100 dollars per house,

313
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
they mosquito proofed every house.

314
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And these are the data.

315
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones.

316
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And the asterisks represent the time at which

317
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the mosquito proofing was complete.

318
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And so what you can see is that

319
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,

320
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
caused the eradication of malaria.

321
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And this was, incidentally, published in 1949,

322
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."

323
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.

324
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
This is important,

325
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,

326
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.

327
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Now, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.

328
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,

329
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
sub-Saharan Africa.

330
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,

331
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
you're certainly not going to eradicate.

332
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.

333
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,

334
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and if it confirms the prediction, then

335
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
we should have a very powerful tool.

336
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,

337
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
because most of what's being done today is

338
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.

339
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And we know that, although it's great to make those

340
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,

341
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
we know that when you make them highly available

342
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
you're going to get resistance to those drugs.

343
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And so it's a short-term solution.

344
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
This is a long-term solution.

345
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution

346
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
working in the direction we want it to go,

347
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem

348
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,

349
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
for example with anti-malarial drugs.

350
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So, this table I've given just to emphasize

351
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that I've only talked about two examples.

352
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board

353
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
for infectious diseases, and it ought to.

354
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.

355
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We're dealing with living systems;

356
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
we're dealing with systems that evolve.

357
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And so if you do something with those systems,

358
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
they're going to evolve one way or another.

359
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,

360
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
so that -- we need to adjust our interventions

361
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
to get the most bang for the intervention buck,

362
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.

363
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So, I don't really have time to talk about those things,

364
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
but I did want to put them up there,

365
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
just to give you a sense that there really are solutions

366
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
to controlling the evolution of harmfulness

367
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.

368
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.

369
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,

370
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?

371
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.

372
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?

373
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that

374
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.

375
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,

376
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.

377
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And the data really do support this:

378
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.

379
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.

380
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So the other thing I really like about this,

381
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension

382
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
into the study of control of disease,

383
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
is that often the kinds of interventions that you want,

384
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
that it indicates should be done,

385
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.

386
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
But people just haven't been able to justify the cost.

387
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.

388
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,

389
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
then I think that we can say,

390
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
let's push the effort into that aspect of the control,

391
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
so that we can actually solve the problem,

392
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,

393
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough

394
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
just by cleaning up water supply.

395
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.

396
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
(Applause)

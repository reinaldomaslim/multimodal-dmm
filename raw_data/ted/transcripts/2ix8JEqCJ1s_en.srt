1
0:00:12.612,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I spent the past three years

2
0:00:14.247,000 --> 0:00:17,000
talking to some of the worst people on the internet.

3
0:00:18.441,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Now, if you've been online recently,

4
0:00:20.661,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you may have noticed that there's a lot of toxic garbage out there:

5
0:00:24.489,000 --> 0:00:28,000
racist memes, misogynist propaganda, viral misinformation.

6
0:00:29.466,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I wanted to know who was making this stuff.

7
0:00:31.689,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I wanted to understand how they were spreading it.

8
0:00:34.051,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Ultimately, I wanted to know

9
0:00:35.462,000 --> 0:00:37,000
what kind of impact it might be having on our society.

10
0:00:38.055,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So in 2016, I started tracing some of these memes back to their source,

11
0:00:42.09,000 --> 0:00:45,000
back to the people who were making them or who were making them go viral.

12
0:00:45.616,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'd approach those people and say,

13
0:00:47.274,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Hey, I'm a journalist. Can I come watch you do what you do?"

14
0:00:50.204,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, often the response would be,

15
0:00:51.824,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"Why in hell would I want to talk to

16
0:00:53.595,000 --> 0:00:55,000
some low-t soy-boy Brooklyn globalist Jew cuck

17
0:00:55.818,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who's in cahoots with the Democrat Party?"

18
0:00:57.929,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:59.205,000 --> 0:01:02,000
To which my response would be, "Look, man, that's only 57 percent true."

20
0:01:03.064,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:04.633,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But often I got the opposite response.

22
0:01:06.497,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Yeah, sure, come on by."

23
0:01:08.625,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So that's how I ended up in the living room

24
0:01:10.73,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of a social media propagandist in Southern California.

25
0:01:14.386,000 --> 0:01:16,000
He was a married white guy in his late 30s.

26
0:01:16.791,000 --> 0:01:19,000
He had a table in front of him with a mug of coffee,

27
0:01:19.997,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a laptop for tweeting,

28
0:01:21.591,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a phone for texting

29
0:01:23.463,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and an iPad for livestreaming to Periscope and YouTube.

30
0:01:27.258,000 --> 0:01:28,000
That was it.

31
0:01:28.998,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And yet, with those tools,

32
0:01:30.292,000 --> 0:01:33,000
he was able to propel his fringe, noxious talking points

33
0:01:34.031,000 --> 0:01:36,000
into the heart of the American conversation.

34
0:01:37.144,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For example, one of the days I was there,

35
0:01:39.191,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a bomb had just exploded in New York,

36
0:01:42.367,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the guy accused of planting the bomb had a Muslim-sounding name.

37
0:01:45.866,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Now, to the propagandist in California, this seemed like an opportunity,

38
0:01:50.032,000 --> 0:01:51,000
because one of the things he wanted

39
0:01:51.772,000 --> 0:01:53,000
was for the US to cut off almost all immigration,

40
0:01:54.358,000 --> 0:01:56,000
especially from Muslim-majority countries.

41
0:01:57.424,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So he started livestreaming,

42
0:01:59.503,000 --> 0:02:01,000
getting his followers worked up into a frenzy

43
0:02:01.763,000 --> 0:02:03,000
about how the open borders agenda was going to kill us all

44
0:02:04.562,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and asking them to tweet about this,

45
0:02:06.354,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and use specific hashtags,

46
0:02:07.847,000 --> 0:02:08,000
trying to get those hashtags trending.

47
0:02:09.729,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And tweet they did --

48
0:02:10.972,000 --> 0:02:11,000
hundreds and hundreds of tweets,

49
0:02:12.86,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a lot of them featuring images like this one.

50
0:02:15.263,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So that's George Soros.

51
0:02:17.064,000 --> 0:02:19,000
He's a Hungarian billionaire and philanthropist,

52
0:02:19.733,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and in the minds of some conspiracists online,

53
0:02:22.352,000 --> 0:02:24,000
George Soros is like a globalist bogeyman,

54
0:02:24.944,000 --> 0:02:28,000
one of a few elites who is secretly manipulating all of global affairs.

55
0:02:29.078,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, just to pause here: if this idea sounds familiar to you,

56
0:02:32.694,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that there are a few elites who control the world

57
0:02:35.11,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and a lot of them happen to be rich Jews,

58
0:02:37.715,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that's because it is one of the most anti-Semitic tropes in existence.

59
0:02:42.296,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I should also mention that the guy in New York who planted that bomb,

60
0:02:45.718,000 --> 0:02:46,000
he was an American citizen.

61
0:02:47.785,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So whatever else was going on there,

62
0:02:50.013,000 --> 0:02:52,000
immigration was not the main issue.

63
0:02:53.332,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And the propagandist in California, he understood all this.

64
0:02:56.188,000 --> 0:02:58,000
He was a well-read guy. He was actually a lawyer.

65
0:02:58.733,000 --> 0:02:59,000
He knew the underlying facts,

66
0:03:00.444,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but he also knew that facts do not drive conversation online.

67
0:03:03.659,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What drives conversation online

68
0:03:05.39,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is emotion.

69
0:03:07.451,000 --> 0:03:09,000
See, the original premise of social media

70
0:03:09.485,000 --> 0:03:11,000
was that it was going to bring us all together,

71
0:03:11.758,000 --> 0:03:13,000
make the world more open and tolerant and fair ...

72
0:03:14.161,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And it did some of that.

73
0:03:16.503,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But the social media algorithms have never been built

74
0:03:19.25,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to distinguish between what's true or false,

75
0:03:21.612,000 --> 0:03:24,000
what's good or bad for society, what's prosocial and what's antisocial.

76
0:03:25.965,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That's just not what those algorithms do.

77
0:03:28.226,000 --> 0:03:3,000
A lot of what they do is measure engagement:

78
0:03:30.805,000 --> 0:03:33,000
clicks, comments, shares, retweets, that kind of thing.

79
0:03:33.85,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And if you want your content to get engagement,

80
0:03:36.575,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it has to spark emotion,

81
0:03:38.257,000 --> 0:03:41,000
specifically, what behavioral scientists call "high-arousal emotion."

82
0:03:42.343,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, "high arousal" doesn't only mean sexual arousal,

83
0:03:44.857,000 --> 0:03:46,000
although it's the internet, obviously that works.

84
0:03:47.616,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It means anything, positive or negative, that gets people's hearts pumping.

85
0:03:51.649,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So I would sit with these propagandists,

86
0:03:53.642,000 --> 0:03:55,000
not just the guy in California, but dozens of them,

87
0:03:56.075,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I would watch as they did this again and again successfully,

88
0:03:59.847,000 --> 0:04:02,000
not because they were Russian hackers, not because they were tech prodigies,

89
0:04:03.479,000 --> 0:04:05,000
not because they had unique political insights --

90
0:04:05.772,000 --> 0:04:07,000
just because they understood how social media worked,

91
0:04:08.269,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and they were willing to exploit it to their advantage.

92
0:04:10.865,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, at first I was able to tell myself this was a fringe phenomenon,

93
0:04:14.132,000 --> 0:04:16,000
something that was relegated to the internet.

94
0:04:16.385,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But there's really no separation anymore between the internet and everything else.

95
0:04:20.761,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This is an ad that ran on multiple TV stations

96
0:04:22.969,000 --> 0:04:24,000
during the 2018 congressional elections,

97
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:27,000
alleging with very little evidence that one of the candidates

98
0:04:28.504,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was in the pocket of international manipulator George Soros,

99
0:04:31.414,000 --> 0:04:34,000
who is awkwardly photoshopped here next to stacks of cash.

100
0:04:35.296,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This is a tweet from the President of the United States,

101
0:04:37.974,000 --> 0:04:38,000
alleging, again with no evidence,

102
0:04:39.631,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that American politics is being manipulated by George Soros.

103
0:04:43.086,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This stuff that once seemed so shocking and marginal and, frankly, just ignorable,

104
0:04:47.084,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it's now so normalized that we hardly even notice it.

105
0:04:50.053,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So I spent about three years in this world.

106
0:04:52.143,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I talked to a lot of people.

107
0:04:53.837,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Some of them seemed to have no core beliefs at all.

108
0:04:56.327,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They just seemed to be betting, perfectly rationally,

109
0:04:58.934,000 --> 0:05:,000
that if they wanted to make some money online

110
0:05:01.121,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or get some attention online,

111
0:05:02.557,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they should just be as outrageous as possible.

112
0:05:04.794,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But I talked to other people who were true ideologues.

113
0:05:08.173,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And to be clear, their ideology was not traditional conservatism.

114
0:05:12.078,000 --> 0:05:15,000
These were people who wanted to revoke female suffrage.

115
0:05:15.48,000 --> 0:05:17,000
These were people who wanted to go back to racial segregation.

116
0:05:18.471,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Some of them wanted to do away with democracy altogether.

117
0:05:21.304,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now, obviously these people were not born believing these things.

118
0:05:24.44,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They didn't pick them up in elementary school.

119
0:05:26.856,000 --> 0:05:28,000
A lot of them, before they went down some internet rabbit hole,

120
0:05:29.872,000 --> 0:05:31,000
they had been libertarian or they had been socialist

121
0:05:32.364,000 --> 0:05:34,000
or they had been something else entirely.

122
0:05:34.575,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So what was going on?

123
0:05:36.918,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Well, I can't generalize about every case,

124
0:05:39.004,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but a lot of the people I spoke to,

125
0:05:40.715,000 --> 0:05:43,000
they seem to have a combination of a high IQ and a low EQ.

126
0:05:44.619,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They seem to take comfort in anonymous, online spaces

127
0:05:48.154,000 --> 0:05:49,000
rather than connecting in the real world.

128
0:05:50.81,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So often they would retreat to these message boards

129
0:05:53.287,000 --> 0:05:54,000
or these subreddits,

130
0:05:54.483,000 --> 0:05:56,000
where their worst impulses would be magnified.

131
0:05:56.961,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They might start out saying something just as a sick joke,

132
0:06:00.044,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and then they would get so much positive reinforcement for that joke,

133
0:06:03.412,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so many meaningless "internet points," as they called it,

134
0:06:06.257,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that they might start believing their own joke.

135
0:06:10.014,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I talked a lot with one young woman who grew up in New Jersey,

136
0:06:13.562,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and then after high school, she moved to a new place

137
0:06:16.062,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and suddenly she just felt alienated and cut off

138
0:06:18.34,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and started retreating into her phone.

139
0:06:20.85,000 --> 0:06:22,000
She found some of these spaces on the internet

140
0:06:23.046,000 --> 0:06:25,000
where people would post the most shocking, heinous things.

141
0:06:25.936,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And she found this stuff really off-putting

142
0:06:28.229,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but also kind of engrossing,

143
0:06:30.754,000 --> 0:06:32,000
kind of like she couldn't look away from it.

144
0:06:33.304,000 --> 0:06:35,000
She started interacting with people in these online spaces,

145
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and they made her feel smart, they made her feel validated.

146
0:06:38.983,000 --> 0:06:39,000
She started feeling a sense of community,

147
0:06:40.984,000 --> 0:06:42,000
started wondering if maybe some of these shocking memes

148
0:06:43.666,000 --> 0:06:45,000
might actually contain a kernel of truth.

149
0:06:46.151,000 --> 0:06:49,000
A few months later, she was in a car with some of her new internet friends

150
0:06:49.69,000 --> 0:06:5,000
headed to Charlottesville, Virginia,

151
0:06:51.54,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to march with torches in the name of the white race.

152
0:06:55.033,000 --> 0:06:57,000
She'd gone, in a few months, from Obama supporter

153
0:06:57.338,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to fully radicalized white supremacist.

154
0:07:01.03,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, in her particular case,

155
0:07:03.335,000 --> 0:07:07,000
she actually was able to find her way out of the cult of white supremacy.

156
0:07:08.418,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But a lot of the people I spoke to were not.

157
0:07:10.502,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And just to be clear:

158
0:07:12.248,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I was never so convinced that I had to find common ground

159
0:07:15.238,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with every single person I spoke to

160
0:07:17.325,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that I was willing to say,

161
0:07:18.603,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"You know what, man, you're a fascist propagandist, I'm not,

162
0:07:21.768,000 --> 0:07:24,000
whatever, let's just hug it out, all our differences will melt away."

163
0:07:25.208,000 --> 0:07:26,000
No, absolutely not.

164
0:07:28.056,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But I did become convinced that we cannot just look away from this stuff.

165
0:07:31.601,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We have to try to understand it, because only by understanding it

166
0:07:34.841,000 --> 0:07:37,000
can we even start to inoculate ourselves against it.

167
0:07:39.361,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In my three years in this world, I got a few nasty phone calls,

168
0:07:42.734,000 --> 0:07:43,000
even some threats,

169
0:07:44.278,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but it wasn't a fraction of what female journalists get on this beat.

170
0:07:48.791,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And yeah, I am Jewish,

171
0:07:50.206,000 --> 0:07:53,000
although, weirdly, a lot of the Nazis couldn't tell I was Jewish,

172
0:07:53.879,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which I frankly just found kind of disappointing.

173
0:07:56.764,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:58.588,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Seriously, like, your whole job is being a professional anti-Semite.

175
0:08:03.228,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Nothing about me is tipping you off at all?

176
0:08:05.674,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Nothing?

177
0:08:06.774,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

178
0:08:09.983,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This is not a secret.

179
0:08:11.202,000 --> 0:08:13,000
My name is Andrew Marantz, I write for "The New Yorker,"

180
0:08:13.909,000 --> 0:08:15,000
my personality type is like if a Seinfeld episode

181
0:08:16.454,000 --> 0:08:17,000
was taped at the Park Slope Food Coop.

182
0:08:18.315,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Nothing?

183
0:08:19.501,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:24.804,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Anyway, look -- ultimately, it would be nice

185
0:08:27.059,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if there were, like, a simple formula:

186
0:08:29.431,000 --> 0:08:32,000
smartphone plus alienated kid equals 12 percent chance of Nazi.

187
0:08:33.918,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's obviously not that simple.

188
0:08:36.19,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And in my writing,

189
0:08:37.377,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I'm much more comfortable being descriptive, not prescriptive.

190
0:08:41.049,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But this is TED,

191
0:08:43.714,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so let's get practical.

192
0:08:45.725,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I want to share a few suggestions

193
0:08:47.375,000 --> 0:08:5,000
of things that citizens of the internet like you and I

194
0:08:50.525,000 --> 0:08:53,000
might be able to do to make things a little bit less toxic.

195
0:08:54.799,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So the first one is to be a smart skeptic.

196
0:08:57.964,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So, I think there are two kinds of skepticism.

197
0:09:00.185,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And I don't want to drown you in technical epistemological information here,

198
0:09:04.437,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but I call them smart and dumb skepticism.

199
0:09:08.176,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So, smart skepticism:

200
0:09:10.707,000 --> 0:09:11,000
thinking for yourself,

201
0:09:11.935,000 --> 0:09:12,000
questioning every claim,

202
0:09:13.151,000 --> 0:09:14,000
demanding evidence --

203
0:09:14.617,000 --> 0:09:15,000
great, that's real skepticism.

204
0:09:17.397,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Dumb skepticism: it sounds like skepticism,

205
0:09:20.051,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but it's actually closer to knee-jerk contrarianism.

206
0:09:23.817,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Everyone says the earth is round,

207
0:09:25.414,000 --> 0:09:26,000
you say it's flat.

208
0:09:26.794,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Everyone says racism is bad,

209
0:09:28.385,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you say, "I dunno, I'm skeptical about that."

210
0:09:31.682,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I cannot tell you how many young white men I have spoken to in the last few years

211
0:09:35.825,000 --> 0:09:36,000
who have said,

212
0:09:37.005,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"You know, the media, my teachers, they're all trying to indoctrinate me

213
0:09:40.429,000 --> 0:09:42,000
into believing in male privilege and white privilege,

214
0:09:42.976,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but I don't know about that, man, I don't think so."

215
0:09:45.452,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Guys -- contrarian white teens of the world --

216
0:09:48.613,000 --> 0:09:5,000
look:

217
0:09:50.755,000 --> 0:09:53,000
if you are being a round earth skeptic and a male privilege skeptic

218
0:09:54.492,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and a racism is bad skeptic,

219
0:09:56.826,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you're not being a skeptic, you're being a jerk.

220
0:09:59.175,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Applause)

221
0:10:04.394,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's great to be independent-minded, we all should be independent-minded,

222
0:10:07.878,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but just be smart about it.

223
0:10:09.906,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So this next one is about free speech.

224
0:10:11.793,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You will hear smart, accomplished people who will say, "Well, I'm pro-free speech,"

225
0:10:15.781,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and they say it in this way that it's like they're settling a debate,

226
0:10:19.078,000 --> 0:10:22,000
when actually, that is the very beginning of any meaningful conversation.

227
0:10:23.554,000 --> 0:10:25,000
All the interesting stuff happens after that point.

228
0:10:26.051,000 --> 0:10:28,000
OK, you're pro-free speech. What does that mean?

229
0:10:28.379,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Does it mean that David Duke and Richard Spencer

230
0:10:30.69,000 --> 0:10:31,000
need to have active Twitter accounts?

231
0:10:32.888,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Does it mean that anyone can harass anyone else online

232
0:10:35.555,000 --> 0:10:36,000
for any reason?

233
0:10:37.031,000 --> 0:10:4,000
You know, I looked through the entire list of TED speakers this year.

234
0:10:40.343,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I didn't find a single round earth skeptic.

235
0:10:42.403,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Is that a violation of free speech norms?

236
0:10:45.086,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Look, we're all pro-free speech, it's wonderful to be pro-free speech,

237
0:10:48.652,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but if that's all you know how to say again and again,

238
0:10:51.297,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you're standing in the way of a more productive conversation.

239
0:10:56.105,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Making decency cool again, so ...

240
0:10:59.264,000 --> 0:11:,000
Great!

241
0:11:00.486,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Applause)

242
0:11:02.051,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Yeah. I don't even need to explain it.

243
0:11:04.181,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So in my research, I would go to Reddit or YouTube or Facebook,

244
0:11:08.051,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and I would search for "sharia law"

245
0:11:10.375,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or I would search for "the Holocaust,"

246
0:11:12.515,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and you might be able to guess what the algorithms showed me, right?

247
0:11:16.386,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"Is sharia law sweeping across the United States?"

248
0:11:19.34,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"Did the Holocaust really happen?"

249
0:11:22.291,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Dumb skepticism.

250
0:11:24.835,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So we've ended up in this bizarre dynamic online,

251
0:11:27.24,000 --> 0:11:29,000
where some people see bigoted propaganda

252
0:11:29.356,000 --> 0:11:31,000
as being edgy or being dangerous and cool,

253
0:11:32.046,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and people see basic truth and human decency as pearl-clutching

254
0:11:35.397,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or virtue-signaling or just boring.

255
0:11:38.329,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And the social media algorithms, whether intentionally or not,

256
0:11:41.642,000 --> 0:11:43,000
they have incentivized this,

257
0:11:43.689,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because bigoted propaganda is great for engagement.

258
0:11:46.641,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Everyone clicks on it, everyone comments on it,

259
0:11:48.931,000 --> 0:11:49,000
whether they love it or they hate it.

260
0:11:51.463,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So the number one thing that has to happen here

261
0:11:53.775,000 --> 0:11:55,000
is social networks need to fix their platforms.

262
0:11:57.069,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

263
0:12:01.6,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So if you're listening to my voice and you work at a social media company

264
0:12:05.054,000 --> 0:12:07,000
or you invest in one or, I don't know, own one,

265
0:12:08.598,000 --> 0:12:09,000
this tip is for you.

266
0:12:10.083,000 --> 0:12:13,000
If you have been optimizing for maximum emotional engagement

267
0:12:14.028,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and maximum emotional engagement turns out to be actively harming the world,

268
0:12:18.165,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it's time to optimize for something else.

269
0:12:20.725,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Applause)

270
0:12:26.939,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But in addition to putting pressure on them to do that

271
0:12:30.476,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and waiting for them and hoping that they'll do that,

272
0:12:33.134,000 --> 0:12:35,000
there's some stuff that the rest of us can do, too.

273
0:12:35.66,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So, we can create some better pathways or suggest some better pathways

274
0:12:40.181,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for angsty teens to go down.

275
0:12:42.196,000 --> 0:12:45,000
If you see something that you think is really creative and thoughtful

276
0:12:45.499,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and you want to share that thing, you can share that thing,

277
0:12:48.322,000 --> 0:12:5,000
even if it's not flooding you with high arousal emotion.

278
0:12:51.002,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Now that is a very small step, I realize,

279
0:12:53.046,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but in the aggregate, this stuff does matter,

280
0:12:55.254,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because these algorithms, as powerful as they are,

281
0:12:57.684,000 --> 0:12:59,000
they are taking their behavioral cues from us.

282
0:13:01.556,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So let me leave you with this.

283
0:13:03.701,000 --> 0:13:05,000
You know, a few years ago it was really fashionable

284
0:13:06.214,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to say that the internet was a revolutionary tool

285
0:13:08.551,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that was going to bring us all together.

286
0:13:11.074,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's now more fashionable to say

287
0:13:12.687,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that the internet is a huge, irredeemable dumpster fire.

288
0:13:16.787,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Neither caricature is really true.

289
0:13:18.643,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We know the internet is just too vast and complex

290
0:13:21.04,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to be all good or all bad.

291
0:13:22.563,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And the danger with these ways of thinking,

292
0:13:24.674,000 --> 0:13:27,000
whether it's the utopian view that the internet will inevitably save us

293
0:13:28.161,000 --> 0:13:31,000
or the dystopian view that it will inevitably destroy us,

294
0:13:31.633,000 --> 0:13:33,000
either way, we're letting ourselves off the hook.

295
0:13:35.564,000 --> 0:13:37,000
There is nothing inevitable about our future.

296
0:13:38.878,000 --> 0:13:4,000
The internet is made of people.

297
0:13:40.903,000 --> 0:13:42,000
People make decisions at social media companies.

298
0:13:43.911,000 --> 0:13:45,000
People make hashtags trend or not trend.

299
0:13:46.586,000 --> 0:13:49,000
People make societies progress or regress.

300
0:13:51.12,000 --> 0:13:52,000
When we internalize that fact,

301
0:13:52.679,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we can stop waiting for some inevitable future to arrive

302
0:13:55.751,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and actually get to work now.

303
0:13:58.842,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You know, we've all been taught that the arc of the moral universe is long

304
0:14:02.385,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but that it bends toward justice.

305
0:14:06.489,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Maybe.

306
0:14:08.814,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Maybe it will.

307
0:14:10.776,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But that has always been an aspiration.

308
0:14:13.277,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It is not a guarantee.

309
0:14:15.856,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The arc doesn't bend itself.

310
0:14:18.045,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It's not bent inevitably by some mysterious force.

311
0:14:21.744,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The real truth,

312
0:14:23.44,000 --> 0:14:25,000
which is scarier and also more liberating,

313
0:14:26.847,000 --> 0:14:27,000
is that we bend it.

314
0:14:28.943,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Thank you.

315
0:14:30.176,000 --> 0:14:32,000

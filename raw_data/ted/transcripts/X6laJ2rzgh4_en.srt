1
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,

2
0:00:25.466,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism.

3
0:00:30.092,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way

4
0:00:34.297,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

5
0:00:37.443,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing

6
0:00:41.066,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and photographers were telling us another.

7
0:00:43.779,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans.

8
0:00:48.323,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.

9
0:00:52.484,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They not only recorded history -- they helped change the course of history.

10
0:00:57.128,000 --> 0:01:,000
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness

11
0:01:00.746,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,

12
0:01:04.639,000 --> 0:01:07,000
change became not only possible, but inevitable.

13
0:01:07.927,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It puts a human face on issues which, from afar,

14
0:01:11.678,000 --> 0:01:16,000
can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.

15
0:01:17.085,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,

16
0:01:21.73,000 --> 0:01:24,000
happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

17
0:01:25.152,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I understood that documentary photography

18
0:01:27.475,000 --> 0:01:31,000
has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

19
0:01:31.965,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.

20
0:01:36.013,000 --> 0:01:41,000
My TED wish. There’s a vital story that needs to be told

21
0:01:41.498,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it

22
0:01:45.105,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways

23
0:01:48.689,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to use news photography in the digital era.

24
0:01:51.938,000 --> 0:01:53,000

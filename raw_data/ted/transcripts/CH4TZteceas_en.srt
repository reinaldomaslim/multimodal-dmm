1
0:00:16.133,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A couple of years ago,

2
0:00:17.315,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when I was attending the TED conference in Long Beach,

3
0:00:20.448,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I met Harriet.

4
0:00:21.837,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We'd actually met online before -- not the way you're thinking.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We were introduced because we both knew Linda Avey,

6
0:00:27.719,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies.

7
0:00:31.047,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And because we shared our genetic information with Linda,

8
0:00:33.768,000 --> 0:00:34,000
she could see that Harriet and I shared

9
0:00:35.699,000 --> 0:00:38,000
a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA, haplotype K1a1b1a,

10
0:00:39.613,000 --> 0:00:4,000
which meant we were distantly related.

11
0:00:41.632,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We actually share the same genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.

12
0:00:44.489,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So -- Ötzi, Harriet and me.

13
0:00:46.024,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And being the current day, of course, we started our own Facebook group.

14
0:00:49.449,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You're all welcome to join.

15
0:00:50.772,000 --> 0:00:53,000
When I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED conference,

16
0:00:53.876,000 --> 0:00:55,000
she'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype T-shirts.

17
0:00:56.888,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:57.923,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Why am I telling you this story?

19
0:00:59.49,000 --> 0:01:01,000
What does it have to do with the future of health?

20
0:01:01.856,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Well, the way I met Harriet is an example

21
0:01:03.856,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of how leveraging cross-disciplinary, exponentially growing technologies

22
0:01:07.631,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is affecting our future of health and wellness --

23
0:01:09.966,000 --> 0:01:1,000
from low-cost gene analysis

24
0:01:11.34,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to the ability to do powerful bioinformatics

25
0:01:13.482,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to the connection of the Internet and social networking.

26
0:01:16.849,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What I'd like to talk about today

27
0:01:18.473,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is understanding these exponential technologies.

28
0:01:20.757,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We often think linearly.

29
0:01:22.338,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But if you think about it, if you have a lily pad

30
0:01:24.95,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and it just divided every single day --

31
0:01:26.937,000 --> 0:01:29,000
two, four, eight, sixteen -- in 15 days, you'd have 32,000.

32
0:01:30.617,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What do you think you'd have in a month?

33
0:01:32.576,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We're at a billion.

34
0:01:33.751,000 --> 0:01:34,000
If we start to think exponentially,

35
0:01:35.447,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us.

36
0:01:38.923,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Many of these technologies, speaking as a physician and innovator,

37
0:01:42.05,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we can start to leverage, to impact the future of our own health

38
0:01:45.166,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and of health care,

39
0:01:46.341,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and to address many of the major challenges in health care today,

40
0:01:49.45,000 --> 0:01:52,000
ranging from the exponential costs to the aging population,

41
0:01:52.639,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the way we really don't use information very well today,

42
0:01:55.363,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the fragmentation of care

43
0:01:56.877,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and the often very difficult course of adoption of innovation.

44
0:02:00.631,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And one of the major things we can do is move the curve to the left.

45
0:02:04.45,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life.

46
0:02:07.191,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What if we could incentivize physicians in the health care system

47
0:02:10.275,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and our own selves

48
0:02:11.455,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to move the curve to the left and improve our health,

49
0:02:13.994,000 --> 0:02:14,000
leveraging technology as well?

50
0:02:15.462,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now my favorite example of exponential technology,

51
0:02:17.91,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we all have in our pocket.

52
0:02:19.234,000 --> 0:02:22,000
If you think about it, these are really dramatically improving.

53
0:02:22.529,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I mean, this is the iPhone 4.

54
0:02:24.459,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do.

55
0:02:27.671,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, I've gained some insight into this.

56
0:02:29.613,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I've been the track share for the medicine portion

57
0:02:32.212,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of a new institution called Singularity University,

58
0:02:34.743,000 --> 0:02:35,000
based in Silicon Valley.

59
0:02:36.156,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We bring together each summer about 100 very talented students

60
0:02:39.14,000 --> 0:02:4,000
from around the world.

61
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine,

62
0:02:43.22,000 --> 0:02:46,000
biotech, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, space,

63
0:02:46.39,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and address how we can cross-train and leverage these

64
0:02:48.893,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to impact major unmet goals.

65
0:02:50.257,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We also have seven-day executive programs.

66
0:02:52.288,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And coming up next month is FutureMed,

67
0:02:54.695,000 --> 0:02:57,000
a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine.

68
0:02:58.093,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now, I mentioned the phone.

69
0:02:59.638,000 --> 0:03:02,000
These mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available.

70
0:03:02.973,000 --> 0:03:05,000
There's one out of the UK where you can pee on a little chip,

71
0:03:06.239,000 --> 0:03:07,000
connect it to your iPhone,

72
0:03:07.544,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and check for an STD.

73
0:03:08.723,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I don't know if I'd try that, but it's available.

74
0:03:11.05,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There are other sorts of applications.

75
0:03:12.899,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Merging your phone and diagnostics, for example,

76
0:03:15.199,000 --> 0:03:17,000
measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone

77
0:03:17.264,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and sending that to your physician,

78
0:03:18.995,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so they can better understand and you can better understand

79
0:03:21.786,000 --> 0:03:22,000
your blood sugars as a diabetic.

80
0:03:23.39,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So let's see how exponential technologies are taking health care.

81
0:03:26.535,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Let's start with faster.

82
0:03:27.725,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It's no secret that computers, through Moore's law,

83
0:03:30.158,000 --> 0:03:31,000
are speeding up faster and faster.

84
0:03:31.825,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We can do more powerful things with them.

85
0:03:33.91,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They're really approaching -- in many cases, surpassing --

86
0:03:36.735,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the ability of the human mind.

87
0:03:38.205,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in imaging.

88
0:03:42.063,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The ability now to look inside the body in real time

89
0:03:44.719,000 --> 0:03:45,000
with very high resolution

90
0:03:46.201,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is really becoming incredible.

91
0:03:47.685,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And we're layering multiple technologies -- PET scans, CT scans

92
0:03:50.745,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and molecular diagnostics --

93
0:03:52.791,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to find and seek things at different levels.

94
0:03:55.616,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today,

95
0:03:59.091,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.

96
0:04:01.934,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And now we can see inside of the brain

97
0:04:04.101,000 --> 0:04:06,000
at a resolution and ability never before available,

98
0:04:06.717,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even reengineer

99
0:04:10.807,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or backwards engineer the brain,

100
0:04:12.515,000 --> 0:04:14,000
so we can better understand pathology, disease and therapy.

101
0:04:15.516,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We can look inside with real-time fMRI in the brain at real time.

102
0:04:18.832,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And by understanding these sorts of processes and these connections,

103
0:04:22.145,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation

104
0:04:25.232,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and better personalize and make effective, for example,

105
0:04:27.863,000 --> 0:04:28,000
psychoactive drugs.

106
0:04:29.49,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The scanners for these are getting smaller, less expensive

107
0:04:32.282,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and more portable.

108
0:04:33.457,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And this sort of data explosion available from these

109
0:04:35.952,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is really almost becoming a challenge.

110
0:04:37.91,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The scan of today takes up about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.

111
0:04:40.911,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.

112
0:04:44.206,000 --> 0:04:45,000
How do you leverage that information?

113
0:04:45.999,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Let's get personal.

114
0:04:47.174,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy, but if you're over age 50,

115
0:04:50.405,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it's time for your screening colonoscopy.

116
0:04:52.422,000 --> 0:04:54,000
How'd you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick?

117
0:04:54.877,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now there's essentially virtual colonoscopy.

118
0:04:56.952,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Compare those two pictures.

119
0:04:58.267,000 --> 0:05:01,000
As a radiologist, you can basically fly through your patient's colon,

120
0:05:01.558,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and augmenting that with artificial intelligence,

121
0:05:03.877,000 --> 0:05:05,000
potentially identify a lesion that we might have missed,

122
0:05:06.53,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but using AI on top of radiology,

123
0:05:08.13,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we can find lesions that were missed before.

124
0:05:10.205,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies

125
0:05:12.756,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that wouldn't have otherwise.

126
0:05:14.163,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This is an example of this paradigm shift.

127
0:05:16.199,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology,

128
0:05:19.624,000 --> 0:05:22,000
wireless and, I would say, mobile now -- this era of digital medicine.

129
0:05:22.954,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Even my stethoscope is now digital, and of course, there's an app for that.

130
0:05:26.522,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We're moving, obviously, to the era of the tricorder.

131
0:05:29.081,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing

132
0:05:31.554,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and supplanting the stethoscope.

133
0:05:33.576,000 --> 0:05:35,000
These are now at a price point of what used to be 100,000 euros

134
0:05:36.562,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or a couple hundred-thousand dollars.

135
0:05:38.425,000 --> 0:05:39,000
For about 5,000 dollars,

136
0:05:39.602,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand.

137
0:05:42.952,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records --

138
0:05:46.068,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in the US, we're still less than 20 percent electronic;

139
0:05:48.673,000 --> 0:05:5,000
here in the Netherlands, I think it's more than 80 percent.

140
0:05:51.493,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Now that we're switching to merging medical data,

141
0:05:53.805,000 --> 0:05:54,000
making it available electronically,

142
0:05:55.504,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we can crowd-source the information, and as a physician,

143
0:05:58.176,000 --> 0:06:,000
I can access my patients' data from wherever I am,

144
0:06:00.536,000 --> 0:06:01,000
just through my mobile device.

145
0:06:01.99,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And now, of course, we're in the era of the iPad, even the iPad 2.

146
0:06:05.127,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Just last month,

147
0:06:06.302,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the first FDA-approved application was approved

148
0:06:08.541,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices.

149
0:06:12.058,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So certainly, the physicians of today, including myself,

150
0:06:14.703,000 --> 0:06:15,000
are completely reliable on these devices.

151
0:06:16.704,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And as you saw just about a month ago,

152
0:06:18.547,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Watson from IBM beat the two champions in "Jeopardy."

153
0:06:21.064,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So I want you to imagine when, in a couple of years,

154
0:06:23.526,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we've started to apply this cloud-based information,

155
0:06:26.01,000 --> 0:06:29,000
when we really have the AI physician and leverage our brains to connectivity

156
0:06:29.634,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done.

157
0:06:32.608,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Already today, you don't need to go to your physician in many cases.

158
0:06:35.831,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Only in about 20 percent of visits do you need to lay hands on the patient.

159
0:06:39.397,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We're now in the era of virtual visits.

160
0:06:41.282,000 --> 0:06:43,000
From Skype-type visits you can do with American Well,

161
0:06:43.799,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to Cisco, that's developed a very complex health presence system,

162
0:06:46.88,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the ability to interact with your health care provider is different.

163
0:06:50.111,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And these are being augmented even by our devices, again, today.

164
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
My friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration,

165
0:06:55.953,000 --> 0:06:57,000
so I can save her a trip to the emergency room,

166
0:06:58.185,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and do diagnostics that way.

167
0:06:59.638,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Or maybe we can leverage today's gaming technology,

168
0:07:02.056,000 --> 0:07:03,000
like the Microsoft Kinect,

169
0:07:03.326,000 --> 0:07:06,000
hack that to enable diagnostics, for example, in diagnosing stroke,

170
0:07:06.527,000 --> 0:07:08,000
using simple motion detection, using $100 devices.

171
0:07:09.14,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We can actually now visit our patients robotically.

172
0:07:12.349,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is the RP7;

173
0:07:13.524,000 --> 0:07:15,000
if I'm a hematologist, I can visit another clinic or hospital.

174
0:07:16.506,000 --> 0:07:18,000
These are being augmented by a whole suite of tools

175
0:07:18.925,000 --> 0:07:19,000
actually in the home now.

176
0:07:20.145,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We already have wireless scales.

177
0:07:22.023,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You step on the scale, tweet your weight to your friends,

178
0:07:24.752,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they can keep you in line.

179
0:07:26.018,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We have wireless blood pressure cuffs.

180
0:07:27.86,000 --> 0:07:29,000
A whole gamut of technologies are being put together.

181
0:07:30.391,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Instead of wearing kludgy devices, we put on a simple patch.

182
0:07:33.229,000 --> 0:07:34,000
This was developed at Stanford.

183
0:07:34.746,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's called iRhythm; it completely supplants the prior technology

184
0:07:37.849,000 --> 0:07:39,000
at a much lower price point, with much more effectivity.

185
0:07:40.525,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We're also in the era today of quantified self.

186
0:07:43.024,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Consumers now can basically buy $100 devices, like this little Fitbit.

187
0:07:46.653,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I can measure my steps, my caloric outtake.

188
0:07:48.698,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I can get insight into that on a daily basis

189
0:07:50.775,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and share it with my friends or physician.

190
0:07:52.807,000 --> 0:07:55,000
There's watches that measure your heart rate, Zeo sleep monitors,

191
0:07:55.91,000 --> 0:07:57,000
a suite of tools that enable you to leverage

192
0:07:58.017,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and have insight into your own health.

193
0:07:59.855,000 --> 0:08:01,000
As we start to integrate this information,

194
0:08:01.887,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we'll know better what to do with it, and have better insight

195
0:08:04.792,000 --> 0:08:06,000
into our own pathologies, health and wellness.

196
0:08:07.243,000 --> 0:08:09,000
There's even mirrors that can pick up your pulse rate.

197
0:08:09.91,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And I would argue, in the future,

198
0:08:11.693,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring us 24/7.

199
0:08:14.879,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And just like the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on.

200
0:08:18.32,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It won't say "check engine"; it'll be a "check your body" light,

201
0:08:21.389,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and you'll go get it taken care of.

202
0:08:23.097,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Probably in a few years,

203
0:08:24.294,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you'll look in your mirror and it'll be diagnosing you.

204
0:08:27.124,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:28.37,000 --> 0:08:3,000
For those of you with kiddos at home,

206
0:08:30.473,000 --> 0:08:32,000
how would you like a wireless diaper that supports your --

207
0:08:33.442,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

208
0:08:34.526,000 --> 0:08:36,000
More information, I think, than you might need,

209
0:08:36.747,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but it's going to be here.

210
0:08:38.208,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, we've heard a lot today about technology and connection.

211
0:08:41.332,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And I think some of these technologies

212
0:08:43.168,000 --> 0:08:46,000
will enable us to be more connected with our patients, to take more time

213
0:08:46.61,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and do the important human-touch elements of medicine,

214
0:08:49.215,000 --> 0:08:5,000
as augmented by these technologies.

215
0:08:50.917,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, we've talked about augmenting the patient.

216
0:08:53.31,000 --> 0:08:54,000
How about augmenting the physician?

217
0:08:55.01,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon,

218
0:08:57.424,000 --> 0:09:,000
who can now go into the body and do robotic surgery, which is here today,

219
0:09:00.91,000 --> 0:09:03,000
at a level that was not really possible even five years ago.

220
0:09:04.397,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And now this is being augmented with further layers of technology,

221
0:09:07.541,000 --> 0:09:08,000
like augmented reality.

222
0:09:08.72,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So the surgeon can see inside the patient, through their lens,

223
0:09:11.675,000 --> 0:09:13,000
where the tumor is, where the blood vessels are.

224
0:09:14.01,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This can be integrated with decision support.

225
0:09:16.139,000 --> 0:09:19,000
A surgeon in New York can help a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.

226
0:09:19.324,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And we're entering an era of truly scarless surgery called NOTES,

227
0:09:22.724,000 --> 0:09:24,000
where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach

228
0:09:25.339,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and pull out that gallbladder,

229
0:09:26.811,000 --> 0:09:28,000
all in a scarless way and robotically.

230
0:09:29.186,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is called NOTES, and it's coming -- basically scarless surgery,

231
0:09:32.526,000 --> 0:09:34,000
as mediated by robotic surgery.

232
0:09:34.608,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now, how about controlling other elements?

233
0:09:36.728,000 --> 0:09:38,000
For those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic,

234
0:09:39.182,000 --> 0:09:41,000
there's the brain-computer interface, or BCI,

235
0:09:41.993,000 --> 0:09:43,000
where chips have been put on the motor cortex

236
0:09:44.206,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of completely quadriplegic patients,

237
0:09:46.05,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair

238
0:09:48.734,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or, potentially, a robotic arm.

239
0:09:50.291,000 --> 0:09:51,000
These devices are getting smaller

240
0:09:51.911,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and going into more and more of these patients.

241
0:09:54.162,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Still in clinical trials,

242
0:09:55.398,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but imagine when we can connect these, for example,

243
0:09:57.823,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to the amazing bionic limb,

244
0:09:59.463,000 --> 0:10:01,000
such as the DEKA Arm, built by Dean Kamen and colleagues,

245
0:10:02.309,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom,

246
0:10:04.353,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and can allow the person who's lost a limb

247
0:10:06.405,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to have much higher dexterity or control than they've had in the past.

248
0:10:09.764,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So we're really entering the era of wearable robotics, actually.

249
0:10:12.832,000 --> 0:10:14,000
If you haven't lost a limb but had a stroke,

250
0:10:15.07,000 --> 0:10:16,000
you can wear these augmented limbs.

251
0:10:16.781,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Or if you're a paraplegic -- I've visited the folks at Berkeley Bionics --

252
0:10:20.301,000 --> 0:10:21,000
they've developed eLEGS.

253
0:10:21.494,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I took this video last week.

254
0:10:22.884,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Here's a paraplegic patient, walking by strapping on these exoskeletons.

255
0:10:26.693,000 --> 0:10:28,000
He's otherwise completely wheelchair-bound.

256
0:10:28.728,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is the early era of wearable robotics.

257
0:10:30.768,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And by leveraging these sorts of technologies,

258
0:10:33.071,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we're going to change the definition of disability

259
0:10:35.432,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to, in some cases, be superability, or super-enabling.

260
0:10:37.986,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is Aimee Mullins, who lost her lower limbs as a young child,

261
0:10:41.2,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT,

262
0:10:43.537,000 --> 0:10:45,000
who lost his limbs in a climbing accident.

263
0:10:45.562,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And now both of them can climb better, move faster, swim differently

264
0:10:48.981,000 --> 0:10:51,000
with their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons.

265
0:10:52.492,000 --> 0:10:53,000
How about other exponentials?

266
0:10:53.956,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction,

267
0:10:57.39,000 --> 0:10:58,000
including with huge costs.

268
0:10:58.849,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But the trend in medicine is to get exponentially smaller.

269
0:11:01.996,000 --> 0:11:04,000
A few examples: we're now in the era of "Fantastic Voyage," the iPill.

270
0:11:05.595,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You can swallow this completely integrated device.

271
0:11:08.02,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It can take pictures of your GI system,

272
0:11:09.91,000 --> 0:11:11,000
help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract.

273
0:11:12.69,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We get into even smaller micro-robots

274
0:11:14.533,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that will eventually, autonomously, move through your system,

275
0:11:17.454,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and be able to do things surgeons can't do

276
0:11:19.535,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in a much less invasive manner.

277
0:11:21.095,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Sometimes these might self-assemble in your GI system,

278
0:11:23.708,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and be augmented in that reality.

279
0:11:25.456,000 --> 0:11:27,000
On the cardiac side, pacemakers are getting smaller

280
0:11:27.972,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and much easier to place,

281
0:11:29.333,000 --> 0:11:32,000
so no need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them.

282
0:11:32.44,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And they'll be wirelessly telemetered to your mobile devices,

283
0:11:35.4,000 --> 0:11:37,000
so you can go places and be monitored remotely.

284
0:11:37.91,000 --> 0:11:38,000
These are shrinking even further.

285
0:11:39.532,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This one is in prototyping by Medtronic; it's smaller than a penny.

286
0:11:42.812,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Artificial retinas, the ability to put arrays on the back of the eyeball

287
0:11:46.261,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and allow the blind to see --

288
0:11:47.709,000 --> 0:11:49,000
also in early trials, but moving into the future.

289
0:11:50.044,000 --> 0:11:51,000
These are going to be game-changing.

290
0:11:51.799,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Or for those of us who are sighted,

291
0:11:53.511,000 --> 0:11:55,000
how about having the assisted-living contact lens?

292
0:11:55.897,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi available -- beams back images to your eye.

293
0:11:58.743,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Laughter)

294
0:11:59.79,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Now, if you have trouble maintaining your diet,

295
0:12:02.017,000 --> 0:12:03,000
it might help to have some extra imagery

296
0:12:03.997,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you.

297
0:12:07.655,000 --> 0:12:09,000
How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone

298
0:12:10.43,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to see at a microscopic level

299
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics?

300
0:12:15.338,000 --> 0:12:17,000
In fact, the whole era of laboratory medicine

301
0:12:17.648,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is completely changing.

302
0:12:18.824,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We can now leverage microfluidics,

303
0:12:20.801,000 --> 0:12:22,000
like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford.

304
0:12:23.042,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians;

305
0:12:25.702,000 --> 0:12:28,000
put it on a chip, enable thousands of tests at the point of care,

306
0:12:28.865,000 --> 0:12:29,000
anywhere in the world.

307
0:12:30.041,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This will really leverage technology to the rural and the underserved

308
0:12:33.469,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done for pennies,

309
0:12:37.008,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and at the point of care.

310
0:12:38.384,000 --> 0:12:4,000
If we go down the small pathway a little bit further,

311
0:12:40.909,000 --> 0:12:41,000
we're entering the era of nanomedicine,

312
0:12:42.832,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the ability to make devices super-small,

313
0:12:44.778,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to the point where we can design red blood cells

314
0:12:47.122,000 --> 0:12:5,000
or microrobots that monitor our blood system or immune system,

315
0:12:50.221,000 --> 0:12:53,000
or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries.

316
0:12:53.333,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Now how about exponentially cheaper?

317
0:12:55.097,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine,

318
0:12:57.954,000 --> 0:13:,000
but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper.

319
0:13:01.882,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In genomics now, the genome cost about a billion dollars

320
0:13:04.568,000 --> 0:13:06,000
about 10 years ago, when the first one came out.

321
0:13:06.851,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We're now approaching essentially a $1,000 genome, probably next year.

322
0:13:10.239,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And in two years, a $100 genome.

323
0:13:11.796,000 --> 0:13:12,000
What will we do with $100 genomes?

324
0:13:13.544,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Soon we'll have millions of these tests available.

325
0:13:15.922,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Then it gets interesting, when we start to crowd-source that information,

326
0:13:19.437,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and enter the era of true personalized medicine:

327
0:13:21.707,000 --> 0:13:23,000
the right drug for the right person at the right time,

328
0:13:24.263,000 --> 0:13:27,000
instead of what we're doing now, which is the same drug for everybody,

329
0:13:27.58,000 --> 0:13:3,000
blockbuster drug medications, which don't work for the individual.

330
0:13:30.71,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches.

331
0:13:33.953,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I'll show you a simple example, from 23andMe again.

332
0:13:36.382,000 --> 0:13:38,000
My data indicates I've got about average risk

333
0:13:38.516,000 --> 0:13:4,000
for developing macular degeneration, a kind of blindness.

334
0:13:41.231,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But if I take that same data, upload it to deCODEme,

335
0:13:43.881,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I can look at my risk for type 2 diabetes; I'm at almost twice the risk.

336
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I might want to watch how much dessert I have at lunch, for example.

337
0:13:51.401,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It might change my behavior.

338
0:13:52.776,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics:

339
0:13:55.042,000 --> 0:13:58,000
how my genes modulate, what my drugs do and what doses I need

340
0:13:58.401,000 --> 0:13:59,000
will become increasingly important,

341
0:14:00.116,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and once in the hands of individuals and patients,

342
0:14:02.491,000 --> 0:14:04,000
will make better drug dosing and selection available.

343
0:14:05.037,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So again, it's not just genes, it's multiple details --

344
0:14:07.903,000 --> 0:14:09,000
our habits, our environmental exposures.

345
0:14:10.046,000 --> 0:14:12,000
When was the last time your doctor asked where you've lived?

346
0:14:12.881,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Geomedicine: where you live, what you've been exposed to,

347
0:14:15.616,000 --> 0:14:16,000
can dramatically affect your health.

348
0:14:17.357,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We can capture that information.

349
0:14:18.912,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Genomics, proteomics, the environment --

350
0:14:20.845,000 --> 0:14:22,000
all this data streaming at us individually and as physicians:

351
0:14:23.734,000 --> 0:14:24,000
How do we manage it?

352
0:14:24.91,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We're now entering the era of systems medicine, systems biology,

353
0:14:27.996,000 --> 0:14:29,000
where we can start to integrate all this information.

354
0:14:30.521,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And by looking at the patterns, for example, in our blood,

355
0:14:33.353,000 --> 0:14:34,000
of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test,

356
0:14:35.19,000 --> 0:14:38,000
we can look at patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage.

357
0:14:38.749,000 --> 0:14:41,000
This is called by Lee Hood, the father of the field, P4 Medicine.

358
0:14:42.207,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We'll be predictive and know what you're likely to have.

359
0:14:44.857,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We can be preventative; that prevention can be personalized.

360
0:14:47.704,000 --> 0:14:49,000
More importantly, it'll be increasingly participatory.

361
0:14:50.257,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Through websites like PatientsLikeMe

362
0:14:52.12,000 --> 0:14:55,000
or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health,

363
0:14:55.255,000 --> 0:14:57,000
leveraging this together in participatory ways

364
0:14:57.426,000 --> 0:14:58,000
will be increasingly important.

365
0:14:58.934,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I'll finish up with exponentially better.

366
0:15:00.914,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We'd like to get therapies better and more effective.

367
0:15:03.455,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills.

368
0:15:05.96,000 --> 0:15:06,000
What if we take a new device,

369
0:15:07.371,000 --> 0:15:09,000
knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure,

370
0:15:10.281,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and in a single therapy, basically cure hypertension?

371
0:15:12.91,000 --> 0:15:14,000
This is a new device doing essentially that.

372
0:15:14.995,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It should be on the market in a year or two.

373
0:15:17.081,000 --> 0:15:19,000
How about more targeted therapies for cancer?

374
0:15:19.209,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I'm an oncologist and know that most of what we give is essentially poison.

375
0:15:22.782,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells,

376
0:15:26.595,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse.

377
0:15:29.847,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So if you think of cancer as a weed,

378
0:15:31.79,000 --> 0:15:33,000
we often can whack the weed away and it seems to shrink,

379
0:15:34.707,000 --> 0:15:35,000
but it often comes back.

380
0:15:35.899,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So we're attacking the wrong target.

381
0:15:37.66,000 --> 0:15:38,000
The cancer stem cells remain,

382
0:15:39.146,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and the tumor can return months or years later.

383
0:15:41.426,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells

384
0:15:43.931,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and identify those as targets and go for the long-term cure.

385
0:15:47.071,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We're entering the era of personalized oncology,

386
0:15:49.388,000 --> 0:15:51,000
the ability to leverage all of this data together,

387
0:15:51.775,000 --> 0:15:52,000
analyze the tumor

388
0:15:52.95,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and come up with a real, specific cocktail for the individual patient.

389
0:15:56.288,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I'll close with regenerative medicine.

390
0:15:58.145,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I've studied a lot about stem cells.

391
0:15:59.911,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful.

392
0:16:02.137,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We have adult stem cells throughout our body;

393
0:16:04.272,000 --> 0:16:06,000
we use those in bone marrow transplantation.

394
0:16:06.421,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Geron, last year, started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells

395
0:16:10.247,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to treat spinal cord injuries.

396
0:16:11.836,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Still a phase I trial, but evolving.

397
0:16:13.91,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We've been using adult stem cells in clinical trials for about 15 years

398
0:16:17.707,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to approach a whole range of topics, particularly cardiovascular disease.

399
0:16:21.31,000 --> 0:16:24,000
If we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack,

400
0:16:25.05,000 --> 0:16:27,000
we can see much improved heart function and better survival

401
0:16:27.986,000 --> 0:16:29,000
using our own bone marrow derived cells after a heart attack.

402
0:16:30.963,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I invented a device called the MarrowMiner,

403
0:16:33.023,000 --> 0:16:35,000
a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow.

404
0:16:35.484,000 --> 0:16:38,000
It's now been FDA approved; hopefully on the market in the next year.

405
0:16:38.767,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Hopefully you can appreciate the device

406
0:16:40.668,000 --> 0:16:43,000
going through the patient's body removing bone marrow, not with 200 punctures,

407
0:16:44.462,000 --> 0:16:46,000
but with a single puncture, under local anesthesia.

408
0:16:46.879,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Where is stem-cell therapy going?

409
0:16:48.487,000 --> 0:16:49,000
If you think about it,

410
0:16:49.662,000 --> 0:16:52,000
every cell in your body has the same DNA you had when you were an embryo.

411
0:16:53.161,000 --> 0:16:54,000
We can now reprogram your skin cells

412
0:16:55.129,000 --> 0:16:57,000
to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell

413
0:16:58.066,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and utilize those, potentially, to treat multiple organs in the same patient,

414
0:17:01.738,000 --> 0:17:02,000
making personalized stem cell lines.

415
0:17:03.485,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I think there'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking

416
0:17:06.294,000 --> 0:17:09,000
to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells, myocytes and neural cells

417
0:17:09.786,000 --> 0:17:11,000
to use them in the future, should you need them.

418
0:17:12.163,000 --> 0:17:15,000
We're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering,

419
0:17:15.409,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing,

420
0:17:19.001,000 --> 0:17:2,000
replacing the ink with cells,

421
0:17:20.709,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ.

422
0:17:23.53,000 --> 0:17:24,000
That's where things are heading.

423
0:17:25.08,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Still very early days,

424
0:17:26.265,000 --> 0:17:28,000
but I think, as integration of exponential technologies,

425
0:17:29.036,000 --> 0:17:3,000
this is the example.

426
0:17:30.224,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So in closing, as you think about technology trends

427
0:17:32.735,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and how to impact health and medicine,

428
0:17:34.599,000 --> 0:17:35,000
we're entering an era of miniaturization,

429
0:17:36.6,000 --> 0:17:38,000
decentralization and personalization.

430
0:17:38.846,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And by pulling these things together,

431
0:17:40.678,000 --> 0:17:42,000
if we start to think about how to understand and leverage them,

432
0:17:43.687,000 --> 0:17:46,000
we're going to empower the patient, enable the doctor, enhance wellness

433
0:17:47.062,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and begin to cure the well before they get sick.

434
0:17:49.533,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Because I know as a doctor, if someone comes to me with stage I disease,

435
0:17:53.095,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I'm thrilled; we can often cure them.

436
0:17:54.91,000 --> 0:17:55,000
But often it's too late,

437
0:17:56.104,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and it's stage III or IV cancer, for example.

438
0:17:58.257,000 --> 0:18:,000
So by leveraging these technologies together,

439
0:18:00.396,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call stage 0 medicine.

440
0:18:03.657,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And as a cancer doctor, I'm looking forward to being out of a job.

441
0:18:06.95,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Thanks very much.

442
0:18:08.196,000 --> 0:18:09,000
(Applause)

443
0:18:10.198,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Host: Thank you. Thank you.

444
0:18:11.919,000 --> 0:18:12,000
(Applause)

445
0:18:13.743,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Take a bow, take a bow.

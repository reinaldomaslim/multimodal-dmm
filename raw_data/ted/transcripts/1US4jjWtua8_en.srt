2
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Tonight, I want to have a conversation about

3
0:00:14.995,000 --> 0:00:15,000
this incredible global issue

4
0:00:16.929,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,

5
0:00:21.466,000 --> 0:00:22,000
something we can all relate to,

6
0:00:22.787,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth.

7
0:00:25.517,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But first, I want to take you on a little journey.

8
0:00:28.794,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Let's first visit our planet, but at night,

9
0:00:31.59,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and from space.

10
0:00:33.126,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is what our planet looks like from outer space

11
0:00:36.077,000 --> 0:00:38,000
at nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel

12
0:00:38.215,000 --> 0:00:4,000
around the planet. And the thing you would notice first,

13
0:00:41.069,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of course, is how dominant the human presence

14
0:00:44.386,000 --> 0:00:46,000
on our planet is.

15
0:00:46.45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We see cities, we see oil fields,

16
0:00:49.185,000 --> 0:00:52,000
you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,

17
0:00:52.382,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that we are dominating much of our planet,

18
0:00:54.946,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and mostly through the use of energy

19
0:00:56.719,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that we see here at night.

20
0:00:58.453,000 --> 0:01:,000
But let's go back and drop it a little deeper

21
0:01:00.627,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and look during the daytime.

22
0:01:02.669,000 --> 0:01:05,000
What we see during the day is our landscapes.

23
0:01:06.359,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called Rondônia

24
0:01:09.912,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.

25
0:01:13.502,000 --> 0:01:15,000
If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,

26
0:01:16.118,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you're going to see a thin white line,

27
0:01:18.644,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which is a road that was built in the 1970s.

28
0:01:22.022,000 --> 0:01:25,000
If we come back to the same place in 2001,

29
0:01:25.689,000 --> 0:01:27,000
what we're going to find is that these roads

30
0:01:27.946,000 --> 0:01:3,000
spurt off more roads, and more roads after that,

31
0:01:31.796,000 --> 0:01:34,000
at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest

32
0:01:34.937,000 --> 0:01:36,000
where there are going to be a few cows.

33
0:01:37.098,000 --> 0:01:4,000
These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.

34
0:01:40.41,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And these cows are eaten basically in South America,

35
0:01:43.041,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.

36
0:01:45.825,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation

37
0:01:48.561,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is something we notice a lot of around the tropics,

38
0:01:51.146,000 --> 0:01:53,000
especially in this part of the world.

39
0:01:53.374,000 --> 0:01:56,000
If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,

40
0:01:56.697,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,

41
0:01:59.089,000 --> 0:02:03,000
here also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,

42
0:02:03.225,000 --> 0:02:06,000
there's a thin white line through that kind of seam,

43
0:02:06.787,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and there's a lone farmer out there

44
0:02:08.099,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in the middle of the primeval jungle.

45
0:02:10.662,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,

46
0:02:15.435,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and we'll see that that landscape actually looks

47
0:02:17.963,000 --> 0:02:19,000
a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.

48
0:02:20.845,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.

49
0:02:24.213,000 --> 0:02:26,000
These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China

50
0:02:27.086,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare

51
0:02:30.832,000 --> 0:02:32,000
about a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals

52
0:02:33.373,000 --> 0:02:36,000
animal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.

53
0:02:36.803,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.

54
0:02:39.415,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So soybeans have really exploded,

55
0:02:41.207,000 --> 0:02:44,000
showing how trade and globalization are

56
0:02:44.832,000 --> 0:02:46,000
really responsible for the connections to rainforests

57
0:02:47.704,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange

58
0:02:49.641,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and interconnected world that we have today.

59
0:02:52.357,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Well, again and again, what we find as we look

60
0:02:54.678,000 --> 0:02:56,000
around the world in our little tour of the world

61
0:02:56.814,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is that landscape after landscape after landscape

62
0:03:00.565,000 --> 0:03:02,000
have been cleared and altered for growing food

63
0:03:03.334,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and other crops.

64
0:03:05.669,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So one of the questions we've been asking is,

65
0:03:08.029,000 --> 0:03:1,000
how much of the world is used to grow food,

66
0:03:10.517,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and where is it exactly, and how can we change that

67
0:03:12.913,000 --> 0:03:14,000
into the future, and what does it mean?

68
0:03:15.407,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,

69
0:03:18.375,000 --> 0:03:2,000
using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track

70
0:03:21.295,000 --> 0:03:23,000
farming on a global scale.

71
0:03:23.479,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And this is what we found, and it's startling.

72
0:03:27.191,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This map shows the presence of agriculture

73
0:03:29.982,000 --> 0:03:31,000
on planet Earth.

74
0:03:32.046,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,

75
0:03:35.006,000 --> 0:03:38,000
like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.

76
0:03:38.207,000 --> 0:03:42,000
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.

77
0:03:42.471,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If you put it all together in one place,

78
0:03:44.595,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it'd be the size of South America.

79
0:03:47.262,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The second area, in brown, is the world's pastures

80
0:03:49.938,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and rangelands, where our animals live.

81
0:03:52.155,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That area's about 30 million square kilometers,

82
0:03:54.871,000 --> 0:03:56,000
or about an Africa's worth of land,

83
0:03:57.29,000 --> 0:03:59,000
a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,

84
0:04:00.203,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is what you see. And what's left is, like,

85
0:04:02.355,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,

86
0:04:04.366,000 --> 0:04:05,000
or the middle of a rain forest.

87
0:04:06.057,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We're using a planet's worth of land already.

88
0:04:09.802,000 --> 0:04:11,000
If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent

89
0:04:12.593,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,

90
0:04:15.305,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and it's 60 times larger

91
0:04:17.874,000 --> 0:04:19,000
than all the areas we complain about,

92
0:04:20.449,000 --> 0:04:23,000
our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.

93
0:04:23.666,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Half of humanity lives in cities today,

94
0:04:26.529,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.

95
0:04:30.465,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So this is an amazing kind of result,

96
0:04:32.384,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and it really shocked us when we looked at that.

97
0:04:34.561,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,

98
0:04:37.265,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but also we're using a lot of water.

99
0:04:39.971,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is a photograph flying into Arizona,

100
0:04:42.499,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and when you look at it, you're like,

101
0:04:43.308,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"What are they growing here?" It turns out

102
0:04:44.435,000 --> 0:04:46,000
they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert

103
0:04:47.367,000 --> 0:04:49,000
using water sprayed on top.

104
0:04:49.755,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold

105
0:04:51.305,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.

106
0:04:53.981,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come

107
0:04:56.293,000 --> 0:04:58,000
from some place, and it comes from here,

108
0:04:58.837,000 --> 0:05:,000
the Colorado River in North America.

109
0:05:01.477,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,

110
0:05:04.125,000 --> 0:05:06,000
this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,

111
0:05:06.244,000 --> 0:05:08,000
kind of an average day, it looks something like this.

112
0:05:09.029,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But if we come back today, during a normal condition

113
0:05:11.933,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to the exact same location, this is what's left.

114
0:05:15.501,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,

115
0:05:18.503,000 --> 0:05:21,000
or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.

116
0:05:22.059,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water

117
0:05:24.979,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and using it to grow food,

118
0:05:27.386,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,

119
0:05:30.066,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.

120
0:05:33.346,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We've literally consumed an entire river in North America

121
0:05:36.474,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for irrigation.

122
0:05:38.602,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Well, that's not even the worst example in the world.

123
0:05:40.358,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This probably is: the Aral Sea.

124
0:05:43.178,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.

125
0:05:46.082,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is in the former Soviet Union

126
0:05:48.141,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,

127
0:05:50.713,000 --> 0:05:52,000
one of the great inland seas of the world.

128
0:05:53.161,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like

129
0:05:55.473,000 --> 0:05:58,000
it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?

130
0:05:58.995,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,

131
0:06:00.958,000 --> 0:06:02,000
you see two little rivers kind of coming down

132
0:06:03.45,000 --> 0:06:06,000
through the sand, feeding this basin with water.

133
0:06:06.967,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains

134
0:06:09.549,000 --> 0:06:11,000
far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river

135
0:06:12.482,000 --> 0:06:15,000
through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.

136
0:06:15.682,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Well, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water

137
0:06:19.694,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,

138
0:06:22.047,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets

139
0:06:25.827,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.

140
0:06:27.887,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They really needed the money.

141
0:06:29.813,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off

142
0:06:31.809,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?

143
0:06:34.739,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Here it is in 1973,

144
0:06:37.187,000 --> 0:06:39,000
1986,

145
0:06:39.399,000 --> 0:06:41,000
1999,

146
0:06:42.203,000 --> 0:06:45,000
2004,

147
0:06:45.258,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and about 11 months ago.

148
0:06:49.923,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's pretty extraordinary.

149
0:06:51.972,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.

150
0:06:55.163,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Imagine that was Lake Superior.

151
0:06:57.823,000 --> 0:07:,000
Imagine that was Lake Huron.

152
0:07:01.097,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's an extraordinary change.

153
0:07:02.704,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This is not only a change in water and

154
0:07:05.047,000 --> 0:07:07,000
where the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals

155
0:07:07.416,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of the environment of this region.

156
0:07:09.673,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Let's start with this.

157
0:07:10.957,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.

158
0:07:13.167,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Let's put it that way.

159
0:07:14.707,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.

160
0:07:18.111,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things

161
0:07:20.055,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.

162
0:07:22.471,000 --> 0:07:24,000
One of those small islands that was remote

163
0:07:24.603,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and impossible to get to was a site

164
0:07:26.215,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of Soviet biological weapons testing.

165
0:07:28.911,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You can walk there today.

166
0:07:30.265,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Weather patterns have changed.

167
0:07:31.812,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only

168
0:07:35.121,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.

169
0:07:38.071,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is an environmental disaster writ large.

170
0:07:40.951,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But let's bring it home.

171
0:07:42.446,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago

172
0:07:45.175,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that he took when he was in the Soviet Union

173
0:07:46.824,000 --> 0:07:47,000
a long, long time ago,

174
0:07:48.086,000 --> 0:07:5,000
showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.

175
0:07:51.082,000 --> 0:07:53,000
You see the canal they dug?

176
0:07:53.24,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into

177
0:07:55.704,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up

178
0:07:57.92,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't

179
0:08:00.384,000 --> 0:08:02,000
keep up with the retreating shoreline.

180
0:08:02.554,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future

181
0:08:04.565,000 --> 0:08:06,000
archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about

182
0:08:06.963,000 --> 0:08:08,000
our time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?"

183
0:08:09.783,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Well, that's the future we have to look forward to.

184
0:08:12.811,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water

185
0:08:15.724,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that's sustainable, and agriculture alone

186
0:08:17.916,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is 70 percent of that.

187
0:08:20.316,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.

188
0:08:23.476,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.

189
0:08:26.82,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Usually when we think about the atmosphere,

190
0:08:29.156,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we think about climate change and greenhouse gases,

191
0:08:31.804,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and mostly around energy,

192
0:08:33.86,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters

193
0:08:36.496,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of greenhouse gases too.

194
0:08:38.548,000 --> 0:08:4,000
If you look at carbon dioxide from

195
0:08:40.604,000 --> 0:08:42,000
burning tropical rainforest,

196
0:08:42.756,000 --> 0:08:44,000
or methane coming from cows and rice,

197
0:08:45.316,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,

198
0:08:48.229,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse

199
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
gases going into the atmosphere from human activity.

200
0:08:54.016,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That's more than all our transportation.

201
0:08:55.87,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's more than all our electricity.

202
0:08:57.62,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.

203
0:09:00.245,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases

204
0:09:03.355,000 --> 0:09:05,000
of any human activity in the world.

205
0:09:05.675,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And yet, we don't talk about it very much.

206
0:09:08.301,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture

207
0:09:11.354,000 --> 0:09:13,000
dominating our planet,

208
0:09:13.491,000 --> 0:09:15,000
whether it's 40 percent of our land surface,

209
0:09:15.849,000 --> 0:09:17,000
70 percent of the water we use,

210
0:09:17.957,000 --> 0:09:19,000
30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.

211
0:09:20.682,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus

212
0:09:23.531,000 --> 0:09:25,000
around the world simply by using fertilizers,

213
0:09:25.994,000 --> 0:09:27,000
causing huge problems of water quality from rivers,

214
0:09:28.765,000 --> 0:09:3,000
lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest

215
0:09:31.482,000 --> 0:09:33,000
driver of biodiversity loss.

216
0:09:34.157,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So without a doubt, agriculture is

217
0:09:36.258,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet

218
0:09:39.938,000 --> 0:09:41,000
since the end of the ice age. No question.

219
0:09:42.557,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And it rivals climate change in importance.

220
0:09:45.537,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And they're both happening at the same time.

221
0:09:48.462,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But what's really important here to remember is that

222
0:09:50.834,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.

223
0:09:54.102,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In fact, we completely depend on it.

224
0:09:56.282,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.

225
0:10:00.722,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We have to provide food and feed and, yeah,

226
0:10:02.866,000 --> 0:10:05,000
fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people

227
0:10:06.722,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in the world today, and if anything,

228
0:10:09.458,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we're going to have the demands on agriculture

229
0:10:11.488,000 --> 0:10:13,000
increase into the future. It's not going to go away.

230
0:10:14.026,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of

231
0:10:16.257,000 --> 0:10:18,000
growing population. We're seven billion people today

232
0:10:19.25,000 --> 0:10:21,000
heading towards at least nine,

233
0:10:21.45,000 --> 0:10:23,000
probably nine and a half before we're done.

234
0:10:24.242,000 --> 0:10:26,000
More importantly, changing diets.

235
0:10:26.619,000 --> 0:10:29,000
As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,

236
0:10:29.666,000 --> 0:10:32,000
we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,

237
0:10:32.733,000 --> 0:10:35,000
which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.

238
0:10:36.194,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,

239
0:10:40.116,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,

240
0:10:43.317,000 --> 0:10:46,000
where we have to replace oil with other energy sources

241
0:10:46.79,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels

242
0:10:49.361,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and bio-energy sources.

243
0:10:51.14,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So you put these together. It's really hard to see

244
0:10:53.893,000 --> 0:10:55,000
how we're going to get to the rest of the century

245
0:10:56.245,000 --> 0:11:,000
without at least doubling global agricultural production.

246
0:11:00.573,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to

247
0:11:02.522,000 --> 0:11:04,000
double global ag production around the world?

248
0:11:05.315,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Well, we could try to farm more land.

249
0:11:08.003,000 --> 0:11:1,000
This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where

250
0:11:10.802,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the crops are today, on the right is where they could be

251
0:11:14.296,000 --> 0:11:16,000
based on soils and climate, assuming climate change

252
0:11:17.244,000 --> 0:11:18,000
doesn't disrupt too much of this,

253
0:11:19.085,000 --> 0:11:2,000
which is not a good assumption.

254
0:11:20.973,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We could farm more land, but the problem is

255
0:11:23.162,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the remaining lands are in sensitive areas.

256
0:11:26.143,000 --> 0:11:28,000
They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,

257
0:11:28.181,000 --> 0:11:3,000
things we want to protect.

258
0:11:30.615,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So we could grow more food by expanding farmland,

259
0:11:33.439,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but we'd better not,

260
0:11:34.757,000 --> 0:11:37,000
because it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.

261
0:11:38.423,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint

262
0:11:40.807,000 --> 0:11:43,000
of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.

263
0:11:44.592,000 --> 0:11:46,000
This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places

264
0:11:46.992,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in the world where we could improve yields

265
0:11:49.559,000 --> 0:11:51,000
without harming the environment.

266
0:11:51.825,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The green areas here show where corn yields,

267
0:11:54.226,000 --> 0:11:56,000
just showing corn as an example,

268
0:11:56.376,000 --> 0:11:58,000
are already really high, probably the maximum you could

269
0:11:58.977,000 --> 0:12:,000
find on Earth today for that climate and soil,

270
0:12:01.855,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where

271
0:12:04.206,000 --> 0:12:06,000
we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield

272
0:12:06.72,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you should be able to get.

273
0:12:08.06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,

274
0:12:10.378,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union

275
0:12:13.238,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and Eastern Bloc countries used to be,

276
0:12:15.479,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is still a mess agriculturally.

277
0:12:17.703,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Now, this would require nutrients and water.

278
0:12:20.336,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It's going to either be organic or conventional

279
0:12:22.469,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or some mix of the two to deliver that.

280
0:12:24.282,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Plants need water and nutrients.

281
0:12:26.447,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.

282
0:12:29.655,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive

283
0:12:31.935,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to meeting the food security needs of the future

284
0:12:34.544,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and the environmental security needs of the future.

285
0:12:37.807,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between

286
0:12:40.821,000 --> 0:12:43,000
growing food and having a healthy environment work better.

287
0:12:44.53,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.

288
0:12:47.06,000 --> 0:12:48,000
We can grow food in the background --

289
0:12:49.022,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that's a soybean field 

290
0:12:50.483,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,

291
0:12:53.61,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing

292
0:12:56.128,000 --> 0:12:58,000
a lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.

293
0:12:59.125,000 --> 0:13:01,000
In the foreground, we have this prairie

294
0:13:01.133,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that's wonderful from the environmental side,

295
0:13:02.691,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?

296
0:13:05.895,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We need to figure out how to bring both of those together

297
0:13:08.432,000 --> 0:13:12,000
into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.

298
0:13:12.542,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me,

299
0:13:14.753,000 --> 0:13:17,000
"Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food,

300
0:13:17.985,000 --> 0:13:21,000
local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills --

301
0:13:22.733,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,

302
0:13:25.5,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but not any one of these is a silver bullet.

303
0:13:28.573,000 --> 0:13:3,000
In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.

304
0:13:31.533,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And I love silver buckshot. You put it together

305
0:13:34.045,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and you've got something really powerful,

306
0:13:36.363,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but we need to put them together.

307
0:13:38.763,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind

308
0:13:41.296,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of agriculture that blends the best ideas

309
0:13:43.98,000 --> 0:13:46,000
of commercial agriculture and the green revolution

310
0:13:47.085,000 --> 0:13:5,000
with the best ideas of organic farming and local food

311
0:13:50.637,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and the best ideas of environmental conservation,

312
0:13:54.045,000 --> 0:13:55,000
not to have them fighting each other but to have them

313
0:13:55.85,000 --> 0:13:58,000
collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,

314
0:13:59.599,000 --> 0:14:03,000
something I call "terraculture," or farming for a whole planet.

315
0:14:04.317,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Now, having this conversation has been really hard,

316
0:14:07.301,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points

317
0:14:09.413,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to people to reduce the controversy,

318
0:14:11.716,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to increase the collaboration.

319
0:14:13.216,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I want to show you a short video that does kind of show

320
0:14:15.763,000 --> 0:14:17,000
our efforts right now to bring these sides together

321
0:14:18.093,000 --> 0:14:21,000
into a single conversation. So let me show you that.

322
0:14:21.819,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Music)

323
0:14:25.48,000 --> 0:14:28,000
("Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover")

324
0:14:29.137,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Music)

325
0:14:30.578,000 --> 0:14:31,000
("The world population is growing

326
0:14:32.226,000 --> 0:14:35,000
by 75 million people each year.

327
0:14:35.239,000 --> 0:14:37,000
That's almost the size of Germany.

328
0:14:37.672,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Today, we're nearing 7 billion people.

329
0:14:40.615,000 --> 0:14:42,000
At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.

330
0:14:43.305,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And we all need food.

331
0:14:45.073,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But how?

332
0:14:46.424,000 --> 0:14:48,000
How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?

333
0:14:49.312,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We already know climate change is a big problem.

334
0:14:52.557,000 --> 0:14:53,000
But it's not the only problem.

335
0:14:53.807,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'

336
0:14:56.729,000 --> 0:14:58,000
A global crisis in agriculture.

337
0:14:59.277,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.

338
0:15:05.536,000 --> 0:15:08,000
More than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.

339
0:15:08.985,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Global croplands cover 16 million km².

340
0:15:10.991,000 --> 0:15:13,000
That's almost the size of South America.

341
0:15:14.184,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Global pastures cover 30 million km².

342
0:15:15.979,000 --> 0:15:17,000
That's the size of Africa.

343
0:15:18.054,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.

344
0:15:22.77,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.

345
0:15:26.482,000 --> 0:15:3,000
We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.

346
0:15:30.856,000 --> 0:15:33,000
That's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.

347
0:15:34.638,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Today, many large rivers have reduced flows.

348
0:15:37.619,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Some dry up altogether.

349
0:15:39.643,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.

350
0:15:43.627,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.

351
0:15:47.25,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.

352
0:15:51.133,000 --> 0:15:52,000
The consequence?

353
0:15:52.389,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Widespread water pollution

354
0:15:54.373,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.

355
0:15:56.535,000 --> 0:16:,000
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.

356
0:16:00.909,000 --> 0:16:02,000
It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.

357
0:16:03.336,000 --> 0:16:05,000
That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,

358
0:16:06.029,000 --> 0:16:08,000
or from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.

359
0:16:09.005,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,

360
0:16:11.373,000 --> 0:16:12,000
methane from animals and rice fields,

361
0:16:12.749,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.

362
0:16:14.581,000 --> 0:16:17,000
There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.

363
0:16:17.836,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.

364
0:16:21.367,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Here's the dilemma...

365
0:16:22.873,000 --> 0:16:26,000
As the world grows by several billion more people,

366
0:16:27.228,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.

367
0:16:31.812,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So where do we go from here?

368
0:16:33.208,000 --> 0:16:35,000
We need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.

369
0:16:36.011,000 --> 0:16:37,000
We need to invest in real solutions:

370
0:16:37.819,000 --> 0:16:41,000
incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,

371
0:16:42.157,000 --> 0:16:45,000
gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.

372
0:16:45.818,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We need everyone at the table.

373
0:16:48.024,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Advocates of commercial agriculture,

374
0:16:49.974,000 --> 0:16:5,000
environmental conservation,

375
0:16:51.121,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and organic farming...

376
0:16:52.582,000 --> 0:16:54,000
must work together.

377
0:16:54.617,000 --> 0:16:55,000
There is no single solution.

378
0:16:56.191,000 --> 0:16:57,000
We need collaboration,

379
0:16:57.8,000 --> 0:16:58,000
imagination,

380
0:16:59.236,000 --> 0:16:59,000
determination,

381
0:17:00.014,000 --> 0:17:03,000
because failure is not an option.

382
0:17:03.673,000 --> 0:17:06,000
How do we feed the world without destroying it?

383
0:17:07.37,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Yeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges

384
0:17:10.236,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in all of human history today:

385
0:17:12.346,000 --> 0:17:14,000
the need to feed nine billion people

386
0:17:15.02,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and do so sustainably and equitably and justly,

387
0:17:18.774,000 --> 0:17:19,000
at the same time protecting our planet

388
0:17:20.475,000 --> 0:17:22,000
for this and future generations.

389
0:17:23.288,000 --> 0:17:24,000
This is going to be one of the hardest things

390
0:17:24.804,000 --> 0:17:25,000
we ever have done in human history,

391
0:17:26.675,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and we absolutely have to get it right,

392
0:17:29.925,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and we have to get it right on our first and only try.

393
0:17:34.262,000 --> 0:17:37,000
So thanks very much. (Applause)

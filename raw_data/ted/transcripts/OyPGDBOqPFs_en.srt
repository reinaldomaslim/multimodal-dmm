1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I normally teach courses on

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
how to rebuild states after war.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But today I've got a personal story to share with you.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This is a picture of my family,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And we're actually Cambodians.

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And this picture is taken in Vietnam.

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to explain the Khmer Rouge regime

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
during 1975 and 1979.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Video: April 17th, 1975.

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The communist Khmer Rouge

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam,

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and American bombing campaigns.

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Led by peasant-born Pol Pot,

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in order to create a rural communist utopia,

20
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.

21
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.

22
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But after four years the grim truth seeps out.

23
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In a country of only seven million people,

24
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders,

25
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields.

26
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Sophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration,

27
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
on April 17th 1975

28
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we lived in Phnom Penh.

29
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge

30
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.

31
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.

32
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.

33
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And this is very normal now, of modern day conflict,

34
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because they're easy to bring into wars.

35
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off.

36
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were

37
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
more munitions that fell on Cambodia

38
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
than in all of World War II Japan,

39
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
including the two nuclear bombs

40
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of August 1945.

41
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.

42
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank

43
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in Cambodia was bombed.

44
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But not just that, they actually banned money.

45
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I think it's the only precedent in which

46
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
money has ever been stopped from being used.

47
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And we know money is the root of all evil,

48
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact.

49
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province.

50
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This is a picture of what Pursat looks like.

51
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia,

52
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
where rice growing takes place.

53
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And in fact they were forced to work the fields.

54
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So my father and mother ended up in

55
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a sort of concentration camp, labor camp.

56
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And it was at that time that my mother got word

57
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
from the commune chief

58
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that the Vietnamese were actually asking

59
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
for their citizens to go back to Vietnam.

60
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And she spoke some Vietnamese,

61
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.

62
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors,

63
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that she would take the chance

64
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and claim to be Vietnamese

65
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so that we could have a chance to survive,

66
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because at this point they're forcing everybody to work.

67
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And they're giving about --

68
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess --

69
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice.

70
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And at about this time actually

71
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
my father got very sick.

72
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And he didn't speak Vietnamese.

73
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So he died actually, in January 1976.

74
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it made it possible, in fact,

75
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
for us to take on this plan.

76
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So the Khmer Rouge took us

77
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev,

78
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which is across from the border from Vietnam.

79
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And there they had a detention camp

80
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested.

81
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad

82
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that to make our story more credible,

83
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.

84
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But she'd given the boys girls' names,

85
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and the girls boys' names.

86
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady

87
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively,

88
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that she was able to go into her exam

89
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and -- you know, this was a moment of truth.

90
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If she fails, we're all headed to the gallows;

91
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
if she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.

92
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And she actually, of course -- I'm here, she passes.

93
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.

94
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And then onwards to Chau Doc.

95
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.

96
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.

97
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But for us it meant freedom.

98
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge.

99
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Last year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal,

100
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on,

101
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
started, and I decided that as a matter of record

102
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I should file a Civil Complaint

103
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
with the Tribunal about my father's passing away.

104
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And I got word last month

105
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.

106
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future,

107
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times.

108
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc.

109
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And she was able to return to a place

110
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that for her meant freedom, but also fear,

111
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because we had just come out of Cambodia.

112
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'm happy, actually, today, to present her.

113
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
She's here today with us in the audience.

114
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Thank you mother.

115
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Applause)

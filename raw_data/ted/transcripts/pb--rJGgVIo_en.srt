1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Today I wanted to -- well, this morning --

2
0:00:15.929,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation;

3
0:00:21.56,000 --> 0:00:26,000
about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking

4
0:00:27.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
by getting more people into fewer cars;

5
0:00:31.84,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets.

6
0:00:37.84,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...

7
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:41,000
not self-driving cars.

8
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years.

9
0:00:48.8,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber.

10
0:00:55.48,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And if it had survived,

11
0:00:57.36,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the future of transportation would probably already be here.

12
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So let me introduce you to the jitney.

13
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper.

14
0:01:12.88,000 --> 0:01:15,000
He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea.

15
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles,

16
0:01:18.68,000 --> 0:01:19,000
my hometown,

17
0:01:20.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and he saw trolleys

18
0:01:21.44,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go.

19
0:01:26.4,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car

20
0:01:29.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney --

21
0:01:32.68,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that was slang for a nickel.

22
0:01:34.88,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And so people jumped on board,

23
0:01:37.28,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and not just in Los Angeles but across the country.

24
0:01:40.68,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And within one year,

25
0:01:41.92,000 --> 0:01:42,000
by 1915,

26
0:01:44.2,000 --> 0:01:46,000
there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle,

27
0:01:47.52,000 --> 0:01:5,000
45,000 rides per day in Kansas

28
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.

29
0:01:54.72,000 --> 0:01:55,000
To give you some perspective,

30
0:01:57.36,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Uber in Los Angeles

31
0:01:59.76,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...

32
0:02:05.28,000 --> 0:02:06,000
100 years later.

33
0:02:09.56,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And so these are the trolley guys,

34
0:02:11.68,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the existing transportation monopoly at the time.

35
0:02:14.44,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut.

36
0:02:18.44,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And so they got to work

37
0:02:20.479,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and they went to cities across the country

38
0:02:23.12,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.

39
0:02:28.52,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And there were all kinds of regulations.

40
0:02:31.04,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There were licenses -- often they were pricey.

41
0:02:33.32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In some cities,

42
0:02:34.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
if you were a jitney driver,

43
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day.

44
0:02:40.88,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In other cities,

45
0:02:42.28,000 --> 0:02:44,000
they required two jitney drivers for one jitney.

46
0:02:45.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But there was a really interesting regulation

47
0:02:48.04,000 --> 0:02:5,000
which was they had to put a backseat light --

48
0:02:51.92,000 --> 0:02:52,000
install it in every Jitney --

49
0:02:53.84,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.

50
0:02:57.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:59.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
All right. So what happened?

52
0:03:01.24,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, within a year this thing had taken off.

53
0:03:04.36,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.

54
0:03:10.88,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That's unfortunate ...

55
0:03:13.2,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one.

56
0:03:17.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And car ownership skyrocketed

57
0:03:19.76,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and it's no wonder that by 2007,

58
0:03:23.32,000 --> 0:03:26,000
there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States.

59
0:03:27.48,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And that phenomenon had gone global.

60
0:03:30.28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In China by 2011,

61
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:36,000
there were more car sales happening in China than in the US.

62
0:03:37.4,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost.

63
0:03:41.28,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year,

64
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
wasted, sitting in traffic.

65
0:03:48.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
160 billion dollars in lost productivity,

66
0:03:52.24,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of course also sitting in traffic,

67
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint

68
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
is spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.

69
0:04:02.24,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, that's only four percent of our problem though.

70
0:04:05.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Because if you have to own a car

71
0:04:07.48,000 --> 0:04:1,000
then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle.

72
0:04:11.36,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space

73
0:04:15.6,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is used storing these hunks of steel.

74
0:04:18.92,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We even have skyscrapers built for cars.

75
0:04:23.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
That's the world we live in today.

76
0:04:27.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.

77
0:04:31.399,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's called mass transit.

78
0:04:33.079,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And even in a city like New York City,

79
0:04:35.64,000 --> 0:04:37,000
one of the most densely populated in the world

80
0:04:37.88,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world,

81
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:47,000
there are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day.

82
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Why is that?

83
0:04:50.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out

84
0:04:55.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
how to get to everybody's doorstep.

85
0:04:58.92,000 --> 0:05:,000
And so back in San Francisco, where I live,

86
0:05:01.52,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the situation's much worse,

87
0:05:02.88,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in fact, much worse around the world.

88
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was --

89
0:05:09.48,000 --> 0:05:11,000
well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride.

90
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We didn't have any grand ambitions.

91
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But it just turned out

92
0:05:15.68,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride,

93
0:05:18.6,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides.

94
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We saw a lot of people

95
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
pushing the same button at the same time

96
0:05:29.2,000 --> 0:05:31,000
going essentially to the same place.

97
0:05:31.68,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And so we started thinking about,

98
0:05:33.28,000 --> 0:05:36,000
well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one.

99
0:05:37.84,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper --

100
0:05:41.2,000 --> 0:05:42,000
up to 50 percent cheaper --

101
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and of course for the city

102
0:05:44.44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.

103
0:05:47.52,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And so the big question for us was:

104
0:05:49.92,000 --> 0:05:5,000
would it work?

105
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Could you have a cheaper ride

106
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:56,000
cheap enough that people would be willing to share it?

107
0:05:58.36,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.

108
0:06:02.08,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In San Francisco,

109
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:05,000
before uberPOOL, we had --

110
0:06:06.48,000 --> 0:06:09,000
well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted.

111
0:06:09.88,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And the bright colors is where we have the most cars.

112
0:06:12.88,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And once we introduced uberPOOL,

113
0:06:15.04,000 --> 0:06:17,000
well, you see there's not as many bright colors.

114
0:06:18.4,000 --> 0:06:21,000
More people getting around the city in fewer cars,

115
0:06:22.36,000 --> 0:06:24,000
taking cars off the road.

116
0:06:24.44,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It looks like uberPOOL is working.

117
0:06:27.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles

118
0:06:30.64,000 --> 0:06:31,000
eight months ago.

119
0:06:32.56,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads

120
0:06:38.12,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air.

121
0:06:45.4,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But the part that I'm really --

122
0:06:47.24,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:51.52,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But my favorite statistic --

124
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:55,000
remember, I'm from LA,

125
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I spent years of my life

126
0:06:56.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
sitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" --

127
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:02,000
my favorite part is that eight months later,

128
0:07:03.68,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.

129
0:07:10.2,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now, in China everything is supersized,

130
0:07:13.72,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month,

131
0:07:18.12,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that's 500,000 per day.

132
0:07:20.2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.

133
0:07:23.2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.

134
0:07:25.32,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about,

135
0:07:27.72,000 --> 0:07:33,000
"Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done."

136
0:07:34.4,000 --> 0:07:35,000
How do we get that to a million?

137
0:07:36.68,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And in China, well, that could be several million.

138
0:07:39.8,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling.

139
0:07:45.96,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But what about the suburbs?

140
0:07:47.92,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles,

141
0:07:50.32,000 --> 0:07:52,000
it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California,

142
0:07:52.85,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and, well --

143
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever.

144
0:07:58.6,000 --> 0:08:,000
And every morning at about the same time,

145
0:08:01.84,000 --> 0:08:02,000
cars roll of out their driveway,

146
0:08:03.76,000 --> 0:08:05,000
most of them, one person in the car,

147
0:08:07.96,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and they go to work, they go to their place of work.

148
0:08:11.6,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So the question for us is:

149
0:08:12.88,000 --> 0:08:13,000
well, how do we turn

150
0:08:15.32,000 --> 0:08:16,000
all of these commuter cars --

151
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and literally there's tens of millions of them --

152
0:08:21.08,000 --> 0:08:24,000
how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?

153
0:08:25.04,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.

154
0:08:29.64,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee,

155
0:08:32.617,000 --> 0:08:33,000
go to your car

156
0:08:33.92,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and you light up the Uber app,

157
0:08:35.96,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and all of a sudden,

158
0:08:37.48,000 --> 0:08:38,000
you become an Uber driver.

159
0:08:40.36,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors

160
0:08:42.76,000 --> 0:08:43,000
on your way to work

161
0:08:44.679,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and it's a really great thing.

162
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
There's just one hitch ...

163
0:08:50.08,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it's called regulation.

164
0:08:52.44,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So 54 cents a mile, what is that?

165
0:08:54.679,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Well, that is what the US government

166
0:08:56.76,000 --> 0:09:,000
has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile.

167
0:09:01.72,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You can pick up anybody in the United States

168
0:09:04.72,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice,

169
0:09:08.32,000 --> 0:09:1,000
for 54 cents a mile or less.

170
0:09:10.84,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal.

171
0:09:14.96,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But what if for 60 cents a mile

172
0:09:17.08,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles?

173
0:09:21.68,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And what if at 60 cents a mile

174
0:09:24.24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States?

175
0:09:28.96,000 --> 0:09:29,000
If we could,

176
0:09:30.24,000 --> 0:09:31,000
it's obviously something we should do.

177
0:09:33.12,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney.

178
0:09:36.32,000 --> 0:09:39,000
If by 1915 this thing was taking off,

179
0:09:40.08,000 --> 0:09:43,000
imagine without the regulations that happened,

180
0:09:43.6,000 --> 0:09:44,000
if that thing could just keep going.

181
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
How would our cities be different today?

182
0:09:49.04,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Would we have parks in the place of parking lots?

183
0:09:52.76,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Well, we lost that chance.

184
0:09:54.68,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But technology has given us another opportunity.

185
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars

186
0:10:02.96,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years

187
0:10:07.4,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to make our new cities a reality?

188
0:10:11.4,000 --> 0:10:13,000
With the technology in our pockets today,

189
0:10:14.4,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and a little smart regulation,

190
0:10:16.92,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we can turn every car into a shared car,

191
0:10:21.36,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and we can reclaim our cities starting today.

192
0:10:25.56,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Thank you.

193
0:10:26.8,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Applause)

194
0:10:35.916,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.

195
0:10:37.56,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Travis Kalanick: Thank you.

196
0:10:38.87,000 --> 0:10:42,000
CA: You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding.

197
0:10:43.44,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You only just talked about a small part of it here --

198
0:10:46.32,000 --> 0:10:47,000
a powerful part --

199
0:10:47.56,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the idea of turning cars into public transport like that,

200
0:10:50.28,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it's cool.

201
0:10:51.52,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But I've got a couple other questions

202
0:10:53.36,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because I know they're out there on people's minds.

203
0:10:55.8,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So first of all, last week I think it was,

204
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
I switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber

205
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and I couldn't find the app.

206
0:11:03.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.

207
0:11:07.52,000 --> 0:11:08,000
TK: Sure.

208
0:11:08.96,000 --> 0:11:09,000
CA: How did it go?

209
0:11:10.2,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Did you notice other people not finding the app that day?

210
0:11:12.92,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Are you going to win people over for this redesign?

211
0:11:15.64,000 --> 0:11:17,000
TK: Well, first I should probably just say,

212
0:11:17.72,000 --> 0:11:19,000
well, what we were trying to accomplish.

213
0:11:19.92,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I think if you know a little bit about our history,

214
0:11:22.84,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it makes a lot more sense.

215
0:11:24.8,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Which is, when we first got started,

216
0:11:27.04,000 --> 0:11:28,000
it was just black cars.

217
0:11:28.44,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It was literally you push a button and get an S-Class.

218
0:11:31.12,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so what we did

219
0:11:32.76,000 --> 0:11:37,000
was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand

220
0:11:38.12,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that looked like a badge on a luxury car.

221
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And as we've gone worldwide

222
0:11:42.84,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India,

223
0:11:47.2,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it became something that was important for us

224
0:11:49.36,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to be more accessible,

225
0:11:51.76,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to be more hyperlocal,

226
0:11:53.32,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to be about the cities we were in

227
0:11:55.68,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and that's what you see with the patterns and colors.

228
0:11:58.2,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And to be more iconic,

229
0:11:59.48,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit,

230
0:12:02.12,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.

231
0:12:04.6,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And so that was a little bit what it was about.

232
0:12:06.84,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Now, when you first roll out something like that,

233
0:12:09.76,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I mean, your hands are sweating,

234
0:12:11.32,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you've got --

235
0:12:12.56,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you know, you're a little worried.

236
0:12:14.24,000 --> 0:12:15,000
What we saw is a lot of people --

237
0:12:15.88,000 --> 0:12:18,000
actually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app

238
0:12:19.2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because they were curious what they would find when they opened it.

239
0:12:23.6,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.

240
0:12:28.44,000 --> 0:12:29,000
CA: OK, that's cool.

241
0:12:29.72,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Now, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say.

242
0:12:34.56,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Your supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way,

243
0:12:39.36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
believe that the only chance

244
0:12:40.76,000 --> 0:12:43,000
of sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests

245
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
of taxi industry and so forth,

246
0:12:46.12,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor,

247
0:12:49.8,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which you've certainly proved to be.

248
0:12:52.04,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far,

249
0:12:55.4,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and you know -- like a year or two ago

250
0:12:57.4,000 --> 0:13:,000
there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset.

251
0:13:01.24,000 --> 0:13:05,000
How did it feel like inside the company during that period?

252
0:13:06.2,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Did you notice a loss of business?

253
0:13:08.4,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Did you learn anything from that?

254
0:13:10.96,000 --> 0:13:11,000
TK: Well, look, I think --

255
0:13:12.24,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school

256
0:13:14.88,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and you have --

257
0:13:17.72,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times

258
0:13:21.24,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and for us,

259
0:13:22.52,000 --> 0:13:24,000
it was about a year and a half ago,

260
0:13:24.6,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and for us it was hard times, too.

261
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Now, inside, we felt like --

262
0:13:30.12,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I guess at the end of the day

263
0:13:31.56,000 --> 0:13:35,000
we felt like we were good people doing good work,

264
0:13:35.84,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but on the outside that wasn't evident.

265
0:13:38.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And so there was a lot that we had to do

266
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to sort of --

267
0:13:43.04,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We'd gone from a very small company --

268
0:13:44.92,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago,

269
0:13:48.04,000 --> 0:13:5,000
our company was 400 people,

270
0:13:50.2,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and today it's 6,500.

271
0:13:52.88,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And so when you go through that growth,

272
0:13:54.8,000 --> 0:13:57,000
you have to sort of cement your cultural values

273
0:13:57.84,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and talk about them all of the time.

274
0:14:00.2,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And make sure that people are constantly checking

275
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:05,000
to say, "Are we good people doing good work?"

276
0:14:05.92,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And if you check those boxes,

277
0:14:07.6,000 --> 0:14:1,000
the next part of that is making sure you're telling your story.

278
0:14:11.36,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And I think we learned a lot of lessons

279
0:14:13.32,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but I think at the end of it we came out stronger.

280
0:14:16.52,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But it was certainly a difficult period.

281
0:14:20.151,000 --> 0:14:21,000
CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,

282
0:14:22.08,000 --> 0:14:25,000
you're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time.

283
0:14:25.84,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere

284
0:14:28.64,000 --> 0:14:3,000
are mad as hell now because you changed the fees

285
0:14:30.92,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and they can barely -- they claim -- barely afford the deal anymore.

286
0:14:35.8,000 --> 0:14:36,000
How --

287
0:14:37.24,000 --> 0:14:4,000
You know, you said that you started this originally --

288
0:14:40.56,000 --> 0:14:43,000
just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride.

289
0:14:43.84,000 --> 0:14:44,000
This thing's taken off,

290
0:14:45.12,000 --> 0:14:48,000
you're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point.

291
0:14:48.36,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You're being forced to be, whether you want it or not,

292
0:14:51.68,000 --> 0:14:53,000
a kind of global visionary who's changing the world.

293
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I mean -- who are you?

294
0:14:55.84,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Do you want that?

295
0:14:57.08,000 --> 0:15:,000
Are you ready to go with that and be what that takes?

296
0:15:00.88,000 --> 0:15:03,000
TK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so --

297
0:15:04.24,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Laughter)

298
0:15:06.04,000 --> 0:15:09,000
First is on the pricing side --

299
0:15:09.56,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I mean, keep in mind, right?

300
0:15:11.2,000 --> 0:15:12,000
UberX, when we first started,

301
0:15:13.12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product.

302
0:15:17.4,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It's now

303
0:15:19.52,000 --> 0:15:22,000
in many cities, half the price of a taxi.

304
0:15:23.32,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And we have all the data to show

305
0:15:25.48,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.

306
0:15:29.68,000 --> 0:15:32,000
What happens is when the price goes down,

307
0:15:32.72,000 --> 0:15:34,000
people are more likely to take Uber

308
0:15:35.28,000 --> 0:15:37,000
at different times of the day than they otherwise would have,

309
0:15:38.162,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before.

310
0:15:41.48,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off,

311
0:15:45.64,000 --> 0:15:48,000
they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in.

312
0:15:48.92,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And so what that means is more trips per hour,

313
0:15:51.48,000 --> 0:15:53,000
more minutes of the hour where they're productive

314
0:15:53.92,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and actually, earnings come up.

315
0:15:55.84,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts

316
0:15:59.92,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and have seen those price cuts go up over time.

317
0:16:02.72,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So even in New York --

318
0:16:04.28,000 --> 0:16:06,000
We have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" --

319
0:16:07.28,000 --> 0:16:08,000
compare the earnings

320
0:16:08.52,000 --> 0:16:1,000
September after September after September.

321
0:16:10.68,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Same month every year.

322
0:16:12.76,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And we see the earnings going up over time

323
0:16:15.52,000 --> 0:16:17,000
as the price comes down.

324
0:16:18.24,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And there's a perfect price point -- you can't go down forever.

325
0:16:21.56,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And in those places where we bring the price down

326
0:16:23.92,000 --> 0:16:24,000
but we don't see those earnings pop,

327
0:16:25.68,000 --> 0:16:26,000
we bring the prices back up.

328
0:16:27.08,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So that addresses that first part.

329
0:16:29.24,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And then the enigma and all of this --

330
0:16:32.92,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am

331
0:16:35.56,000 --> 0:16:38,000
is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems.

332
0:16:39.6,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor.

333
0:16:44.08,000 --> 0:16:47,000
You know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve,

334
0:16:47.56,000 --> 0:16:49,000
that's a really sad math professor.

335
0:16:50.6,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And so at Uber we like the hard problems

336
0:16:54.8,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and we like getting excited about those and solving them.

337
0:16:59.04,000 --> 0:17:,000
But we don't want just any math problem,

338
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:03,000
we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find,

339
0:17:03.44,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and we want the one that if you solve it,

340
0:17:05.44,000 --> 0:17:06,000
there's a little bit of a wow factor.

341
0:17:08.04,000 --> 0:17:09,000
CA: In a couple years' time --

342
0:17:09.52,000 --> 0:17:11,000
say five years' time, I don't know when --

343
0:17:11.544,000 --> 0:17:14,000
you roll out your incredible self-driving cars,

344
0:17:14.76,000 --> 0:17:18,000
at probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride.

345
0:17:19.28,000 --> 0:17:24,000
What do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?

346
0:17:24.4,000 --> 0:17:25,000
TK: Explain that again -- at which time?

347
0:17:26.319,000 --> 0:17:28,000
CA: At the time when self-driving cars are coming --

348
0:17:28.8,000 --> 0:17:3,000
TK: Sure, sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that.

349
0:17:31.28,000 --> 0:17:32,000
CA: What do you say to a driver?

350
0:17:32.96,000 --> 0:17:34,000
TK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take --

351
0:17:35.96,000 --> 0:17:36,000
it's likely going to take a lot longer

352
0:17:37.839,000 --> 0:17:4,000
than I think some of the hype or media might expect.

353
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
That's part one.

354
0:17:42.4,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Part two is it's going to also take --

355
0:17:44.64,000 --> 0:17:45,000
there's going to be a long transition.

356
0:17:46.52,000 --> 0:17:5,000
These cars will work in certain places and not in others.

357
0:17:50.76,000 --> 0:17:53,000
For us it's an interesting challenge, right?

358
0:17:53.96,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Because, well --

359
0:17:56.28,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Google's been investing in this since 2007,

360
0:17:59.52,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Tesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it,

361
0:18:02.36,000 --> 0:18:04,000
the manufacturers are going to be doing it.

362
0:18:04.44,000 --> 0:18:07,000
This is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason.

363
0:18:08.04,000 --> 0:18:1,000
A million people die a year in cars.

364
0:18:10.96,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide

365
0:18:14.52,000 --> 0:18:18,000
that people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious.

366
0:18:18.8,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And think about the quality of life that improves

367
0:18:22.76,000 --> 0:18:24,000
when you give people their time back

368
0:18:25.72,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and it's not so anxiety-ridden.

369
0:18:27.32,000 --> 0:18:29,000
So I think there's a lot of good.

370
0:18:29.76,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge,

371
0:18:32.64,000 --> 0:18:34,000
but one for optimistic leadership,

372
0:18:35.12,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Where instead of resisting --

373
0:18:37.96,000 --> 0:18:38,000
resisting technology,

374
0:18:39.2,000 --> 0:18:41,000
maybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry --

375
0:18:43.64,000 --> 0:18:46,000
we have to embrace it or be a part of the future.

376
0:18:47.28,000 --> 0:18:49,000
But how do we optimistically lead through it?

377
0:18:49.44,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Are there ways to partner with cities?

378
0:18:51.4,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Are there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc.,

379
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
for that transition period.

380
0:18:56.6,000 --> 0:18:58,000
It will take a lot longer than I think we all expect,

381
0:18:59.12,000 --> 0:19:,000
especially that transition period.

382
0:19:00.8,000 --> 0:19:02,000
But it is a world that's going to exist,

383
0:19:03.24,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and it is going to be a better world.

384
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:08,000
CA: Travis, what you're building is absolutely incredible

385
0:19:08.8,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED and sharing so openly.

386
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Thank you so much. TK: Thank you very much.

387
0:19:14.24,000 --> 0:19:17,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently,

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
they're not brothers. (Laughter)

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And they were a lot of fun.

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family.

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We are going to focus on Charles today, because it is Charles' 100th birthday.

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But when I speak of him, I'm really speaking of both of them as a team.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be 100 this June.

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The thing about their work

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is that most people come to the door of furniture --

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I suspect you probably recognize this chair

14
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and some of the others I'm going to show you.

15
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top.

16
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it?

17
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Is it because Charles and Ray made this film?

18
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.

19
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture

20
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be.

21
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip.

22
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair.

23
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Video: This is the land.

24
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It has many contrasts.

25
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It is rough and it is flat.

26
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In places it is cold.

27
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In some it is hot.

28
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Too much rain falls on some areas,

29
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and not enough on others.

30
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But people live on this land.

31
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And, as in Russia,

32
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
they are drawn together into towns and cities.

33
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Here is something of the way they live.

34
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Eames Demetrios: Now, this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States.

35
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.

36
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it was at the height of the Cold War.

37
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate

38
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
happened about 50 feet from where this was shown.

39
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And yet, how did it start?

40
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You know, commonality, the first line

41
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in Charles' narration was,

42
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"The same stars that shine down on Russia

43
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
shine down on the United States. From the sky,

44
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
our cities look much the same."

45
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything.

46
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And you can imagine, and the thing about it is,

47
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images

48
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because the important thing was to get the gestalt

49
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of what the images were about.

50
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So that was just a little snip.

51
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But the thing about Charles and Ray

52
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
is that they were always modeling stuff.

53
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
They were always trying things out.

54
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I think one of the things I am passionate about, my grandparents work,

55
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'm passionate about my work,

56
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but on top of all that I'm passionate

57
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
about a holistic vision of design,

58
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
where design is a life skill, not a professional skill.

59
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.

60
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I'm no exception.

61
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.

62
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking.

63
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Design is the same way. Design has to become that same way.

64
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.

65
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And Charles just checking it out there.

66
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So now we're going to go through that door of furniture.

67
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is an unusual installation of airport seating.

68
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture.

69
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer

70
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
was essentially that of a good host,

71
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
anticipating the needs of the guest.

72
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.

73
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes,

74
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design.

75
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's just the things you try out

76
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to kind of make it work better.

77
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs.

78
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?"

79
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It was that hands-on iterative process

80
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which is so much like vernacular design

81
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and folk design in traditional cultures.

82
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism

83
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground

84
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.

85
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The other thing that's kind of cool is that

86
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you look at this and in the media when people say design,

87
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
they actually mean style.

88
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I'm really here to talk about design.

89
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But you know the object is just a pivot.

90
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's a pivot between a process and a system.

91
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And this is a little film I made

92
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
about the making of the Eames lounge chair.

93
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The design process for Charles and Ray

94
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
never ended in manufacturing.

95
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better.

96
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.

97
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's not enough to create one.

98
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You've got to create a system that will work better and better.

99
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I've always liked this prototype picture.

100
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Because it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.

101
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You try things out.

102
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This is a relatively famous chair.

103
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Its early version had an "X" base. That's what the collectors like.

104
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better.

105
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It worked better: "H" base, much more practical.

106
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
This is something called a splint.

107
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's

108
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
work for the military, or for the soldiers,

109
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it.

110
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And they'd been working on furniture before.

111
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process,

112
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which was incredibly important to them.

113
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I'm trying to show you too much,

114
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images.

115
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed.

116
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me.

117
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary, it's not me.

118
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And then this is a film, on the lower left, that Charles and Ray made.

119
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now look at that plastic chair.

120
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The house is 1949.

121
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The chair is done in 1949.

122
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Charles and Ray,

123
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.

124
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy."

125
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They didn't say, "Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy."

126
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They focused on the need.

127
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They tried to solve the design problem.

128
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Charles used to say, "The extent to which you have a design style

129
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem."

130
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's kind of a brutal quote.

131
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This is the earlier design of that house.

132
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype

133
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of a house -- architecture, very expensive medium.

134
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Here's a film we've been hearing things about.

135
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The "Powers of Ten" is a film they made.

136
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
If we watch the next clip,

137
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
you're going to see the first version of "Powers of Ten," upper left.

138
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The familiar one on the lower right.

139
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The Eames' film Tops, lower left.

140
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church.

141
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Video: Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies.

142
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
These form part of a grouping system

143
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
much as the stars do.

144
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They are so many and so varied that from this distance

145
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they appear like the stars from Earth.

146
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
ED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this

147
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.

148
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Everybody here is coming at it from a different way.

149
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I want to give you one example.

150
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants --

151
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
he loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them --

152
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale.

153
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So here is the tiny creature.

154
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And yet simply by changing the frame of reference

155
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize.

156
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Modeling, they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things.

157
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.

158
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And I think in our family we were very lucky,

159
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
because we learned about design backwards.

160
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Design was not something other.

161
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It was part of the business of life in general.

162
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It was part of the quality of life.

163
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And here is some family pictures.

164
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And you can see why I'm down on style, with a haircut like that.

165
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But anyway, (Laughter)

166
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid.

167
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So we're going to watch another film.

168
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
This is a film, the one called Toys.

169
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
You can see me, I have the same haircut, in the upper right corner.

170
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Upper left is a film they did on toy trains.

171
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy.

172
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.

173
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear.

174
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They are often the precursor to bigger things.

175
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And these ideas -- that train up there, being about the honest use of materials,

176
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is totally the same

177
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as the honest use of materials in the plywood.

178
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And now I'm going to test you.

179
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.

180
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So can you read it?

181
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Lucia angel,

182
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
okay, eye.

183
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Audience: Saw many trains.

184
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
ED: Awl, also, good that the leather crafter's guild is here.

185
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Also, what is he doing? Row, rowed.

186
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Sun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise?

187
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Dawn, very good.

188
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Also rode on one. I ...

189
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Audience: You had, I hope you had --

190
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
ED: Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis

191
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in the late, in the mid-1930's,

192
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
then you'd know that was a Great Dane.

193
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So, I hope you had a

194
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Audience: Nice time, time --

195
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
ED: Time at.

196
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Citizen Kane, rose --

197
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Audience: Rosebud.

198
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
ED: No, bud. "D"'s right. At Buddy's --

199
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Audience: Party. Love.

200
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
ED: Okay, good.

201
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So, "I saw many trains and also rode on one.

202
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party."

203
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So you guys did pretty good, cool.

204
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So my mom and Charles had this great relationship

205
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another.

206
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And it's all part of the, you know,

207
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
they used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously."

208
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
These are some images from a project of mine

209
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that's called Kymaerica.

210
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's sort of an alternative universe.

211
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape.

212
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America.

213
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We're about to do six in the U.K. next week.

214
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world.

215
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true.

216
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Video: Kymaerica with waterfalls,

217
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
tumbling through our --

218
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
ED: This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs.

219
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And so we had spelling bees in Paris, Illinois.

220
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Video: Your word is N. Carolina.

221
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Girl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A.

222
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
ED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site,

223
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
because in the Kymaerican story

224
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
this is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.

225
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional

226
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
fictional experience there.

227
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And the town has really embraced it.

228
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club.

229
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But what is really cool is that we take our visual environment

230
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
as inevitable. And it's not.

231
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.

232
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago.

233
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench.

234
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They have trading cards

235
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and all sorts of cool things.

236
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.

237
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.

238
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
A guy named Nobu Naga,

239
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the so-called Japanese Columbus.

240
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But now I'm going to return you to the real world.

241
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you,

242
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
which is the first film that Charles ever made.

243
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it.

244
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here.

245
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's a film about Maya Gretel, a famous ceramicist, and a teacher at Cranbrook.

246
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.

247
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Silent. We don't have a track for it yet.

248
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing.

249
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.

250
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And you try something out.

251
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But here is what's really great.

252
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
See that chair there? The orange one? That's the organic chair. 1940.

253
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
At the same time that Charles was doing that chair,

254
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
he was doing this film.

255
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So my point is that this scope of vision, this holistic vision

256
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
of design, was with them from the beginning.

257
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.

258
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Now we're going to do some movies."

259
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful.

260
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward,

261
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
it's not about just doing one thing.

262
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality

263
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
between design, business and the world.

264
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So we're going to do the last clip.

265
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now.

266
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So this is Charles' voice.

267
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Charles Eames: In India, those without, and the lowest in caste,

268
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
eat very often, particularly in southern India,

269
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
they eat off of a banana leaf.

270
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And those a little bit up the scale

271
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
eat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.

272
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And a little bit higher, why they have a glaze

273
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
on a thing they call a thali.

274
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
If you're up the scale a little bit more,

275
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
why, a brass thali.

276
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And then things get to be a little questionable.

277
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
There are things like silver-plated thalis.

278
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And there is solid silver thalis.

279
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And I suppose some nut has had a

280
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
gold thali that he's eaten off of.

281
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But you can go beyond that.

282
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And the guys that have not only means,

283
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding,

284
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
go to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf.

285
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I think that in these times

286
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
when we fall back and regroup,

287
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that somehow or other,

288
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the banana leaf parable

289
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
sort of got to get working there,

290
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because I'm not prepared to say

291
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that the banana leaf that one eats off of

292
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is the same as the other eats off of.

293
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But it is that process that has happened within the man

294
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that changes the banana leaf.

295
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
ED: I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you.

296
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Because that's part of where we've got to get to.

297
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And I also want to share this one.

298
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices."

299
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And I really think that's where we are.

300
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family

301
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978.

302
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And part of why this stuff is important

303
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and all the things that we do are important,

304
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is that these are the ideas we need.

305
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.

306
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
That's what we all need to do.

307
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.

308
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
All that great thinking needs to really get about solving

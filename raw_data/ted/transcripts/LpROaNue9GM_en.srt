1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a contemporary artist

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
with a bit of an unexpected background.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I grew up in the middle of nowhere

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
on a dirt road in rural Arkansas,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
an hour from the nearest movie theater.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because I grew up around quirky, colorful characters

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
who were great at making with their hands.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And my childhood is more hick

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
than I could ever possibly relate to you,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and also more intellectual than you would ever expect.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
For instance, me and my sister, when we were little,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But on the other side of that, though,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we were big readers in our house.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And if the TV was on, we were watching a documentary.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And my dad is the most voracious reader I know.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
He can read a novel or two a day.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But when I was little, I remember,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And what was so amazing to me about that --

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
well he would be in his recliner, would holler for me to fetch the BB gun,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and I'd go get it.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And what was amazing to me --

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
well it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun --

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but what was so amazing to me

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
was that he knew just enough how to pump it.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And he could shoot it from two rooms away

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and not damage what it was on

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and not damage what it landed on.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I should talk about art.

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I love contemporary art,

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the contemporary art scene.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
A few years ago,

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I spent months in Europe

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to see the major international art exhibitions

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that have the pulse

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of what is supposed to be going on in the art world.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I was struck

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
by going to so many, one after the other,

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with some clarity of what it was

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that I was longing for.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
or not getting enough of.

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But two of the main things:

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
one of it, I was longing for more work

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that was appealing to a broad public,

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that was accessible.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And the second thing that I was longing for

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
was some more exquisite craftsmanship

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and technique.

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I started thinking and listing

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So I decided,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm going to start my own biennial.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I'm going to organize it and direct it

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and get it going in the world.

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I thought, okay,

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I have to have some criteria of how to choose work.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So amongst all the criteria I have,

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
there's two main things.

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
One of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And what that is

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is I imagine explaining a work of art

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to my grandmother in five minutes,

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and if I can't explain it in five minutes,

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
then it's too obtuse

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
or esoteric

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and it hasn't been refined enough yet.

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It needs to worked on

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
until it can speak fluently.

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And then my other second set of rules --

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I hate to say "rules" because it's art --

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
my criteria would be

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the three H's,

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which is head, heart and hands.

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And great art would have "head":

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it would have interesting intellectual ideas

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and concepts.

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It would have "heart" in that it would have passion

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and heart and soul.

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And it would have "hand" in that it would be greatly crafted.

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I started thinking about

90
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
how am I going to do this biennial,

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
how am I going to travel the world

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and find these artists?

93
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself.

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And so this is what I did.

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So I thought, a biennial needs artists.

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I'm going to do an international biennial; I need artists from all around the world.

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So what I did was

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I invented a hundred artists from around the world.

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I figured out their bios, their passions in life

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and their art styles,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and I started making their work.

104
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Applause)

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial.

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's going to be two years of studio work.

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I'm going to create this in two years,

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I have.

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So I should start to talk about these guys.

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Well the range is quite a bit.

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I'm such a technician, so I loved this project,

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
getting to play with all the techniques.

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So for example, in realist paintings,

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it ranges from this,

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which is kind of old masters style,

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to really realistic still-life,

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair.

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And then at the other end, there's performance and short films

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and indoor installations

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
like this indoor installation

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and this one,

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and outdoor installations like this one

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and this one.

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I know I should mention: I'm making all these things.

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This isn't Photoshopped.

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I'm under the river with those fish.

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you.

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is Nell Remmel.

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Nell is interested in agricultural processes,

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and her work is based in these practices.

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This piece, which is called "Flipped Earth" --

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
she was interested in taking the sky

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and using it to cleanse barren ground.

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And by taking giant mirrors --

137
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Applause)

138
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and here she's taking giant mirrors

139
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and pulling them into the dirt.

140
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And this is 22 feet long.

141
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And what I loved about her work

142
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is, when I would walk around it

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and look down into the sky,

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
looking down to watch the sky,

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and it unfolded in a new way.

146
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And probably the best part of this piece

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is at dusk and dawn

148
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,

149
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but there's still the light above, bright above.

150
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And so you're standing there and everything else is dark,

151
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but there's this portal that you want to jump in.

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.

153
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I love to dig a hole.

154
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So this piece was great fun

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because it was two days of digging in soft dirt.

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The next artist is Kay Overstry,

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and she's interested in ephemerality and transience.

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And in her most recent project,

159
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it's called "Weather I Made."

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And she's making weather

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
on her body's scale.

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And this piece is "Frost."

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And what she did was she went out on a cold, dry night

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and breathed back and forth on the lawn

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to leave --

166
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to leave her life's mark,

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the mark of her life.

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

169
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And so this is five-foot, five-inches of frost

170
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that she left behind.

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The sun rises, and it melts away.

172
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And that was played by my mom.

173
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists,

174
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a collective of Japanese artists --

175
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in Tokyo.

177
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space,

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and they needed funding for it,

179
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.

180
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces.

181
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

182
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And so what they're doing --

183
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
each of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card,

184
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which they sell for 10 bucks,

185
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
they drew original works of art.

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not.

187
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Well this has sparked a craze in Japan,

188
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because everyone's wanting a masterpiece.

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And the ones that are the most sought after

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are the ones that are only barely scratched off.

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And all these works, in some way,

192
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
talk about luck or fate or chance.

193
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Those first two

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win.

195
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And in this one it's called "Drawing the Short Stick."

196
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home

198
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction --

199
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea.

200
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
He draws sticks real good."

201
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

202
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Which is one of the best compliments ever.

203
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This artist is Gus Weinmueller,

204
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and he's doing a project, a large project, called "Art for the Peoples."

205
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And within this project, he's doing a smaller project

206
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
called "Artists in Residence."

207
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And what he does is --

208
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

209
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
he spends a week at a time with a family.

210
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,

211
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
with a toothbrush and pajamas,

212
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and he's ready to spend the week with them.

213
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And using only what's present,

214
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.

215
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And he spends that week talking to the family

216
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
about what do they think great art is.

217
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
He has all these discussions with their family,

218
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and he digs through everything they have,

219
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and he finds materials to make work.

220
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And he makes a work

221
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
that answers what they think great art is.

222
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
For this family, he made this still-life painting.

223
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And whatever he makes

224
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
somehow references nesting and space

225
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and personal property.

226
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
This next project,

227
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
this is by Jaochim Parisvega,

228
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and he's interested in --

229
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
he believes art is everywhere waiting --

230
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen.

231
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces,

232
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
like in his series where he used rain to make paintings.

233
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This project is called "Love Nests."

234
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.

235
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them,

236
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and they crafted his nests for him.

237
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And this one's called "Lovelock's Nest."

238
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest."

239
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Laughter)

240
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."

241
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughted)

242
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Next is Sylvia Slater.

243
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Sylvia's interested in art training.

244
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
She's a very serious Swiss artist.

245
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

246
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
And she was thinking about her friends and family

247
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries,

248
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and she was thinking,

249
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
what can I make that would be of value to them,

250
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in case something bad happens

251
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and they have to buy their way across the border

252
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or pay off a gunman?

253
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And so she came up with creating

254
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
these pocket-sized artworks

255
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that are portraits of the person that would carry them.

256
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And you would carry this around with you,

257
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and if everything went to hell, you could make payments

258
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and buy your life.

259
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So this life price

260
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is for an irrigation non-profit director.

261
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So hopefully what happens is you never use it,

262
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and it's an heirloom that you pass down.

263
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments,

264
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
or they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.

265
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.

266
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And this one had to get broken up.

267
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently.

268
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.

269
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And they're interested in creating culture,

270
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
just tradition.

271
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
So what they do is they move into an area

272
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.

273
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So this is in Eastern Tennessee,

274
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and what they decided was

275
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that we need a positive tradition

276
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that goes with death.

277
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So they came up with "dig jigs."

278
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And a dig jig --

279
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a dig jig is where,

280
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
for a milestone anniversary or a birthday,

281
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
you gather all your friends and family together

282
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and you dance on where you're going to be buried.

283
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

284
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And we got a lot of attention when we did it.

285
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.

286
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And I was like, "Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work."

287
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious --

288
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the attention that we got.

289
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So what happens is you dance on the grave,

290
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and after you've done your dance,

291
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are.

292
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And you in essence have a funeral

293
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that you get to be present for.

294
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That's my mom and dad.

295
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is by Jason Birdsong.

296
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
He is interested in how we see as an animal,

297
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.

298
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
You know, we look down a dark alley

299
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
or a jungle path,

300
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
trying to make out a face or a creature.

301
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We just have that natural way of seeing.

302
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And he plays with this idea.

303
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And this piece: those aren't actually leaves.

304
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage.

305
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So he pairs these up.

306
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
There's another pile of leaves.

307
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens.

308
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And he pairs these up with paintings.

309
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Like this is a painting of a snake in a box.

310
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So you open the box and you think, "Whoa, there's a snake in there."

311
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But it's actually a painting.

312
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So he makes these interesting conversations

313
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
about realism and mimicry

314
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage.

315
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Laughter)

316
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The next artist is Hazel Clausen.

317
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical

318
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture

319
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch."

320
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So that's what she did.

321
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
She created the Swiss people named the Uvulites,

322
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and they have this distinctive yodeling song

323
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
that they use the uvula for.

324
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And also they reference how the uvula --

325
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
everything they say is fallen

326
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because of the forbidden fruit.

327
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And that's the symbol of their culture.

328
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And this is from a documentary

329
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
called "Sexual Practices and Populations Control

330
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Among the Uvulites."

331
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
This is a typical angora embroidery for them.

332
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.

333
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Laughter)

334
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And actually this is my Aunt Irene.

335
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It was so funny having a fake person

336
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
who was making fake things.

337
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And I crack up at this piece,

338
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
because when I see it I know that's French angora

339
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and all antique German ribbons

340
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill

341
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and carried around for 10 years

342
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and then antique Chinese skirts.

343
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
The next is a collective of artists

344
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
called the Silver Dobermans,

345
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and their motto is to spread pragmatism

346
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
one person at a time.

347
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Laughter)

348
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And they're really interested

349
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in how over-coddled we've become.

350
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.

351
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And what they've done

352
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence.

353
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

354
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

355
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And this is called "Horse Sense Fence."

356
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
The next artist is K. M. Yoon,

357
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
a really interesting South Korean artist.

358
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition

359
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
of scholar stones.

360
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Next is Maynard Sipes.

361
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And I love Maynard Sipes,

362
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
but he's off in his own world,

363
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and, bless his heart, he's so paranoid.

364
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Next is Roy Penig,

365
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
a really interesting Kentucky artist,

366
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and he's the nicest guy.

367
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese

368
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
because the person wanted it so badly.

369
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Next is an Australian artist, Janeen Jackson,

370
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and this is from a project of hers

371
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
called "What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching."

372
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
(Laughter)

373
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller, Jurgi Petrauskas.

374
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Next is Ginger Cheshire.

375
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
This is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person."

376
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.

377
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
The next, this is by Sam Sandy.

378
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
He's an Australian Aboriginal elder,

379
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and he's also an artist.

380
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And this is from a large traveling sculpture project

381
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that he's doing.

382
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This is from Estelle Willoughsby.

383
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
She heals with color.

384
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists,

385
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
even though she's going to be 90 next year.

386
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Laughter)

387
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
This is by Z. Zhou,

388
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and he's interested in stasis.

389
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Next is by Hilda Singh,

390
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits."

391
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Next is by Vera Sokolova.

392
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And I have to say, Vera kind of scares me.

393
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
You can't look her directly in the eyes

394
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
because she's kind of scary.

395
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And it's good that she's not real;

396
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
she'd be mad that I said that.

397
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
(Laughter)

398
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg,

399
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and she plays with optics.

400
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Next, this is by Thomas Swifton.

401
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
This is from a short film, "Adventures with Skinny."

402
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Laughter)

403
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And this is by Cicily Bennett,

404
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and it's from a series of short films.

405
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And after this one, there's 77 other artists.

406
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And all together with those other 77 you're not seeing,

407
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that's my biennial.

408
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Thank you. Thank you.

409
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Thanks.

410
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Applause)

411
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Thank you. Thanks.

412
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
(Applause)

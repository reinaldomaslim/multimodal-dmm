Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Hello and welcome to everyone

3
0:00:15.477,000 --> 0:00:16,000
joining us from around the globe.

4
0:00:17.079,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Thank you for being part of day two of our special series TED Connects.

5
0:00:20.453,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This week, we're bringing you interviews from some of the world's greatest minds

6
0:00:24.418,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to offer tools for us to navigate through and thrive

7
0:00:27.013,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in these really uncertain times.

8
0:00:29.132,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm Whitney Pennington Rogers, TED's current affairs curator,

9
0:00:32.203,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I'll be one of your hosts for today's event.

10
0:00:34.855,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Yesterday, we kicked off this series

11
0:00:36.609,000 --> 0:00:39,000
with an interview from acclaimed psychologist Susan David,

12
0:00:39.792,000 --> 0:00:41,000
who offered us some tips on how to really be our best selves

13
0:00:42.778,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in these trying times.

14
0:00:45.31,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And we're going to switch gears a little bit today

15
0:00:47.678,000 --> 0:00:49,000
from thinking about our own personal mental health

16
0:00:50.508,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to the state of our global public health systems.

17
0:00:53.323,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

18
0:00:55.014,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I guess we have a pretty exciting guest to introduce.

19
0:00:59.141,000 --> 0:01:02,000
On the other side of the country, let's bring in Bill Gates.

20
0:01:03.336,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Bill, they say the better-known people are,

21
0:01:06.51,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the less you have to intro them.

22
0:01:08.792,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's great to have you here.

23
0:01:10.17,000 --> 0:01:11,000
How are you doing?

24
0:01:13.768,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Bill Gates: I think this is an unprecedented,

25
0:01:17.435,000 --> 0:01:19,000
really disconcerting time for everyone,

26
0:01:20.027,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with things being shut down,

27
0:01:22.07,000 --> 0:01:25,000
not knowing exactly how long it's going to last,

28
0:01:25.243,000 --> 0:01:27,000
worrying about the health of all the people we care about.

29
0:01:29.974,000 --> 0:01:31,000
You know, I'm lucky that I get to connect up

30
0:01:32.935,000 --> 0:01:35,000
with video conferencing using Teams a lot,

31
0:01:36.085,000 --> 0:01:39,000
so the Foundation is stepping up

32
0:01:39.257,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and there's a lot of great people trying to help with this crisis.

33
0:01:44.625,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But it's scary for everyone.

34
0:01:47.03,000 --> 0:01:5,000
CA: Are you basically stuck at home like many of us watching?

35
0:01:51.41,000 --> 0:01:55,000
BG: Yeah, almost all my meetings are using Teams now,

36
0:01:55.743,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm getting used to that.

37
0:01:58.173,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You know, I've gone days without seeing any coworkers.

38
0:02:04.585,000 --> 0:02:05,000
CA: Let's start here, Bill.

39
0:02:05.934,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Five years ago, you stood on the TED stage

40
0:02:10.3,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and you gave this chilling warning

41
0:02:12.919,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that the world was in danger, at some point, of a major pandemic.

42
0:02:18.695,000 --> 0:02:19,000
People watching that talk now,

43
0:02:20.419,000 --> 0:02:22,000
their hair stands up on the back of their neck --

44
0:02:22.764,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it is exactly what we're living through.

45
0:02:24.863,000 --> 0:02:27,000
What happened, did people listen to that warning at all?

46
0:02:29.903,000 --> 0:02:3,000
BG: Basically, no.

47
0:02:32.815,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You know, I was hopeful that with the Zika and Ebola

48
0:02:38.836,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and SARS and MERS,

49
0:02:40.455,000 --> 0:02:42,000
they all reminded us

50
0:02:42.951,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that, particularly in a world where people move around so much,

51
0:02:46.646,000 --> 0:02:49,000
you can get huge devastation.

52
0:02:50.9,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And so the talk was to say,

53
0:02:53.884,000 --> 0:02:55,000
hey, we're not ready for the next pandemic,

54
0:02:56.234,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but in fact, there's advances in science that if we put resources against them,

55
0:03:02.371,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we can be ready.

56
0:03:04.212,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Sadly, very little was done.

57
0:03:06.411,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There were some things --

58
0:03:07.666,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, CEPI,

59
0:03:13.323,000 --> 0:03:16,000
was funded by our foundation,

60
0:03:16.579,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Wellcome Trust and a number of governments,

61
0:03:21.077,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to do some of the platform vaccine work,

62
0:03:25.1,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but in the area of diagnostics, antibodies, antivirals,

63
0:03:30.608,000 --> 0:03:32,000
basically doing the disease games that I talked about,

64
0:03:33.491,000 --> 0:03:36,000
where we'd simulate what needed to be done.

65
0:03:37.443,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We hardly did anything,

66
0:03:39.049,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and so now here we have a respiratory virus

67
0:03:43.38,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that is, sadly, fulfilling some of the more negative predictions I made.

68
0:03:50.338,000 --> 0:03:53,000
CA: Last month, you said that this might be the big one.

69
0:03:53.711,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You wrote that this could be the sort of once-in-a-century pandemic

70
0:04:00.246,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that people had been fearing.

71
0:04:02.511,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Is that how you think of it still?

72
0:04:05.127,000 --> 0:04:07,000
BG: Well, it's awful to say this,

73
0:04:07.875,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but we could have a respiratory virus whose case fatality rate was even higher,

74
0:04:14.355,000 --> 0:04:16,000
if this was something like smallpox,

75
0:04:16.68,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you know, that kills 30 percent of people.

76
0:04:18.713,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So this is horrific.

77
0:04:21.173,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But in fact,

78
0:04:23.789,000 --> 0:04:27,000
most people, even who get the COVID disease,

79
0:04:28.022,000 --> 0:04:29,000
are able to survive.

80
0:04:29.942,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So it's quite infectious,

81
0:04:32.927,000 --> 0:04:35,000
way more infectious than MERS or SARS were.

82
0:04:37.632,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's not as fatal as they were.

83
0:04:40.838,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And yet, the disruption we're seeing, in order to knock it down,

84
0:04:46.528,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is really completely unprecedented.

85
0:04:50.048,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So this is going global,

86
0:04:54.931,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that was --

87
0:04:56.177,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it's respiratory,

88
0:04:58.114,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that was the great fear.

89
0:05:01.067,000 --> 0:05:03,000
How many people end up dying --

90
0:05:03.847,000 --> 0:05:07,000
hopefully, if we do the right things, it won't be a gigantic number.

91
0:05:08.141,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, you know, we should end up not having the 1918 flu situation.

92
0:05:15.402,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We should be able to do a lot better than that.

93
0:05:19.28,000 --> 0:05:21,000
CA: And that's because of actions that we would take.

94
0:05:22.124,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I mean, left without the right actions,

95
0:05:25.95,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the prospects are pretty deadly.

96
0:05:27.937,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If we knew what we knew in 1919,

97
0:05:31.89,000 --> 0:05:33,000
this thing could take out tens of millions of people

98
0:05:34.363,000 --> 0:05:35,000
around the world.

99
0:05:36.371,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You said --

100
0:05:37.577,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is the key thing here that it's got this sort of a strange combination

101
0:05:41.779,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of being certainly more dangerous than flu --

102
0:05:44.403,000 --> 0:05:46,000
not as dangerous as something like Ebola or SARS,

103
0:05:47.323,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but more dangerous than flu by a factor, but infectious,

104
0:05:52.133,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and also infectious before symptoms have started,

105
0:05:56.212,000 --> 0:06:,000
is that part of why it's been really hard to respond to?

106
0:06:01.3,000 --> 0:06:02,000
BG: Right.

107
0:06:03.062,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Ebola,

108
0:06:05.173,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you're actually flat on your back before you're very infectious.

109
0:06:09.197,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So you're not at church or in a bus or at a store.

110
0:06:15.546,000 --> 0:06:21,000
With most respiratory viruses like the flu and COVID,

111
0:06:22.173,000 --> 0:06:25,000
at first you only feel a little bit of a fever and a little bit sick,

112
0:06:25.911,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and so there's the possibility you're going about your normal activities

113
0:06:32.251,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and infecting other people.

114
0:06:35.083,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And so human-to-human transmissible respiratory viruses

115
0:06:39.124,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that in the early stage aren't stopping you from doing things,

116
0:06:46.3,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that's kind of a worst case,

117
0:06:47.831,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and that's where, you know, I did a flu simulation in the 2015 talk

118
0:06:52.792,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and showed how quickly it spread.

119
0:06:54.982,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You know, versus 1918,

120
0:06:57.188,000 --> 0:07:01,000
people move around a lot more now than they used to,

121
0:07:01.641,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and so that works against us.

122
0:07:03.347,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now the medical system that steps up to treat people

123
0:07:06.552,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is also far, far better.

124
0:07:08.077,000 --> 0:07:09,000
CA: But when was it clear to you

125
0:07:10.053,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that unless we acted, this could be a really deadly pandemic?

126
0:07:17.235,000 --> 0:07:21,000
BG: Well, in January it was discussed

127
0:07:21.547,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that there was human-to-human transmission taking place.

128
0:07:26.146,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And so the alarm bells were ringing

129
0:07:33.837,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that this fits the very scary pattern

130
0:07:37.578,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that it will be very difficult to contain.

131
0:07:42.189,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And on January 23,

132
0:07:45.507,000 --> 0:07:48,000
China did their equivalent of the shutdown.

133
0:07:49.577,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Did it in a fairly extreme form.

134
0:07:52.506,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The very good news is that they were able to reduce

135
0:07:56.712,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the infection rates dramatically

136
0:08:00.522,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because of those actions.

137
0:08:02.879,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But it's January where everybody should have been on notice --

138
0:08:07.903,000 --> 0:08:09,000
let's get our act together with testing,

139
0:08:10.625,000 --> 0:08:14,000
let's get going on therapeutics and vaccines,

140
0:08:14.942,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we've got to get organized

141
0:08:16.398,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because we have this novel respiratory virus

142
0:08:19.315,000 --> 0:08:24,000
whose infectiousness and fatality put it in that superscary range.

143
0:08:26.053,000 --> 0:08:27,000
CA: And so, what did happen?

144
0:08:27.958,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Because it's such a mystery to me

145
0:08:29.63,000 --> 0:08:33,000
about the "lost month" of preparations

146
0:08:33.944,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in many countries and certainly in the US,

147
0:08:36.868,000 --> 0:08:37,000
where we are.

148
0:08:38.792,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Were you on the phone to people

149
0:08:41.609,000 --> 0:08:44,000
during early February, late January, early February,

150
0:08:45.046,000 --> 0:08:48,000
saying, "Guys, what's going on,

151
0:08:48.554,000 --> 0:08:5,000
this is a really big deal, what are we doing?"

152
0:08:50.728,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What was happening behind the scenes during that period?

153
0:08:55.006,000 --> 0:08:57,000
BG: Well, you'd like to have government money show up

154
0:08:57.696,000 --> 0:08:58,000
for the key activities.

155
0:08:58.942,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We put out 100 million,

156
0:09:02.242,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we created the Therapeutics Accelerator,

157
0:09:05.331,000 --> 0:09:09,000
there's the period between when we realized it was transmitting

158
0:09:09.887,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and now, where we should have done more.

159
0:09:12.355,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I think the most important thing to discuss today

160
0:09:15.712,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is that in the area of testing,

161
0:09:19.427,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we're still not creating that capacity

162
0:09:24.292,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and applying it to the people most in need.

163
0:09:27.546,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And so we have health workers who are symptomatic,

164
0:09:31.03,000 --> 0:09:33,000
who can't get a test

165
0:09:33.275,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and so they don't know should they go in or not go in,

166
0:09:36.323,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and yet we have lots of tests

167
0:09:37.784,000 --> 0:09:39,000
being given to people who aren't symptomatic.

168
0:09:40.488,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So the testing thing to me,

169
0:09:42.792,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's got to be organized, it's got to be prioritized,

170
0:09:47.738,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that is super, super urgent.

171
0:09:50.683,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The second thing is the isolation

172
0:09:52.714,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that, you know, various parts, just focusing on the US,

173
0:09:56.665,000 --> 0:09:59,000
some parts are doing that in a fairly strong way

174
0:10:00.101,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and other parts not yet,

175
0:10:01.68,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it's very hard to do,

176
0:10:03.934,000 --> 0:10:04,000
it's tough on people,

177
0:10:05.208,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it's disastrous for the economy.

178
0:10:09.903,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But the sooner you do it in a tough way,

179
0:10:14.471,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the sooner you can undo it and go back to normal.

180
0:10:21.533,000 --> 0:10:23,000
CA: So we'll come to the isolation part in a minute,

181
0:10:24.069,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but just sticking with the testing thing,

182
0:10:26.077,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I'm just so confused as to why, with more than a month's notice --

183
0:10:31.411,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I mean, there are so many smart epidemiologists in the US, for example,

184
0:10:35.721,000 --> 0:10:37,000
you plug numbers about infectiousness and fatality

185
0:10:38.646,000 --> 0:10:39,000
into any simulation

186
0:10:39.888,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and you see that if you don't do anything,

187
0:10:41.927,000 --> 0:10:42,000
millions of people will die.

188
0:10:43.641,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And there's a month.

189
0:10:44.839,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So what's your explanation,

190
0:10:48.116,000 --> 0:10:52,000
what do you think happened here as to why there was almost no --

191
0:10:52.322,000 --> 0:10:53,000
a month later,

192
0:10:53.514,000 --> 0:10:55,000
there was no viable test in the US.

193
0:10:56.157,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Was this just government complexity,

194
0:10:59.223,000 --> 0:11:01,000
too many chefs in the kitchen,

195
0:11:01.459,000 --> 0:11:03,000
what on earth happened here?

196
0:11:04.595,000 --> 0:11:08,000
BG: Well, we certainly didn't take advantage of the month of February.

197
0:11:09.333,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The good news is that the actual process,

198
0:11:12.917,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the PCR machines,

199
0:11:16.895,000 --> 0:11:18,000
we have a lot in the United States.

200
0:11:19.736,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And so there's models like South Korea,

201
0:11:22.902,000 --> 0:11:24,000
who took advantage of February,

202
0:11:25.188,000 --> 0:11:27,000
built up the testing capacity,

203
0:11:27.417,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and they were able to contact-trace and their infections have gone down,

204
0:11:32.168,000 --> 0:11:34,000
even without the type of shutdown

205
0:11:34.855,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that, because we're late, we're having to do.

206
0:11:38.141,000 --> 0:11:41,000
One thing that is good news just this week

207
0:11:41.668,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is that people had thought to do this test,

208
0:11:46.133,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that you had to have a nurse or doctor shove a swab way up,

209
0:11:50.673,000 --> 0:11:51,000
all the way to the back of your throat,

210
0:11:52.601,000 --> 0:11:53,000
which hurts a lot,

211
0:11:53.84,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but also, you're going to cough

212
0:11:56.279,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and potentially spread the disease to that health care worker.

213
0:11:59.657,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So they have to have protective equipment

214
0:12:01.681,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and change that.

215
0:12:02.911,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We sent data to the FDA this weekend,

216
0:12:07.276,000 --> 0:12:1,000
showing that just an individual, by themselves,

217
0:12:10.996,000 --> 0:12:12,000
swabbing up to the tip of their nose,

218
0:12:15.397,000 --> 0:12:18,000
the accuracy of that test

219
0:12:18.707,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is essentially the same as having a health care worker do it.

220
0:12:22.358,000 --> 0:12:24,000
That helps a lot.

221
0:12:25.038,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We still have to do other things,

222
0:12:26.657,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but that means that you don't have to change protective equipment,

223
0:12:31.069,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you just hand the patient that swab,

224
0:12:33.673,000 --> 0:12:34,000
they do it, put it in the test tube,

225
0:12:35.569,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and if the capacity is right,

226
0:12:38.482,000 --> 0:12:41,000
within 24 hours, you should get that result back.

227
0:12:42.069,000 --> 0:12:43,000
CA: So how do you see that playing out?

228
0:12:43.975,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Are there people going to massively scale those tests

229
0:12:48.824,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and how will ordinary citizens be able to get hold of them?

230
0:12:54.165,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Does it still have to be kind of prescribed by a doctor at some point,

231
0:12:57.492,000 --> 0:13:01,000
or at some point, will you be able to order them off Amazon or something?

232
0:13:01.966,000 --> 0:13:05,000
BG: Well, it's pretty chaotic today, because the government hasn't stepped in

233
0:13:06.328,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to make sure the testing capacity is both increased

234
0:13:09.466,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and it's used for the right cases.

235
0:13:12.151,000 --> 0:13:15,000
There will be a website --

236
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and if the federal government doesn't do it,

237
0:13:17.831,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a lot of local governments will have to do it --

238
0:13:20.139,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that you go to, you give your situation, including your symptoms,

239
0:13:23.901,000 --> 0:13:27,000
you're told, based on your work and your symptoms,

240
0:13:28.036,000 --> 0:13:29,000
are you a priority.

241
0:13:29.235,000 --> 0:13:33,000
If so, you're told where there are kiosks you can go to

242
0:13:33.839,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and you'll do the self-swab and just hand it over,

243
0:13:37.102,000 --> 0:13:42,000
or eventually, we'll send the kits to you at home,

244
0:13:42.736,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and then you'll send it back and hear that result.

245
0:13:47.331,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Maybe six months from now,

246
0:13:48.688,000 --> 0:13:51,000
you'll actually have a strip where you perform the test in the home,

247
0:13:52.213,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but for now, they're sending it back for the PCR processing.

248
0:13:56.086,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We can have massive capacity there.

249
0:13:59.308,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And that's how you know.

250
0:14:01.927,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The testing is everything,

251
0:14:03.561,000 --> 0:14:07,000
because that's how you know whether you need to do more shutdown

252
0:14:07.609,000 --> 0:14:1,000
or you're starting to get to the point where you can relieve it.

253
0:14:10.665,000 --> 0:14:11,000
CA: Some people are trying to argue now

254
0:14:12.569,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that, almost, the testing should be dialed back,

255
0:14:15.521,000 --> 0:14:17,000
because the cat is out of the bag,

256
0:14:17.609,000 --> 0:14:2,000
testing is bringing people together and risking infection,

257
0:14:20.95,000 --> 0:14:22,000
you know, forget that, let's just focus on treatment

258
0:14:23.601,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and on isolation strategies.

259
0:14:27.101,000 --> 0:14:28,000
You disagree with that.

260
0:14:28.284,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Testing is still absolutely essential and needs to be scaled dramatically.

261
0:14:31.8,000 --> 0:14:33,000
BG: The two that go together are testing,

262
0:14:34.379,000 --> 0:14:35,000
at very high volume,

263
0:14:35.958,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and the isolation piece.

264
0:14:38.228,000 --> 0:14:39,000
If you're a medical worker,

265
0:14:39.998,000 --> 0:14:41,000
you want to stay and do your job.

266
0:14:42.148,000 --> 0:14:46,000
If you're making sure the electricity, water, food

267
0:14:46.347,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is still available,

268
0:14:48.53,000 --> 0:14:49,000
you want to do your job,

269
0:14:49.966,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and so testing is what indicates to you,

270
0:14:54.077,000 --> 0:14:56,000
do you need to go into isolation

271
0:14:56.66,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and make sure you're not the source of spread.

272
0:14:59.482,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And so, you know, testing is the key thing.

273
0:15:05.752,000 --> 0:15:08,000
South Korea did that in this massive way

274
0:15:09.736,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that everybody should learn from.

275
0:15:13.524,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And so that is paired with the isolation piece.

276
0:15:19.405,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Our goal here is to get to the point

277
0:15:22.627,000 --> 0:15:26,000
where a very small percentage of the population is infected.

278
0:15:26.971,000 --> 0:15:3,000
You know, China, only 0.01 percent of the population was infected.

279
0:15:31.773,000 --> 0:15:32,000
If you let it,

280
0:15:32.948,000 --> 0:15:33,000
if you don't do these things,

281
0:15:34.45,000 --> 0:15:37,000
you're going to get the majority of people infected

282
0:15:37.775,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and that huge overload of the medical system.

283
0:15:43.03,000 --> 0:15:46,000
CA: Whitney has some questions from our online audience. Whitney.

284
0:15:47.006,000 --> 0:15:49,000
WPR: Some of the questions that we're seeing

285
0:15:49.141,000 --> 0:15:51,000
are about how our tech giants and leaders

286
0:15:51.49,000 --> 0:15:55,000
can play a role in isolating this and containing this virus.

287
0:15:57.12,000 --> 0:15:58,000
BG: The tech companies are very involved

288
0:15:59.074,000 --> 0:16:01,000
in making sure that some work can go on.

289
0:16:02.482,000 --> 0:16:04,000
People can stay in touch,

290
0:16:04.632,000 --> 0:16:06,000
you know, they can help with some of the disease modeling,

291
0:16:07.387,000 --> 0:16:09,000
they can help with the visibility of the numbers.

292
0:16:09.8,000 --> 0:16:1,000
It's actually very impressive,

293
0:16:11.522,000 --> 0:16:13,000
you get up there and you can see those numbers.

294
0:16:14.244,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Actually, they're sad numbers,

295
0:16:15.76,000 --> 0:16:19,000
but everybody's able to monitor this thing.

296
0:16:19.792,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Back in 1918, they didn't have this type of visibility,

297
0:16:24.473,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and ability to share best practices.

298
0:16:29.805,000 --> 0:16:32,000
But for a lot of people, the isolation is the key thing.

299
0:16:33.306,000 --> 0:16:39,000
CA: Bill, one of the riddles about this isolation strategy

300
0:16:39.395,000 --> 0:16:42,000
is how long it has to last.

301
0:16:43.018,000 --> 0:16:45,000
A lot of people are concerned

302
0:16:45.662,000 --> 0:16:49,000
that the price of victory by isolating everyone

303
0:16:50.212,000 --> 0:16:51,000
is that you crash the economy,

304
0:16:51.689,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and that we have to be, basically,

305
0:16:55.06,000 --> 0:17:,000
at home, not doing our regular jobs for three, six months, maybe all year.

306
0:17:00.972,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And so much so that there's now this big debate in the US

307
0:17:03.712,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and other countries

308
0:17:05.004,000 --> 0:17:07,000
about this may just be the wrong strategy,

309
0:17:07.062,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that we can't crash the economy that badly,

310
0:17:09.395,000 --> 0:17:11,000
we should only isolate for another couple of weeks,

311
0:17:12.022,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and then let people back,

312
0:17:13.538,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and if that means a lot of other people get sick

313
0:17:16.315,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and we eventually build up herd immunity,

314
0:17:18.313,000 --> 0:17:19,000
that may be the right way to go.

315
0:17:20.053,000 --> 0:17:21,000
What's your thought on this,

316
0:17:21.411,000 --> 0:17:23,000
what is the isolation strategy

317
0:17:23.941,000 --> 0:17:26,000
that eventually leads to us getting back to normal?

318
0:17:28.022,000 --> 0:17:32,000
BG: It's very tough to say to people,

319
0:17:32.046,000 --> 0:17:34,000
"Hey, keep going to restaurants,"

320
0:17:34.315,000 --> 0:17:37,000
you know, "Go buy new houses,

321
0:17:37.434,000 --> 0:17:4,000
ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner,

322
0:17:41.157,000 --> 0:17:43,000
just, you know, we want you to keep spending,"

323
0:17:43.388,000 --> 0:17:45,000
because there's some, maybe a politician

324
0:17:46.014,000 --> 0:17:49,000
who thinks GDP growth is what really counts.

325
0:17:49.775,000 --> 0:17:53,000
It's very hard to tell people, when there's an epidemic spreading

326
0:17:53.898,000 --> 0:17:58,000
that threatens, particularly, their parents

327
0:17:58.971,000 --> 0:18:,000
or elderly people that they know,

328
0:18:01.106,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that they should go about things

329
0:18:02.989,000 --> 0:18:05,000
knowing that their activity is spreading this disease.

330
0:18:07.648,000 --> 0:18:11,000
I don't know of any rich countries that have chosen to use that approach.

331
0:18:11.736,000 --> 0:18:13,000
It is true, if you did that approach,

332
0:18:14.444,000 --> 0:18:16,000
over a period of several years,

333
0:18:17.204,000 --> 0:18:2,000
enough people would be infected you'd have what's called herd immunity.

334
0:18:20.567,000 --> 0:18:24,000
But herd immunity is meaningless until you infect over half the population.

335
0:18:25.323,000 --> 0:18:26,000
And so you can take --

336
0:18:26.942,000 --> 0:18:27,000
You'll overload your medical system,

337
0:18:28.728,000 --> 0:18:3,000
so your case fatality rate, instead of being one percent,

338
0:18:31.466,000 --> 0:18:32,000
will be like three, four percent.

339
0:18:34.658,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And so,

340
0:18:36.538,000 --> 0:18:39,000
the idea, it's very irresponsible

341
0:18:40.317,000 --> 0:18:43,000
for somebody to suggest we can have the best of both worlds.

342
0:18:43.46,000 --> 0:18:46,000
What we need is the extreme shutdown

343
0:18:46.84,000 --> 0:18:49,000
so that in six to ten weeks,

344
0:18:49.895,000 --> 0:18:5,000
if things go well,

345
0:18:51.371,000 --> 0:18:53,000
then you can start opening back up.

346
0:18:54.847,000 --> 0:18:57,000
CA: So just putting the math together from what you just said, Bill,

347
0:18:58.102,000 --> 0:18:59,000
to get to herd immunity,

348
0:18:59.372,000 --> 0:19:01,000
you need more than half the people in the country

349
0:19:01.712,000 --> 0:19:02,000
to basically get the bug.

350
0:19:03.149,000 --> 0:19:04,000
So in the case of the US, for example,

351
0:19:05.05,000 --> 0:19:07,000
that would be 150 million people, thereabouts.

352
0:19:07.277,000 --> 0:19:1,000
You said that the fatality rate in that scenario,

353
0:19:10.537,000 --> 0:19:13,000
you're talking about four to five million people

354
0:19:14.386,000 --> 0:19:17,000
potential fatalities.

355
0:19:17.577,000 --> 0:19:21,000
That is just a horrifying scenario that no one should be contemplating.

356
0:19:22.046,000 --> 0:19:24,000
BG: Even one percent of the population getting sick,

357
0:19:24.68,000 --> 0:19:29,000
they will treat, whoever goes for this "ignore the disease" strategy,

358
0:19:30.602,000 --> 0:19:31,000
they will treat them as a pariah state,

359
0:19:32.516,000 --> 0:19:34,000
so none of their people will go in,

360
0:19:35.204,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and none of your people will go into that.

361
0:19:37.974,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And so briefly, a few countries in Europe that hadn't really looked at this hard,

362
0:19:42.531,000 --> 0:19:46,000
considered, "OK, should we be the ones who kind of go about business as usual?"

363
0:19:47.474,000 --> 0:19:5,000
It is tempting, because if you got there early --

364
0:19:50.643,000 --> 0:19:53,000
South Korea did not have to do the extreme shutdown,

365
0:19:53.846,000 --> 0:19:55,000
because they did such a good job on testing.

366
0:19:57.496,000 --> 0:19:58,000
CA: Testing and containment.

367
0:19:58.957,000 --> 0:20:,000
BG: That's why it's so maddening to me

368
0:20:01.09,000 --> 0:20:05,000
that government is not allocating the testing

369
0:20:05.506,000 --> 0:20:08,000
to where it's needed,

370
0:20:09.379,000 --> 0:20:11,000
and maybe that will have to happen at the state level,

371
0:20:11.945,000 --> 0:20:13,000
because it's not happening at the federal level.

372
0:20:14.427,000 --> 0:20:17,000
But there is no middle course on this thing.

373
0:20:19.109,000 --> 0:20:23,000
It is sad that the shutdown will be harder for poorer countries

374
0:20:23.353,000 --> 0:20:25,000
than it is for richer countries.

375
0:20:26.125,000 --> 0:20:28,000
CA: So let's come into that in minute.

376
0:20:28.371,000 --> 0:20:3,000
The one exception I've heard the case made for is Japan,

377
0:20:31.109,000 --> 0:20:35,000
that Japan has not contained it quite in the same way

378
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
that South Korea did

379
0:20:37.061,000 --> 0:20:38,000
but has allowed people to work.

380
0:20:38.584,000 --> 0:20:39,000
It's tried to make extreme measures

381
0:20:40.307,000 --> 0:20:43,000
for protecting their most elderly population.

382
0:20:43.473,000 --> 0:20:48,000
But they've tried to find a middle scenario, haven't they?

383
0:20:50.125,000 --> 0:20:51,000
BG: If you act --

384
0:20:52.879,000 --> 0:20:56,000
When you have hundreds of cases,

385
0:20:57.712,000 --> 0:21:01,000
you may be able to contain it by doing great testing

386
0:21:01.76,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and great contact tracing,

387
0:21:03.942,000 --> 0:21:05,000
and restricting foreigners coming in,

388
0:21:06.601,000 --> 0:21:08,000
without as much damage to your economy.

389
0:21:09.204,000 --> 0:21:15,000
The US is past this opportunity to control without shutdown.

390
0:21:15.871,000 --> 0:21:21,000
So the worst case of what was happening in Wuhan in the beginning

391
0:21:22.61,000 --> 0:21:26,000
or in northern Italy over the last few weeks,

392
0:21:27.098,000 --> 0:21:29,000
that we avoid that.

393
0:21:29.768,000 --> 0:21:35,000
But we did not act fast enough to have an ability to avoid the shutdown.

394
0:21:36.617,000 --> 0:21:39,000
CA: But then what I don't understand, in the case of the US, for example,

395
0:21:40.307,000 --> 0:21:43,000
is that even if we're successful

396
0:21:43.633,000 --> 0:21:46,000
in bending the curve and reducing the number of new cases

397
0:21:47.133,000 --> 0:21:5,000
from a period of extreme shutdown, as it were,

398
0:21:50.461,000 --> 0:21:52,000
no immunity has been built up.

399
0:21:53.391,000 --> 0:21:54,000
Let's say that there's still no vaccine.

400
0:21:55.347,000 --> 0:21:58,000
Surely when you lift restrictions and people start going back to work,

401
0:21:58.98,000 --> 0:22:,000
the whole thing just blows up again.

402
0:22:01.919,000 --> 0:22:07,000
BG: The experience that we're seeing in China and in South Korea

403
0:22:09.934,000 --> 0:22:13,000
is that there are not these people who are asymptomatic

404
0:22:14.212,000 --> 0:22:15,000
that are causing lots of infections.

405
0:22:15.991,000 --> 0:22:16,000
And that's a parameter

406
0:22:17.474,000 --> 0:22:21,000
that, as you build the model, you have to put in.

407
0:22:22.124,000 --> 0:22:25,000
There's an Imperial model that people talk about a lot,

408
0:22:25.369,000 --> 0:22:28,000
which shows that reopening is very hard to do.

409
0:22:29.584,000 --> 0:22:33,000
But the results of that model are not matching what we see in China,

410
0:22:34.17,000 --> 0:22:36,000
and so very likely,

411
0:22:36.645,000 --> 0:22:39,000
there aren't as many of these infecting asymptomatics.

412
0:22:40.403,000 --> 0:22:42,000
And that's why you have to be pragmatic.

413
0:22:42.927,000 --> 0:22:43,000
There's a lot we don't know.

414
0:22:44.331,000 --> 0:22:47,000
For example, seasonality may help us in the Northern Hemisphere,

415
0:22:47.957,000 --> 0:22:49,000
the force of infection will --

416
0:22:50.673,000 --> 0:22:55,000
Respiratory viruses, to some degree, they all are seasonal.

417
0:22:56.667,000 --> 0:22:59,000
We don't know how seasonal this one is,

418
0:23:00.141,000 --> 0:23:03,000
but you know, there's a reasonable chance

419
0:23:03.405,000 --> 0:23:05,000
that the force of infection will be going down.

420
0:23:06.031,000 --> 0:23:09,000
And it's your testing that always is telling you,

421
0:23:09.484,000 --> 0:23:12,000
"Oh, my gosh, do I have to shut down more,

422
0:23:12.831,000 --> 0:23:13,000
or can I start to open up?"

423
0:23:14.182,000 --> 0:23:16,000
So particularly, right as you open up,

424
0:23:16.609,000 --> 0:23:2,000
that testing and contact tracing is saying to you --

425
0:23:20.975,000 --> 0:23:24,000
And you can say I'm more on the optimistic side,

426
0:23:25.228,000 --> 0:23:28,000
that it will be possible to do what China's doing,

427
0:23:28.369,000 --> 0:23:32,000
where they are starting to go back to normal.

428
0:23:33.163,000 --> 0:23:35,000
CA: And help me understand what happened there

429
0:23:35.393,000 --> 0:23:37,000
because it seems kind of miraculous to me,

430
0:23:37.514,000 --> 0:23:39,000
because this virus was exploding,

431
0:23:40.482,000 --> 0:23:46,000
yes, in Wuhan, but people moved from there to many other parts of China.

432
0:23:46.953,000 --> 0:23:47,000
How is it possible

433
0:23:48.335,000 --> 0:23:51,000
that the combination of the shutdown in Wuhan

434
0:23:51.365,000 --> 0:23:52,000
and measures elsewhere

435
0:23:52.818,000 --> 0:23:54,000
seem to have got to the point where there are literally

436
0:23:55.46,000 --> 0:23:56,000
no new cases happening.

437
0:23:57.358,000 --> 0:23:59,000
I mean, to me, that implies that literally,

438
0:23:59.387,000 --> 0:24:05,000
the virus is not circulating at all between humans in China.

439
0:24:06.275,000 --> 0:24:08,000
You know, there's a few tourists coming in who they deal with,

440
0:24:09.236,000 --> 0:24:13,000
but I mean, is that literally your interpretation of what happened,

441
0:24:13.903,000 --> 0:24:15,000
that it's no longer circulating in China?

442
0:24:15.998,000 --> 0:24:16,000
BG: Absolutely.

443
0:24:17.173,000 --> 0:24:19,000
Take a spreadsheet and take a number like four --

444
0:24:19.569,000 --> 0:24:21,000
one person infects four people --

445
0:24:21.696,000 --> 0:24:24,000
and say the cycle is every 10 days.

446
0:24:24.894,000 --> 0:24:28,000
Go through eight of those cycles,

447
0:24:29.125,000 --> 0:24:31,000
and you're getting the big number.

448
0:24:31.76,000 --> 0:24:35,000
You know, start with 10,000 and then,

449
0:24:36.268,000 --> 0:24:37,000
you know, that increase.

450
0:24:37.514,000 --> 0:24:39,000
If you take the number 0.4 instead,

451
0:24:40.252,000 --> 0:24:44,000
that is, the average case infects 0.4 people,

452
0:24:44.928,000 --> 0:24:47,000
then look at what happens to that number as you go out.

453
0:24:48.237,000 --> 0:24:49,000
It drops to zero,

454
0:24:49.844,000 --> 0:24:54,000
and so things that are exponential are very, very dramatic.

455
0:24:55.431,000 --> 0:24:59,000
When they're above one, they are growing rapidly.

456
0:24:59.542,000 --> 0:25:02,000
When they're below one, they are shrinking rapidly.

457
0:25:03.022,000 --> 0:25:06,000
And so the isolation in China

458
0:25:06.101,000 --> 0:25:1,000
drove that reproductive number to well below zero.

459
0:25:10.553,000 --> 0:25:11,000
And so local infection rates --

460
0:25:12.118,000 --> 0:25:13,000
CA: Below one.

461
0:25:14.153,000 --> 0:25:16,000
BG: Below one, sorry.

462
0:25:16.3,000 --> 0:25:21,000
And that quarantine,

463
0:25:21.347,000 --> 0:25:23,000
you know, quarantine comes from "40 days,"

464
0:25:24.108,000 --> 0:25:27,000
which is what they thought would help for black plague,

465
0:25:27.911,000 --> 0:25:28,000
that is our primary technique.

466
0:25:29.831,000 --> 0:25:33,000
Thank God we have testing, if we use it properly.

467
0:25:34.141,000 --> 0:25:36,000
We are doing therapeutics,

468
0:25:36.665,000 --> 0:25:37,000
which will help with the death rate,

469
0:25:38.427,000 --> 0:25:42,000
but in terms of keeping the infections below one percent of the population,

470
0:25:42.601,000 --> 0:25:44,000
it really all depends just on the two things:

471
0:25:45.312,000 --> 0:25:46,000
isolation and testing.

472
0:25:47.498,000 --> 0:25:51,000
CA: So to quote a question from my Twitter feed this morning for you Bill:

473
0:25:51.712,000 --> 0:25:55,000
If you were president for a month in the US,

474
0:25:56.371,000 --> 0:25:59,000
what would be the top two or three things you would do?

475
0:26:00.474,000 --> 0:26:02,000
BG: Well, the clear message

476
0:26:02.752,000 --> 0:26:05,000
that we have no choice to maintain this isolation

477
0:26:06.315,000 --> 0:26:11,000
and that's going to keep going for a period of time,

478
0:26:11.355,000 --> 0:26:15,000
you know, probably in the Chinese case, it was like six weeks,

479
0:26:15.95,000 --> 0:26:16,000
so we have to prepare ourselves for that,

480
0:26:17.95,000 --> 0:26:18,000
and do it very well.

481
0:26:19.309,000 --> 0:26:21,000
And then use the testing

482
0:26:22.228,000 --> 0:26:25,000
and every week, talk about what's going on with that.

483
0:26:26.117,000 --> 0:26:3,000
If you're doing isolation well, within about 20 days,

484
0:26:30.739,000 --> 0:26:33,000
you'll see those numbers really change,

485
0:26:33.903,000 --> 0:26:35,000
you know, instead of this, you'll see this,

486
0:26:36.814,000 --> 0:26:39,000
and that is a sign that you're on your way.

487
0:26:39.877,000 --> 0:26:43,000
Now, you have to stay to get more generations

488
0:26:44.261,000 --> 0:26:48,000
that are 0.4 infections per previous infection.

489
0:26:48.756,000 --> 0:26:5,000
You have to maintain it for a number of weeks there.

490
0:26:51.725,000 --> 0:26:52,000
And you know,

491
0:26:52.913,000 --> 0:26:54,000
so this is not going to be easy.

492
0:26:55.494,000 --> 0:26:57,000
We need a clear message about that.

493
0:26:57.91,000 --> 0:27:,000
It is really tragic that the economic effects of this

494
0:27:01.077,000 --> 0:27:02,000
are very dramatic.

495
0:27:02.657,000 --> 0:27:05,000
I mean, nothing like this has ever happened to the economy

496
0:27:06.419,000 --> 0:27:08,000
in our lifetimes.

497
0:27:09.026,000 --> 0:27:12,000
But bringing the economy back and doing money,

498
0:27:12.677,000 --> 0:27:18,000
that's more of a reversible thing than bringing people back to life.

499
0:27:19.059,000 --> 0:27:23,000
And so, we're going to take the pain in the economic dimension,

500
0:27:23.45,000 --> 0:27:24,000
huge pain,

501
0:27:24.805,000 --> 0:27:28,000
in order to minimize the pain in the disease and death dimension.

502
0:27:30.53,000 --> 0:27:31,000
CA: Whitney.

503
0:27:32.38,000 --> 0:27:34,000
WPR: We have a lot of other questions coming in.

504
0:27:34.657,000 --> 0:27:35,000
One that we've been seeing

505
0:27:36.3,000 --> 0:27:38,000
is a question about what tools are available for countries

506
0:27:39.293,000 --> 0:27:42,000
that maybe don't have the luxury of being able to social-distance,

507
0:27:43.061,000 --> 0:27:45,000
don't have great health systems in place,

508
0:27:45.601,000 --> 0:27:47,000
how should they be handling this virus?

509
0:27:49.212,000 --> 0:27:51,000
BG: Yeah, I would say,

510
0:27:51.855,000 --> 0:27:53,000
if the rich countries really do their job well,

511
0:27:54.419,000 --> 0:27:59,000
by the summer, they'll be like China is,

512
0:28:00.284,000 --> 0:28:03,000
or some of the other countries that responded early.

513
0:28:03.569,000 --> 0:28:06,000
But in the developing countries,

514
0:28:06.617,000 --> 0:28:07,000
particularly in the Southern Hemisphere,

515
0:28:08.561,000 --> 0:28:1,000
the seasonality is large.

516
0:28:11.585,000 --> 0:28:14,000
As you say, the ability to isolate,

517
0:28:14.887,000 --> 0:28:17,000
you know, when you go out to get your food every day,

518
0:28:18.8,000 --> 0:28:19,000
you have to earn your wage,

519
0:28:20.307,000 --> 0:28:23,000
when you live in a slum or you're very nearby each other,

520
0:28:23.423,000 --> 0:28:25,000
it's very hard to do,

521
0:28:25.569,000 --> 0:28:28,000
as you move down the income ladder,

522
0:28:28.76,000 --> 0:28:32,000
than it is for a country like the United States.

523
0:28:33.038,000 --> 0:28:36,000
And so we should all accelerate the vaccine,

524
0:28:36.577,000 --> 0:28:38,000
which eventually will come,

525
0:28:39.162,000 --> 0:28:41,000
and you know, people are being responsible to say

526
0:28:41.49,000 --> 0:28:45,000
that that's going to take 18 months.

527
0:28:45.531,000 --> 0:28:48,000
And there's a lot of those being pursued.

528
0:28:49.864,000 --> 0:28:51,000
I'm talking a lot with Seth Berkley,

529
0:28:51.952,000 --> 0:28:53,000
who you're going to have later this week,

530
0:28:54.714,000 --> 0:28:58,000
who can talk a lot about the vaccine front,

531
0:28:58.77,000 --> 0:29:01,000
because he's definitely at the center of that,

532
0:29:02.095,000 --> 0:29:04,000
being the head of GAVI.

533
0:29:04.325,000 --> 0:29:09,000
We do need to get really cheap testing out to these countries,

534
0:29:09.403,000 --> 0:29:1,000
and we need to get therapeutics

535
0:29:10.998,000 --> 0:29:13,000
so you don't need to put five percent of people on respirators.

536
0:29:14.204,000 --> 0:29:15,000
Because even if they had the equipment,

537
0:29:16.11,000 --> 0:29:17,000
they don't have the personnel,

538
0:29:17.577,000 --> 0:29:2,000
they just don't have the beds, the capacity.

539
0:29:20.839,000 --> 0:29:24,000
And so the only good news is that the rich countries have this

540
0:29:25.236,000 --> 0:29:3,000
and so they will be learning about testing, therapeutics,

541
0:29:30.8,000 --> 0:29:33,000
and funding the vaccines for the entire world,

542
0:29:33.999,000 --> 0:29:37,000
to try and minimize the damage in developing countries.

543
0:29:40.209,000 --> 0:29:42,000
WPR: Great, I'll be back later with more questions.

544
0:29:42.962,000 --> 0:29:44,000
CA: Bill, you mentioned therapeutics there.

545
0:29:45.899,000 --> 0:29:47,000
What is looking promising,

546
0:29:48.62,000 --> 0:29:5,000
is anything looking promising?

547
0:29:51.149,000 --> 0:29:54,000
BG: Yeah, so there's quite a range of things going on.

548
0:29:55.601,000 --> 0:29:57,000
There's a few that get mentioned a lot,

549
0:29:58.438,000 --> 0:30:02,000
remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,

550
0:30:02.704,000 --> 0:30:04,000
and the data is still a bit confusing,

551
0:30:05.077,000 --> 0:30:07,000
but there's some positive data on those.

552
0:30:08.061,000 --> 0:30:12,000
Remdesivir is a five-day IV infusion,

553
0:30:12.292,000 --> 0:30:14,000
and actually kind of hard to manufacture,

554
0:30:14.755,000 --> 0:30:16,000
so people are looking at how that can be improved.

555
0:30:19.147,000 --> 0:30:21,000
The hydroxychloroquine looks like it works, somewhat,

556
0:30:21.865,000 --> 0:30:22,000
if you get in early.

557
0:30:23.242,000 --> 0:30:27,000
There's a huge list of compounds, including antibodies,

558
0:30:27.425,000 --> 0:30:28,000
antiviral drugs,

559
0:30:29.117,000 --> 0:30:33,000
and so the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust,

560
0:30:33.942,000 --> 0:30:35,000
with support from Mastercard and now others,

561
0:30:36.387,000 --> 0:30:4,000
created this therapeutics accelerator to really triage out.

562
0:30:41.332,000 --> 0:30:44,000
You have hundreds of people showing up and saying, try this, try that.

563
0:30:44.905,000 --> 0:30:47,000
So we look at lab assays, animal models,

564
0:30:48.07,000 --> 0:30:51,000
and so we understand which things should be prioritized

565
0:30:51.221,000 --> 0:30:53,000
for these very quick human trials

566
0:30:53.895,000 --> 0:30:54,000
that need to be done all over the world.

567
0:30:55.84,000 --> 0:31:,000
So the coordination on that is very complex, globally.

568
0:31:01.54,000 --> 0:31:05,000
But I think, you know, out of the top 20 or so candidates,

569
0:31:05.96,000 --> 0:31:08,000
probably three or four of them will work out,

570
0:31:09.135,000 --> 0:31:11,000
you know, at different stages of the disease,

571
0:31:11.436,000 --> 0:31:14,000
to reduce the respiratory distress.

572
0:31:15.45,000 --> 0:31:17,000
CA: I heard you mentioned that one possibility

573
0:31:17.641,000 --> 0:31:21,000
might be treatments from the serum, the blood serum,

574
0:31:21.688,000 --> 0:31:25,000
of people who had had the disease and recovered.

575
0:31:25.798,000 --> 0:31:26,000
So I guess they're carrying antibodies.

576
0:31:27.72,000 --> 0:31:29,000
Talk a bit about that, how that could work

577
0:31:29.808,000 --> 0:31:31,000
and what it would take to accelerate that.

578
0:31:33.337,000 --> 0:31:37,000
BG: Yeah, this has always been discussed as how could you pull that off.

579
0:31:38.123,000 --> 0:31:41,000
So people who are recovered,

580
0:31:41.916,000 --> 0:31:42,000
it appears,

581
0:31:43.091,000 --> 0:31:46,000
have really effective antibodies in their blood.

582
0:31:46.903,000 --> 0:31:47,000
So you could go,

583
0:31:48.434,000 --> 0:31:54,000
transfuse them and only take out the white cells, the immune cells.

584
0:31:54.665,000 --> 0:31:55,000
And then the question is,

585
0:31:55.991,000 --> 0:31:58,000
OK, how many patients' worth of material could you get?

586
0:31:59.824,000 --> 0:32:01,000
You know, if you have that recovered person come in,

587
0:32:02.302,000 --> 0:32:03,000
say, once a week,

588
0:32:03.845,000 --> 0:32:06,000
do you get enough for two people or five people?

589
0:32:07.046,000 --> 0:32:12,000
Then logistically, you have to take that and get it to where that need is.

590
0:32:12.744,000 --> 0:32:15,000
And so it's fairly complicated,

591
0:32:15.807,000 --> 0:32:18,000
you know, compared to a drug that we can make in high volume.

592
0:32:19.673,000 --> 0:32:23,000
You know, the cost of taking it out and putting it back in

593
0:32:24.365,000 --> 0:32:26,000
probably doesn't scale as well.

594
0:32:27.182,000 --> 0:32:3,000
But there is work being done on this.

595
0:32:30.833,000 --> 0:32:31,000
You know, we actually started with Ebola,

596
0:32:32.847,000 --> 0:32:37,000
and fortunately, it got done before it was needed.

597
0:32:39.059,000 --> 0:32:41,000
So that is being pursued

598
0:32:41.68,000 --> 0:32:43,000
and it will work to some degree,

599
0:32:43.974,000 --> 0:32:46,000
but it will be hard to scale the numbers.

600
0:32:48.372,000 --> 0:32:49,000
CA: So it's almost like,

601
0:32:49.997,000 --> 0:32:51,000
when you talk about the need to accelerate testing,

602
0:32:52.419,000 --> 0:32:54,000
the immediate need is for testing for the virus.

603
0:32:55.372,000 --> 0:32:57,000
But is it possible that in a few months' time,

604
0:32:57.594,000 --> 0:33:,000
there's going to be this growing need to test for these antibodies in people,

605
0:33:01.276,000 --> 0:33:04,000
i.e. to see if someone had the disease and recovered,

606
0:33:04.578,000 --> 0:33:06,000
maybe they didn't even know they had it.

607
0:33:06.61,000 --> 0:33:1,000
Because you could picture this growing worldwide force of heroes --

608
0:33:10.967,000 --> 0:33:11,000
let's call them heroes --

609
0:33:12.249,000 --> 0:33:14,000
who have been through this experience

610
0:33:14.276,000 --> 0:33:15,000
and have a lot to offer the world.

611
0:33:15.934,000 --> 0:33:18,000
Maybe they can offer blood donation, serum donation.

612
0:33:19.719,000 --> 0:33:2,000
But also other tasks,

613
0:33:21.037,000 --> 0:33:23,000
like, if you've got overwhelmed health care systems,

614
0:33:23.854,000 --> 0:33:26,000
presumably, there are kind of community health worker type tasks

615
0:33:27.577,000 --> 0:33:3,000
that people could be trained to do to relieve the pressure there,

616
0:33:30.673,000 --> 0:33:32,000
if we knew that they were effectively immune?

617
0:33:33.633,000 --> 0:33:34,000
BG: Yes.

618
0:33:34.808,000 --> 0:33:37,000
Until we came up with the self-swab

619
0:33:38.323,000 --> 0:33:4,000
and showed FDA that that's equivalent,

620
0:33:40.958,000 --> 0:33:43,000
we were thinking that people who might be able to man those kiosks

621
0:33:44.331,000 --> 0:33:45,000
would be the recovered patients.

622
0:33:46.203,000 --> 0:33:48,000
Now we don't want to have a lot of recovered people, you know.

623
0:33:49.139,000 --> 0:33:52,000
To be clear, we're trying, through the shutdown,

624
0:33:53.088,000 --> 0:33:54,000
in the United States,

625
0:33:54.48,000 --> 0:33:58,000
to not get to one percent of the population infected.

626
0:33:58.716,000 --> 0:33:59,000
We're well below that today,

627
0:34:00.239,000 --> 0:34:06,000
but with exponentiation, you could get past that three million.

628
0:34:06.802,000 --> 0:34:09,000
I believe we will be able to avoid that

629
0:34:10.149,000 --> 0:34:13,000
with having this economic pain.

630
0:34:14.184,000 --> 0:34:15,000
Eventually, what we'll have to have

631
0:34:15.922,000 --> 0:34:17,000
is certificates of who is a recovered person,

632
0:34:18.64,000 --> 0:34:19,000
who is a vaccinated person,

633
0:34:20.2,000 --> 0:34:23,000
because you don't want people moving around the world --

634
0:34:23.667,000 --> 0:34:26,000
where you'll have some countries that won't have it under control, sadly --

635
0:34:27.667,000 --> 0:34:29,000
you don't want to completely block off

636
0:34:30.485,000 --> 0:34:35,000
the ability for those people to go there and come back and move around.

637
0:34:35.628,000 --> 0:34:38,000
CA: Bill, is your foundation helping to accelerate the manufacture

638
0:34:38.89,000 --> 0:34:39,000
of these self tests?

639
0:34:40.193,000 --> 0:34:42,000
What are the prospects for really seeing scale

640
0:34:42.398,000 --> 0:34:43,000
on some of this testing soon,

641
0:34:43.952,000 --> 0:34:45,000
not just in the US, but globally?

642
0:34:46.741,000 --> 0:34:47,000
BG: Yeah, our foundation,

643
0:34:47.988,000 --> 0:34:49,000
we'd been funding the thing called the Flu Study

644
0:34:50.313,000 --> 0:34:53,000
to really understand how respiratory viruses spread.

645
0:34:53.338,000 --> 0:34:58,000
It's amazing how little was understood about how important schools are,

646
0:34:58.95,000 --> 0:35:,000
different age groups, different types of interaction.

647
0:35:02.046,000 --> 0:35:03,000
And that gave us an experience.

648
0:35:03.839,000 --> 0:35:04,000
In fact, that flu study

649
0:35:05.623,000 --> 0:35:08,000
actually was the first time coronavirus was found in the community,

650
0:35:09.48,000 --> 0:35:1,000
because the government was still saying

651
0:35:11.362,000 --> 0:35:13,000
you only test people who'd come from China,

652
0:35:13.56,000 --> 0:35:16,000
but we ran into people who had coronavirus,

653
0:35:17.253,000 --> 0:35:19,000
who hadn't been travelers.

654
0:35:19.609,000 --> 0:35:21,000
So, that was like an early warning sign,

655
0:35:22.319,000 --> 0:35:26,000
even though the regulation said you weren't supposed to even look at that.

656
0:35:27.117,000 --> 0:35:33,000
So yeah, the Foundation is working with all the private sector people,

657
0:35:33.773,000 --> 0:35:35,000
the diagnostics people on this testing piece.

658
0:35:37.035,000 --> 0:35:41,000
Now that we can do the self-swab,

659
0:35:41.333,000 --> 0:35:43,000
those swabs are very easy to manufacture.

660
0:35:44.142,000 --> 0:35:46,000
The one where you had to jam it into the throat,

661
0:35:46.873,000 --> 0:35:47,000
deep turbinate,

662
0:35:48.048,000 --> 0:35:5,000
that was getting into short supply.

663
0:35:50.888,000 --> 0:35:53,000
So the swab should not be limiting,

664
0:35:54.011,000 --> 0:35:59,000
neither should the various chemicals that help run the PCR machines.

665
0:35:59.567,000 --> 0:36:,000
So we should be able

666
0:36:01.512,000 --> 0:36:04,000
to get to a South Korea-type prioritized testing thing

667
0:36:05.446,000 --> 0:36:06,000
within a few weeks.

668
0:36:07.49,000 --> 0:36:11,000
CA: How important is it that the world's nations

669
0:36:11.579,000 --> 0:36:12,000
collaborate right now?

670
0:36:12.95,000 --> 0:36:14,000
I mean, it seems like, you know,

671
0:36:15.331,000 --> 0:36:17,000
here's this common enemy facing humanity,

672
0:36:18.062,000 --> 0:36:2,000
it does not know that it just crossed a border,

673
0:36:20.308,000 --> 0:36:22,000
it does not know what race people are,

674
0:36:22.339,000 --> 0:36:23,000
what religion they are --

675
0:36:23.585,000 --> 0:36:24,000
it just knows, "Here's a human,

676
0:36:25.12,000 --> 0:36:31,000
I've got a manufacturing machine here that can make me famous."

677
0:36:31.307,000 --> 0:36:32,000
And it goes to work.

678
0:36:32.927,000 --> 0:36:34,000
It's so terrifying to me to see

679
0:36:35.687,000 --> 0:36:37,000
signs of countries starting to blame each other

680
0:36:38.667,000 --> 0:36:42,000
or the xenophobia, it just seems so toxic.

681
0:36:43.187,000 --> 0:36:45,000
What's your take on this, Bill?

682
0:36:45.902,000 --> 0:36:48,000
Do you see signs of cooperation happening,

683
0:36:49.015,000 --> 0:36:55,000
or are you also worried about the sort of, "US versus China" kind of thing

684
0:36:55.262,000 --> 0:36:57,000
that seems to be going on if we're not careful?

685
0:36:58.085,000 --> 0:36:59,000
BG: Well, I see both.

686
0:36:59.444,000 --> 0:37:04,000
I see that countries that are recovered

687
0:37:04.553,000 --> 0:37:05,000
can help other countries.

688
0:37:07.363,000 --> 0:37:1,000
And that's fantastic.

689
0:37:10.95,000 --> 0:37:13,000
If by the summer, we've knocked this thing down,

690
0:37:14.533,000 --> 0:37:16,000
then great, we can help other countries.

691
0:37:17.263,000 --> 0:37:19,000
There are vaccine projects all over the world,

692
0:37:19.787,000 --> 0:37:22,000
and those should be evaluated on a very neutral basis,

693
0:37:23.49,000 --> 0:37:26,000
to which one is the best to help humanity.

694
0:37:27.173,000 --> 0:37:31,000
And make sure the manufacturing capacity isn't just for rich countries,

695
0:37:31.315,000 --> 0:37:35,000
that it's scaled up, very low cost stuff for the entire world,

696
0:37:35.601,000 --> 0:37:4,000
and that's the spirit of GAVI, is getting vaccines out to every person.

697
0:37:40.708,000 --> 0:37:44,000
So in the science side, and data-sharing side,

698
0:37:45.621,000 --> 0:37:47,000
you see this great cooperation going on.

699
0:37:48.883,000 --> 0:37:49,000
Unfortunately, whenever you have disease,

700
0:37:50.879,000 --> 0:37:54,000
this sense of other and foreign and "Oh, stay away from me,"

701
0:37:55.776,000 --> 0:37:59,000
you know, that sort of pulling inward is reinforced.

702
0:37:59.958,000 --> 0:38:,000
And we have to avoid that.

703
0:38:02.752,000 --> 0:38:05,000
You know, ironically, we have to isolate physically,

704
0:38:06.554,000 --> 0:38:11,000
while in terms of looking at community groups

705
0:38:11.934,000 --> 0:38:15,000
that are pooling resources to help make sure food gets to everyone

706
0:38:16.387,000 --> 0:38:17,000
and help assure medical care,

707
0:38:18.403,000 --> 0:38:22,000
you know, if older people need to be moved out of common facilities,

708
0:38:22.918,000 --> 0:38:23,000
you help out with that,

709
0:38:24.125,000 --> 0:38:28,000
and that people aren't suffering too much from the psychology of isolation.

710
0:38:28.975,000 --> 0:38:31,000
So our generosity has to go up towards others

711
0:38:32.053,000 --> 0:38:38,000
at the same time we're less actually physically interacting with other people.

712
0:38:39.005,000 --> 0:38:43,000
CA: I mean, thinking about the situation in many developing countries,

713
0:38:43.045,000 --> 0:38:44,000
I'm curious how you think of this.

714
0:38:44.878,000 --> 0:38:47,000
You mentioned, first of all, that seasonality may help,

715
0:38:47.982,000 --> 0:38:48,000
i.e. high temperatures.

716
0:38:49.331,000 --> 0:38:53,000
Is it possible that that is so far protecting, to some extent,

717
0:38:53.632,000 --> 0:38:56,000
places like India or sub-Saharan Africa and so forth?

718
0:38:57.53,000 --> 0:38:59,000
BG: India's Northern Hemisphere.

719
0:38:59.744,000 --> 0:39:02,000
So Southern Hemisphere is lots of Africa, South America,

720
0:39:03.399,000 --> 0:39:05,000
Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia.

721
0:39:05.927,000 --> 0:39:06,000
And it is true,

722
0:39:07.806,000 --> 0:39:11,000
either the force of the infection is lower there

723
0:39:11.947,000 --> 0:39:13,000
or we're just not seeing it with testing.

724
0:39:14.036,000 --> 0:39:17,000
You know, a few months from now, we'll understand the seasonality question,

725
0:39:18.006,000 --> 0:39:2,000
which would be good news for the Northern Hemisphere,

726
0:39:21.013,000 --> 0:39:23,000
and somewhat bad news for the Southern Hemisphere.

727
0:39:23.958,000 --> 0:39:25,000
Now more people live in the Northern Hemisphere,

728
0:39:26.323,000 --> 0:39:28,000
including India, Pakistan,

729
0:39:29.03,000 --> 0:39:31,000
and that would buy us some time, and time is a big deal,

730
0:39:31.765,000 --> 0:39:36,000
because all these tools get so much better

731
0:39:36.832,000 --> 0:39:38,000
if you had to go into a second season with it.

732
0:39:39.444,000 --> 0:39:4,000
But yeah, sadly,

733
0:39:41.015,000 --> 0:39:43,000
we could see, in the next few months,

734
0:39:43.34,000 --> 0:39:49,000
as the Southern Hemisphere is moving into its fall and then winter,

735
0:39:49.765,000 --> 0:39:5,000
we could see a big increase there,

736
0:39:51.416,000 --> 0:39:53,000
and that is going to be very difficult.

737
0:39:54.408,000 --> 0:39:56,000
Now they don't have as many older people,

738
0:39:56.743,000 --> 0:40:,000
but they have lots of people who are HIV positive,

739
0:40:01.165,000 --> 0:40:05,000
or have malnutrition or various lung challenges

740
0:40:05.793,000 --> 0:40:06,000
because of indoor smoke,

741
0:40:07.015,000 --> 0:40:09,000
and so the wild card

742
0:40:09.419,000 --> 0:40:12,000
is how well can the developing countries deal with this.

743
0:40:13.507,000 --> 0:40:16,000
CA: If you're in a country where the majority of your population

744
0:40:16.639,000 --> 0:40:19,000
is making less than two or three dollars a day,

745
0:40:19.673,000 --> 0:40:21,000
can you even afford a strategy that looks like, basically,

746
0:40:22.442,000 --> 0:40:23,000
shutting down the economy?

747
0:40:24.11,000 --> 0:40:31,000
BG: I'm very worried that there will be a massive number of deaths

748
0:40:31.134,000 --> 0:40:32,000
in those poorer countries,

749
0:40:32.682,000 --> 0:40:35,000
because the health systems just aren't --

750
0:40:35.936,000 --> 0:40:37,000
you know, the number of respirators, hospitals,

751
0:40:38.776,000 --> 0:40:4,000
and of course, when you overload that system,

752
0:40:40.911,000 --> 0:40:42,000
your deaths are not just COVID deaths,

753
0:40:43.323,000 --> 0:40:48,000
but everyone else who's trying to access a system that will be somewhat in chaos,

754
0:40:48.357,000 --> 0:40:51,000
including with health workers who are getting sick.

755
0:40:52.438,000 --> 0:40:54,000
CA: OK, we're getting near to running out of time with this.

756
0:40:55.296,000 --> 0:40:58,000
Whitney, maybe a last question or two from online.

757
0:40:58.398,000 --> 0:40:59,000
WPR: Sure, we have two from online,

758
0:41:00.097,000 --> 0:41:02,000
we're seeing thousands of questions around these same lines.

759
0:41:02.982,000 --> 0:41:04,000
One, there's lots of people who are really interested to hear

760
0:41:05.879,000 --> 0:41:07,000
about the kind of work that you're doing with your foundation

761
0:41:08.792,000 --> 0:41:11,000
as far as distributing tests, but also producing safety gear,

762
0:41:12.318,000 --> 0:41:13,000
masks and that sort of thing,

763
0:41:14.047,000 --> 0:41:16,000
to help with this effort for health workers.

764
0:41:17.087,000 --> 0:41:19,000
BG: So the Gates Foundation,

765
0:41:19.46,000 --> 0:41:22,000
you know, we, very early on,

766
0:41:22.929,000 --> 0:41:26,000
gave out 100 million to help out with all the pieces:

767
0:41:26.974,000 --> 0:41:29,000
the testing piece, the therapeutics and the vaccines.

768
0:41:30.942,000 --> 0:41:34,000
We are not experts in making masks and ventilators and gowns,

769
0:41:35.328,000 --> 0:41:39,000
and it's great that other people, including some 3D printing,

770
0:41:39.709,000 --> 0:41:41,000
and open-source things, that is great.

771
0:41:42.375,000 --> 0:41:46,000
Our focus, you know, like this self-swab thing,

772
0:41:47.261,000 --> 0:41:48,000
nobody had done that before,

773
0:41:48.999,000 --> 0:41:49,000
people thought it wouldn't work,

774
0:41:50.888,000 --> 0:41:51,000
we were quite sure it would work.

775
0:41:52.484,000 --> 0:41:55,000
And so that, for the globe, is a huge thing.

776
0:41:55.523,000 --> 0:41:57,000
We work a lot with both governments and private sector,

777
0:41:58.125,000 --> 0:42:,000
so in some ways, we're kind of a bridge.

778
0:42:01.03,000 --> 0:42:04,000
And we've been talking to the heads of the pharmaceutical companies,

779
0:42:04.308,000 --> 0:42:05,000
the testing companies

780
0:42:05.919,000 --> 0:42:07,000
and, specifically, with the ones doing vaccines,

781
0:42:08.339,000 --> 0:42:12,000
including some of which are these new type of vaccines, RNA vaccines,

782
0:42:12.663,000 --> 0:42:15,000
that we've been backing for quite some time,

783
0:42:16.339,000 --> 0:42:17,000
and CEPI has been backing.

784
0:42:17.744,000 --> 0:42:2,000
And so our expertise is in those medical tools

785
0:42:21.747,000 --> 0:42:24,000
and really getting the best of the private sector engaged there.

786
0:42:25.768,000 --> 0:42:26,000
It's been a little slow.

787
0:42:26.966,000 --> 0:42:28,000
We can write checks right away,

788
0:42:29.364,000 --> 0:42:3,000
whereas the government processes,

789
0:42:30.978,000 --> 0:42:32,000
even in this situation --

790
0:42:33.371,000 --> 0:42:35,000
you know, there's still this notion of bidding,

791
0:42:35.609,000 --> 0:42:39,000
and not really knowing who has the unique capabilities of doing things,

792
0:42:40.097,000 --> 0:42:44,000
and so, an organization that's working on this all the time,

793
0:42:44.494,000 --> 0:42:45,000
lots of new vaccines,

794
0:42:46.169,000 --> 0:42:48,000
can step in and be helpful.

795
0:42:48.427,000 --> 0:42:49,000
And it's really amazing.

796
0:42:49.744,000 --> 0:42:51,000
When we talk to private-sector partners,

797
0:42:51.784,000 --> 0:42:57,000
their interest in helping out has been absolutely fantastic.

798
0:42:58.439,000 --> 0:43:01,000
And so that's where we have a unique role.

799
0:43:02.281,000 --> 0:43:04,000
WPR: And the other question that we're seeing a ton of --

800
0:43:05.034,000 --> 0:43:06,000
before we wrap up here --

801
0:43:06.654,000 --> 0:43:09,000
is just people are really interested in your insight, Bill,

802
0:43:09.715,000 --> 0:43:11,000
on whether you think we are heading in the right direction,

803
0:43:12.516,000 --> 0:43:14,000
do you feel like our economy is heading in the right place,

804
0:43:15.35,000 --> 0:43:17,000
that humanity is heading in the right place,

805
0:43:17.453,000 --> 0:43:18,000
are we in a better position now

806
0:43:19.117,000 --> 0:43:21,000
than you thought we were in five years ago?

807
0:43:22.911,000 --> 0:43:23,000
BG: Well, five years ago,

808
0:43:24.384,000 --> 0:43:27,000
I said that pandemic

809
0:43:28.124,000 --> 0:43:33,000
is this unaddressed, very, very scary thing.

810
0:43:33.823,000 --> 0:43:38,000
And that if we did the right things, we could be more prepared.

811
0:43:38.903,000 --> 0:43:39,000
Science is on our side.

812
0:43:40.665,000 --> 0:43:45,000
The fact we can be ready for the next epidemic,

813
0:43:46.526,000 --> 0:43:48,000
it's very clear how to do that.

814
0:43:49.343,000 --> 0:43:51,000
And yes, it will take tens of billions,

815
0:43:51.421,000 --> 0:43:54,000
but not hundreds or trillions of dollars.

816
0:43:54.646,000 --> 0:43:58,000
So it will be tiny compared to the economic cost.

817
0:43:58.712,000 --> 0:44:,000
I remember when I did that presentation 2015,

818
0:44:01.016,000 --> 0:44:05,000
I put up, "Hey, a big flu epidemic could cost four trillion,"

819
0:44:05.383,000 --> 0:44:06,000
and I thought, wow, that's a big number,

820
0:44:07.336,000 --> 0:44:08,000
do I really think it's that big?

821
0:44:09.256,000 --> 0:44:12,000
And I went and looked up numbers and thought, yeah, well, that's big.

822
0:44:12.577,000 --> 0:44:18,000
This epidemic will cost that much to the economy.

823
0:44:18.601,000 --> 0:44:2,000
So in the short run,

824
0:44:21.387,000 --> 0:44:24,000
we are going to have more pain and more difficulty

825
0:44:24.779,000 --> 0:44:27,000
and people are going to have to step up to help each other.

826
0:44:28.154,000 --> 0:44:3,000
I'm still very much an optimist, you know,

827
0:44:30.377,000 --> 0:44:33,000
whether it's climate change, countries working together,

828
0:44:33.868,000 --> 0:44:38,000
biology taking the diseases, malaria, TB,

829
0:44:39.57,000 --> 0:44:42,000
you know, even advances for what are more rich-world diseases,

830
0:44:43.066,000 --> 0:44:44,000
like cancer.

831
0:44:44.245,000 --> 0:44:45,000
The amount of innovation,

832
0:44:45.546,000 --> 0:44:47,000
the way we can connect up and work together --

833
0:44:47.982,000 --> 0:44:5,000
yes, I'm superpositive about that.

834
0:44:51.395,000 --> 0:44:52,000
You know, I love my work

835
0:44:52.734,000 --> 0:44:55,000
because I see progress on all these diseases all the time.

836
0:44:56.475,000 --> 0:45:,000
Now we have to turn and focus on this, you know.

837
0:45:01.134,000 --> 0:45:02,000
Sadly, it may interrupt

838
0:45:02.768,000 --> 0:45:04,000
and the polio situation might get worse a little bit

839
0:45:05.498,000 --> 0:45:07,000
because of the distraction here.

840
0:45:08.427,000 --> 0:45:1,000
We're using a lot of the great capacity

841
0:45:10.744,000 --> 0:45:13,000
that was built up for those polio activities

842
0:45:13.8,000 --> 0:45:16,000
to try and help the developing countries respond to this very well.

843
0:45:17.22,000 --> 0:45:18,000
And that is appropriate,

844
0:45:18.918,000 --> 0:45:2,000
but the message from me,

845
0:45:20.996,000 --> 0:45:24,000
although it's very sober when we're dealing with this epidemic,

846
0:45:25.908,000 --> 0:45:3,000
you know, I'm very positive that this should draw us together.

847
0:45:31.815,000 --> 0:45:34,000
We will get out of this,

848
0:45:35.283,000 --> 0:45:39,000
and then, we will get ready for the next epidemic.

849
0:45:40.887,000 --> 0:45:42,000
CA: That's exactly what I was going to ask you, Bill,

850
0:45:43.466,000 --> 0:45:47,000
which is, where is your head, do you think we will get through this?

851
0:45:48.26,000 --> 0:45:51,000
Will the leaders that matter listen to the scientists,

852
0:45:52.13,000 --> 0:45:53,000
will they?

853
0:45:53.305,000 --> 0:45:54,000
Will we make it through?

854
0:45:54.577,000 --> 0:45:56,000
Do you believe that within a few months' time,

855
0:45:56.776,000 --> 0:45:58,000
we're already going to be looking back and saying,

856
0:45:59.149,000 --> 0:46:01,000
"Phew, we dodged a pretty bad one there."

857
0:46:01.506,000 --> 0:46:03,000
BG: We can't say for sure

858
0:46:04.387,000 --> 0:46:06,000
that even the rich countries will be out of this

859
0:46:07.053,000 --> 0:46:08,000
in six to ten weeks.

860
0:46:08.807,000 --> 0:46:09,000
I think that's likely,

861
0:46:10.411,000 --> 0:46:12,000
but as we get the testing data,

862
0:46:12.815,000 --> 0:46:13,000
we'll get more of a sense of that

863
0:46:14.577,000 --> 0:46:16,000
and people will continuously be able to see that.

864
0:46:17.737,000 --> 0:46:2,000
But you know, the rich countries will get out of this.

865
0:46:21.444,000 --> 0:46:23,000
The developing countries will bear a significant price,

866
0:46:24.372,000 --> 0:46:26,000
but even they, we will get a vaccine

867
0:46:27.173,000 --> 0:46:3,000
and GAVI will get that out to everyone.

868
0:46:31.111,000 --> 0:46:34,000
So you know, two to three years from now,

869
0:46:34.52,000 --> 0:46:36,000
this thing, even on a global basis,

870
0:46:37.299,000 --> 0:46:41,000
will essentially be over with a gigantic price tag.

871
0:46:42.157,000 --> 0:46:43,000
But now we're going to know,

872
0:46:44.141,000 --> 0:46:46,000
OK, next time we see a pathogen,

873
0:46:46.942,000 --> 0:46:5,000
we can make billions of tests within two or three weeks.

874
0:46:51.53,000 --> 0:46:54,000
We can figure out which antiviral drugs work

875
0:46:54.788,000 --> 0:46:55,000
within two or three weeks

876
0:46:56.088,000 --> 0:46:57,000
and get those scaled up.

877
0:46:57.266,000 --> 0:46:58,000
And we can make a vaccine,

878
0:46:58.871,000 --> 0:46:59,000
if we're really ready,

879
0:47:00.355,000 --> 0:47:02,000
probably in six months,

880
0:47:02.847,000 --> 0:47:05,000
using these new platforms, probably the RNA vaccine.

881
0:47:06.213,000 --> 0:47:12,000
So specifically, there are innovations that are there

882
0:47:13.11,000 --> 0:47:19,000
that will get financed, you know, I hope, quite generously,

883
0:47:19.601,000 --> 0:47:2,000
coming out of this thing.

884
0:47:21.163,000 --> 0:47:23,000
And so, three years from now, we'll look back and say,

885
0:47:23.943,000 --> 0:47:25,000
you know, that was awful,

886
0:47:26.149,000 --> 0:47:28,000
there's a lot of heroes, but we've learned a lesson

887
0:47:28.669,000 --> 0:47:31,000
and the world as a whole,

888
0:47:32.522,000 --> 0:47:34,000
with its great science and desire to help each other,

889
0:47:35.213,000 --> 0:47:38,000
was able to try and minimize what happened there

890
0:47:38.49,000 --> 0:47:42,000
and avoid it happening again.

891
0:47:43.365,000 --> 0:47:45,000
CA: That's certainly the optimistic scenario

892
0:47:45.593,000 --> 0:47:47,000
that I'm craving for, myself.

893
0:47:48.067,000 --> 0:47:5,000
That the world kind of realizes,

894
0:47:51.073,000 --> 0:47:54,000
one, that there are certain things that you just have to unite on.

895
0:47:54.212,000 --> 0:47:55,000
Two, that science really matters

896
0:47:55.942,000 --> 0:47:59,000
and it's a miracle that science can understand this bug,

897
0:47:59.989,000 --> 0:48:,000
you know, make a vaccine,

898
0:48:01.927,000 --> 0:48:02,000
sequence it, make therapeutics,

899
0:48:03.911,000 --> 0:48:04,000
understand how to model it --

900
0:48:05.713,000 --> 0:48:06,000
it's kind of miraculous to me.

901
0:48:07.228,000 --> 0:48:1,000
So will we learn, now, to pay attention to scientists,

902
0:48:10.776,000 --> 0:48:13,000
because if we do, I'm sure that you feel this as well,

903
0:48:13.975,000 --> 0:48:14,000
there's an amazing analogue with climate,

904
0:48:15.983,000 --> 0:48:16,000
it's just a different timescale.

905
0:48:17.657,000 --> 0:48:19,000
That the scientists are out there, saying,

906
0:48:19.696,000 --> 0:48:2,000
"There's this huge enemy coming,

907
0:48:21.253,000 --> 0:48:22,000
if we do nothing,

908
0:48:22.458,000 --> 0:48:25,000
it's going to take millions of lives, it's going to wreck our planet.

909
0:48:25.784,000 --> 0:48:26,000
For God's sake, act, politicians!

910
0:48:27.419,000 --> 0:48:28,000
Do something."

911
0:48:28.601,000 --> 0:48:29,000
And the politicians are going, "Meh, no.

912
0:48:30.546,000 --> 0:48:32,000
We need a little more GDP, we need to win an election."

913
0:48:33.165,000 --> 0:48:34,000
And they're not acting.

914
0:48:34.403,000 --> 0:48:37,000
Do you see a scenario where this shocks politicians

915
0:48:37.78,000 --> 0:48:38,000
to actually change their thinking

916
0:48:39.409,000 --> 0:48:41,000
and their prioritization of science overall,

917
0:48:41.528,000 --> 0:48:43,000
or is that asking too much?

918
0:48:44.28,000 --> 0:48:47,000
BG: Yeah, it's interesting how much of this distraction

919
0:48:47.888,000 --> 0:48:53,000
will delay the urgent innovation agenda that exists over in climate.

920
0:48:54.807,000 --> 0:48:57,000
You know, I have freed up a lot of time to work on climate.

921
0:48:58.712,000 --> 0:48:59,000
I have to say,

922
0:48:59.942,000 --> 0:49:01,000
you know, for the last few months, that's now shifted,

923
0:49:02.832,000 --> 0:49:06,000
and until we get out of this crisis, COVID will dominate,

924
0:49:07.761,000 --> 0:49:11,000
and so some of the climate stuff, although it will still go on,

925
0:49:12.372,000 --> 0:49:14,000
it won't get that same focus.

926
0:49:15.704,000 --> 0:49:18,000
As we get past this,

927
0:49:19.309,000 --> 0:49:23,000
yes, that idea of innovation and science and the world working together,

928
0:49:23.908,000 --> 0:49:26,000
that is totally common between these two problems.

929
0:49:27.474,000 --> 0:49:31,000
And so I don't think this has to be a huge setback for climate.

930
0:49:32.609,000 --> 0:49:33,000
CA: Last question.

931
0:49:33.834,000 --> 0:49:35,000
There are thousands of people watching,

932
0:49:36.3,000 --> 0:49:38,000
many of them living alone,

933
0:49:38.712,000 --> 0:49:39,000
some quite scared,

934
0:49:40.328,000 --> 0:49:43,000
there may even be people there who have this virus

935
0:49:43.728,000 --> 0:49:46,000
and are suffering symptoms or recovering.

936
0:49:47.442,000 --> 0:49:5,000
By the way, if that's you, we'd love to hear from you,

937
0:49:51.077,000 --> 0:49:52,000
we really would.

938
0:49:52.264,000 --> 0:49:54,000
Maybe have a conversation with some of you,

939
0:49:54.299,000 --> 0:49:56,000
in a future one of these,

940
0:49:56.371,000 --> 0:49:58,000
just understanding the experience.

941
0:49:59.069,000 --> 0:50:03,000
But Bill, what can people do as individuals from their own homes,

942
0:50:03.872,000 --> 0:50:05,000
right now, to try and help?

943
0:50:07.331,000 --> 0:50:09,000
BG: Well, there's a lot of creativity, you know --

944
0:50:09.699,000 --> 0:50:14,000
can you mentor kids who are being forced into an online format

945
0:50:14.88,000 --> 0:50:16,000
where the school systems really weren't ready for that?

946
0:50:17.685,000 --> 0:50:22,000
Can you organize some giving activity that gets the food banks to step up

947
0:50:22.864,000 --> 0:50:24,000
where there's problems there?

948
0:50:25.673,000 --> 0:50:27,000
These are such unprecedented times,

949
0:50:27.792,000 --> 0:50:32,000
and it really should draw out that sense of creativity,

950
0:50:33.451,000 --> 0:50:36,000
while complying with the isolation mandates.

951
0:50:38.569,000 --> 0:50:41,000
CA: Bill, I really want to thank you for spending this time with us

952
0:50:41.768,000 --> 0:50:44,000
and for the financial investment, the time investment.

953
0:50:45.424,000 --> 0:50:49,000
You've really invested your life into trying to solve these big problems.

954
0:50:50.019,000 --> 0:50:52,000
And this is as big as they get.

955
0:50:52.043,000 --> 0:50:55,000
I have a hunch that your voice is really going to be needed

956
0:50:55.654,000 --> 0:50:56,000
in the next few weeks.

957
0:50:56.855,000 --> 0:50:57,000
Thank you so much for your time today.

958
0:50:58.744,000 --> 0:51:,000
This was really wonderful, hearing from you.

959
0:51:00.839,000 --> 0:51:01,000
Thank you.

960
0:51:02.014,000 --> 0:51:03,000
BG: Thanks, Chris.

961
0:51:03.239,000 --> 0:51:04,000
CA: OK, thanks, everyone,

962
0:51:05.118,000 --> 0:51:07,000
thanks for being part of the TED community.

963
0:51:07.716,000 --> 0:51:09,000
Look after yourselves, be smart about this.

964
0:51:10.292,000 --> 0:51:11,000
You know, get ahead of it.

965
0:51:11.706,000 --> 0:51:14,000
If you're in a part of the world where this thing hasn't really hit,

966
0:51:15.101,000 --> 0:51:17,000
listen to Bill Gates.

967
0:51:17.252,000 --> 0:51:18,000
Get ahead of it.

968
0:51:18.427,000 --> 0:51:21,000
Keep, you know, if you possibly can,

969
0:51:22.228,000 --> 0:51:23,000
socially distanced.

970
0:51:23.403,000 --> 0:51:25,000
No, not -- physically distanced and socially connect.

971
0:51:26.157,000 --> 0:51:28,000
That's what the internet is for.

972
0:51:28.315,000 --> 0:51:31,000
These days are what the internet was built for.

973
0:51:31.804,000 --> 0:51:32,000
We can spread love, we can spread ideas,

974
0:51:33.741,000 --> 0:51:35,000
we can spread relationship, we can spread thought,

975
0:51:36.105,000 --> 0:51:39,000
without spreading a dangerous bug.

976
0:51:39.145,000 --> 0:51:41,000
So get ahead of it, and let's figure this out together.

977
0:51:42.059,000 --> 0:51:44,000
It's been wonderful spending time with you.

978
0:51:44.643,000 --> 0:51:47,000
From Whitney and from me and from the whole TED team,

979
0:51:47.889,000 --> 0:51:48,000
thank you, and over and out.

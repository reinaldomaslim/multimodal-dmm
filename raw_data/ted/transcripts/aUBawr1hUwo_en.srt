1
0:00:12.875,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a lifelong traveler.

2
0:00:14.783,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Even as a little kid,

3
0:00:16.442,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was actually working out that it would be cheaper

4
0:00:19.922,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to go to boarding school in England

5
0:00:22.048,000 --> 0:00:27,000
than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California.

6
0:00:27.168,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So, from the time I was nine years old

7
0:00:30.547,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was flying alone several times a year

8
0:00:33.775,000 --> 0:00:36,000
over the North Pole, just to go to school.

9
0:00:37.241,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly,

10
0:00:40.884,000 --> 0:00:43,000
so the very week after I graduated from high school,

11
0:00:44.15,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I got a job mopping tables

12
0:00:46.864,000 --> 0:00:5,000
so that I could spend every season of my 18th year

13
0:00:51.065,000 --> 0:00:54,000
on a different continent.

14
0:00:54.066,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And then, almost inevitably, I became a travel writer

15
0:00:58.187,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so my job and my joy could become one.

16
0:01:02.636,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough

17
0:01:06.522,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet

18
0:01:09.954,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or to wander along the seafronts in Havana

19
0:01:12.758,000 --> 0:01:14,000
with music passing all around you,

20
0:01:15.138,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you could bring those sounds and the high cobalt skies

21
0:01:18.435,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and the flash of the blue ocean

22
0:01:20.777,000 --> 0:01:22,000
back to your friends at home,

23
0:01:22.79,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and really bring some magic

24
0:01:24.581,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and clarity to your own life.

25
0:01:27.402,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Except, as you all know,

26
0:01:29.868,000 --> 0:01:31,000
one of the first things you learn when you travel

27
0:01:32.7,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it.

28
0:01:38.078,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You take an angry man to the Himalayas,

29
0:01:40.557,000 --> 0:01:43,000
he just starts complaining about the food.

30
0:01:43.873,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I found that the best way

31
0:01:46.395,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes

32
0:01:50.439,000 --> 0:01:51,000
was, oddly,

33
0:01:52.037,000 --> 0:01:55,000
by going nowhere, just by sitting still.

34
0:01:55.505,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And of course sitting still is how many of us get

35
0:01:58.354,000 --> 0:02:03,000
what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives, a break.

36
0:02:04.124,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But it was also the only way

37
0:02:05.846,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience

38
0:02:11.347,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and make sense of the future and the past.

39
0:02:14.631,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And so, to my great surprise,

40
0:02:17.673,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I found that going nowhere

41
0:02:19.579,000 --> 0:02:23,000
was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba.

42
0:02:23.697,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And by going nowhere, I mean nothing more intimidating

43
0:02:27.752,000 --> 0:02:29,000
than taking a few minutes out of every day

44
0:02:30.584,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or a few days out of every season,

45
0:02:32.555,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or even, as some people do,

46
0:02:34.524,000 --> 0:02:36,000
a few years out of a life

47
0:02:37.343,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in order to sit still long enough

48
0:02:40.044,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to find out what moves you most,

49
0:02:43.435,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to recall where your truest happiness lies

50
0:02:46.779,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and to remember that sometimes

51
0:02:48.549,000 --> 0:02:5,000
making a living and making a life

52
0:02:51.264,000 --> 0:02:54,000
point in opposite directions.

53
0:02:54.457,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And of course, this is what wise beings through the centuries

54
0:02:57.654,000 --> 0:02:59,000
from every tradition have been telling us.

55
0:02:59.897,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's an old idea.

56
0:03:01.823,000 --> 0:03:04,000
More than 2,000 years ago, the Stoics were reminding us

57
0:03:05.117,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it's not our experience that makes our lives,

58
0:03:08.171,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it's what we do with it.

59
0:03:10.379,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Imagine a hurricane suddenly sweeps through your town

60
0:03:14.231,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and reduces every last thing to rubble.

61
0:03:18.739,000 --> 0:03:21,000
One man is traumatized for life.

62
0:03:22.401,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But another, maybe even his brother, almost feels liberated,

63
0:03:26.265,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew.

64
0:03:30.507,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's exactly the same event,

65
0:03:32.357,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but radically different responses.

66
0:03:34.909,000 --> 0:03:38,000
There is nothing either good or bad, as Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,"

67
0:03:39.3,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but thinking makes it so.

68
0:03:42.72,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler.

69
0:03:46.06,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Twenty-four years ago I took the most mind-bending trip

70
0:03:49.233,000 --> 0:03:51,000
across North Korea.

71
0:03:51.915,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But the trip lasted a few days.

72
0:03:54.804,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What I've done with it sitting still, going back to it in my head,

73
0:03:58.384,000 --> 0:04:01,000
trying to understand it, finding a place for it in my thinking,

74
0:04:02.056,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that's lasted 24 years already

75
0:04:04.32,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and will probably last a lifetime.

76
0:04:07.683,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The trip, in other words, gave me some amazing sights,

77
0:04:11.059,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but it's only sitting still

78
0:04:13.124,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that allows me to turn those into lasting insights.

79
0:04:16.816,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I sometimes think that so much of our life

80
0:04:19.762,000 --> 0:04:21,000
takes place inside our heads,

81
0:04:21.779,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation,

82
0:04:26.592,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that if I really want to change my life

83
0:04:29.395,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I might best begin by changing my mind.

84
0:04:33.43,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Again, none of this is new;

85
0:04:34.95,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago,

86
0:04:39.25,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but Shakespeare never had to face 200 emails in a day.

87
0:04:43.503,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:44.905,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The Stoics, as far as I know, were not on Facebook.

89
0:04:49.228,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We all know that in our on-demand lives,

90
0:04:52.084,000 --> 0:04:54,000
one of the things that's most on demand

91
0:04:54.192,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is ourselves.

92
0:04:55.42,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Wherever we are, any time of night or day,

93
0:04:58.052,000 --> 0:05:01,000
our bosses, junk-mailers, our parents can get to us.

94
0:05:02.443,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Sociologists have actually found that in recent years

95
0:05:05.772,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Americans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago,

96
0:05:09.23,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but we feel as if we're working more.

97
0:05:12.396,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We have more and more time-saving devices,

98
0:05:14.942,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but sometimes, it seems, less and less time.

99
0:05:18.742,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We can more and more easily make contact with people

100
0:05:21.226,000 --> 0:05:23,000
on the furthest corners of the planet,

101
0:05:23.585,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but sometimes in that process

102
0:05:25.579,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we lose contact with ourselves.

103
0:05:29.325,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And one of my biggest surprises as a traveler

104
0:05:33.118,000 --> 0:05:36,000
has been to find that often it's exactly the people

105
0:05:36.296,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who have most enabled us to get anywhere

106
0:05:39.413,000 --> 0:05:41,000
who are intent on going nowhere.

107
0:05:42.128,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In other words, precisely those beings

108
0:05:44.313,000 --> 0:05:46,000
who have created the technologies

109
0:05:46.646,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that override so many of the limits of old,

110
0:05:50.196,000 --> 0:05:53,000
are the ones wisest about the need for limits,

111
0:05:53.207,000 --> 0:05:56,000
even when it comes to technology.

112
0:05:56.883,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I once went to the Google headquarters

113
0:05:59.512,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I saw all the things many of you have heard about;

114
0:06:02.315,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the indoor tree houses, the trampolines,

115
0:06:05.539,000 --> 0:06:09,000
workers at that time enjoying 20 percent of their paid time free

116
0:06:10.017,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering.

117
0:06:14.057,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But what impressed me even more

118
0:06:16.975,000 --> 0:06:19,000
was that as I was waiting for my digital I.D.,

119
0:06:20.554,000 --> 0:06:22,000
one Googler was telling me about the program

120
0:06:23.323,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that he was about to start to teach the many, many Googlers

121
0:06:27.117,000 --> 0:06:3,000
who practice yoga to become trainers in it,

122
0:06:30.51,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write

123
0:06:34.764,000 --> 0:06:37,000
on the inner search engine,

124
0:06:37.778,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and the ways in which science has empirically shown

125
0:06:40.771,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that sitting still, or meditation,

126
0:06:43.308,000 --> 0:06:46,000
can lead not just to better health or to clearer thinking,

127
0:06:46.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but even to emotional intelligence.

128
0:06:50.44,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I have another friend in Silicon Valley

129
0:06:52.753,000 --> 0:06:55,000
who is really one of the most eloquent spokesmen

130
0:06:55.875,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for the latest technologies,

131
0:06:57.678,000 --> 0:07:,000
and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.

132
0:07:01.563,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies

133
0:07:05.316,000 --> 0:07:09,000
without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home.

134
0:07:09.879,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And like many in Silicon Valley,

135
0:07:12.761,000 --> 0:07:14,000
he tries really hard to observe

136
0:07:15.737,000 --> 0:07:18,000
what they call an Internet sabbath,

137
0:07:19.643,000 --> 0:07:22,000
whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week

138
0:07:22.741,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they go completely offline

139
0:07:25.821,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in order to gather the sense of direction

140
0:07:27.969,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and proportion they'll need when they go online again.

141
0:07:31.463,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us

142
0:07:35.19,000 --> 0:07:39,000
is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology.

143
0:07:39.899,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And when you speak of the sabbath,

144
0:07:42.564,000 --> 0:07:43,000
look at the Ten Commandments --

145
0:07:44.501,000 --> 0:07:48,000
there's only one word there for which the adjective "holy" is used,

146
0:07:48.874,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and that's the Sabbath.

147
0:07:51.15,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah --

148
0:07:54.18,000 --> 0:07:57,000
its longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.

149
0:07:57.521,000 --> 0:08:,000
And we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries,

150
0:08:01.418,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the empty space.

151
0:08:03.606,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In many a piece of music, it's the pause or the rest

152
0:08:07.528,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that gives the piece its beauty and its shape.

153
0:08:10.638,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I know I as a writer

154
0:08:12.221,000 --> 0:08:16,000
will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page

155
0:08:16.354,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences

156
0:08:20.066,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and so that her imagination has room to breathe.

157
0:08:25.618,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now, in the physical domain, of course, many people,

158
0:08:28.196,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if they have the resources,

159
0:08:29.72,000 --> 0:08:32,000
will try to get a place in the country, a second home.

160
0:08:33.2,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I've never begun to have those resources,

161
0:08:36.342,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but I sometimes remember that any time I want,

162
0:08:40.057,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I can get a second home in time, if not in space,

163
0:08:44.422,000 --> 0:08:46,000
just by taking a day off.

164
0:08:46.853,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And it's never easy because, of course, whenever I do I spend much of it

165
0:08:50.418,000 --> 0:08:51,000
worried about all the extra stuff

166
0:08:52.096,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that's going to crash down on me the following day.

167
0:08:54.77,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine

168
0:08:57.792,000 --> 0:08:59,000
than the chance to check on my emails.

169
0:08:59.834,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:00.958,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat

171
0:09:05.266,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind

172
0:09:09.568,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails

173
0:09:12.616,000 --> 0:09:13,000
from my bosses

174
0:09:14.37,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party.

175
0:09:17.437,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet,

176
0:09:21.265,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I realize that it's only by going there

177
0:09:23.734,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share

178
0:09:27.761,000 --> 0:09:29,000
with my wife or bosses or friends.

179
0:09:30.267,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Otherwise, really,

180
0:09:31.547,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness,

181
0:09:35.067,000 --> 0:09:37,000
which is no blessing at all.

182
0:09:38.849,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And so when I was 29,

183
0:09:41.317,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I decided to remake my entire life

184
0:09:44.382,000 --> 0:09:46,000
in the light of going nowhere.

185
0:09:47.099,000 --> 0:09:49,000
One evening I was coming back from the office,

186
0:09:49.6,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it was after midnight, I was in a taxi driving through Times Square,

187
0:09:53.779,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much

188
0:09:57.279,000 --> 0:10:,000
I could never catch up with my life.

189
0:10:00.435,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And my life then, as it happened,

190
0:10:02.251,000 --> 0:10:05,000
was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy.

191
0:10:06.072,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I had really interesting friends and colleagues,

192
0:10:08.387,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and 20th Street.

193
0:10:12.635,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I had, to me, a fascinating job writing about world affairs,

194
0:10:17.068,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but I could never separate myself enough from them

195
0:10:20.056,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to hear myself think --

196
0:10:21.759,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or really, to understand if I was truly happy.

197
0:10:25.885,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And so, I abandoned my dream life

198
0:10:29.072,000 --> 0:10:33,000
for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto, Japan,

199
0:10:34.382,000 --> 0:10:37,000
which was the place that had long exerted a strong,

200
0:10:37.668,000 --> 0:10:4,000
really mysterious gravitational pull on me.

201
0:10:41.518,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Even as a child

202
0:10:42.853,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;

203
0:10:46.224,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.

204
0:10:49.471,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But it's also, as you all know,

205
0:10:51.4,000 --> 0:10:53,000
a beautiful city encircled by hills,

206
0:10:54.119,000 --> 0:10:57,000
filled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines,

207
0:10:57.748,000 --> 0:11:02,000
where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more.

208
0:11:02.86,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And quite soon after I moved there, I ended up where I still am

209
0:11:06.853,000 --> 0:11:08,000
with my wife, formerly our kids,

210
0:11:09.432,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere

211
0:11:12.013,000 --> 0:11:14,000
where we have no bicycle, no car,

212
0:11:14.401,000 --> 0:11:16,000
no TV I can understand,

213
0:11:16.57,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and I still have to support my loved ones

214
0:11:19.123,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as a travel writer and a journalist,

215
0:11:21.654,000 --> 0:11:24,000
so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement

216
0:11:25.018,000 --> 0:11:26,000
or for cultural excitement

217
0:11:26.845,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or for social diversion.

218
0:11:29.212,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But I realized that it gives me what I prize most,

219
0:11:34.4,000 --> 0:11:35,000
which is days

220
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and hours.

221
0:11:37.773,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I have never once had to use a cell phone there.

222
0:11:40.4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I almost never have to look at the time,

223
0:11:43.943,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and every morning when I wake up,

224
0:11:46.497,000 --> 0:11:48,000
really the day stretches in front of me

225
0:11:48.858,000 --> 0:11:5,000
like an open meadow.

226
0:11:51.832,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises,

227
0:11:55.028,000 --> 0:11:56,000
as it will, more than once,

228
0:11:56.989,000 --> 0:11:58,000
when a doctor comes into my room

229
0:11:59.17,000 --> 0:12:,000
wearing a grave expression,

230
0:12:01.065,000 --> 0:12:04,000
or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway,

231
0:12:04.693,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I know, in my bones,

232
0:12:07.437,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that it's the time I've spent going nowhere

233
0:12:10.147,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that is going to sustain me much more

234
0:12:12.149,000 --> 0:12:16,000
than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.

235
0:12:18.306,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I'll always be a traveler --

236
0:12:19.71,000 --> 0:12:2,000
my livelihood depends on it --

237
0:12:21.614,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but one of the beauties of travel

238
0:12:23.793,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is that it allows you to bring stillness

239
0:12:27.899,000 --> 0:12:31,000
into the motion and the commotion of the world.

240
0:12:32.019,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I once got on a plane in Frankfurt, Germany,

241
0:12:35.397,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and a young German woman came down and sat next to me

242
0:12:38.345,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and engaged me in a very friendly conversation

243
0:12:40.965,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for about 30 minutes,

244
0:12:42.716,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and then she just turned around

245
0:12:44.709,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and sat still for 12 hours.

246
0:12:47.982,000 --> 0:12:49,000
She didn't once turn on her video monitor,

247
0:12:50.616,000 --> 0:12:53,000
she never pulled out a book, she didn't even go to sleep,

248
0:12:53.911,000 --> 0:12:55,000
she just sat still,

249
0:12:56.698,000 --> 0:13:,000
and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me.

250
0:13:01.999,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days

251
0:13:06.321,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to try to open up a space inside their lives.

252
0:13:09.605,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Some people go to black-hole resorts

253
0:13:11.935,000 --> 0:13:13,000
where they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night

254
0:13:14.295,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop

255
0:13:17.453,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to the front desk on arrival.

256
0:13:19.657,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Some people I know, just before they go to sleep,

257
0:13:22.622,000 --> 0:13:24,000
instead of scrolling through their messages

258
0:13:24.746,000 --> 0:13:25,000
or checking out YouTube,

259
0:13:26.418,000 --> 0:13:29,000
just turn out the lights and listen to some music,

260
0:13:29.662,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and notice that they sleep much better

261
0:13:32.088,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and wake up much refreshed.

262
0:13:35.301,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I was once fortunate enough

263
0:13:37.507,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to drive into the high, dark mountains behind Los Angeles,

264
0:13:42.547,000 --> 0:13:44,000
where the great poet and singer

265
0:13:45.095,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen

266
0:13:48.317,000 --> 0:13:52,000
was living and working for many years as a full-time monk

267
0:13:52.488,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.

268
0:13:55.339,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And I wasn't entirely surprised

269
0:13:57.304,000 --> 0:14:,000
when the record that he released at the age of 77,

270
0:14:01.014,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of "Old Ideas,"

271
0:14:06.296,000 --> 0:14:08,000
went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world,

272
0:14:09.258,000 --> 0:14:12,000
hit the top five in nine others.

273
0:14:12.488,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Something in us, I think, is crying out

274
0:14:15.255,000 --> 0:14:19,000
for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that.

275
0:14:19.761,000 --> 0:14:22,000
who take the time and trouble to sit still.

276
0:14:23.543,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I think many of us have the sensation,

277
0:14:25.781,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I certainly do,

278
0:14:27.309,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen,

279
0:14:31.767,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and it's noisy and it's crowded

280
0:14:33.605,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and it's changing with every second,

281
0:14:35.781,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and that screen is our lives.

282
0:14:38.53,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And it's only by stepping back, and then further back,

283
0:14:42.153,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and holding still,

284
0:14:43.891,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that we can begin to see what the canvas means

285
0:14:46.709,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and to catch the larger picture.

286
0:14:49.005,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And a few people do that for us by going nowhere.

287
0:14:53.95,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So, in an age of acceleration,

288
0:14:55.972,000 --> 0:14:59,000
nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow.

289
0:15:00.021,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And in an age of distraction,

290
0:15:02.202,000 --> 0:15:05,000
nothing is so luxurious as paying attention.

291
0:15:06.715,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And in an age of constant movement,

292
0:15:09.441,000 --> 0:15:12,000
nothing is so urgent as sitting still.

293
0:15:13.214,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So you can go on your next vacation

294
0:15:15.443,000 --> 0:15:18,000
to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;

295
0:15:18.509,000 --> 0:15:21,000
I bet you'll have a wonderful time.

296
0:15:22.049,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But, if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope,

297
0:15:27.117,000 --> 0:15:29,000
in love with the world,

298
0:15:29.277,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I think you might want to try considering going nowhere.

299
0:15:33.713,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you.

300
0:15:34.86,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Applause)

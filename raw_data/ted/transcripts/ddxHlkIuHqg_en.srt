1
0:00:14.222,000 --> 0:00:16,000
OK, first, some introductions.

2
0:00:17.919,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My mom, Jennie, took this picture.

3
0:00:21.158,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That's my dad, Frank, in the middle.

4
0:00:24.139,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And on his left, my sisters:

5
0:00:26.766,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Mary Catherine, Judith Ann, Theresa Marie.

6
0:00:30.815,000 --> 0:00:33,000
John Patrick's sitting on his lap and Kevin Michael's on his right.

7
0:00:35.739,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And in the pale-blue windbreaker,

8
0:00:38.236,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Susan Diane. Me.

9
0:00:41.491,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I loved growing up in a big family.

10
0:00:45.159,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And one of my favorite things was picking names.

11
0:00:49.924,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But by the time child number seven came along,

12
0:00:53.393,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we had nearly run out of middle names.

13
0:00:57.075,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It was a long deliberation

14
0:00:58.941,000 --> 0:01:02,000
before we finally settled on Jennifer Bridget.

15
0:01:04.353,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Every parent in this audience

16
0:01:07.108,000 --> 0:01:09,000
knows the joy and excitement

17
0:01:09.756,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of picking a new baby's name.

18
0:01:12.913,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I was excited and thrilled

19
0:01:14.859,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to help my mom in that special ceremonial moment.

20
0:01:19.824,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But it's not like that everywhere.

21
0:01:23.163,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I travel a lot and I see a lot.

22
0:01:26.273,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But it took me by surprise to learn

23
0:01:29.39,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in an area of Ethiopia,

24
0:01:31.593,000 --> 0:01:34,000
parents delay picking the names for their new babies

25
0:01:35.298,000 --> 0:01:36,000
by a month or more.

26
0:01:37.908,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Why delay?

27
0:01:40.278,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time?

28
0:01:44.423,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well, they delay because they're afraid.

29
0:01:48.007,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They're afraid their baby will die.

30
0:01:51.08,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And this loss might be a little more bearable without a name.

31
0:01:57.248,000 --> 0:02:,000
A face without a name might help them feel

32
0:02:01.177,000 --> 0:02:03,000
just a little less attached.

33
0:02:05.019,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So here we are in one part of the world --

34
0:02:07.52,000 --> 0:02:11,000
a time of joy, excitement, dreaming of the future of that child --

35
0:02:12.893,000 --> 0:02:14,000
while in another world,

36
0:02:15.179,000 --> 0:02:17,000
parents are filled with dread,

37
0:02:18.123,000 --> 0:02:21,000
not daring to dream of a future for their child

38
0:02:21.722,000 --> 0:02:22,000
beyond a few precious weeks.

39
0:02:24.789,000 --> 0:02:25,000
How can that be?

40
0:02:27.189,000 --> 0:02:32,000
How can it be that 2.6 million babies

41
0:02:32.698,000 --> 0:02:33,000
die around the world

42
0:02:34.516,000 --> 0:02:36,000
before they're even one month old?

43
0:02:37.926,000 --> 0:02:38,000
2.6 million.

44
0:02:41.034,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That's the population of Vancouver.

45
0:02:44.512,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the shocking thing is:

46
0:02:47.043,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Why?

47
0:02:48.365,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In too many cases, we simply don't know.

48
0:02:53.145,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, I remember recently seeing an updated pie chart.

49
0:02:57.295,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the pie chart was labeled,

50
0:02:59.487,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Causes of death in children under five worldwide."

51
0:03:03.838,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And there was a pretty big section of that pie chart, about 40 percent --

52
0:03:07.907,000 --> 0:03:1,000
40 percent was labeled "neonatal."

53
0:03:12.077,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now, "neonatal" is not a cause of death.

54
0:03:14.92,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Neonatal is simply an adjective,

55
0:03:17.711,000 --> 0:03:21,000
an adjective that means that the child is less than one month old.

56
0:03:23.656,000 --> 0:03:27,000
For me, "neonatal" said: "We have no idea."

57
0:03:29.1,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.

58
0:03:31.294,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I want to fix things.

59
0:03:33.58,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But you can't fix what you can't define.

60
0:03:38.227,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents

61
0:03:43.019,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is to answer the question:

62
0:03:45.22,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Why are babies dying?

63
0:03:48.359,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So today, I want to talk about a new approach,

64
0:03:52.118,000 --> 0:03:53,000
an approach that I feel

65
0:03:54.079,000 --> 0:03:58,000
will not only help us know why babies are dying,

66
0:03:59.367,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but is beginning to completely transform

67
0:04:02.768,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the whole field of global health.

68
0:04:06.235,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It's called "Precision Public Health."

69
0:04:10.615,000 --> 0:04:15,000
For me, precision medicine comes from a very special place.

70
0:04:16.894,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I trained as a cancer doctor, an oncologist.

71
0:04:20.079,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I got into it because I wanted to help people feel better.

72
0:04:24.491,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But too often my treatments made them feel worse.

73
0:04:29.277,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I still remember young women being driven to my clinic

74
0:04:34.55,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by their moms --

75
0:04:36.611,000 --> 0:04:4,000
adults, who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers.

76
0:04:42.791,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They were so weak

77
0:04:43.975,000 --> 0:04:45,000
from the treatment I had given them.

78
0:04:47.283,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But at the time, in those front lines in the war on cancer,

79
0:04:51.507,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we had few tools.

80
0:04:54.03,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the tools we did have couldn't differentiate

81
0:04:57.746,000 --> 0:05:,000
between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard

82
0:05:01.67,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve.

83
0:05:06.663,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And so the side effects that you're all very familiar with --

84
0:05:09.642,000 --> 0:05:11,000
hair loss, being sick to your stomach,

85
0:05:12.5,000 --> 0:05:16,000
having a suppressed immune system, so infection was a constant threat --

86
0:05:17.179,000 --> 0:05:19,000
were always surrounding us.

87
0:05:20.985,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And then I moved to the biotechnology industry.

88
0:05:24.269,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients

89
0:05:28.373,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that could do a better job of telling the healthy cells

90
0:05:33.398,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from the unhealthy or cancer cells.

91
0:05:36.566,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's a drug called Herceptin.

92
0:05:39.343,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And what Herceptin allowed us to do

93
0:05:42.603,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is to precisely target HER2-positive breast cancer,

94
0:05:49.036,000 --> 0:05:51,000
at the time, the scariest form of breast cancer.

95
0:05:52.091,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells,

96
0:05:56.727,000 --> 0:06:,000
while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells.

97
0:06:02.441,000 --> 0:06:03,000
A huge breakthrough.

98
0:06:04.181,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It felt like a miracle,

99
0:06:07.091,000 --> 0:06:09,000
so much so that today,

100
0:06:10.064,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we're harnessing all those tools --

101
0:06:13.156,000 --> 0:06:18,000
big data, consumer monitoring, gene sequencing and more --

102
0:06:18.704,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to tackle a broad variety of diseases.

103
0:06:23.044,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That's allowing us to target individuals

104
0:06:28.137,000 --> 0:06:31,000
with the right remedies at the right time.

105
0:06:32.731,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Precision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy.

106
0:06:37.655,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Everything changed.

107
0:06:40.187,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And I want everything to change again.

108
0:06:44.214,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So I've been asking myself:

109
0:06:46.49,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Why should we limit

110
0:06:48.332,000 --> 0:06:52,000
this smarter, more precise, better way to tackle diseases

111
0:06:53.165,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to the rich world?

112
0:06:56.105,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now, don't misunderstand me --

113
0:06:57.641,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like Herceptin

114
0:07:00.991,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to the developing world,

115
0:07:02.9,000 --> 0:07:04,000
although I'd actually kind of like that.

116
0:07:05.707,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What I am talking about

117
0:07:07.696,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is moving from this precise targeting for individuals

118
0:07:12.088,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to tackle public health problems

119
0:07:14.755,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in populations.

120
0:07:18.487,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now, OK, I know probably you're thinking, "She's crazy.

121
0:07:23.094,000 --> 0:07:25,000
You can't do that. That's too ambitious."

122
0:07:26.83,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But here's the thing:

123
0:07:29.18,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we're already doing this in a limited way,

124
0:07:32.502,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and it's already starting to make a big difference.

125
0:07:36.606,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So here's what's happening.

126
0:07:38.952,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, I told you I trained as a cancer doctor.

127
0:07:41.566,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But like many, many doctors who trained in San Francisco in the '80s,

128
0:07:46.039,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I also trained as an AIDS doctor.

129
0:07:49.077,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It was a terrible time.

130
0:07:51.504,000 --> 0:07:53,000
AIDS was a death sentence.

131
0:07:54.385,000 --> 0:07:55,000
All my patients died.

132
0:07:57.329,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now, things are better,

133
0:07:59.257,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but HIV/AIDS remains a terrible global challenge.

134
0:08:04.473,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Worldwide, about 17 million women are living with HIV.

135
0:08:10.744,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We know that when these women become pregnant,

136
0:08:14.065,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they can transfer the virus to their baby.

137
0:08:18.551,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We also know in the absence of therapy,

138
0:08:20.827,000 --> 0:08:23,000
half those babies will not survive until the age of two.

139
0:08:25.446,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee

140
0:08:30.607,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that she will not transmit the virus to the baby.

141
0:08:33.86,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So what do we do?

142
0:08:35.708,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Well, a one-size-fits-all approach, kind of like that blast of chemo,

143
0:08:40.294,000 --> 0:08:43,000
would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world.

144
0:08:43.952,000 --> 0:08:44,000
That would do the job.

145
0:08:45.889,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But it's just not practical.

146
0:08:49.223,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So instead, we target those areas where HIV rates are the highest.

147
0:08:55.444,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We know in certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa

148
0:08:59.845,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest.

149
0:09:04.794,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This precision approach to a public health problem

150
0:09:07.976,000 --> 0:09:09,000
has cut by nearly half

151
0:09:10.401,000 --> 0:09:12,000
HIV transmission from mothers to baby

152
0:09:13.18,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in the last five years.

153
0:09:15.485,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Applause)

154
0:09:20.945,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Screening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world

155
0:09:26.031,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is a powerful example

156
0:09:29.159,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of how precision public health can change things on a big scale.

157
0:09:36.452,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So ...

158
0:09:38.213,000 --> 0:09:39,000
How do we do that?

159
0:09:39.414,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We can do that because we know.

160
0:09:41.896,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We know who to target,

161
0:09:44.238,000 --> 0:09:45,000
what to target,

162
0:09:45.949,000 --> 0:09:47,000
where to target and how to target.

163
0:09:48.685,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And that, for me, are the important elements of precision public health:

164
0:09:53.78,000 --> 0:09:55,000
who, what, where and how.

165
0:09:57.814,000 --> 0:10:,000
But let's go back to the 2.6 million babies

166
0:10:01.739,000 --> 0:10:03,000
who die before they're one month old.

167
0:10:03.78,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Here's the problem: we just don't know.

168
0:10:06.753,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It may seem unbelievable,

169
0:10:09.241,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality

170
0:10:14.128,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in those countries with the highest infant mortality

171
0:10:17.163,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is a conversation with mom.

172
0:10:19.948,000 --> 0:10:23,000
A health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child,

173
0:10:24.35,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"Was the baby vomiting? Did they have a fever?"

174
0:10:28.043,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And that conversation may take place

175
0:10:30.016,000 --> 0:10:33,000
as long as three months after the baby has died.

176
0:10:34.951,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Now, put yourself in the shoes of that mom.

177
0:10:39.239,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's a heartbreaking, excruciating conversation.

178
0:10:43.833,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And even worse -- it's not that helpful,

179
0:10:47.635,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because we might know there was a fever or vomiting,

180
0:10:50.612,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but we don't know why.

181
0:10:53.171,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So in the absence of knowing that knowledge,

182
0:10:56.677,000 --> 0:10:58,000
we cannot prevent that mom, that family,

183
0:10:59.683,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or other families in that community

184
0:11:01.805,000 --> 0:11:02,000
from suffering the same tragedy.

185
0:11:04.804,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But what if we applied a precision public health approach?

186
0:11:09.064,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Let's say, for example,

187
0:11:10.482,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we find out in certain areas of Africa

188
0:11:13.44,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection

189
0:11:17.21,000 --> 0:11:19,000
transferred from the mother to the baby,

190
0:11:19.781,000 --> 0:11:21,000
known as Group B streptococcus.

191
0:11:22.999,000 --> 0:11:27,000
In the absence of treatment, mom has a seven times higher chance

192
0:11:28.535,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that her next baby will die.

193
0:11:32.124,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Once we define the problem, we can prevent that death

194
0:11:36.049,000 --> 0:11:4,000
with something as cheap and safe as penicillin.

195
0:11:41.894,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We can do that because then we'll know.

196
0:11:45.034,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And that's the point:

197
0:11:46.59,000 --> 0:11:49,000
once we know, we can bring the right interventions

198
0:11:50.05,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to the right population in the right places

199
0:11:53.613,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to save lives.

200
0:11:56.973,000 --> 0:11:59,000
With this approach, and with these interventions

201
0:12:00.749,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and others like them,

202
0:12:02.798,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I have no doubt

203
0:12:04.533,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that a precision public health approach

204
0:12:07.104,000 --> 0:12:1,000
can help our world achieve our 15-year goal.

205
0:12:11.423,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And that would translate into a million babies' lives saved

206
0:12:15.776,000 --> 0:12:16,000
every single year.

207
0:12:18.253,000 --> 0:12:22,000
One million babies every single year.

208
0:12:23.706,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And why would we stop there?

209
0:12:26.319,000 --> 0:12:29,000
A much more powerful approach to public health --

210
0:12:29.64,000 --> 0:12:31,000
imagine what might be possible.

211
0:12:32.912,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Why couldn't we more effectively tackle malnutrition?

212
0:12:37.643,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Why wouldn't we prevent cervical cancer in women?

213
0:12:42.832,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And why not eradicate malaria?

214
0:12:45.674,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Applause)

215
0:12:46.699,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Yes, clap for that!

216
0:12:47.936,000 --> 0:12:5,000
(Applause)

217
0:12:51.888,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So, you know, I live in two different worlds,

218
0:12:54.755,000 --> 0:12:57,000
one world populated by scientists,

219
0:12:58.59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and another world populated by public health professionals.

220
0:13:03.319,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The promise of precision public health

221
0:13:05.771,000 --> 0:13:07,000
is to bring these two worlds together.

222
0:13:08.876,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But you know, we all live in two worlds:

223
0:13:13.254,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the rich world and the poor world.

224
0:13:17.76,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And what I'm most excited about about precision public health

225
0:13:21.634,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is bridging these two worlds.

226
0:13:25.051,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Every day in the rich world,

227
0:13:28.095,000 --> 0:13:31,000
we're bringing incredible talent and tools --

228
0:13:31.374,000 --> 0:13:32,000
everything at our disposal --

229
0:13:33.357,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to precisely target diseases in ways I never imagined

230
0:13:38.294,000 --> 0:13:39,000
would be possible.

231
0:13:40.152,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Surely, we can tap into that kind of talent and tools

232
0:13:45.192,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to stop babies dying in the poor world.

233
0:13:49.201,000 --> 0:13:51,000
If we did,

234
0:13:51.274,000 --> 0:13:55,000
then every parent would have the confidence

235
0:13:55.355,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to name their child the moment that child is born,

236
0:14:00.746,000 --> 0:14:05,000
daring to dream that that child's life will be measured in decades,

237
0:14:06.498,000 --> 0:14:07,000
not days.

238
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Thank you.

239
0:14:09.505,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

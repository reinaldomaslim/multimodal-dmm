1
0:00:15.471,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Namaskar.

2
0:00:17.63,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,

3
0:00:21.408,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I don't use Botox as yet.

4
0:00:23.688,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:24.928,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw like a 21-year-old in my movies.

6
0:00:30.288,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Yeah, I do that.

7
0:00:31.528,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I sell dreams, and I peddle love to millions of people back home in India

8
0:00:36.448,000 --> 0:00:38,000
who assume that I'm the best lover in the world.

9
0:00:38.728,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:41.888,000 --> 0:00:43,000
If you don't tell anyone, I'm going to tell you I'm not,

11
0:00:44.568,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but I never let that assumption go away.

12
0:00:46.528,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.568,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I've also been made to understand

14
0:00:49.208,000 --> 0:00:51,000
there are lots of you here who haven't seen my work,

15
0:00:51.688,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I feel really sad for you.

16
0:00:53.168,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:55.608,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Applause)

18
0:01:00.648,000 --> 0:01:03,000
That doesn't take away from the fact that I'm completely self-obsessed,

19
0:01:04.008,000 --> 0:01:05,000
as a movie star should be.

20
0:01:05.288,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:06.368,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That's when my friends, Chris and Juliet called me here

22
0:01:10.008,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to speak about the future "you."

23
0:01:11.598,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Naturally, it follows I'm going to speak about the present me.

24
0:01:14.558,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:19.088,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Because I truly believe that humanity is a lot like me.

26
0:01:21.888,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:23.128,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It is. It is.

28
0:01:24.528,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's an aging movie star,

29
0:01:27.248,000 --> 0:01:29,000
grappling with all the newness around itself,

30
0:01:29.848,000 --> 0:01:31,000
wondering whether it got it right in the first place,

31
0:01:32.528,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and still trying to find a way

32
0:01:34.568,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to keep on shining regardless.

33
0:01:37.528,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of India, New Delhi.

34
0:01:41.768,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And my father was a freedom fighter.

35
0:01:44.288,000 --> 0:01:47,000
My mother was, well, just a fighter like mothers are.

36
0:01:49.368,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And much like the original homo sapiens,

37
0:01:52.408,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we struggled to survive.

38
0:01:54.728,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When I was in my early 20s,

39
0:01:56.888,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I lost both my parents,

40
0:01:58.648,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which I must admit seems a bit careless of me now,

41
0:02:02.008,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but --

42
0:02:03.328,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:08.848,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I do remember the night my father died,

44
0:02:10.768,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I remember the driver of a neighbor who was driving us to the hospital.

45
0:02:15.688,000 --> 0:02:17,000
He mumbled something about "dead people don't tip so well"

46
0:02:18.528,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and walked away into the dark.

47
0:02:20.808,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I was only 14 then,

48
0:02:22.728,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and I put my father's dead body in the back seat of the car,

49
0:02:26.208,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and my mother besides me,

50
0:02:27.448,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I started driving back from the hospital to the house.

51
0:02:30.048,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And in the middle of her quiet crying, my mother looked at me and she said,

52
0:02:33.688,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"Son, when did you learn to drive?"

53
0:02:37.848,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And I thought about it and realized, and I said to my mom,

54
0:02:41.128,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"Just now, Mom."

55
0:02:42.448,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:44.728,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So from that night onwards,

57
0:02:46.288,000 --> 0:02:48,000
much akin to humanity in its adolescence,

58
0:02:49.008,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I learned the crude tools of survival.

59
0:02:52.968,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And the framework of life was very, very simple then, to be honest.

60
0:02:56.648,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You know, you just ate what you got

61
0:02:59.648,000 --> 0:03:,000
and did whatever you were told to do.

62
0:03:01.488,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I thought celiac was a vegetable,

63
0:03:04.848,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's lost comrade in "Star Trek."

64
0:03:09.408,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:10.528,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You married the first girl that you dated,

66
0:03:13.528,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and you were a techie if you could fix the carburetor in your car.

67
0:03:18.928,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I really thought that gay was a sophisticated English word for happy.

68
0:03:23.648,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital of Portugal, as you all know.

69
0:03:26.928,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:28.208,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Where was I?

71
0:03:32.528,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We relied on systems

72
0:03:34.888,000 --> 0:03:37,000
created through the toil and sacrifice of generations before

73
0:03:38.608,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to protect us,

74
0:03:40.088,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and we felt that governments actually worked for our betterment.

75
0:03:43.768,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Science was simple and logical,

76
0:03:45.728,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Apple was still then just a fruit

77
0:03:49.128,000 --> 0:03:5,000
owned by Eve first and then Newton,

78
0:03:51.088,000 --> 0:03:53,000
not by Steve Jobs, until then.

79
0:03:53.448,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And "Eureka!" was what you screamed

80
0:03:55.168,000 --> 0:03:57,000
when you wanted to run naked on the streets.

81
0:03:58.048,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You went wherever life took you for work,

82
0:04:01.688,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and people were mostly welcoming of you.

83
0:04:04.408,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Migration was a term then

84
0:04:06.408,000 --> 0:04:08,000
still reserved for Siberian cranes, not human beings.

85
0:04:09.808,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Most importantly, you were who you were

86
0:04:12.688,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and you said what you thought.

87
0:04:15.208,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Then in my late 20s,

88
0:04:16.488,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I shifted to the sprawling metropolis of Mumbai,

89
0:04:20.248,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and my framework,

90
0:04:21.608,000 --> 0:04:24,000
like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity,

91
0:04:24.928,000 --> 0:04:25,000
began to alter.

92
0:04:26.768,000 --> 0:04:28,000
In the urban rush for a new, more embellished survival,

93
0:04:30.207,000 --> 0:04:32,000
things started to look a little different.

94
0:04:32.248,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I met people who had descended from all over the world,

95
0:04:35.968,000 --> 0:04:38,000
faces, races, genders, money-lenders.

96
0:04:39.208,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Definitions became more and more fluid.

97
0:04:42.088,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Work began to define you at that time

98
0:04:45.208,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,

99
0:04:47.888,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me,

100
0:04:50.768,000 --> 0:04:53,000
almost too thick to hold on

101
0:04:53.928,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to the diversity of mankind

102
0:04:55.928,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the human need to progress and grow.

103
0:04:59.328,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Ideas were flowing with more freedom and speed.

104
0:05:03.208,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And I experienced the miracle of human innovation and cooperation,

105
0:05:08.568,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and my own creativity,

106
0:05:10.008,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when supported by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor,

107
0:05:14.528,000 --> 0:05:15,000
catapulted me into superstardom.

108
0:05:16.968,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I started to feel that I had arrived,

109
0:05:19.408,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and generally, by the time I was 40, I was really, really flying.

110
0:05:22.928,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I was all over the place.

111
0:05:24.208,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You know? I'd done 50 films by then

112
0:05:26.248,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and 200 songs,

113
0:05:28.608,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.

114
0:05:30.888,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I had been given the highest civil honor by the French government,

115
0:05:34.208,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the title of which for the life of me I can't pronounce even until now.

116
0:05:37.568,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:38.648,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I'm sorry, France, and thank you, France, for doing that.

118
0:05:42.088,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But much bigger than that, I got to meet Angelina Jolie --

119
0:05:45.448,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:48.208,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for two and a half seconds.

121
0:05:49.728,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:51.048,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere.

123
0:05:53.768,000 --> 0:05:54,000
OK, maybe not.

124
0:05:55.008,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I sat next to Hannah Montana on a round dinner table

125
0:05:58.568,000 --> 0:06:,000
with her back towards me most of the time.

126
0:06:01.408,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Like I said, I was flying, from Miley to Jolie,

127
0:06:04.568,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and humanity was soaring with me.

128
0:06:07.848,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We were both pretty much flying off the handle, actually.

129
0:06:11.088,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And then you all know what happened.

130
0:06:13.328,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The internet happened.

131
0:06:15.568,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I was in my late 40s,

132
0:06:17.528,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and I started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage

133
0:06:21.088,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and assuming that, you know, people who peered into my world

134
0:06:24.088,000 --> 0:06:25,000
would admire it

135
0:06:25.368,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for the miracle I believed it to be.

136
0:06:27.488,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But something else awaited me and humanity.

137
0:06:30.568,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You know, we had expected an expansion of ideas and dreams

138
0:06:35.488,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with the enhanced connectivity of the world.

139
0:06:38.848,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We had not bargained for the village-like enclosure of thought,

140
0:06:46.528,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of judgment, of definition

141
0:06:48.568,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that flowed from the same place

142
0:06:50.728,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that freedom and revolution was taking place in.

143
0:06:54.328,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Everything I said took a new meaning.

144
0:06:56.728,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --

145
0:06:59.648,000 --> 0:07:02,000
was there for the world to comment upon and judge.

146
0:07:03.008,000 --> 0:07:05,000
As a matter of fact, everything I didn't say or do also

147
0:07:06.408,000 --> 0:07:07,000
met with the same fate.

148
0:07:08.528,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Four years ago,

149
0:07:10.768,000 --> 0:07:13,000
my lovely wife Gauri and me decided to have a third child.

150
0:07:15.808,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It was claimed on the net

151
0:07:18.608,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that he was the love child

152
0:07:20.728,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of our first child

153
0:07:22.528,000 --> 0:07:23,000
who was 15 years old.

154
0:07:24.608,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Apparently, he had sown his wild oats with a girl

155
0:07:27.728,000 --> 0:07:29,000
while driving her car in Romania.

156
0:07:30.808,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And yeah, there was a fake video to go with it.

157
0:07:33.448,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And we were so disturbed as a family.

158
0:07:35.288,000 --> 0:07:36,000
My son, who is 19 now,

159
0:07:36.568,000 --> 0:07:37,000
even now when you say "hello" to him,

160
0:07:38.408,000 --> 0:07:39,000
he just turns around and says,

161
0:07:39.888,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"But bro, I didn't even have a European driving license."

162
0:07:42.608,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:45.088,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Yeah.

164
0:07:46.848,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In this new world,

165
0:07:48.568,000 --> 0:07:51,000
slowly, reality became virtual and virtual became real,

166
0:07:51.968,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and I started to feel

167
0:07:53.648,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that I could not be who I wanted to be or say what I actually thought,

168
0:07:57.208,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and humanity at this time

169
0:08:00.128,000 --> 0:08:01,000
completely identified with me.

170
0:08:02.088,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I think both of us were going through our midlife crisis,

171
0:08:06.128,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and humanity, like me, was becoming an overexposed prima donna.

172
0:08:10.248,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I started to sell everything,

173
0:08:11.968,000 --> 0:08:13,000
from hair oil to diesel generators.

174
0:08:14.888,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Humanity was buying everything

175
0:08:16.928,000 --> 0:08:18,000
from crude oil to nuclear reactors.

176
0:08:19.328,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You know, I even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit

177
0:08:23.328,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to reinvent myself.

178
0:08:26.088,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I must admit I failed miserably.

179
0:08:28.848,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And just an aside I want to say on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men

180
0:08:33.888,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and Supermen of the world,

181
0:08:36.008,000 --> 0:08:37,000
you have to commend them,

182
0:08:37.888,000 --> 0:08:39,000
because it really hurts in the crotch, that superhero suit.

183
0:08:40.688,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:41.768,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Yeah, I'm being honest. I need to tell you this here.

185
0:08:45.768,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Really.

186
0:08:47.008,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And accidentally, I happened to even invent a new dance form

187
0:08:50.568,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which I didn't realize, and it became a rage.

188
0:08:52.727,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So if it's all right,

189
0:08:53.967,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and you've seen a bit of me, so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.

190
0:08:57.168,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It was called the Lungi dance.

191
0:08:58.648,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So if it's all right, I'll just show you. I'm talented otherwise.

192
0:09:01.768,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Cheers)

193
0:09:03.008,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So it went something like this.

194
0:09:05.688,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

195
0:09:08.128,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance.

196
0:09:10.568,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi.

197
0:09:13.248,000 --> 0:09:14,000
That's it. It became a rage.

198
0:09:14.928,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Cheers)

199
0:09:16.248,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It really did.

200
0:09:19.768,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Like you notice, nobody could make any sense of what was happening except me,

201
0:09:23.448,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and I didn't give a damn, really,

202
0:09:25.088,000 --> 0:09:27,000
because the whole world, and whole humanity,

203
0:09:27.328,000 --> 0:09:28,000
seemed as confused and lost as I was.

204
0:09:30.368,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I didn't give up then.

205
0:09:31.648,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media

206
0:09:34.448,000 --> 0:09:35,000
like everyone else does.

207
0:09:35.728,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I thought if I put on philosophical tweets out there

208
0:09:38.488,000 --> 0:09:39,000
people will think I'm with it,

209
0:09:40.088,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but some of the responses I got from those tweets

210
0:09:42.688,000 --> 0:09:45,000
were extremely confusing acronyms which I didn't understand. You know?

211
0:09:46.048,000 --> 0:09:48,000
ROFL, LOL.

212
0:09:48.128,000 --> 0:09:52,000
"Adidas," somebody wrote back to one of my more thought-provoking tweets

213
0:09:52.448,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and I was wondering why would you name a sneaker,

214
0:09:54.808,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I mean, why would you write back the name of a sneaker to me?

215
0:09:57.728,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter, and she enlightened me.

216
0:10:00.608,000 --> 0:10:02,000
"Adidas" now means "All day I dream about sex."

217
0:10:04.128,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

218
0:10:06.408,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Really.

219
0:10:07.728,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I didn't know if you know that.

220
0:10:09.248,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So I wrote back, "WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,

221
0:10:13.848,000 --> 0:10:17,000
thanking secretly that some acronyms and things won't change at all.

222
0:10:19.008,000 --> 0:10:2,000
WTF.

223
0:10:22.008,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But here we are.

224
0:10:24.208,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I am 51 years old, like I told you,

225
0:10:25.928,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,

226
0:10:29.528,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I just want to tell you

227
0:10:30.848,000 --> 0:10:33,000
if there has been a momentous time for humanity to exist,

228
0:10:34.088,000 --> 0:10:35,000
it is now,

229
0:10:35.728,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because the present you is brave.

230
0:10:39.128,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The present you is hopeful.

231
0:10:40.488,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The present you is innovative and resourceful,

232
0:10:43.808,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and of course, the present you is annoyingly indefinable.

233
0:10:48.128,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And in this spell-binding,

234
0:10:50.608,000 --> 0:10:51,000
imperfect moment of existence,

235
0:10:52.568,000 --> 0:10:54,000
feeling a little brave just before I came here,

236
0:10:55.168,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I decided to take a good, hard look at my face.

237
0:10:59.488,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And I realized that I'm beginning to look more and more

238
0:11:03.168,000 --> 0:11:05,000
like the wax statue of me at Madame Tussaud's.

239
0:11:05.608,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:07.888,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Yeah, and in that moment of realization,

241
0:11:10.408,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me:

242
0:11:16.088,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Do I need to fix my face?

243
0:11:19.208,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,

244
0:11:22.568,000 --> 0:11:25,000
a modern expression of human creativity.

245
0:11:25.968,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The land I come from

246
0:11:27.528,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is the source of inexplicable but very simple spirituality.

247
0:11:33.688,000 --> 0:11:34,000
In its immense generosity,

248
0:11:36.208,000 --> 0:11:38,000
India decided somehow

249
0:11:38.968,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that I, the Muslim son of a broke freedom fighter

250
0:11:42.968,000 --> 0:11:45,000
who accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams,

251
0:11:47.728,000 --> 0:11:5,000
should become its king of romance,

252
0:11:52.648,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the "Badhshah of Bollywood,"

253
0:11:55.688,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the greatest lover the country has ever seen ...

254
0:11:59.328,000 --> 0:12:,000
with this face.

255
0:12:01.048,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Yeah.

256
0:12:02.288,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

257
0:12:03.408,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Which has alternately been described as ugly, unconventional,

258
0:12:06.328,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and strangely, not chocolatey enough.

259
0:12:08.168,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Laughter)

260
0:12:13.488,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The people of this ancient land

261
0:12:15.848,000 --> 0:12:17,000
embraced me in their limitless love,

262
0:12:18.288,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and I've learned from these people

263
0:12:20.848,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that neither power nor poverty

264
0:12:24.048,000 --> 0:12:25,000
can make your life more magical

265
0:12:25.768,000 --> 0:12:26,000
or less tortuous.

266
0:12:27.768,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I've learned from the people of my country

267
0:12:30.408,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that the dignity of a life,

268
0:12:32.528,000 --> 0:12:35,000
a human being, a culture, a religion, a country

269
0:12:37.168,000 --> 0:12:38,000
actually resides in its ability

270
0:12:40.208,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for grace and compassion.

271
0:12:42.328,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I've learned that whatever moves you,

272
0:12:45.088,000 --> 0:12:47,000
whatever urges you to create, to build,

273
0:12:47.808,000 --> 0:12:48,000
whatever keeps you from failing,

274
0:12:49.488,000 --> 0:12:51,000
whatever helps you survive,

275
0:12:51.768,000 --> 0:12:55,000
is perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known to mankind,

276
0:12:56.168,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and that is love.

277
0:12:59.328,000 --> 0:13:01,000
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,

278
0:13:02.248,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Recites poem in Hindi)

279
0:13:12.928,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Poem ends)

280
0:13:14.608,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Which loosely translates into that whatever --

281
0:13:17.208,000 --> 0:13:19,000
yeah, if you know Hindi, please clap, yeah.

282
0:13:19.308,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

283
0:13:20.768,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It's very difficult to remember.

284
0:13:23.248,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Which loosely translates into actually saying

285
0:13:25.848,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that all the books of knowledge that you might read

286
0:13:28.328,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and then go ahead and impart your knowledge

287
0:13:31.248,000 --> 0:13:34,000
through innovation, through creativity, through technology,

288
0:13:34.608,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but mankind will never be the wiser about its future

289
0:13:37.768,000 --> 0:13:43,000
unless it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings.

290
0:13:44.528,000 --> 0:13:47,000

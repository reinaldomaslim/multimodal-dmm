1
0:00:12.458,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I think it's safe to say

2
0:00:14.276,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that all humans will be intimate with death

3
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
at least once in their lives.

4
0:00:21.1,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But what if that intimacy began

5
0:00:23.117,000 --> 0:00:25,000
long before you faced your own transition

6
0:00:25.406,000 --> 0:00:27,000
from life into death?

7
0:00:28.2,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What would life be like

8
0:00:30.129,000 --> 0:00:33,000
if the dead literally lived alongside you?

9
0:00:33.725,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In my husband's homeland

10
0:00:35.651,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the highlands of Sulawesi island

11
0:00:38.331,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in eastern Indonesia,

12
0:00:40.358,000 --> 0:00:42,000
there is a community of people that experience death

13
0:00:42.827,000 --> 0:00:44,000
not as a singular event

14
0:00:45.448,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but as a gradual social process.

15
0:00:49.2,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In Tana Toraja,

16
0:00:50.997,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the most important social moments in people's lives,

17
0:00:54.035,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the focal points of social and cultural interaction

18
0:00:57.381,000 --> 0:01:01,000
are not weddings or births or even family dinners,

19
0:01:02.096,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but funerals.

20
0:01:04.59,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So these funerals are characterized

21
0:01:06.919,000 --> 0:01:07,000
by elaborate rituals

22
0:01:08.83,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt

23
0:01:12.345,000 --> 0:01:14,000
based on the amount of animals --

24
0:01:14.482,000 --> 0:01:18,000
pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo --

25
0:01:19.476,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that are sacrificed and distributed

26
0:01:22.159,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in the name of the deceased.

27
0:01:24.926,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So this cultural complex surrounding death,

28
0:01:28.663,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the ritual enactment of the end of life,

29
0:01:32.291,000 --> 0:01:34,000
has made death the most visible

30
0:01:34.871,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.

31
0:01:39.7,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Lasting anywhere from a few days

32
0:01:42.128,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to a few weeks,

33
0:01:43.968,000 --> 0:01:46,000
funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair,

34
0:01:47.11,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where commemorating someone who's died

35
0:01:50.152,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is not so much a private sadness

36
0:01:52.743,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but more of a publicly shared transition.

37
0:01:57.811,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And it's a transition that's just as much

38
0:02:00.212,000 --> 0:02:02,000
about the identity of the living

39
0:02:02.414,000 --> 0:02:05,000
as it is about remembrance of the dead.

40
0:02:06.227,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So every year, thousands of visitors

41
0:02:08.721,000 --> 0:02:1,000
come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were,

42
0:02:11.285,000 --> 0:02:13,000
this culture of death,

43
0:02:13.349,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and for many people these grandiose ceremonies

44
0:02:16.935,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and the length of the ceremonies

45
0:02:19.693,000 --> 0:02:21,000
are somehow incommensurable

46
0:02:22.437,000 --> 0:02:26,000
with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.

47
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So even as we share death as a universal experience,

48
0:02:33.274,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it's not experienced the same way the world over.

49
0:02:37.416,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And as an anthropologist,

50
0:02:39.684,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I see these differences in experience

51
0:02:42.146,000 --> 0:02:46,000
being rooted in the cultural and social world

52
0:02:46.895,000 --> 0:02:51,000
through which we define the phenomena around us.

53
0:02:52.071,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So where we see an unquestionable reality,

54
0:02:56.956,000 --> 0:03:,000
death as an irrefutable biological condition,

55
0:03:01.879,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Torajans see the expired corporeal form

56
0:03:05.184,000 --> 0:03:08,000
as part of a larger social genesis.

57
0:03:08.996,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So again, the physical cessation of life

58
0:03:13.792,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is not the same as death.

59
0:03:16.741,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In fact, a member of society is only truly dead

60
0:03:20.324,000 --> 0:03:23,000
when the extended family can agree upon

61
0:03:23.758,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and marshal the resources necessary

62
0:03:26.102,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to hold a funeral ceremony

63
0:03:27.888,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that is considered appropriate in terms of resources

64
0:03:31.54,000 --> 0:03:33,000
for the status of the deceased.

65
0:03:34.235,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And this ceremony has to take place

66
0:03:36.507,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in front of the eyes of the whole community

67
0:03:38.669,000 --> 0:03:4,000
with everyone's participation.

68
0:03:41.276,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So after a person's physical death,

69
0:03:44.146,000 --> 0:03:46,000
their body is placed in a special room

70
0:03:46.885,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.

71
0:03:49.941,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And the tongkonan is symbolic

72
0:03:52.089,000 --> 0:03:56,000
not only of the family's identity

73
0:03:56.191,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but also of the human life cycle from birth to death.

74
0:03:59.888,000 --> 0:04:,000
So essentially, the shape of the building

75
0:04:01.787,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that you're born into is the shape

76
0:04:03.831,000 --> 0:04:04,000
of the structure which carries you

77
0:04:05.725,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to your ancestral resting place.

78
0:04:09.421,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Until the funeral ceremony,

79
0:04:11.701,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which can be held years after a person's physical death,

80
0:04:16.648,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person,

81
0:04:22.363,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or "to mama," a person who is asleep,

82
0:04:26.706,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and they continue to be a member of the household.

83
0:04:30.489,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They are symbolically fed and cared for,

84
0:04:33.848,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and the family at this time

85
0:04:35.73,000 --> 0:04:37,000
will begin a number of ritual injunctions,

86
0:04:38.643,000 --> 0:04:4,000
which communicates to the wider community around them

87
0:04:41.605,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that one of their members is undergoing the transition

88
0:04:44.427,000 --> 0:04:47,000
from this life into the afterlife

89
0:04:47.462,000 --> 0:04:49,000
known as Puya.

90
0:04:49.722,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So I know what some of you must be thinking right now.

91
0:04:52.444,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Is she really saying that these people live

92
0:04:55.22,000 --> 0:04:58,000
with the bodies of their dead relatives?

93
0:04:58.288,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And that's exactly what I'm saying.

94
0:05:01.36,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction

95
0:05:04.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we have to this idea of proximity to bodies,

96
0:05:08.378,000 --> 0:05:1,000
proximity to death,

97
0:05:10.512,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or how this notion just does not fit

98
0:05:13.032,000 --> 0:05:16,000
into our very biological or medical

99
0:05:16.284,000 --> 0:05:18,000
sort of definition of death,

100
0:05:19.088,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I like to think about what the Torajan way

101
0:05:22.175,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of viewing death encompasses of the human experience

102
0:05:26.931,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that the medical definition leaves out.

103
0:05:31.964,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I think that Torajans socially recognize

104
0:05:35.705,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and culturally express

105
0:05:38.835,000 --> 0:05:4,000
what many of us feel to be true

106
0:05:41.297,000 --> 0:05:43,000
despite the widespread acceptance

107
0:05:43.721,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of the biomedical definition of death,

108
0:05:48.468,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and that is that our relationships with other humans,

109
0:05:52.363,000 --> 0:05:55,000
their impact on our social reality,

110
0:05:55.869,000 --> 0:05:57,000
doesn't cease with the termination

111
0:05:58.345,000 --> 0:06:01,000
of the physical processes of the body,

112
0:06:02.326,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that there's a period of transition

113
0:06:04.969,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as the relationship between the living and the dead

114
0:06:09.19,000 --> 0:06:13,000
is transformed but not ended.

115
0:06:14.043,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship

116
0:06:18.881,000 --> 0:06:19,000
by lavishing love and attention

117
0:06:20.723,000 --> 0:06:23,000
on the most visible symbol of that relationship,

118
0:06:23.993,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the human body.

119
0:06:25.77,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So my husband has fond memories

120
0:06:28.594,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of talking to and playing with

121
0:06:31.14,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and generally being around his deceased grandfather,

122
0:06:34.601,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and for him there is nothing unnatural about this.

123
0:06:37.876,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is a natural part of the process

124
0:06:40.805,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as the family comes to terms with the transition

125
0:06:44.274,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in their relationship to the deceased,

126
0:06:46.966,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and this is the transition from relating to the deceased

127
0:06:49.455,000 --> 0:06:51,000
as a person who's living

128
0:06:51.725,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to relating to the deceased

129
0:06:53.627,000 --> 0:06:54,000
as a person who's an ancestor.

130
0:06:55.453,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And here you can see these wooden effigies

131
0:06:57.638,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of the ancestors,

132
0:06:58.841,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so these are people who have already been buried,

133
0:07:00.432,000 --> 0:07:01,000
already had a funeral ceremony.

134
0:07:01.898,000 --> 0:07:03,000
These are called tau tau.

135
0:07:04.808,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So the funeral ceremony itself

136
0:07:07.328,000 --> 0:07:1,000
embodies this relational perspective on death.

137
0:07:11.224,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It ritualizes the impact of death on families

138
0:07:15.607,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and communities.

139
0:07:17.83,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And it's also a moment of self-awareness.

140
0:07:20.998,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's a moment when people think about who they are,

141
0:07:24.127,000 --> 0:07:27,000
their place in society,

142
0:07:27.632,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and their role in the life cycle

143
0:07:29.935,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in accordance with Torajan cosmology.

144
0:07:34.128,000 --> 0:07:35,000
There's a saying in Toraja

145
0:07:35.782,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that all people will become grandparents,

146
0:07:38.916,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and what this means is that after death,

147
0:07:41.297,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we all become part of the ancestral line

148
0:07:44.146,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that anchors us between the past and the present

149
0:07:47.954,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and will define who our loved ones are into the future.

150
0:07:52.943,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So essentially, we all become grandparents

151
0:07:55.732,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to the generations of human children

152
0:07:58.146,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that come after us.

153
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And this metaphor of membership

154
0:08:03.389,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in the greater human family

155
0:08:05.519,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is the way that children also describe

156
0:08:07.364,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the money that they invest

157
0:08:08.942,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in these sacrificial buffaloes

158
0:08:10.913,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that are thought to carry people's soul

159
0:08:12.955,000 --> 0:08:14,000
from here to the afterlife,

160
0:08:15.125,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and children will explain

161
0:08:16.711,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that they will invest the money in this

162
0:08:19.29,000 --> 0:08:21,000
because they want to repay their parents

163
0:08:21.717,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the debt for all of the years their parents spent

164
0:08:24.962,000 --> 0:08:26,000
investing and caring for them.

165
0:08:27.476,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But the sacrifice of buffalo

166
0:08:30.186,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and the ritual display of wealth

167
0:08:32.873,000 --> 0:08:35,000
also exhibits the status of the deceased,

168
0:08:35.928,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and, by extension, the deceased's family.

169
0:08:39.22,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed

170
0:08:43.348,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but also transformed

171
0:08:45.661,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in a ritual drama that highlights

172
0:08:48.301,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the most salient feature about death in this place:

173
0:08:52.079,000 --> 0:08:57,000
its impact on life and the relationships of the living.

174
0:08:57.345,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So all of this focus on death

175
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire

176
0:09:02.796,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to the ideal of a long life.

177
0:09:05.472,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They engage in many practices

178
0:09:07.541,000 --> 0:09:09,000
thought to confer good health

179
0:09:09.669,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and survival to an advanced age.

180
0:09:12.533,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But they don't put much stock

181
0:09:14.7,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness

182
0:09:19.699,000 --> 0:09:21,000
or in old age.

183
0:09:22.354,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's said in Toraja that everybody has

184
0:09:24.217,000 --> 0:09:26,000
sort of a predetermined amount of life.

185
0:09:26.954,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's called the sunga'.

186
0:09:28.932,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool

187
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to its natural end.

188
0:09:34.94,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So by having death as a part

189
0:09:37.488,000 --> 0:09:41,000
of the cultural and social fabric of life,

190
0:09:41.657,000 --> 0:09:43,000
people's everyday decisions about their health

191
0:09:44.63,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and healthcare are affected.

192
0:09:47.931,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan,

193
0:09:51.058,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Nenet Katcha,

194
0:09:53.13,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.

195
0:09:58.783,000 --> 0:10:,000
And there are increasing signs

196
0:10:00.885,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.

197
0:10:05.528,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And his death will be greatly mourned.

198
0:10:10.459,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But I know that my husband's family

199
0:10:12.675,000 --> 0:10:14,000
looks forward to the moment

200
0:10:14.893,000 --> 0:10:17,000
when they can ritually display

201
0:10:18.55,000 --> 0:10:22,000
what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives,

202
0:10:23.283,000 --> 0:10:24,000
when they can ritually recount

203
0:10:25.021,000 --> 0:10:27,000
his life's narrative,

204
0:10:27.036,000 --> 0:10:28,000
weaving his story

205
0:10:28.8,000 --> 0:10:32,000
into the history of their community.

206
0:10:32.822,000 --> 0:10:35,000
His story is their story.

207
0:10:36.654,000 --> 0:10:41,000
His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.

208
0:10:42.426,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And it's a story that has no discernible beginning,

209
0:10:46.211,000 --> 0:10:48,000
no foreseeable end.

210
0:10:48.832,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's a story that goes on

211
0:10:50.768,000 --> 0:10:54,000
long after his body no longer does.

212
0:10:55.42,000 --> 0:10:59,000
People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed

213
0:10:59.94,000 --> 0:11:01,000
by participating in a culture

214
0:11:02.66,000 --> 0:11:04,000
where the physical manifestations of death

215
0:11:05.331,000 --> 0:11:06,000
greet us at every turn.

216
0:11:07.11,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But I see something profoundly transformative

217
0:11:10.34,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in experiencing death as a social process

218
0:11:13.755,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and not just a biological one.

219
0:11:17.011,000 --> 0:11:21,000
In reality, the relationship between the living and the dead

220
0:11:21.075,000 --> 0:11:24,000
has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system,

221
0:11:24.365,000 --> 0:11:26,000
where decisions about how long to stretch

222
0:11:26.908,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the thread of life are made based on our emotional

223
0:11:30.181,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and social ties with the people around us,

224
0:11:32.806,000 --> 0:11:37,000
not just on medicine's ability to prolong life.

225
0:11:37.925,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We, like the Torajans,

226
0:11:40.65,000 --> 0:11:42,000
base our decisions about life

227
0:11:43.445,000 --> 0:11:46,000
on the meanings and the definitions

228
0:11:47.093,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that we ascribe to death.

229
0:11:49.357,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience

230
0:11:52.9,000 --> 0:11:54,000
should run out and adopt the traditions

231
0:11:55.132,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of the Torajans.

232
0:11:56.754,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It might be a little bit difficult

233
0:11:58.346,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to put into play in the United States.

234
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But I want to ask what we can gain

235
0:12:03.561,000 --> 0:12:07,000
from seeing physical death not only as a biological process

236
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but as part of the greater human story.

237
0:12:12.492,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What would it be like to look on

238
0:12:15.023,000 --> 0:12:18,000
the expired human form with love

239
0:12:18.472,000 --> 0:12:21,000
because it's so intimately a part of who we all are?

240
0:12:22.196,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If we could expand our definition of death

241
0:12:25.083,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to encompass life,

242
0:12:27.494,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we could experience death as part of life

243
0:12:31.408,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and perhaps face death

244
0:12:33.67,000 --> 0:12:37,000
with something other than fear.

245
0:12:38.133,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges

246
0:12:41.076,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that are facing the U.S. healthcare system,

247
0:12:43.929,000 --> 0:12:45,000
particularly in the end-of-life care,

248
0:12:46.355,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is as simple as a shift in perspective,

249
0:12:49.385,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and the shift in perspective in this case

250
0:12:51.402,000 --> 0:12:56,000
would be to look at the social life of every death.

251
0:12:57.03,000 --> 0:13:,000
It might help us recognize that the way we limit

252
0:13:00.515,000 --> 0:13:01,000
our conversation about death

253
0:13:02.191,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to something that's medical or biological

254
0:13:05.226,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is reflective of a larger culture that we all share

255
0:13:09.049,000 --> 0:13:14,000
of avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.

256
0:13:14.699,000 --> 0:13:18,000
If we could entertain and value

257
0:13:19.139,000 --> 0:13:22,000
other kinds of knowledge about life,

258
0:13:22.262,000 --> 0:13:25,000
including other definitions of death,

259
0:13:25.936,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it has the potential to change the discussions

260
0:13:28.138,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that we have about the end of life.

261
0:13:31.885,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It could change the way that we die,

262
0:13:35.978,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but more importantly,

263
0:13:37.99,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it could transform the way that we live.

264
0:13:45.101,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Applause)

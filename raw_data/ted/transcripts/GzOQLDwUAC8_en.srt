1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just

2
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions

3
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
about with happiness is, what gives happiness --

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or happiness, which I equate with joy in my

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
particular area, and I think there's something very

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And

9
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we

10
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
something about these things where our

12
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:01,000
expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing

13
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected

14
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and

15
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you find a joyful experience. You look at those

16
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what

17
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you'd expect. And there's something joyful about

18
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all

19
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try

20
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and do in my lecture is go a little bit further

21
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and see if I can violate your expectations in a

22
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that

23
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try

24
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,

25
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so I can make the audience here happy.

26
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I'm going to show you some ways that we can

27
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
violate your expectations. First of all, I want to

28
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
show you the particular illusion here. I want you

29
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
first of all when it pops up on the screen to

30
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
notice that the two holes are perpendicular to

31
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:55,000
each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These

32
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:06,000
are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now

33
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped

34
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the film here so you can get a very interesting

35
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
experience. I want you to see how this illusion is

36
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see

37
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates

38
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.

39
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very

40
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it

41
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's

42
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:4,000
true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does

43
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do

44
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop

45
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it from happening. No. It's difficult.

46
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And we can violate your expectations in a whole

47
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
variety of ways about representation, about shape,

48
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
about color and so forth and it's very primal. And

49
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it's an interesting question to ponder, why these

50
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:1,000
things -- we find these things joyful. Why would

51
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we find them joyful? So, here's something that

52
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of

53
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:16,000
little things like this.

54
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what

55
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
you would see. In other words, it's not a camera

56
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
cut. It's a perceptual trick.

57
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
OK. We can violate your expectations about

58
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:58,000
shape.

59
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We can violate your expectations on representation

60
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
-- what an image represents. What do you see here?

61
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:32,000
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand

62
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised

63
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,

64
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the

65
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
best example of priming by experience that I know.

66
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
If you are a child under the age of 10 who

67
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this

68
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:57,000
image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults

69
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?"

70
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground --

71
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to

72
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll

73
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,

74
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also

75
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on

76
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
experience.

77
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now, something like this can be used because this

78
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is after all talk about design, too. This was

79
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got

80
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at

81
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of

82
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
provocative positions. But they got it passed, and

83
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do

84
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:44,000
these things.

85
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did

86
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
when the Florida ballot was going around. You

87
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for

88
0:05:58,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Bush; count 'em again ...

89
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
You can violate your expectations about

90
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:12,000
experience. Here is an outside water fountain that

91
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I created with some friends of mine, but you can

92
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
stop the water in drops and -- actually make all

93
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the drops levitate. This is something we're

94
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
building for, you know, amusement parks and that

95
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
kind of stuff.

96
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now let's take a static image. Can you see this?

97
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Do you see the middle section moving down and the

98
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
outer sections moving up? It's completely static.

99
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's a static image. How many people see this

100
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
illusion? It's completely static.

101
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we

102
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
look at an image we see, you know, color, depth,

103
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
texture. And you can look at this whole scene and

104
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than

105
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is

106
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.

107
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people

108
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
got irritated when they tried to talk to the

109
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
woman and she wouldn't respond.

110
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this

111
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:24,000
building in New York. So that when you see it from

112
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,

113
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and when you walk around to the other side it

114
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
looks like the balconies go down. So there are

115
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
cases where you have mistakes in design that

116
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:38,000
incorporate illusions.

117
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Or, you take this particular un-retouched

118
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:48,000
photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot

119
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of emails from people who say, "Is there any

120
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
perceptual difference between males and females?"

121
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate

122
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
through the world just as well as males can -- and

123
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
why wouldn't they? However, this is the one

124
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
illusion that women can consistently do better

125
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
than males: in matching which head because they

126
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.

127
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show

128
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
design in illusions. I believe that the first

129
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:25,000
example of illusions being used purposely was by

130
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So

131
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that when you saw from one little angle was like

132
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
this. And this little technique got popular in the

133
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
16th century and the 17th century to disguise

134
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and

135
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:47,000
see it from one little point of view like this.

136
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But these are early incorporations of illusions

137
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
brought to -- sort of high point with Hans

138
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Holbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked

139
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you

140
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
could walk down from the stair and you can see

141
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:03,000
this hidden skull.

142
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:07,000
All right, now I'm going to show you some

143
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
designers who work with illusions to give that

144
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott

145
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions

146
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one

147
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
here on TED and happiness.

148
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is

149
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
going to be a delightful talk and he has some of

150
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:53,000
his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we

151
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
-- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur

152
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Ganson.

153
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that

154
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:18,000
was appropriate here.

155
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And figure goes to ground.

156
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And for the musicians.

157
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And of course, since happiness -- we want "joy to the

158
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:02,000
world."

159
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now, another great designer -- he's very well

160
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:18,000
known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just

161
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
builds some fantastic things. This is simply

162
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view

163
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:36,000
it from one particular angle, you see its

164
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.

165
0:11:54,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Pianist transforms to violinist.

166
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is really wild. This assemblage of forks,

167
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded

168
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn

169
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
something in the sort of thing that I do, which

170
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is there are people out there with a lot of time

171
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:35,000
on their hands.

172
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like

173
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells --

174
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging

175
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:53,000
them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after

176
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:56,000
all, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with

177
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:,000
the universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched

178
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:06,000
keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John

179
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil

180
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:11,000
cabinets.

181
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running

182
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've

183
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:22,000
created, some new type of illusions. I've done

184
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:26,000
something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So

185
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
you see these kids the same size here, running

186
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
down the hall. The two table tops of the same size.

187
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
They're looking out two directions at once. You

188
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:44,000
have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And

189
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that's something for you to think about, all

190
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within

191
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which

192
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:57,000
is impossible. You can see the two kids are

193
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
looking out simultaneously out of two different

194
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:05,000
directions at once. Now can you believe these two

195
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:1,000
table tops are the same size and shape? They are.

196
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,

197
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
those two figures are identical in size and shape.

198
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort

199
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
of rendered fashion, how much stronger the

200
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought

201
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
you a little joy and happiness, and if you're

202
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
interested in seeing more cool effects, see me

203
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.

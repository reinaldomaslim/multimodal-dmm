1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, this is a story

2
0:00:14.904,000 --> 0:00:15,000
about how we know what we know.

3
0:00:17.69,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's a story about this woman,

4
0:00:20.611,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Natalia Rybczynski.

5
0:00:22.912,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She's a paleobiologist,

6
0:00:24.984,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.

7
0:00:28.837,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."

8
0:00:32.363,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Latif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting

9
0:00:35.016,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because of where she digs that stuff up,

10
0:00:36.954,000 --> 0:00:4,000
way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.

11
0:00:41.901,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now, one summer day in 2006,

12
0:00:44.98,000 --> 0:00:47,000
she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed,

13
0:00:48.195,000 --> 0:00:52,000
which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.

14
0:00:52.797,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Audio) NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting,

15
0:00:55.548,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS

16
0:00:59.602,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.

17
0:01:03.704,000 --> 0:01:05,000
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.

18
0:01:06.403,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,

19
0:01:08.594,000 --> 0:01:09,000
about the size of the palm of my hand.

20
0:01:10.553,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was just lying on the surface.

21
0:01:12.871,000 --> 0:01:15,000
LN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood,

22
0:01:16.347,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because that's the sort of thing people had found

23
0:01:18.664,000 --> 0:01:21,000
at the Fyles Leaf Bed before -- prehistoric plant parts.

24
0:01:22.107,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But that night, back at camp ...

25
0:01:24.94,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,

26
0:01:26.893,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing

27
0:01:29.314,000 --> 0:01:31,000
it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings.

28
0:01:31.742,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Maybe it's a preservation thing,

29
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but it looks really like ...

30
0:01:35.628,000 --> 0:01:36,000
bone.

31
0:01:36.853,000 --> 0:01:38,000
LN: Huh. So over the next four years,

32
0:01:39.766,000 --> 0:01:41,000
she went to that spot over and over,

33
0:01:42.724,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone,

34
0:01:48.284,000 --> 0:01:49,000
most of them really tiny.

35
0:01:50.522,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Ziploc bag.

36
0:01:54.982,000 --> 0:01:57,000
LN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle.

37
0:01:58.941,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But it was challenging.

38
0:02:00.41,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Audio) NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces,

39
0:02:03.254,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good.

40
0:02:07.536,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.

41
0:02:12.727,000 --> 0:02:13,000
LN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?

42
0:02:14.34,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:15.804,000 --> 0:02:17,000
LN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.

44
0:02:18.571,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.

45
0:02:21.365,000 --> 0:02:23,000
LN: How certain were you that you had it right,

46
0:02:23.588,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that you had put it together in the right way?

47
0:02:25.757,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way

48
0:02:28.795,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and have, like, a parakeet or something?

49
0:02:30.761,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:32.15,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no. No, we got this.

51
0:02:36.242,000 --> 0:02:39,000
LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone,

52
0:02:40.107,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal,

53
0:02:44.131,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so something like a cow or a sheep.

54
0:02:47.004,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But it couldn't have been either of those.

55
0:02:49.488,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It was just too big.

56
0:02:51.822,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Audio) NR: The size of this thing, it was huge. It's a really big animal.

57
0:02:55.91,000 --> 0:02:57,000
LN: So what animal could it be?

58
0:02:59.291,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments

59
0:03:01.895,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,

60
0:03:04.491,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and they had an idea.

61
0:03:06.244,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Audio) NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it,

62
0:03:11.315,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.

63
0:03:18.521,000 --> 0:03:2,000
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.

64
0:03:21.308,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It was a smell that Natalia recognized

65
0:03:23.965,000 --> 0:03:26,000
from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab:

66
0:03:27.932,000 --> 0:03:28,000
collagen.

67
0:03:29.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.

68
0:03:31.801,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And usually, after so many years,

69
0:03:33.983,000 --> 0:03:34,000
it breaks down.

70
0:03:35.158,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.

71
0:03:40.19,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,

72
0:03:43.837,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley

73
0:03:47.055,000 --> 0:03:52,000
was demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting."

74
0:03:53.284,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It turns out that different species have slightly different structures

75
0:03:56.951,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of collagen,

76
0:03:58.127,000 --> 0:04:,000
so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone,

77
0:04:00.967,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you can compare it to those of known species,

78
0:04:03.185,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and, who knows, maybe you get a match.

79
0:04:06.546,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So she shipped him one of the fragments,

80
0:04:09.849,000 --> 0:04:1,000
FedEx.

81
0:04:11.167,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.

82
0:04:15.001,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:16.278,000 --> 0:04:17,000
LN: And he processed it,

84
0:04:17.493,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.

85
0:04:22.674,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And he found a match.

86
0:04:24.824,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone

87
0:04:29.46,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic

88
0:04:33.729,000 --> 0:04:34,000
belonged to ...

89
0:04:36.031,000 --> 0:04:37,000
a camel.

90
0:04:37.372,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:39.127,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing -- if it's true.

92
0:04:43.449,000 --> 0:04:45,000
LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments,

93
0:04:45.525,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they got the same result for each one.

94
0:04:48.197,000 --> 0:04:53,000
However, based on the size of the bone that they found,

95
0:04:53.641,000 --> 0:04:59,000
it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.

96
0:05:00.028,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So this camel would have been about nine feet tall,

97
0:05:03.242,000 --> 0:05:04,000
weighed around a ton.

98
0:05:04.464,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Audience reacts)

99
0:05:05.539,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Yeah.

100
0:05:06.612,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.

101
0:05:10.129,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:14.396,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now, when you hear the word "camel,"

103
0:05:16.738,000 --> 0:05:19,000
what may come to mind is one of these,

104
0:05:21.507,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.

105
0:05:24.895,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain

106
0:05:28.404,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is one of these, the dromedary,

107
0:05:31.983,000 --> 0:05:33,000
quintessential desert creature --

108
0:05:34.435,000 --> 0:05:38,000
hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara,

109
0:05:38.778,000 --> 0:05:39,000
has a big old hump on its back

110
0:05:40.282,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for storing water for those long desert treks,

111
0:05:42.823,000 --> 0:05:45,000
has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.

112
0:05:46.918,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?

113
0:05:53.719,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out,

114
0:05:56.53,000 --> 0:05:58,000
even before Natalia's discovery,

115
0:05:59.116,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that camels are actually originally American.

116
0:06:04.758,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)

117
0:06:10.482,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:11.965,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They started here.

119
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:17,000
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around,

120
0:06:18.378,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you could only find them in North America,

121
0:06:21.561,000 --> 0:06:24,000
around 20 different species, maybe more.

122
0:06:24.838,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?

123
0:06:28.107,000 --> 0:06:3,000
NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.

124
0:06:30.566,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You'll have some with really long necks,

125
0:06:32.502,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so they're actually functionally like giraffes.

126
0:06:35.345,000 --> 0:06:38,000
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.

127
0:06:38.441,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Audio) NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small,

128
0:06:42.049,000 --> 0:06:44,000
almost like rabbits.

129
0:06:44.576,000 --> 0:06:46,000
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?

130
0:06:47.447,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.

131
0:06:48.908,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So those ones you probably would not recognize.

132
0:06:51.167,000 --> 0:06:53,000
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.

133
0:06:53.381,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Audio) NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?

134
0:06:55.449,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:56.645,000 --> 0:06:58,000
LN: And then about three to seven million years ago,

136
0:06:59.328,000 --> 0:07:01,000
one branch of camels went down to South America,

137
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
where they became llamas and alpacas,

138
0:07:05.138,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge

139
0:07:08.084,000 --> 0:07:09,000
into Asia and Africa.

140
0:07:09.544,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And then around the end of the last ice age,

141
0:07:11.989,000 --> 0:07:14,000
North American camels went extinct.

142
0:07:15.893,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, scientists knew all of that already,

143
0:07:18.337,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.

144
0:07:24.437,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.

145
0:07:29.135,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now to be fair,

146
0:07:31.66,000 --> 0:07:32,000
three and a half million years ago,

147
0:07:33.367,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.

148
0:07:37.49,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So it would have been boreal forest,

149
0:07:40.449,000 --> 0:07:43,000
so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.

150
0:07:44.853,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters

151
0:07:48.583,000 --> 0:07:5,000
where the ponds would freeze over.

152
0:07:50.83,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You'd have blizzards.

153
0:07:52.322,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.

154
0:07:55.957,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Like, how ... How?

155
0:07:58.962,000 --> 0:08:02,000
How is it that one of these Saharan superstars

156
0:08:03.144,000 --> 0:08:06,000
could ever have survived those arctic conditions?

157
0:08:06.399,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

158
0:08:09.399,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.

159
0:08:13.632,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And it's kind of brilliant.

160
0:08:16.7,000 --> 0:08:22,000
What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited

161
0:08:23.257,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to places like the Sahara,

162
0:08:25.249,000 --> 0:08:28,000
actually evolved to help it get through the winter?

163
0:08:29.448,000 --> 0:08:33,000
What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand,

164
0:08:34.169,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?

165
0:08:37.792,000 --> 0:08:39,000
What if that hump -- which, huge news to me,

166
0:08:40.617,000 --> 0:08:42,000
does not contain water, it contains fat --

167
0:08:43.015,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:44.618,000 --> 0:08:47,000
was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter,

169
0:08:48.243,000 --> 0:08:49,000
when food was scarce?

170
0:08:49.944,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge

171
0:08:53.681,000 --> 0:08:57,000
did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?

172
0:08:58.123,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes

173
0:09:02.221,000 --> 0:09:04,000
because having all your fat in one place,

174
0:09:04.717,000 --> 0:09:06,000
like a, you know, fat backpack,

175
0:09:07.482,000 --> 0:09:09,000
means that you don't have to have that insulation

176
0:09:10.034,000 --> 0:09:11,000
all over the rest of your body.

177
0:09:11.817,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So it helps heat dissipate easier.

178
0:09:14.555,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's this crazy idea,

179
0:09:17.42,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature

180
0:09:22.991,000 --> 0:09:25,000
could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.

181
0:09:27.832,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.

182
0:09:31.566,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology

183
0:09:36.54,000 --> 0:09:39,000
or as a keyhole into the future of climate change.

184
0:09:40.855,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But I love it for a totally different reason.

185
0:09:43.751,000 --> 0:09:45,000
For me, it's a story about us,

186
0:09:46.537,000 --> 0:09:47,000
about how we see the world

187
0:09:48.529,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and about how that changes.

188
0:09:51.658,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So I was trained as a historian.

189
0:09:55.054,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.

190
0:09:59.331,000 --> 0:10:,000
They make sense of the past.

191
0:10:00.904,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.

192
0:10:06.741,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And as a historian,

193
0:10:08.242,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.

194
0:10:13.196,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Audio) NR: We make up stories and we stick with it,

195
0:10:15.705,000 --> 0:10:16,000
like the camel in the desert, right?

196
0:10:17.451,000 --> 0:10:19,000
That's a great story! It's totally adapted for that.

197
0:10:19.921,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Clearly, it always lived there.

198
0:10:22.174,000 --> 0:10:26,000
LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.

199
0:10:26.5,000 --> 0:10:28,000
You could learn some tiny thing

200
0:10:28.723,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.

201
0:10:32.706,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard

202
0:10:36.508,000 --> 0:10:37,000
of what she thought was wood,

203
0:10:38.279,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory

204
0:10:43.341,000 --> 0:10:46,000
about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature

205
0:10:46.98,000 --> 0:10:47,000
looks the way it does.

206
0:10:48.536,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel.

207
0:10:53.964,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It went from being this ridiculously niche creature

208
0:10:58.37,000 --> 0:11:,000
suited only to this one specific environment,

209
0:11:00.743,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara,

210
0:11:06.055,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and could end up virtually anywhere.

211
0:11:09.88,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Applause)

212
0:11:26.396,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This is Azuri.

213
0:11:28.589,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Azuri, hi, how are you doing?

214
0:11:31.493,000 --> 0:11:33,000
OK, here, I've got one of these for you here.

215
0:11:34.065,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

216
0:11:36.135,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig

217
0:11:40.342,000 --> 0:11:42,000
at the Radio City Music Hall.

218
0:11:42.589,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Laughter)

219
0:11:44.762,000 --> 0:11:45,000
That's not even a joke.

220
0:11:46.717,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Anyway --

221
0:11:48.478,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But really, Azuri is here as a living reminder

222
0:11:52.859,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that the story of our world is a dynamic one.

223
0:11:57.13,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.

224
0:12:01.861,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

225
0:12:06.162,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Right, Azuri?

226
0:12:07.637,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away

227
0:12:14.077,000 --> 0:12:16,000
from seeing the world anew.

228
0:12:16.926,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Thank you very much.

229
0:12:18.11,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

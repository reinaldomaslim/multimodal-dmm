1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I went to Spain a few months ago

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I had the best foie gras of my life.

3
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The best culinary experience of my life.

4
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Because what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.

5
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Ridiculous, right?

6
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Foie gras and the future of cooking.

7
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?

8
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I mean, it's crucified.

9
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.

11
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,

12
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
you risk being attacked.

13
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.

14
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I'm not saying that there's not a rationale

15
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
for being opposed to foie gras.

16
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.

17
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Basically you take a goose or a duck

18
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.

19
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.

20
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Its liver expands by eight times.

21
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.

22
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.

23
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I mean, I love the stuff.

25
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.

26
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.

27
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
Can we produce a menu that's delicious without foie gras?

28
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Yes, sure.

29
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?

30
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

31
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Not a lot of people are doing it.

32
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And for good reason.

33
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,

35
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Eduardo Sousa.

36
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.

37
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Natural foie gras.

38
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
What's natural about foie gras?

39
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,

40
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
geese and ducks gorge on food

41
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to prepare for the harsh realities of winter.

42
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land

43
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and eat what they want.

44
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So no gavage, no force feeding,

45
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
no factory-like conditions, no cruelty.

46
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And it's shockingly not a new idea.

47
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
His great-granddad started -- Patería de Sousa -- in 1812.

48
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And they've been doing it quietly ever since.

49
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That is until last year,

50
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,

51
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the coveted French gastronomic prize.

52
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's like the Olympics of food products.

53
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
He placed first for his foie gras.

54
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Big, big problem.

55
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.

56
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
He said it sort of gleefully.

58
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It was all over the papers.

59
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I read about it. It was in Le Monde.

60
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him.

61
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Spanish chef accused of cheating."

62
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They accused him of paying off the judges.

63
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.

64
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Huh, amazing.

65
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
A huge scandal for a few weeks.

66
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Couldn't find a shred of evidence.

67
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now, look at the guy.

68
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges

69
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
for his foie gras.

70
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So that died down, and very soon afterward,

71
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
new controversy.

72
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.

73
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It's not foie gras because it's not gavage.

74
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There's no force feeding.

75
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified.

76
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
As funny as it sounds, articulating it now and reading about it --

77
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
actually, if we had talked about it before this controversy,

78
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I would have said, "That's kind of true."

79
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You know, foie gras by definition, force feeding, it's gavage,

80
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that's what you get when you want foie gras.

81
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,

82
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.

83
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex

84
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
and then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,

85
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is utterly simple.

86
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And he said to me, really from the first moment,

87
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
my life's work is to give the geese what they want.

88
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.

89
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I'm just here to give the geese what they want.

90
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Actually, when I showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone

91
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
taking pictures of them

92
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
like his children in the grass.

93
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Amazing.

94
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
He's really just in love with -- he's at one with --

95
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
he's the goose whisperer.

96
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And when I was speaking to him, you know, I thought,

98
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
like I'm speaking to you now, right,

99
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but sort of in the middle of my questions, my excited questions,

100
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
because the more I got to know him and his system,

101
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the more exciting this whole idea became.

102
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
He kept going like this to me.

103
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?

104
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever,

105
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so you know, I slowed down.

106
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And finally, by the end of the day I was like,

107
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Ed-uar-do, you know like this?

108
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But he was still going like this.

109
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I figured it out.

110
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I was speaking too loudly.

111
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So I hushed my voice.

112
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator

113
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in kind of a half whisper.

114
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And he stopped doing this.

115
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around --

116
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"Get the hell away from this kid!" --

117
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.

118
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Right up to us, like right up to here.

119
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Right along the fence line.

120
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And fence line was amazing in itself.

121
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The fence -- like this conception of fence that we have

122
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it's totally backward with him.

123
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The electricity on this fiberglass fence

124
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is only on the outside.

125
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
He rewired it. He invented it.

126
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
I've never seen it. Have you?

127
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.

128
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He doesn't.

129
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
He electrifies only the outside.

130
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Why?

131
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese --

132
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this --

133
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.

134
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden

135
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
with figs and everything else.

136
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He felt like they felt manipulated.

137
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So he got rid of the electricity,

138
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
he got rid of current on the inside

139
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and kept it on the outside,

140
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.

141
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Now, what happened?

142
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They ate, and he showed me on a chart,

143
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.

144
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The landscape is incredible.

145
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I mean, his farm is incredible.

146
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It really is the Garden of Eden.

147
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
There's figs and everything else there for the taking.

148
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And the irony of ironies is because Extremadura, the area --

149
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
what does Extremadura mean?

150
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Extra hard land, right?

151
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Extra difficult. Extra hard.

152
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But over four generations, he and his family

153
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.

154
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Upgrades the life for these geese.

155
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And they are allowed to take whatever they want.

156
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Another irony, the double irony

157
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is that on the figs and the olives,

158
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Eduardo can make more money selling those

159
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
than he can on the foie gras.

160
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He doesn't care.

161
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
He lets them take what they want and he says,

162
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"Usually, it's about 50 percent. They're very fair."

163
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The other 50 percent, he takes and he sells and he makes money on them.

164
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Part of the income for his farm.

165
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
A big part of his income for his farm.

166
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But he never controls it.

167
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They get what they want,

168
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
they leave the rest for me and I sell it.

169
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
His biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace,

170
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which demands these days bright yellow foie gras.

171
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's how I've been trained.

172
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You want to look and see what good foie gras is,

173
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
it's got to be bright yellow.

174
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It's the indication that it's the best foie gras.

175
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Well, because he doesn't force feed,

176
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because he doesn't gavage tons of corn,

177
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
his livers were pretty grey.

178
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Or they were.

179
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.

180
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.

181
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
He let it go to seed, he took the seeds,

182
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.

183
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And the geese love the Lupin bush.

184
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Not for the bush, but for the seeds.

185
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.

186
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Radioactive yellow.

187
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Bright yellow.

188
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.

189
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So I'm listening to all this, you know, and I'm like,

191
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?

192
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Is he like, you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything,

193
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and it was always nature.

194
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It was never him.

195
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,

196
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.

197
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Because, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?

198
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity

199
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
into working with his landscape.

200
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,

201
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but increasingly, eating up his every word.

202
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.

203
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And he grabs my arm and the translator's,

204
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this."

205
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.

206
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"Shush, watch this."

207
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And this squadron of geese come over.

208
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
[Clapping]

209
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.

210
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And like airport traffic control, as they start to go past us

211
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they're called back -- and they're called back and back and back.

212
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And then they circle around.

213
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.

214
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
[Clapping]

215
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And the wild geese are calling down.

216
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
[Clapping]

217
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And it's getting louder and louder and they circle and circle

218
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and they land.

219
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
And I'm just saying, "No way."

220
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Laughter)

221
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
No way.

222
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And I look at Eduardo, who's near tears looking at this,

223
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and I say, "You're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese

224
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to say come for a visit?"

225
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And he says, "No, no, no.

226
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
They've come to stay."

227
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They've come to stay?

228
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?

230
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I said that. I said "Isn't that what they're put on this Earth for?

231
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?"

232
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
He said, "No, no, no.

233
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.

234
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
To happiness.

235
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
They find it here.

236
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
They don't need anything more."

237
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
They stop. They mate with his domesticated geese,

238
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and his flock continues.

239
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Think about that for a minute.

240
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It's brilliant, right?

241
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Imagine -- I don't know, imagine a hog farm

242
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in, like, North Carolina,

243
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm

244
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and decides to stay.

245
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

246
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So how did it taste?

247
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I finally got to taste it before I left.

248
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
He took me to his neighborhood restaurant

249
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.

250
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It was incredible.

251
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And the problem with saying that, of course, is that

252
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.

253
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.

254
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,

255
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,

256
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
this guy's a genius, you know?

257
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I'm really in love with him at this point.

258
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
But it truly was the best foie gras of my life.

259
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.

260
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I'd had something that was called foie gras.

261
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
But this was transformative. Really transformative.

262
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And I say to you, I might not stick to this,

263
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again

264
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because of that taste experience with Eduardo.

265
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It was sweet, it was unctuous.

266
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It had all the qualities of foie gras,

267
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.

268
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.

269
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And I kept -- I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.

270
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I was sure of it.

271
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And I'm not like some super taster, you know?

272
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But I can taste things.

273
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
There's 100 percent star anise in there.

274
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And he says, "No."

275
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And I ended up like going down the spices,

276
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,

277
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
thinking he's salted and peppered his liver.

278
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But no.

279
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras,

280
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
he sticks them in this jar

281
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and he confits it.

282
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.

283
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
What?

284
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We went back out for the final tour of the farm,

285
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and he showed me the wild pepper plants

286
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity.

287
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He doesn't need salt and pepper.

288
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And he doesn't need spices, because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors

289
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that his geese love to gorge on.

290
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I turned to him at the end of the meal,

291
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and it's a question I asked several times,

292
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and he hadn't, kind of, answered me directly,

293
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but I said, "Now look, you're in Spain,

294
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
some of the greatest chefs in the world are --

295
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Ferran Adria, the preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.

296
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
How come you don't give him this?

297
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
How come no one's really heard of you?"

298
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And it may be because of the wine,

299
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
or it may be because of my excitement,

300
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
he answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras."

301
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

302
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And he was right.

303
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
He was right.

304
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.

305
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
They create a dish

306
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
where all the vectors point at us.

307
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.

308
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And as he said, I think fittingly,

309
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.

310
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Simple.

311
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I flew home, I'm on the flight with my little black book

312
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and I took, you know, pages and pages of notes about it.

313
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I really was moved.

314
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And in the corner of one of these -- one of my notes,

315
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
is this note that says, when asked,

316
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
what do you think of conventional foie gras?

317
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
What do you think of foie gras that

318
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
99.99999 percent of the world eats?

319
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
He said, "I think it's an insult to history."

320
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And I wrote, insult to history.

321
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair out.

322
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
It's like, why didn't I follow up on that?

323
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
What the hell does that mean?

324
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
Insult to history.

325
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So I did some research when I got back,

326
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and here's what I found.

327
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The history of foie gras.

328
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Jews invented foie gras.

329
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
True story.

330
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
True story.

331
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
By accident.

332
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.

333
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Gotten sick of the chicken fat.

334
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
They were looking for an alternative.

335
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And they saw in the fall that there was this natural,

336
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.

337
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And they slaughtered them, used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.

338
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
The Pharaoh got wind of this --

339
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
This is true, right off the Internet.

340
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
The Pharaoh got -- (Laughter)

341
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I swear to God.

342
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Laughter)

343
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
The Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.

344
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
He tasted it and fell in love with it.

345
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
He started demanding it.

346
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And he didn't want it just in the fall, he wanted it all year round.

347
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.

348
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And the Jews, fearing for their life,

349
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
had to come up with an ingenious idea,

350
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.

351
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And they invented, what? Gavage.

352
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
They invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives,

353
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and they provided the Pharaoh with gavage liver,

354
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and the good stuff they kept for themselves.

355
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one.

356
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
That's the history of foie gras.

357
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And if you think about it,

358
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
it's the history of industrial agriculture.

359
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
It's the history of what we eat today.

360
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Most of what we eat today.

361
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Mega-farms, feed lots, chemical amendments,

362
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
long-distance travel, food processing.

363
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
All of it, our food system.

364
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
That's also an insult to history.

365
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
It's an insult to the basic laws of nature

366
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and of biology.

367
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Whether we're talking about beef cattle

368
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
or we're talking about chickens,

369
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
or we're talking about broccoli or Brussels sprouts,

370
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
or in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish --

371
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
which wholesale are going out of business.

372
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.

373
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
It's rooted in extraction.

374
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Take more, sell more, waste more.

375
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And for the future it won't serve us.

376
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Jonas Salk has a great quote.

377
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
He said, "If all the insects disappeared,

378
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.

379
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish."

380
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And he's right.

381
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
We need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture.

382
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Really new.

383
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
One in which we stop treating the planet

384
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
as if it were some kind of business in liquidation.

385
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And stop degrading resources under the guise of

386
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
cheap food.

387
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.

388
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Farmers that rely on nature

389
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
for solutions, for answers,

390
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
rather than imposing solutions on nature.

391
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
Listening as Janine Benyus,

392
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic says,

393
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
"Listening to nature's operating instructions."

394
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
That's what Eduardo does, and does so brilliantly.

395
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think,

396
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
is that the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs,

397
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
and for people that care about food and cooking,

398
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
is that the most ecological choice for food

399
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
is also the most ethical choice for food.

400
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.

401
0:19:58.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise,

402
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
but almost always, the most delicious choice.

403
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
That's serendipitous.

404
0:20:08.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Thank you.

405
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi everyone.

2
0:00:14.08,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I would like to introduce you to Laika.

3
0:00:17.68,000 --> 0:00:21,000
To most of us, Laika is simply a very cute pig.

4
0:00:22.8,000 --> 0:00:28,000
However, to hundreds of thousands of patients in need of a lifesaving organ

5
0:00:29.36,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Laika is a symbol of hope.

6
0:00:32.96,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You see, ever since the 1970s,

7
0:00:36.08,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when organ transplants became a real option

8
0:00:39.4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for patients with kidney failure and other organ diseases,

9
0:00:43.64,000 --> 0:00:45,000
organ supply has been an issue.

10
0:00:46.92,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Over the last few decades,

11
0:00:48.84,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the issue only worsened as organ demand has exponentially increased.

12
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Currently in the US,

13
0:00:57.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
there are close to 115,000 patients

14
0:01:01.92,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in need of a lifesaving organ transplant.

15
0:01:05.52,000 --> 0:01:06,000
By the end of my talk,

16
0:01:07.36,000 --> 0:01:1,000
one more patient will be added to this list.

17
0:01:12.12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Today, about 100 people will get a new organ,

18
0:01:16.519,000 --> 0:01:18,000
a chance to start their life anew,

19
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and yet by the end of today,

20
0:01:22.36,000 --> 0:01:24,000
20 others will die waiting.

21
0:01:26.24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The situation is heartbreaking

22
0:01:28.76,000 --> 0:01:3,000
for patients, for their families

23
0:01:31.68,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and for the doctors who want to do more.

24
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In some parts of the world,

25
0:01:37.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the situation also becomes a disturbing social issue.

26
0:01:42.12,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In Asia, for example,

27
0:01:44.12,000 --> 0:01:48,000
media outlets reported that desperate patients

28
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:51,000
are obtaining organs from the cruel black market.

29
0:01:53.6,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It is clear that a solution is needed to this crisis.

30
0:01:59.04,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Human lives are at stake.

31
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
As a biologist and a geneticist,

32
0:02:06.24,000 --> 0:02:09,000
it has become my mission to help solve this problem.

33
0:02:10.76,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Today, I am optimistic to say that we are on our way there,

34
0:02:15.8,000 --> 0:02:16,000
thanks to Laika.

35
0:02:17.6,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Using gene editing technology,

36
0:02:19.96,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it's now possible to exquisitely create a human-transplantable organ

37
0:02:25.84,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that can be safely grown in pigs.

38
0:02:29.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Before we jump into the incredible science that makes it happen,

39
0:02:34.2,000 --> 0:02:38,000
let's have a better understanding what xenotransplantation is.

40
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's a process of transplanting animal organs into humans.

41
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You may want to ask, why pig organs?

42
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Because some pigs carry organs with similar size and physiology

43
0:02:52.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to human organs.

44
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Over the last half a century,

45
0:02:56.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
pioneers of transplantation have tried hard to make it happen,

46
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but with limited to no success.

47
0:03:05.08,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Why is that?

48
0:03:06.88,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Two fundamental hurdles stood in the way.

49
0:03:10.24,000 --> 0:03:13,000
First is a problem of rejection.

50
0:03:13.44,000 --> 0:03:16,000
When our immune system sees a new organ as foreign,

51
0:03:17.28,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it will reject it.

52
0:03:19.4,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Second, and this one is specific to the organs from the pig,

53
0:03:24.76,000 --> 0:03:28,000
every pig carries a virus that is benign to the pig,

54
0:03:29.2,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but can be transmitted into humans.

55
0:03:31.88,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It is called the porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV),

56
0:03:37.4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and this virus has the potential to cause a viral epidemic similar to HIV.

57
0:03:44.28,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Without an effective way to address these issues,

58
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the field of xenotransplantation has been on hold for more than one decade.

59
0:03:55.6,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Little progress has been made, until now.

60
0:04:01.48,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Let me share with you how I got here today with Laika.

61
0:04:06.28,000 --> 0:04:1,000
My journey started from Emei Mountain in China.

62
0:04:10.32,000 --> 0:04:14,000
That is the place well described in a lot of legendary stories,

63
0:04:14.76,000 --> 0:04:16,000
like the "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

64
0:04:17.84,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That is the place I call home.

65
0:04:20.92,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Growing up in the mountain,

66
0:04:22.68,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I started to have a strong connection with nature.

67
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is me when I was seven years old

68
0:04:29.76,000 --> 0:04:32,000
standing in front of an ancient Buddhist temple

69
0:04:33.2,000 --> 0:04:35,000
with a monkey on my shoulder.

70
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I still vividly remember how my friends and I

71
0:04:38.84,000 --> 0:04:41,000
would toss peanuts around to distract the monkeys

72
0:04:42.04,000 --> 0:04:44,000
so that we could cross to hike through the valley.

73
0:04:45.84,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I love nature.

74
0:04:47.36,000 --> 0:04:49,000
When it was time to choose a field of study,

75
0:04:50.24,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I chose to study biology at Peking University in Beijing.

76
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:04:57,000
However, the more I learned,

77
0:04:58.28,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the more questions I had.

78
0:05:00.52,000 --> 0:05:04,000
How could our genetic makeup be so similar to animals

79
0:05:05.08,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and yet we look so different?

80
0:05:07.92,000 --> 0:05:11,000
How is our immune system capable of fighting off so many pathogens

81
0:05:12.8,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but smart enough not to attack ourselves.

82
0:05:16.28,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Questions like this tormented me.

83
0:05:19.88,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I know it sounds nerdy, but you know I'm a scientist.

84
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
After college, I decided I didn't want to just ask the questions,

85
0:05:29.28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I wanted to answer them, so I did.

86
0:05:33.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In 2008, I was lucky enough to be accepted

87
0:05:37.64,000 --> 0:05:4,000
into the PhD program at Harvard University

88
0:05:41.2,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and worked with Dr. George Church.

89
0:05:43.92,000 --> 0:05:44,000
While working in Church's lab,

90
0:05:45.68,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I started to learn and experiment with the genetic makeup of mammals.

91
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Among all the experiments,

92
0:05:53.48,000 --> 0:05:56,000
one particular one took me closer to Laika.

93
0:05:57.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In 2013, my colleagues and I made changes in a human cell

94
0:06:03.48,000 --> 0:06:05,000
using a tool you may have heard about

95
0:06:05.96,000 --> 0:06:06,000
called CRISPR.

96
0:06:07.52,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We were one of the first two groups

97
0:06:10.76,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to report the successful use of such a tool in changing our DNA.

98
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It was an exciting moment in scientific discovery.

99
0:06:20.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The gene-editing tool CRISPR has two components.

100
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It has a scissor called the enzyme CRISPR

101
0:06:28.68,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and what is called a guide RNA.

102
0:06:31.92,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Think about it as genetic scissors with a microscope.

103
0:06:36.08,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The microscope is a guide RNA,

104
0:06:39.2,000 --> 0:06:43,000
which brings the scissors to the place we want to cut

105
0:06:43.24,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and says, "Here it is,"

106
0:06:45.28,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the enzyme CRISPR just cuts and repairs the DNA in the way we want.

107
0:06:51.72,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Shortly after we reported our study,

108
0:06:54.96,000 --> 0:06:59,000
physicians at Mass General Hospital were intrigued by the medical applications

109
0:07:00.92,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of our research.

110
0:07:02.52,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They reached out to us,

111
0:07:04.04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and together, we began to see the potential to use CRISPR

112
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to solve the organ shortage crisis.

113
0:07:11.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
How do we do it?

114
0:07:13.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It is simple, yet very complex.

115
0:07:18.08,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We started by making changes in a pig's cell to make it virus-free

116
0:07:24.12,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and human-immune-compatible.

117
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The nucleus of that cell is then implanted into a pig egg

118
0:07:31.72,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and allowed to divide into an embryo.

119
0:07:34.64,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The resulting embryo is then placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother

120
0:07:39.96,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and allowed to divide into a pig.

121
0:07:42.68,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Basically, it's a process of cloning.

122
0:07:45.76,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The piglet then carries organs whose genetic makeup

123
0:07:49.64,000 --> 0:07:52,000
hopefully wouldn't be rejected by the human immune system.

124
0:07:54.96,000 --> 0:08:,000
In 2015, our team decided to tackle the viral transmission problem first.

125
0:08:01.4,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We wanted to take out all 62 copies of the PERV virus

126
0:08:07.6,000 --> 0:08:08,000
from the pig genome,

127
0:08:10.2,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but at the time, it was nearly mission impossible.

128
0:08:14.36,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Even with CRISPR,

129
0:08:15.8,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we could only do one or two modifications within a cell.

130
0:08:20.64,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The record for number of modifications we can do in a particular cell was five.

131
0:08:27.2,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We had to increase the throughput by more than tenfold to achieve that.

132
0:08:33.4,000 --> 0:08:36,000
With very careful design and hundreds of trials,

133
0:08:37.08,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we successfully took out all the virus,

134
0:08:40.32,000 --> 0:08:41,000
broke the record.

135
0:08:41.92,000 --> 0:08:43,000
More importantly, our studies showed

136
0:08:44.4,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that we could eliminate the possibility of this dangerous virus

137
0:08:49.48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
being transmitted into humans.

138
0:08:53.08,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Last year, with a modified cell and cloning technology,

139
0:08:57.48,000 --> 0:09:,000
our startup, eGenesis, produced Laika,

140
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the first pig of its kind born without PERV.

141
0:09:07.48,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Applause)

142
0:09:11.24,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Laika represents the first critical step

143
0:09:15.24,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in establishing safe xenotransplantation.

144
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It is also a platform

145
0:09:20.92,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that we can do further genetic modification on

146
0:09:23.92,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to solve the immunology problem.

147
0:09:26.76,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Since then, we have created more than 30 pigs without PERV,

148
0:09:31.88,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and they may be the most advanced geno-modified animal living on earth.

149
0:09:38.4,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We named Laika after the Soviet dog

150
0:09:41.72,000 --> 0:09:44,000
who was the first animal to orbit the earth.

151
0:09:45.6,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We hope Laika and her siblings

152
0:09:48.6,000 --> 0:09:52,000
can lead us into a new frontier of science and medicine.

153
0:09:55.36,000 --> 0:10:,000
Imagine a world where patients who suffer from liver failure

154
0:10:00.52,000 --> 0:10:02,000
can be saved with a new liver

155
0:10:03.2,000 --> 0:10:06,000
without having to wait for a donation

156
0:10:06.28,000 --> 0:10:07,000
or another human to die.

157
0:10:09.6,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Imagine a world where people with diabetes

158
0:10:13.72,000 --> 0:10:16,000
do not have to rely on insulin after every meal

159
0:10:17.48,000 --> 0:10:21,000
because we can provide them with good pancreatic cells

160
0:10:21.6,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that can produce insulin on their own.

161
0:10:24.6,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And imagine a world where patients with kidney failure

162
0:10:29.6,000 --> 0:10:32,000
do not have to face the burden of dialysis.

163
0:10:34.32,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We are striving to create that world,

164
0:10:38.08,000 --> 0:10:4,000
a world without organ shortage.

165
0:10:41.72,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We finally have the tool to tackle the problem

166
0:10:45.48,000 --> 0:10:47,000
we could never tackle before,

167
0:10:47.64,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and Laika is just the beginning of our journey.

168
0:10:52.04,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We have to be very humble in front of nature,

169
0:10:55.6,000 --> 0:10:57,000
because there are more issues to be addressed,

170
0:10:58.24,000 --> 0:10:59,000
including immunology

171
0:10:59.88,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and things we couldn't even anticipate at this point.

172
0:11:04.76,000 --> 0:11:1,000
However, it is our responsibility to translate the cutting-edge science

173
0:11:10.92,000 --> 0:11:15,000
into medicine to save the lives of all the patients who are waiting.

174
0:11:17.48,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Thank you very much.

175
0:11:18.76,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Applause)

176
0:11:29.8,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Chris Anderson: I mean, Luhan, this is extraordinary work here.

177
0:11:33.32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Come forward.

178
0:11:35.64,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So what's the next steps here? You've got rid of the virus.

179
0:11:40.08,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The next steps involve trying to get to the point

180
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:45,000
where a human body won't reject a transplant.

181
0:11:46.24,000 --> 0:11:47,000
What's involved in solving that?

182
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Luhan Yang: It's a very complicated process.

183
0:11:51.44,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So we need to take out the antigen of the pigs.

184
0:11:55.92,000 --> 0:11:58,000
In addition, we can learn a lot from cancer.

185
0:11:59.36,000 --> 0:12:03,000
How can cancer invade or circumvent our immune system

186
0:12:03.56,000 --> 0:12:07,000
so that we can utilize the trick of cancer

187
0:12:08.04,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and implement that on the pig organ

188
0:12:10.4,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to fool our immune system to not attack the organ.

189
0:12:15.68,000 --> 0:12:18,000
CA: When would you estimate, when do you hope

190
0:12:19.08,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that the first successful transplant would happen?

191
0:12:23.36,000 --> 0:12:26,000
LY: It would be irresponsible for me to give you any number.

192
0:12:28.2,000 --> 0:12:3,000
CA: We're at TED. We're always irresponsible.

193
0:12:30.76,000 --> 0:12:31,000
LY: But we are working day and night

194
0:12:32.52,000 --> 0:12:34,000
trying to make this happen for the patients.

195
0:12:35.44,000 --> 0:12:37,000
CA: So not even, you won't say that you think it could happen

196
0:12:38.36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
within a decade or within five years or something?

197
0:12:40.76,000 --> 0:12:42,000
LY: For sure we hope it happens within one decade.

198
0:12:44.08,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Laughter)

199
0:12:46.04,000 --> 0:12:49,000
CA: So there's a lot of people here who would be very, very excited at that,

200
0:12:49.68,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the potential is extraordinary.

201
0:12:51.2,000 --> 0:12:53,000
There will be some other people here who are going,

202
0:12:53.64,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"That pig is too cute.

203
0:12:54.92,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Humans shouldn't be exploiting something so cute for our benefit."

204
0:12:59.52,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Do you have any response to that?

205
0:13:03.12,000 --> 0:13:04,000
LY: Yeah, sure.

206
0:13:04.4,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So imagine one pig can save eight people's lives.

207
0:13:09.32,000 --> 0:13:12,000
In addition, similar to human donation,

208
0:13:12.44,000 --> 0:13:14,000
if we only harvest one kidney from the pig,

209
0:13:15.2,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the pig can still be alive,

210
0:13:17.12,000 --> 0:13:21,000
so we are very mindful about the issues,

211
0:13:21.2,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but I think our goal is just to address the unmet medical need

212
0:13:25.6,000 --> 0:13:27,000
for those patients and their families.

213
0:13:28.32,000 --> 0:13:31,000
CA: Plus, no one can say that to you if they eat bacon, right?

214
0:13:32.44,000 --> 0:13:33,000
LY: That's a good point.

215
0:13:33.68,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Laughter)

216
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
CA: Luhan, thank you so much. LY: Thank you so much.

217
0:13:37.64,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:17.17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Recently, I flew over a crowd

2
0:00:19.521,000 --> 0:00:21,000
of thousands of people in Brazil

3
0:00:21.906,000 --> 0:00:24,000
playing music by George Frideric Handel.

4
0:00:25.539,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam,

5
0:00:28.543,000 --> 0:00:31,000
again playing music by this same composer.

6
0:00:31.918,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Let's take a look.

7
0:00:34.685,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Allegro." Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)

8
0:00:53.888,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Video) Daria van den Bercken: I live there on the third floor.

9
0:00:55.96,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(In Dutch) I live there on the corner.

10
0:00:57.849,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I actually live there, around the corner.

11
0:00:59.457,000 --> 0:01:,000
and you'd be really welcome.

12
0:01:01.133,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Man: (In Dutch) Does that sound like fun? Child: (In Dutch) Yes!

13
0:01:03.952,000 --> 0:01:06,000
[(In Dutch) "Handel house concert"]

14
0:01:28.722,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Applause)

15
0:01:40.236,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real

16
0:01:42.154,000 --> 0:01:45,000
magical experience for hundreds of reasons.

17
0:01:45.81,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now you may ask, why have I done these things?

18
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They're not really typical for a musician's

19
0:01:50.692,000 --> 0:01:52,000
day-to-day life.

20
0:01:52.913,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music

21
0:01:56.463,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I wanted to share it with as many people

22
0:01:59.545,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as possible.

23
0:02:01.829,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It started a couple of years ago.

24
0:02:03.944,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu

25
0:02:07.375,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and browsing the Internet a little,

26
0:02:09.497,000 --> 0:02:11,000
when I found out that Handel had written works

27
0:02:12.32,000 --> 0:02:14,000
for the keyboard.

28
0:02:14.32,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Well, I was surprised. I did not know this.

29
0:02:16.637,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.

30
0:02:21.02,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And what happened next was

31
0:02:22.92,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that I entered this state of pure,

32
0:02:26.491,000 --> 0:02:28,000
unprejudiced amazement.

33
0:02:29.36,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It was an experience

34
0:02:31.7,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of being totally in awe of the music,

35
0:02:34.827,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and I had not felt that in a long time.

36
0:02:38.607,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.

37
0:02:42.76,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The first piece that I played through

38
0:02:46.051,000 --> 0:02:48,000
started like this.

39
0:02:49.845,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Music)

40
0:03:14.95,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?

41
0:03:18.68,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I turned the page and what came next

42
0:03:21.714,000 --> 0:03:22,000
was this.

43
0:03:23.672,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Music)

44
0:03:50.624,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?

45
0:03:54.69,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So within a couple of minutes,

46
0:03:57.39,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the piece isn't even finished yet,

47
0:03:59.55,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I experienced two very contrasting characters:

48
0:04:03.645,000 --> 0:04:06,000
beautiful melancholy and sheer energy.

49
0:04:07.267,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I consider these two elements to be

50
0:04:09.337,000 --> 0:04:11,000
vital human expressions.

51
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the purity of the music makes you hear it

52
0:04:14.815,000 --> 0:04:17,000
very effectively.

53
0:04:19.893,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I've given a lot of children's concerts

54
0:04:22.233,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for children of seven and eight years old,

55
0:04:25.371,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven,

56
0:04:29.185,000 --> 0:04:3,000
even Stockhausen,

57
0:04:30.76,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or some jazzy music,

58
0:04:33.752,000 --> 0:04:35,000
they are open to hear it,

59
0:04:35.901,000 --> 0:04:36,000
really willing to listen,

60
0:04:37.188,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and they are comfortable doing so.

61
0:04:40.716,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And when classes come in

62
0:04:42.25,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with children who are just a few years older,

63
0:04:45.699,000 --> 0:04:49,000
11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had trouble

64
0:04:50.547,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in reaching them like that.

65
0:04:52.64,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The complexity of the music does become an issue,

66
0:04:56.307,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and actually the opinions of others —

67
0:05:00.14,000 --> 0:05:04,000
parents, friends, media — they start to count.

68
0:05:04.823,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But the young ones, they don't question

69
0:05:07.331,000 --> 0:05:1,000
their own opinion.

70
0:05:10.672,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They are in this constant state of wonder,

71
0:05:13.664,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening

72
0:05:17.354,000 --> 0:05:19,000
like these seven-year-old children,

73
0:05:19.638,000 --> 0:05:21,000
even when growing up.

74
0:05:22.112,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And that is why I have played

75
0:05:24.261,000 --> 0:05:26,000
not only in the concert hall

76
0:05:26.601,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but also on the street, online, in the air:

77
0:05:30.93,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to feel that state of wonder,

78
0:05:33.497,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to truly listen,

79
0:05:35.679,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and to listen without prejudice.

80
0:05:39.223,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And I would like to invite you

81
0:05:41.349,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to do so now.

82
0:05:50.862,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Chaconne in G Major." Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)

83
0:09:17.733,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

84
0:09:23.96,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Thank you.

85
0:09:25.906,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

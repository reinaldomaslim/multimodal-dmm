0:00:12.888,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In June of 2017,

2
0:00:15.238,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I volunteered with a group at a local food pantry

3
0:00:18.861,000 --> 0:00:2,000
on the south side of my home city

4
0:00:21.51,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in Atlanta, Georgia.

5
0:00:23.394,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It was a Friday afternoon,

6
0:00:24.957,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the day of their weekly food giveaway.

7
0:00:27.209,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And as I drove up,

8
0:00:28.392,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I saw people beginning to arrive,

9
0:00:30.39,000 --> 0:00:31,000
many with their rolling carts in tow,

10
0:00:32.336,000 --> 0:00:34,000
prepared to receive their food supply for the week.

11
0:00:35.118,000 --> 0:00:38,000
As I was walking in the door, there were about 40 people outside

12
0:00:38.158,000 --> 0:00:39,000
waiting in line.

13
0:00:39.371,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I was so excited,

14
0:00:40.845,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because there are very few things I enjoy more than giving back.

15
0:00:44.538,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But then, as I entered the room where the volunteer meeting was taking place,

16
0:00:48.829,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I immediately realized:

17
0:00:50.525,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we weren't about to give these people any real meals.

18
0:00:53.038,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We were essentially just giving them food.

19
0:00:55.634,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I took my place on the assembly line, where -- get this --

20
0:00:58.462,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I was in charge of making sure that the Weight Watchers Ding Dongs

21
0:01:01.613,000 --> 0:01:03,000
made it into every family's bag.

22
0:01:04.202,000 --> 0:01:06,000
As the bags started to come around,

23
0:01:06.508,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I'm thinking to myself:

24
0:01:08.078,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What on earth are we doing here?

25
0:01:10.234,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Each bag contained two 20-ounce diet Snapples,

26
0:01:13.923,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a gallon of barbecue sauce,

27
0:01:16.236,000 --> 0:01:18,000
a bag of kettle potato chips,

28
0:01:18.754,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a box of superhero-shaped vegetable-enriched macaroni noodles,

29
0:01:23.363,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a box of belVita breakfast bars,

30
0:01:26.082,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a can of refried beans,

31
0:01:28.116,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a can of sweet peas,

32
0:01:29.881,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a miniature can of corn,

33
0:01:31.756,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I can't forget about those Ding Dongs

34
0:01:33.838,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and french fried green onions,

35
0:01:35.576,000 --> 0:01:38,000
you know, the kind that go on top of a green bean casserole.

36
0:01:38.637,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And that was it.

37
0:01:40.303,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We made over a hundred of those bags that day,

38
0:01:42.977,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and people indeed stood in line to receive one.

39
0:01:45.971,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But a feeling came over me;

40
0:01:47.826,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I felt bad and a little angry.

41
0:01:50.387,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It was like, how could I even feel good about the work that I was doing

42
0:01:53.775,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when I knew for a fact that not one meal was to come

43
0:01:56.303,000 --> 0:01:59,000
from the food we had just given to over 100 families?

44
0:01:59.48,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I mean, who wants to have a meal with barbecue sauce and Ding Dongs?

45
0:02:02.816,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:03.867,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And the reality is,

47
0:02:05.37,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I've been part of this process all my life.

48
0:02:07.805,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I've participated in food drives,

49
0:02:09.812,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I've collected cans since I was a kid,

50
0:02:12.102,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I've donated in the grocery store more times than I can count,

51
0:02:15.231,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I've volunteered at shelters, I've worked in food pantries,

52
0:02:18.506,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I'm sure, like me, so many of you have, too.

53
0:02:21.444,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In 2013, I even created a pop-up restaurant,

54
0:02:25.276,000 --> 0:02:26,000
called Sunday Soul.

55
0:02:26.72,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I rented tables and chairs and linens

56
0:02:29.003,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and I printed out menus

57
0:02:30.541,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and I took these experiences to alleyways,

58
0:02:33.066,000 --> 0:02:35,000
underneath bridges and in parks

59
0:02:35.161,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to allow people that were experiencing homelessness

60
0:02:37.917,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to dine with dignity.

61
0:02:39.848,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So I've invested in this fight for quite some time.

62
0:02:43.36,000 --> 0:02:45,000
In almost every major US city,

63
0:02:45.899,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the food bank is viewed as a beloved community institution.

64
0:02:49.717,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Corporations send volunteers down on a weekly basis

65
0:02:53.481,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to sort through food items and make boxes of food for the needy.

66
0:02:57.298,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And can drives --

67
0:02:58.495,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they warm the hearts of schools and office buildings that participate

68
0:03:02.297,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and fill the shelves of food banks and food pantries across the nation.

69
0:03:06.158,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is how we work to end hunger.

70
0:03:08.542,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And what I've come to realize

71
0:03:10.291,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is that we are doing hunger wrong.

72
0:03:12.385,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We are doing the same things

73
0:03:14.109,000 --> 0:03:17,000
over and over and over again

74
0:03:17.172,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and expecting a different end result.

75
0:03:19.545,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We've created a cycle

76
0:03:21.203,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that keeps people dependent on food banks and pantries on a monthly basis

77
0:03:25.337,000 --> 0:03:27,000
for food that is often not well-balanced

78
0:03:27.583,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and certainly doesn't provide them with a healthy meal.

79
0:03:30.848,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In the US, our approach to doing good,

80
0:03:33.301,000 --> 0:03:34,000
or what we call "charity,"

81
0:03:35.015,000 --> 0:03:37,000
has actually hindered us from making real progress.

82
0:03:37.83,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We're educating the world on how many people are food insecure.

83
0:03:41.386,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There are television commercials,

84
0:03:43.196,000 --> 0:03:44,000
billboards,

85
0:03:44.386,000 --> 0:03:45,000
massive donations,

86
0:03:45.693,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the engagement of some of our biggest celebrities in the fight.

87
0:03:48.743,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But the ever-present reality is that,

88
0:03:51.042,000 --> 0:03:52,000
even with all of this work,

89
0:03:52.683,000 --> 0:03:54,000
millions of people are still going hungry.

90
0:03:54.905,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we can do better.

91
0:03:56.623,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Globally, 821 million people are hungry.

92
0:04:00.086,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That's one in nine people on this planet.

93
0:04:03.12,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And here in the United States,

94
0:04:04.593,000 --> 0:04:07,000
nearly 40 million people experience hunger every single year,

95
0:04:07.951,000 --> 0:04:09,000
including more than 11 million children

96
0:04:10.463,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that go to bed hungry every night.

97
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Yet, we're wasting more food than ever before --

98
0:04:15.628,000 --> 0:04:16,000
more than 80 billion pounds a year,

99
0:04:17.589,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to be exact.

100
0:04:19.492,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The EPA estimates that food waste has more than doubled

101
0:04:22.496,000 --> 0:04:25,000
between 1970 and 2017,

102
0:04:25.919,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and now accounts for 27 percent of everything in our landfills.

103
0:04:29.628,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And as this food sits, it gradually rots

104
0:04:32.209,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and produces harmful methane gas,

105
0:04:34.134,000 --> 0:04:36,000
a leading contributor to global climate change.

106
0:04:37.051,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We have the waste of the food itself,

107
0:04:39.023,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the waste of all the money associated with producing this now-wasted food

108
0:04:43.351,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and the waste of labor with all of the above.

109
0:04:46.086,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And then there's the social inequity

110
0:04:48.027,000 --> 0:04:51,000
between people who really need food and can't get it

111
0:04:51.426,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and people who have too much and simply throw it away.

112
0:04:54.885,000 --> 0:04:58,000
All of this made me realize that hunger was not an issue of scarcity

113
0:04:58.98,000 --> 0:05:,000
but rather a matter of logistics.

114
0:05:01.531,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So in 2017, I set out to end hunger using technology.

115
0:05:05.984,000 --> 0:05:08,000
After all, food delivery apps had begun to explode on the scene,

116
0:05:09.973,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and I thought surely we can reverse-engineer this technology

117
0:05:13.484,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and get food from businesses like restaurants and grocery stores

118
0:05:16.87,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and into the hands of people in need.

119
0:05:19.224,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I believe that technology and innovation

120
0:05:21.462,000 --> 0:05:23,000
have the power to solve real problems,

121
0:05:23.619,000 --> 0:05:24,000
especially hunger.

122
0:05:25.334,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So in 2017, I created an app

123
0:05:28.684,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that would inventory everything that a business sells

124
0:05:31.291,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and make it super easy for them to donate this excess food

125
0:05:34.097,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that would typically go to waste at the end of the night.

126
0:05:36.806,000 --> 0:05:38,000
All the user has to do now is click on an item,

127
0:05:39.325,000 --> 0:05:4,000
tell us how many they have to donate,

128
0:05:41.239,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and our platform calculates the weight and the tax value

129
0:05:43.896,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of those items at time of donation.

130
0:05:45.754,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We then connect with local drivers in the shared economy

131
0:05:48.482,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to get this food picked up and delivered directly to the doors

132
0:05:51.421,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of nonprofit organizations and people in need.

133
0:05:54.048,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I provided the data and the analytics

134
0:05:56.295,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to help businesses reduce food waste at the source

135
0:05:58.932,000 --> 0:06:01,000
by letting them know the items that they waste repeatedly

136
0:06:02.153,000 --> 0:06:03,000
on a regular basis,

137
0:06:03.777,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and they even saved millions of dollars.

138
0:06:05.814,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Our mission was simple:

139
0:06:07.397,000 --> 0:06:09,000
feed more, waste less.

140
0:06:09.511,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And by 2018, our clients included the world's busiest airport,

141
0:06:13.176,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson,

142
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we were working with brands and corporations

143
0:06:17.843,000 --> 0:06:19,000
like Hormel, Chick-fil-A and Papa John's.

144
0:06:20.587,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We even had the opportunity to work with the NFL for Super Bowl LIII.

145
0:06:24.844,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And over the last two years, we've worked with over 200 business

146
0:06:28.117,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to divert more than two million pounds of edible food from landfills

147
0:06:31.831,000 --> 0:06:33,000
into the hands of people that needed it most.

148
0:06:34.135,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Applause)

149
0:06:35.866,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Thank you.

150
0:06:37.066,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

151
0:06:43.574,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This has accounted for about 1.7 million meals

152
0:06:46.509,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and allowed us to start to expand our efforts to other cities,

153
0:06:49.695,000 --> 0:06:53,000
like Washington, DC, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and more.

154
0:06:53.75,000 --> 0:06:55,000
That's just one approach that actually tackles the problem.

155
0:06:56.731,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Another was the launch of our pop-up grocery stores.

156
0:06:59.522,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We recover excess food from businesses

157
0:07:01.922,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and set up free community grocery stores right in the middle of food deserts.

158
0:07:05.66,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We bring out a chef,

159
0:07:06.97,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and we do on-site taste-testings and allow families to leave with recipe cards.

160
0:07:11.175,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We give every family reusable grocery bags and allow them to simply shop

161
0:07:14.826,000 --> 0:07:15,000
minus the price tag.

162
0:07:16.488,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We wanted to give people access to meals

163
0:07:19.596,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and not just food.

164
0:07:21.042,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We wanted to change the way that we think and work to solve hunger in this country,

165
0:07:25.06,000 --> 0:07:27,000
get people to believe that we can solve hunger,

166
0:07:27.289,000 --> 0:07:28,000
not as a nonprofit,

167
0:07:28.63,000 --> 0:07:29,000
not as a food bank

168
0:07:29.908,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but as a social enterprise,

169
0:07:31.534,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with the goal of reducing waste and ending hunger.

170
0:07:34.426,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But it hasn't been as easy as I thought

171
0:07:36.378,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to change the narrative and the thought process

172
0:07:38.649,000 --> 0:07:4,000
on how we think that hunger can be solved.

173
0:07:41.487,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In 2016, France became the first country

174
0:07:44.568,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to ban supermarkets from throwing away unused food.

175
0:07:47.997,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Instead, they must donate it,

176
0:07:49.72,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and they're fined if they don't.

177
0:07:51.681,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Yes.

178
0:07:52.861,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Applause)

179
0:07:56.163,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In 2017, Italy followed suit,

180
0:07:58.907,000 --> 0:07:59,000
becoming the second European nation

181
0:08:00.876,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to pass an anti-food-waste ban.

182
0:08:03.184,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And they stated it so simply as it was passed through legislation:

183
0:08:06.48,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"We have millions of pounds of good food going to waste,

184
0:08:09.791,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and we have poor people that are going hungry."

185
0:08:12.068,000 --> 0:08:13,000
That simple.

186
0:08:13.357,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Denmark now has a mandated food waste grocery store.

187
0:08:16.545,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Its name: Wefood.

188
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They recover excess food from local grocery stores

189
0:08:21.017,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and sell it at up to a 50 percent off discount.

190
0:08:23.862,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They then use all the proceeds and donate it to emergency aid programs

191
0:08:28.065,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and social need issues for the people in need.

192
0:08:31.155,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It has been hailed as "the Goodwill of grocery."

193
0:08:34.948,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And last year, the world got its first pay-what-you-can grocery store,

194
0:08:39.161,000 --> 0:08:41,000
when Feed it Forward opened in Toronto.

195
0:08:41.524,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Their shelves remain stocked by recovering excess food

196
0:08:45.796,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from major supermarkets

197
0:08:47.032,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and allowing families to simply pay what they can

198
0:08:49.79,000 --> 0:08:5,000
at their grocery store.

199
0:08:51.501,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is amazing.

200
0:08:53.191,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This innovation we need more of.

201
0:08:56.967,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Everyone can take on the roles of changing the attitudes

202
0:09:00.192,000 --> 0:09:01,000
about how we solve hunger.

203
0:09:02.025,000 --> 0:09:04,000
When we think of how we've allowed innovation and technology

204
0:09:04.887,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to change our lives,

205
0:09:06.087,000 --> 0:09:07,000
from how we communicate with each other

206
0:09:07.998,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to how we view our entertainment

207
0:09:09.799,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to how we even receive food,

208
0:09:11.46,000 --> 0:09:13,000
it's amazing that we haven't solved hunger yet.

209
0:09:14.345,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We literally have cars that can drive themselves

210
0:09:17.043,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and millions of people that cannot feed themselves.

211
0:09:20.142,000 --> 0:09:23,000
With millions of dollars being donated to end food insecurity,

212
0:09:23.483,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we should've solved hunger years ago.

213
0:09:25.631,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And I asked myself --

214
0:09:27.148,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

215
0:09:31.746,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I asked myself, why can't we escape this vicious cycle?

216
0:09:34.856,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Why haven't we solved this problem?

217
0:09:36.8,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I remember meeting with investors and pitching the idea,

218
0:09:39.462,000 --> 0:09:4,000
trying to raise funds for my business,

219
0:09:41.44,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and one of them said to me, in true seriousness,

220
0:09:43.999,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"Hunger is already being solved,"

221
0:09:46.005,000 --> 0:09:49,000
as if millions of people weren't going to go to bed hungry that very night,

222
0:09:49.6,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and as if there was nothing else to do.

223
0:09:51.542,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And the reality is,

224
0:09:52.721,000 --> 0:09:54,000
one would think that hunger is being solved,

225
0:09:54.845,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but the truth is, it's being worked on.

226
0:09:57.034,000 --> 0:09:58,000
If we really want to solve hunger,

227
0:09:58.685,000 --> 0:10:,000
then we have to change the way we've been doing it.

228
0:10:01.146,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The same actions will always garner the same results.

229
0:10:04.41,000 --> 0:10:06,000
There are hundreds of social entrepreneurs all over the world.

230
0:10:07.376,000 --> 0:10:11,000
They have a focus to solve really big problems, like hunger,

231
0:10:11.414,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but they'll never get the same support

232
0:10:13.267,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that we give national hunger-fighting organizations and food banks.

233
0:10:16.456,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But, if given the opportunity,

234
0:10:18.265,000 --> 0:10:2,000
they have the ability to foster insight

235
0:10:20.699,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and perhaps be forward-thinking enough

236
0:10:22.623,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to solve this problem.

237
0:10:24.065,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That's why I'm traveling the world

238
0:10:25.717,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and I'm really talking about what hunger looks like in America

239
0:10:28.717,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and explaining the difference between giving people access to food

240
0:10:31.936,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and access to meals.

241
0:10:33.387,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I've been meeting with city council members

242
0:10:35.445,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and city organizers across the US

243
0:10:37.607,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and telling them that technology indeed does have the power

244
0:10:40.953,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to connect businesses with surplus food

245
0:10:43.153,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to people in need,

246
0:10:44.432,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and explaining to them what a meal can actually mean to a family.

247
0:10:47.89,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I've been meeting with school boards and school districts

248
0:10:50.619,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to talk about how we feed hungry children,

249
0:10:52.689,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and health care organizations,

250
0:10:54.179,000 --> 0:10:55,000
sharing the message that food is health,

251
0:10:56.191,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and food is life,

252
0:10:57.585,000 --> 0:11:,000
and that, by solving hunger, we can solve so many more problems.

253
0:11:01.564,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So if we want to know

254
0:11:03.004,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that we don't live in a nation

255
0:11:04.869,000 --> 0:11:06,000
where perfectly good food goes to waste

256
0:11:07.023,000 --> 0:11:09,000
when our neighbors don't have food to eat,

257
0:11:09.307,000 --> 0:11:11,000
then we need to change the laws.

258
0:11:11.376,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We need to introduce new policies,

259
0:11:13.393,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and, most importantly, we need to change our minds and our actions.

260
0:11:16.841,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Food drives are fine.

261
0:11:18.325,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Food banks serve a huge purpose.

262
0:11:20.444,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And yes, sometimes I like Ding Dongs, too.

263
0:11:23.198,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But the reality is that food drives do not solve hunger.

264
0:11:26.845,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And if we are smart about connecting the dots

265
0:11:29.074,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that are right in front of our noses,

266
0:11:30.905,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we can do far more than give a family

267
0:11:32.915,000 --> 0:11:36,000
a box of superhero-shaped vegetable-enriched macaroni noodles

268
0:11:37.193,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and a gallon of barbecue sauce

269
0:11:38.711,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to feed themselves.

270
0:11:40.186,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Instead, we can give them back their dignity.

271
0:11:42.322,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Perhaps we can increase school attendance in schools.

272
0:11:45.74,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We can improve the health outcomes for millions.

273
0:11:48.483,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And, most importantly, we can reduce food waste in our landfills,

274
0:11:51.931,000 --> 0:11:53,000
creating a better environment for all of us.

275
0:11:54.553,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The thing I love most is that we can feel good about it in the process.

276
0:11:58.561,000 --> 0:11:59,000
If we solve hunger,

277
0:11:59.747,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

278
0:12:02.589,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So let's do it.

279
0:12:03.785,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Thank you.

280
0:12:05.028,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

281
0:12:07.48,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Thank you.

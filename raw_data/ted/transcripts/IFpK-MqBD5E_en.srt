1
0:00:13.56,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was raising investment for my startup,

2
0:00:16.12,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a venture capitalist said to me,

3
0:00:18.24,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"Ashwini, I think you're going to raise a few million dollars.

4
0:00:22.44,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And your company -- it's going to sell for 50 to 70 million.

5
0:00:27.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You're going to be really excited.

6
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Your early investors are going to be really excited.

7
0:00:33.52,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I'm going to be really upset.

8
0:00:35.92,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So I'm not going to invest in this deal."

9
0:00:38.84,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I remember just being dumbstruck.

10
0:00:43.44,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Who would be unhappy

11
0:00:45.2,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with putting four or five million dollars into a company

12
0:00:48.88,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and having it sell for 50 to 70 million?

13
0:00:53.88,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I was a first-time founder.

14
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I didn't have a wealthy network of individuals to turn to for investment,

15
0:00:59.48,000 --> 0:01:,000
so I went to venture capitalists

16
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the most common form of investor in a technology company.

17
0:01:05.24,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But I'd never taken the time to understand

18
0:01:08.64,000 --> 0:01:1,000
what was motivating that VC to invest.

19
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I believe we're living in a golden era of entrepreneurship.

20
0:01:17.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
There is more opportunity to build companies than ever before.

21
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But the financial systems designed to fund that innovation,

22
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:27,000
venture capital,

23
0:01:28.32,000 --> 0:01:31,000
they haven't evolved in the past 20 to 30 years.

24
0:01:32.08,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Venture capital was designed to pour large sums of money

25
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:41,000
into a small number of companies that can sell for over a billion dollars.

26
0:01:41.56,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It was not designed to sprinkle capital across many companies

27
0:01:46.76,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that have the potential to succeed but for less, like my own.

28
0:01:51.64,000 --> 0:01:54,000
That limits the number of ideas that get funded,

29
0:01:55.12,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the number of companies that are created

30
0:01:57.28,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and who can actually receive that funding to grow.

31
0:02:01.48,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I think it inspires a tough question:

32
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What's our goal with entrepreneurship?

33
0:02:07.28,000 --> 0:02:12,000
If our goal is to create a tiny number of billion-dollar companies,

34
0:02:12.84,000 --> 0:02:14,000
let's stick with venture capital, it's working.

35
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But if our goal is to inspire innovation

36
0:02:19.72,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and empower more people to build companies of all sizes,

37
0:02:23.72,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we need a new way to fund those ideas.

38
0:02:25.8,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We need a more flexible system

39
0:02:27.76,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that doesn't squeeze entrepreneurs and investors

40
0:02:31.44,000 --> 0:02:34,000
into one rigid financial outcome.

41
0:02:35.96,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We need to democratize access to capital.

42
0:02:40.24,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In the summer of 2017, I went out to San Francisco,

43
0:02:43.08,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to join a tech accelerator with 30 other companies.

44
0:02:46.4,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The accelerator was supposed to teach us how to raise venture capital.

45
0:02:50.64,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But when I got out there,

46
0:02:52.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the startup community was buzzing about ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings.

47
0:02:58.92,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For the first time, ICOs had raised more money for young startups

48
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:05,000
than venture capital had.

49
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It was the first week of the program.

50
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Tequila Friday.

51
0:03:11.04,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And the founders couldn't stop talking.

52
0:03:13.08,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"I'm going to raise an ICO."

53
0:03:14.52,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"I'm going to raise an ICO."

54
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Until one guy goes,

55
0:03:17.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"How cool if we did this all together?

56
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We should do an ICO that combines the value of all of our companies

57
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and raise money as a group."

58
0:03:26.32,000 --> 0:03:28,000
At that point, I had to ask the obvious question,

59
0:03:28.68,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"Guys, what's an ICO?"

60
0:03:31.32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
ICOs were a way for young companies to raise money

61
0:03:35.32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
by issuing a digital currency

62
0:03:37.8,000 --> 0:03:41,000
tied to the value and services that the company provides.

63
0:03:42.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The currency acts similar to shares in a company,

64
0:03:44.64,000 --> 0:03:45,000
like on the public stock market,

65
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
increasing in value as it's traded online.

66
0:03:50.4,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Most important, ICOs expanded the investor pool,

67
0:03:55.76,000 --> 0:03:57,000
from a few hundred venture capital firms

68
0:03:58.2,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to millions of everyday people, excited to invest.

69
0:04:03.36,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This market represented more money.

70
0:04:06.12,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It represented more investors.

71
0:04:08.32,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Which meant a greater likelihood to get funded.

72
0:04:12.6,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I was sold.

73
0:04:14.8,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The idea, though, of doing it together still seemed a little crazy.

74
0:04:18.28,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Startups compete with each other for investment,

75
0:04:20.84,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it takes hundreds of meetings to get a check.

76
0:04:25.56,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That I would spend my precious 15 minutes in front of an investor

77
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:33,000
talking not just about my own company, but all the companies in the batch,

78
0:04:33.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
was unprecedented.

79
0:04:36.56,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But the idea caught on.

80
0:04:38.52,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we decided to cooperate, rather than compete.

81
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Every company put 10 percent of their equity into a communal pool

82
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that we then split into tradable cryptocurrency

83
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that investors could buy and sell.

84
0:04:55.28,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Six months and four law firms later --

85
0:04:58,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in January 2018, we launched the very first ICO

87
0:05:03.84,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that represented the value of nearly 30 companies

88
0:05:07.2,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and an entirely new way to raise capital.

89
0:05:11.24,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We got a lot of press.

90
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
My favorite headline about us read,

91
0:05:15.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"VCs, read this and weep."

92
0:05:17.48,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:20.2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Our fund was naturally more diverse.

94
0:05:22.28,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Twenty percent of the founders were women.

95
0:05:24.52,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Fifty percent were international.

96
0:05:26.92,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The investors were more excited, too.

97
0:05:29.52,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They had a chance to get better returns,

98
0:05:31.48,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because we took out the middleman fees of venture capital.

99
0:05:34.32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And they could take their money and reinvest it,

100
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
potentially funding more new ideas faster.

101
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I believe this creates a virtuous cycle of capital

102
0:05:46.8,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that allows many more entrepreneurs to succeed.

103
0:05:50.56,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Because access to capital is access to opportunity.

104
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And we have only just begun to imagine

105
0:05:57.12,000 --> 0:06:,000
what democratizing access to capital will do.

106
0:06:01.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I would have never thought that my own search for funding

107
0:06:05.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
would lead me to this stage,

108
0:06:06.92,000 --> 0:06:09,000
having helped nearly 30 companies get investment.

109
0:06:11.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Imagine if other entrepreneurs tried to invent new ways to access capital

110
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:19,000
rather than following the traditional route.

111
0:06:20.32,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It would change what gets built, who builds it

112
0:06:23.4,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and the long-term impact on the economy.

113
0:06:26.2,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I believe that's way more exciting

114
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
than just trying to invest in the next billion-dollar startup.

115
0:06:32.12,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Thank you.

116
0:06:33.36,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Applause)

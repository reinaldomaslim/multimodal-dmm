1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What I am always thinking about

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but in the best sense of the word.

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'm trying to figure out two very simple things:

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
how to live and how to die, period.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things

10
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that keep you grounded.

11
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.

12
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:07,000
My older sister was busy torturing my parents,

13
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and they were busy torturing her.

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored,

15
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.

17
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,

18
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:32,000
where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.

19
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.

20
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched

21
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
from beginning to end.

22
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,

23
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but he went to Cuba.

24
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale

25
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
so I had more money than he did.

26
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.

28
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But, then he came back, and things happened,

29
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and I decided I really hated my writing,

30
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that it was awful, awful, purple prose.

31
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I decided that I wanted to tell --

32
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but I still wanted to tell a narrative story

33
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I still wanted to tell my stories.

34
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?

35
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And so what happened was that I started

36
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,

37
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.

38
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And we started a studio.

39
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&Co.

40
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the premise of M&Co was, we don't know anything,

41
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.

42
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,

43
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because if you know too much, you're stymied.

44
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So, the premise in the studio was,

45
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
there are no boundaries, there is no fear.

46
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,

47
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:58,000
was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas

48
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
that -- fortunately, there were enough people there,

49
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and it was a team, it was a collective,

50
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.

51
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.

52
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&Co,

53
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and clearly we also needed to make some money,

54
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so we decided we would create a series of products.

55
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And some of the watches there,

56
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
attempting to be beautiful and humorous --

57
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.

58
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That to be able to talk about content,

59
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,

60
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:4,000
elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.

61
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design

62
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we wanted to say, the content is what's important,

63
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
not the package, not the wrapping.

64
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,

65
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.

66
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So, the good news is that I have a dog

67
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and, though I don't know if I believe in luck --

68
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,

69
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.

70
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,

71
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because everybody's always, you know, leaving,

72
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,

73
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and he runs to the other room.

74
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But I am able to make the transition from working for children and --

75
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
from working for adults to children, and back and forth,

76
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because, you know, I can say that I'm immature,

77
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and in a way, that's true.

78
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,

79
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand

80
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.

81
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings

82
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.

83
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.

84
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension --

85
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
-- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.

87
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing

88
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and finding out something new.

89
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.

90
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.

91
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.

92
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids

93
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and you're not talking in such a way that you,

94
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.

95
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So, I hopefully am writing, you know,

96
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
books that are good for children and for adults.

97
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But the painting reflects --

98
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.

99
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,

100
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the same kind of love of language.

101
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.

102
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,

103
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.

104
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.

105
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.

106
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,

107
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.

108
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And the books are really journals of my life.

109
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I never -- I don't like plots.

110
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I don't know what a plot means.

111
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,

112
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,

113
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because my life is too random and too confused,

114
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I enjoy it that way.

115
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But anyway, so we were in Venice,

116
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and this is our room. And I had this dream

117
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that I was wearing this fantastic green gown,

118
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and I was looking out the window,

119
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and it was really a beautiful thing.

120
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,

121
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and hopefully go on to something else.

122
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The letter C had other things in it.

123
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,

124
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.

125
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.

126
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.

127
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened

128
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.

129
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,

130
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and somebody said Bronxistan,

131
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and somebody said Ferreristan,

132
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and we came up with this New Yorker cover,

133
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.

134
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be --

135
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.

136
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,

137
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,

138
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:31,000
would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.

139
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And it really became the -- I don't know, you know,

140
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.

141
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,

142
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:45,000
for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,

143
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we were able to take the city

144
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?

145
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Who are these people? What are these tribes?

146
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,

147
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:02,000
had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,

148
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.

149
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?

150
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They're not."

151
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.

153
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen

154
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and that's kind of the beauty part.

155
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,

156
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.

157
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school,

158
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,

159
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.

160
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.

161
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I said, people should know about this book.

162
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.

164
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,

165
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and what an intersection of like, you know,

166
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,

167
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I'd like to do something to this book.

168
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And they said yes, and they left me completely alone,

169
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.

170
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I took the examples that they gave,

171
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and just did 56 paintings, basically.

172
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.

173
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."

174
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And when you're dealing with grammar,

175
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
which is, you know, incredibly dry,

176
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk --

177
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and then you come to the rules and, you know,

178
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?

179
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Do you mind my asking a question?"

180
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."

181
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell,

182
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and "could" is an August Sander subject.

183
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."

184
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme

186
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that I really love very much.

187
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."

188
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules,

189
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him

190
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,

191
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.

192
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,

193
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
because I really adore singing,

194
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and I think that music is the highest form of all art.

195
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,

196
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
who wrote nine songs using the text,

197
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and we performed this fantastic evening of --

198
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.

199
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I played the clattering teacup and the slinky

200
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in the main reading room of the New York Public Library,

201
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
where you're supposed to be very, very quiet,

202
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and it was a phenomenally wonderful event,

203
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
which we hopefully will do some more.

204
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,

205
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.

206
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So, once a month for the last year,

207
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty,"

208
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,

209
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but I know I can throw that around now. You know,

210
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.

211
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some,

212
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.

213
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,

214
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"

215
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."

216
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"

217
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."

218
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:25,000
OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.

219
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?

220
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."

221
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,

222
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and then I talk about Spinoza.

223
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation

224
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
for everything, called eudaemonia.

225
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,

226
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."

227
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I happen to know it for a fact.

228
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.

229
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza,

230
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,

231
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.

232
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump

233
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
in this fantastic, decrepit palace.

234
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day

235
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:13,000
when the Bolsheviks arrived.

236
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,

237
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:19,000
but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."

238
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Laughter)

239
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You don't even know.

240
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:26,000
"And decided his top people had to be extinctified."

241
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.

242
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,

243
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.

244
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.

245
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,

246
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,

247
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
leafing through a book and butterflies,

248
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:49,000
imagine such displacement, such loss?"

249
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And then I want to tell you that this is a map.

250
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.

251
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Too many pogroms.

252
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,

253
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
they went to Palestine and then America."

254
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,

255
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with

256
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
had no use for facts whatsoever.

257
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Facts were actually banished from our home.

258
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California

259
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,

260
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
this is the home that I grew up in, OK?

261
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.

262
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.

263
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,

264
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
which is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."

265
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is

266
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,"

267
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because she couldn't care less.

268
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
"The Impossibility of February"

270
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
is that February's a really wretched month in New York

271
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and the images for me conjure up these really awful things.

272
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Well, not so awful.

273
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper

274
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.

275
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead,

276
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,

277
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but the caption says he is dead."

278
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,

279
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
maybe he's not dead.

280
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,

281
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."

282
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
There's consoling.

283
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:27,000
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,

284
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.

285
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.

286
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:34,000
It is February and not lying is impossible."

287
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And I really spend a lot of time wondering,

288
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
how much truth do we tell?

289
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?

290
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
How do we know when we are ourselves?

291
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths

292
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
are real stories, you know, are real sentences?

293
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?

294
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I'm going to quickly go through this.

295
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
A quote by Bertrand Russell,

296
0:14:56,000 --> 0:15:,000
"All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,

297
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
all the noonday brightness of human genius

298
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
are destined to extinction.

299
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So now, my friends, if that is true,

300
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and it is true, what is the point?"

301
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:11,000
A complicated question.

302
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And so, you know, I talk to my friends

303
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.

304
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Oh my God, you know what?

305
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Could we have -- no, we don't have time.

306
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the --

307
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
you know, could we have it for a second?

308
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Do you have that?

309
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Music)

310
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean

311
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:55,000
every day of the year until she was about 85.

312
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable

313
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
because, you know, we're from Russia.

314
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Laughter)

315
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,

316
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style,"

317
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
she said she would treasure it.

318
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,

319
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
"When you met him, you knew it was him."

320
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And she said, "I knew it was he."

321
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Laughter)

322
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.

323
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.

324
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Gershwin died at the age of 38.

325
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.

326
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I don't want to talk about that now.

327
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake

328
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.

329
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.

330
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Laughter)

331
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And I would like to run it for them.

332
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,

333
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:45,000
who's also still working, and I looked at her sink,

334
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
which is really amazing, and left.

335
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.

336
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.

337
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And then I go and have some tea.

338
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,

339
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:01,000
she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.

340
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Laughter)

341
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see

342
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,

343
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,

344
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:13,000
won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.

345
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
That's actually Hy.

346
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,

347
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.

348
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata,

349
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:27,000
which I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore,

350
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:3,000
give me a break," but I was wrong.

351
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:33,000
It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.

352
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.

353
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:38,000
(Applause)

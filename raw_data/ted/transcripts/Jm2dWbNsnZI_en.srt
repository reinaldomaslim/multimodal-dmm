0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
A few years ago, my eyes were opened

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to the dark side of the construction industry.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In 2006, young Qatari students

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
1.1 million of them.

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to make money for their families back home.

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,

16
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.

17
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities,

18
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector,

19
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.

20
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged,

21
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but the numbers are simply overwhelming.

22
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
In August 2008,

23
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
UAE public officials noted

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps

25
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.

26
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And last summer, more than 10,000 workers

27
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
protested for the non-payment of wages,

28
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.

29
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And then the financial collapse happened.

30
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
When the contractors have gone bust,

31
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as they've been overleveraged like everyone else,

32
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the difference is everything goes missing,

33
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
documentation, passports,

34
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and tickets home for these workers.

35
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.

36
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There is no way back home.

37
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.

38
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
These are the boom-and-bust refugees.

39
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The question is, as a building professional,

40
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
as an architect, an engineer, as a developer,

41
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
if you know this is going on,

42
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
as we go to the sights every single week,

43
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are you complacent or complicit

44
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in the human rights violations?

45
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So let's forget your environmental footprint.

46
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Let's think about your ethical footprint.

47
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
What good is it

48
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex,

49
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when the labor producing this architectural gem

50
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is unethical at best?

51
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.

52
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But, quite frankly, on this issue,

53
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
there is no other road.

54
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.

55
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And that as we worry about our next job in the office,

56
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.

57
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.

58
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Thank you.

59
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Applause)

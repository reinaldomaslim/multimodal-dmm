2
0:00:13.243,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want to share some personal friends and stories with you

3
0:00:17.195,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that I've actually never talked about in public before

4
0:00:19.232,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to help illustrate the idea

5
0:00:21.592,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and the need and the hope

6
0:00:23.511,000 --> 0:00:26,000
for us to reinvent our health care system around the world.

7
0:00:26.793,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Twenty-four years ago, I had -- a sophomore in college,

8
0:00:30.18,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved.

9
0:00:33.002,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I ended up in student health,

10
0:00:35.933,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and they ran some labwork and came back right away,

11
0:00:38.102,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and said, "Kidney problems."

12
0:00:40.275,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into

13
0:00:43.725,000 --> 0:00:46,000
this six months of tests and trials and tribulations

14
0:00:46.945,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with six doctors across two hospitals

15
0:00:49.629,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in this clash of medical titans

16
0:00:52.325,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to figure out which one of them was right

17
0:00:54.369,000 --> 0:00:56,000
about what was wrong with me.

18
0:00:56.833,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound,

19
0:01:00.106,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once,

20
0:01:02.929,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I'm like, "Uh oh, this is bad news."

21
0:01:07.281,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And their diagnosis was this:

22
0:01:08.844,000 --> 0:01:09,000
They said, "You have two rare kidney diseases

23
0:01:10.754,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually,

24
0:01:13.435,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you have cancer-like cells in your immune system

25
0:01:15.972,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that we need to start treatment right away,

26
0:01:17.889,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant,

27
0:01:20.346,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and you're not likely to live more than two or three years."

28
0:01:23.765,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis,

29
0:01:26.729,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it just sucked me in immediately,

30
0:01:29.129,000 --> 0:01:31,000
as if I began preparing myself as a patient

31
0:01:31.771,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me,

32
0:01:35.868,000 --> 0:01:37,000
until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room,

33
0:01:38.508,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day

34
0:01:40.566,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and took me off to the medical library

35
0:01:42.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases,

36
0:01:45.494,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and said, "Eric, these people who get this

37
0:01:48.014,000 --> 0:01:49,000
are normally in their '70s and '80s.

38
0:01:49.962,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They don't know anything about you. Wake up.

39
0:01:53.073,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Take control of your health and get on with your life."

40
0:01:56.195,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I did.

41
0:01:57.737,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, these people making these proclamations to me

42
0:02:00.097,000 --> 0:02:01,000
were not bad people.

43
0:02:01.423,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In fact, these professionals were miracle workers,

44
0:02:03.984,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but they're working in a flawed, expensive system that's set up the wrong way.

45
0:02:08.05,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need.

46
0:02:11.305,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.

47
0:02:14.972,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails,

48
0:02:18.887,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and so something either works or you die.

49
0:02:21.487,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And it's dependent on passive patients

50
0:02:25.695,000 --> 0:02:28,000
who just take it and don't ask any questions.

51
0:02:29.457,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now the problem with this model

52
0:02:31.019,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is that it's unsustainable globally.

53
0:02:33.505,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's unaffordable globally.

54
0:02:35.459,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We need to invent what I call a personal health system.

55
0:02:38.946,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So what does this personal health system look like,

56
0:02:41.269,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail?

57
0:02:46.31,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, I'm going to start by actually sharing with you

58
0:02:48.463,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a new friend of mine, Libby,

59
0:02:50.359,000 --> 0:02:52,000
somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months.

60
0:02:53.073,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby.

61
0:02:56.949,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have.

62
0:02:59.82,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today,

63
0:03:03.671,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and you'll notice, on the edge of this image,

64
0:03:05.611,000 --> 0:03:07,000
there's some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me.

65
0:03:08.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So we're going to actually do a live exam

66
0:03:11.049,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to sort of see how Libby's doing.

67
0:03:12.424,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here.

68
0:03:15.142,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Don't you in the front row worry or anything.

69
0:03:17.276,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:18.558,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.

71
0:03:22.285,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is a portable ultrasound.

72
0:03:23.759,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.

73
0:03:26.302,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Mobisante is up in Redmond, Washington,

74
0:03:28.432,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself.

75
0:03:32.082,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this.

76
0:03:34.287,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear.

77
0:03:37.098,000 --> 0:03:38,000
All right, I gotta gel up.

78
0:03:38.185,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now the people in the front row are very nervous. (Laughter)

79
0:03:42.636,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk,

80
0:03:46.681,000 --> 0:03:47,000
who's another friend of mine.

81
0:03:48.128,000 --> 0:03:51,000
He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon.

82
0:03:52.014,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay?

83
0:03:55.508,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And actually, can you see Libby?

84
0:03:57.684,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Thomas Batuik: Hi there, Eric.

85
0:03:58.862,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You look busy. How are you?

86
0:04:00.107,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Eric Dishman: I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off

87
0:04:02.835,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful.

88
0:04:05.404,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get?

89
0:04:10.061,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there.

90
0:04:13.798,000 --> 0:04:15,000
TB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here,

91
0:04:16.527,000 --> 0:04:17,000
give me a lay of the land.

92
0:04:17.802,000 --> 0:04:2,000
ED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside,

93
0:04:21.318,000 --> 0:04:23,000
a little bit toward the middle for me.

94
0:04:23.718,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Okay, that's good. How about up a little bit?

95
0:04:28.514,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Okay, freeze that image. That's a good one for me.

96
0:04:31.564,000 --> 0:04:33,000
ED: All right. Now last week, when I did this,

97
0:04:34.251,000 --> 0:04:36,000
you had me measure that spot to the right.

98
0:04:37.052,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Should I do that again?

99
0:04:38.739,000 --> 0:04:39,000
TB: Yeah, let's do that.

100
0:04:39.783,000 --> 0:04:42,000
ED: All right. This is kind of hard to do

101
0:04:43.087,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring,

102
0:04:45.258,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but I've got it, I think,

103
0:04:46.513,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I'll save that image and send it to you.

104
0:04:49.064,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means.

105
0:04:51.536,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's not something I was very happy about.

106
0:04:53.641,000 --> 0:04:54,000
TB: Many people after a kidney transplant

107
0:04:55.584,000 --> 0:04:58,000
will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney.

108
0:04:58.852,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief,

109
0:05:02.133,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but it does warrant looking at,

110
0:05:04.541,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today,

111
0:05:07.516,000 --> 0:05:09,000
make sure that it's not growing, it's not creating any problems.

112
0:05:10.444,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Based on the other images we have,

113
0:05:12.66,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm really happy how it looks today.

114
0:05:15.044,000 --> 0:05:17,000
ED: All right. Well, I guess we'll double check it when I come in.

115
0:05:17.441,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks,

116
0:05:20.006,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic,

117
0:05:21.715,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because I don't think I can do that one on myself.

118
0:05:24.155,000 --> 0:05:26,000
TB: Good choice.ED: All right, thanks, Dr. Batiuk.

119
0:05:26.8,000 --> 0:05:28,000
All right. So what you're sort of seeing here

120
0:05:28.931,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is an example of disruptive technologies,

121
0:05:31.039,000 --> 0:05:34,000
of mobile, social and analytic technologies.

122
0:05:34.235,000 --> 0:05:36,000
These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible.

123
0:05:37.146,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now there's really three pillars

124
0:05:39.731,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of this personal health I want to talk to you about now,

125
0:05:41.628,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and it's care anywhere, care networking and care customization.

126
0:05:45.42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And you just saw a little bit of the first two

127
0:05:47.103,000 --> 0:05:48,000
with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk.

128
0:05:48.644,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So let's start with care anywhere.

129
0:05:51.524,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics

130
0:05:54.252,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking.

131
0:05:58.152,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We have got to untether clinicians and patients

132
0:06:01.646,000 --> 0:06:03,000
from the notion of traveling to a special

133
0:06:04.264,000 --> 0:06:06,000
bricks-and-mortar place for all of our care,

134
0:06:06.844,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because these places are often the wrong tool,

135
0:06:09.145,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and the most expensive tool, for the job.

136
0:06:11.611,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients,

137
0:06:15.163,000 --> 0:06:17,000
especially in an era of superbugs

138
0:06:17.3,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and hospital-acquired infections.

139
0:06:19.416,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And many countries are going to go brickless from the start

140
0:06:22.298,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because they're never going to be able to afford

141
0:06:24.264,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built.

142
0:06:28.784,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now I personally learned that hospitals

143
0:06:31.54,000 --> 0:06:33,000
can be a very dangerous place at a young age.

144
0:06:34.056,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This was me in third grade.

145
0:06:35.896,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery,

146
0:06:38.312,000 --> 0:06:4,000
worried that they were going to actually lose the arm.

147
0:06:40.639,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Recovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores.

148
0:06:43.575,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Those bedsores become infected,

149
0:06:45.808,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to,

150
0:06:48.744,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and now my whole body breaks out,

151
0:06:50.695,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and now all of those become infected.

152
0:06:53.255,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became,

153
0:06:55.802,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the more expensive it became,

154
0:06:57.387,000 --> 0:07:,000
and this happens to millions of people around the world every year.

155
0:07:00.732,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The future of personal health that I'm talking about

156
0:07:03.075,000 --> 0:07:07,000
says care must occur at home as the default model,

157
0:07:07.533,000 --> 0:07:08,000
not in a hospital or clinic.

158
0:07:09.013,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You have to earn your way into those places

159
0:07:10.573,000 --> 0:07:13,000
by being sick enough to use that tool for the job.

160
0:07:14.139,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now the smartphones that we're already carrying

161
0:07:16.245,000 --> 0:07:19,000
can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them,

162
0:07:19.971,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and a whole array of others, today,

163
0:07:22.142,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and as sensing is built into these,

164
0:07:23.664,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we'll be able to do vital signs monitor

165
0:07:25.694,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before.

166
0:07:28.533,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Many of us will have implantables that will actually look

167
0:07:31.085,000 --> 0:07:33,000
real-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry

168
0:07:33.822,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and in our proteins right now.

169
0:07:36.069,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now the software is also getting smarter, right?

170
0:07:38.764,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Think about a coach, an agent online,

171
0:07:41.861,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that's going to help me do safe self-care.

172
0:07:43.997,000 --> 0:07:45,000
That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound

173
0:07:46.302,000 --> 0:07:48,000
will likely have real-time image processing,

174
0:07:48.525,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and the device will say, "Up, down, left, right,

175
0:07:50.67,000 --> 0:07:52,000
ah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image

176
0:07:53.326,000 --> 0:07:54,000
off to your doctor."

177
0:07:55.175,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now, if we've got all these networked devices

178
0:07:57.382,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that are helping us to do care anywhere,

179
0:07:59.762,000 --> 0:08:,000
it stands to reason that we also need a team

180
0:08:01.557,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to be able to interact with all of that stuff,

181
0:08:03.544,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about,

182
0:08:06.165,000 --> 0:08:07,000
care networking.

183
0:08:07.737,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We have got to go beyond this paradigm

184
0:08:10.883,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of isolated specialists doing parts care

185
0:08:14.534,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to multidisciplinary teams doing person care.

186
0:08:18.753,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best,

187
0:08:22.149,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and it is deadly at worst.

188
0:08:24.244,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused

189
0:08:26.647,000 --> 0:08:27,000
by communication and coordination problems

190
0:08:28.595,000 --> 0:08:3,000
amongst medical team members.

191
0:08:30.916,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school,

192
0:08:33.155,000 --> 0:08:35,000
when we're under treatment for the kidney,

193
0:08:35.269,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and suddenly, they're like, "Oh, we think you have a heart problem."

194
0:08:37.883,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And I have these palpitations that are showing up.

195
0:08:39.768,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They put me through five weeks of tests --

196
0:08:42.274,000 --> 0:08:45,000
very expensive, very scary -- before the nurse finally notices

197
0:08:45.773,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the piece of the paper, my meds list

198
0:08:47.869,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that I've been carrying to every single appointment,

199
0:08:49.391,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and says, "Oh my gosh."

200
0:08:51.577,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Three different specialists had prescribed

201
0:08:53.546,000 --> 0:08:55,000
three different versions of the same drug to me.

202
0:08:55.585,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem.

203
0:08:59.86,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I had a care coordination problem.

204
0:09:02.673,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And this happens to millions of people every year.

205
0:09:05.439,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen

206
0:09:09.073,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to make health care a coordinated team sport.

207
0:09:12.805,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now this is the most frightening thing to me.

208
0:09:15.107,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world,

209
0:09:19.365,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the first time I've ever had a true team-based care experience

210
0:09:22.712,000 --> 0:09:24,000
was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months

211
0:09:25.483,000 --> 0:09:26,000
for me to go get this.

212
0:09:26.541,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.

213
0:09:29.51,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk.

214
0:09:32.02,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We just talked to him. Here's Jenny, one of the nurses,

215
0:09:34.636,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Allison, who helped manage the transplant list,

216
0:09:36.948,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and a dozen other people who aren't pictured,

217
0:09:39.092,000 --> 0:09:41,000
a pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist,

218
0:09:41.628,000 --> 0:09:43,000
even a financial counselor, Lisa,

219
0:09:43.87,000 --> 0:09:45,000
who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles.

220
0:09:46.597,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I wept the day I graduated.

221
0:09:49.196,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I should have been happy, because I was so well

222
0:09:50.823,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that I could go back to my normal doctors,

223
0:09:52.476,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team.

224
0:09:55.771,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And here's the most important part.

225
0:09:57.367,000 --> 0:10:,000
The other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley.

226
0:10:00.406,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home

227
0:10:04.508,000 --> 0:10:06,000
so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics.

228
0:10:07.252,000 --> 0:10:09,000
That's the only way that the model works.

229
0:10:09.716,000 --> 0:10:1,000
My team is actually working in China

230
0:10:11.532,000 --> 0:10:12,000
on one of these self-care models

231
0:10:13.271,000 --> 0:10:15,000
for a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.

232
0:10:15.644,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We're trying to help build a social network

233
0:10:17.438,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that can help track and train the care of seniors

234
0:10:19.922,000 --> 0:10:2,000
caring for themselves

235
0:10:21.429,000 --> 0:10:23,000
as well as the care provided by their family members

236
0:10:23.834,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or volunteer community health workers,

237
0:10:26.316,000 --> 0:10:28,000
as well as have an exchange network online,

238
0:10:28.572,000 --> 0:10:31,000
where, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom,

239
0:10:31.9,000 --> 0:10:33,000
if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals,

240
0:10:34.77,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and we exchange all of that online.

241
0:10:37.428,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The most important point I want to make to you about this

242
0:10:39.818,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized

243
0:10:43.132,000 --> 0:10:45,000
doctor-patient one-on-one

244
0:10:45.906,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is a relic of the past.

245
0:10:48.022,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The future of health care is smart teams,

246
0:10:50.474,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and you'd better be on that team for yourself.

247
0:10:54.043,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now, the last thing that I want to talk to you about

248
0:10:56.335,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is care customization,

249
0:10:57.575,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking,

250
0:11:00.5,000 --> 0:11:02,000
those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system,

251
0:11:03.308,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but there's still too much guesswork.

252
0:11:06.341,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948

253
0:11:10.429,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis,

254
0:11:13.811,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and those are important things, don't get me wrong.

255
0:11:16.108,000 --> 0:11:17,000
These population studies that we've done have created

256
0:11:17.973,000 --> 0:11:19,000
tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives,

257
0:11:20.552,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but the problem is that health care

258
0:11:22.987,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is treating us as averages, not unique individuals,

259
0:11:27.067,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because at the end of the day,

260
0:11:28.614,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the patient is not the same thing as the population

261
0:11:31.869,000 --> 0:11:34,000
who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork.

262
0:11:35.147,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The technologies that are coming,

263
0:11:36.985,000 --> 0:11:38,000
high-performance computing, analytics,

264
0:11:39.074,000 --> 0:11:4,000
big data that everyone's talking about,

265
0:11:40.991,000 --> 0:11:42,000
will allow us to build predictive models for each of us

266
0:11:43.91,000 --> 0:11:44,000
as individual patients.

267
0:11:45.864,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And the magic here is, experiment on my avatar

268
0:11:50.323,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in software, not my body in suffering.

269
0:11:55.124,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Now, I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you

270
0:11:57.607,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of this kind of care customization on my own journey.

271
0:12:00.166,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago

272
0:12:03.343,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity.

273
0:12:07.22,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live.

274
0:12:09.974,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I was optimizing my life for quality of life,

275
0:12:13.041,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and quality of life for me means time in snow.

276
0:12:17.421,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So on my chart, I forced them to put, "Patient goal:

277
0:12:20.251,000 --> 0:12:23,000
low doses of drugs over longer periods of time,

278
0:12:24.017,000 --> 0:12:27,000
side effects friendly to skiing."

279
0:12:27.263,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And I think that's why I achieved longevity.

280
0:12:29.915,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I think that time-in-snow therapy was as important

281
0:12:32.147,000 --> 0:12:34,000
as the pharmaceuticals that I had.

282
0:12:34.28,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now the second example of customization -- and by the way,

283
0:12:36.595,000 --> 0:12:37,000
you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals,

284
0:12:38.491,000 --> 0:12:41,000
so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals.

285
0:12:41.86,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But the second example I want to give you is,

286
0:12:43.572,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I happened to be an early guinea pig,

287
0:12:45.359,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced.

288
0:12:48.963,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Now it took about two weeks of processing

289
0:12:51.285,000 --> 0:12:53,000
on Intel's highest-end servers to make this happen,

290
0:12:53.409,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and another six months of human and computing labor

291
0:12:56.441,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to make sense of all of that data.

292
0:12:59.003,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And at the end of all of that, they said, "Yes,

293
0:13:02.053,000 --> 0:13:04,000
those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans

294
0:13:04.491,000 --> 0:13:06,000
all of those years ago were wrong,

295
0:13:06.875,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and we have a better path forward."

296
0:13:09.149,000 --> 0:13:11,000
The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out

297
0:13:11.534,000 --> 0:13:13,000
how to make that computing for personalized medicine

298
0:13:13.731,000 --> 0:13:16,000
go from months and weeks to even hours,

299
0:13:17.484,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and make this kind of tool available,

300
0:13:19.155,000 --> 0:13:22,000
not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world,

301
0:13:22.973,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but in the mainstream -- every patient, every clinic

302
0:13:25.779,000 --> 0:13:27,000
with access to whole genome sequencing.

303
0:13:27.928,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And I tell you, this kind of care customization

304
0:13:30.271,000 --> 0:13:32,000
for everything from your goals to your genetics

305
0:13:33.097,000 --> 0:13:34,000
will be the most game-changing transformation

306
0:13:34.862,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that we witness in health care during our lifetime.

307
0:13:38.444,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So these three pillars of personal health,

308
0:13:41.378,000 --> 0:13:43,000
care anywhere, care networking, care customization,

309
0:13:44.236,000 --> 0:13:45,000
are happening in pieces now,

310
0:13:45.483,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up

311
0:13:49.266,000 --> 0:13:53,000
as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.

312
0:13:53.267,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It's what my friend Verna said:

313
0:13:54.92,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Wake up and take control of your health.

314
0:13:57.041,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Because at the end of the day these technologies

315
0:13:58.63,000 --> 0:14:01,000
are simply about people caring for other people

316
0:14:02.527,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and ourselves in some powerful new ways.

317
0:14:05.938,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you

318
0:14:07.498,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to one last friend, very quickly.

319
0:14:10.049,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney

320
0:14:13.916,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that I was never supposed to have.

321
0:14:18.597,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

322
0:14:34.992,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you.

323
0:14:39.349,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Tracey Gamley: For me, it was really easy.

324
0:14:41.233,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I only had one night in the hospital.

325
0:14:43.184,000 --> 0:14:44,000
The surgery was done laparoscopically,

326
0:14:44.888,000 --> 0:14:47,000
so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen,

327
0:14:48.094,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and I had four weeks away from work

328
0:14:50.133,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and went back to doing everything I'd done before

329
0:14:52.016,000 --> 0:14:53,000
without any changes.

330
0:14:53.532,000 --> 0:14:55,000
ED: Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you

331
0:14:56.518,000 --> 0:14:58,000
in such a large audience ever again.

332
0:14:58.977,000 --> 0:15:,000
So "thank you" feel likes a really trite word,

333
0:15:01.764,000 --> 0:15:03,000
but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life.

334
0:15:04.226,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Applause)

335
0:15:10.109,000 --> 0:15:12,000
This TED stage and all of the TED stages

336
0:15:12.558,000 --> 0:15:14,000
are often about celebrating innovation

337
0:15:15.284,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and celebrating new technologies,

338
0:15:16.393,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and I've done that here today,

339
0:15:18.678,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers,

340
0:15:21.007,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming.

341
0:15:25.04,000 --> 0:15:28,000
But until such time that these amazing technologies

342
0:15:28.221,000 --> 0:15:31,000
are available to all of us, and even when they are,

343
0:15:31.259,000 --> 0:15:35,000
it's up to us to care for, and even save, one another.

344
0:15:35.686,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I hope you will go out and make personal health happen

345
0:15:38.124,000 --> 0:15:41,000
for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much.

346
0:15:42.052,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Good morning everybody.

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The first thing is water.

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water

5
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that's been provided for you here at the conference,

6
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
over the past couple of days.

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.

8
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But what if it wasn't?

9
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What if it was from a source like this?

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Then statistics would actually say

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that half of you would now be suffering

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
with diarrhea.

13
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I talked a lot in the past about statistics,

14
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and the provision of safe drinking water for all.

15
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But they just don't seem to get through.

16
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I think I've worked out why.

17
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's because, using current thinking,

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the scale of the problem

19
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
just seems too huge to contemplate solving.

20
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So we just switch off:

21
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
us, governments and aid agencies.

22
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Well, today, I'd like to show you

23
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that through thinking differently,

24
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the problem has been solved.

25
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
By the way, since I've been speaking,

26
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
another 13,000 people around the world

27
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
are suffering now with diarrhea.

28
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And four children have just died.

29
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I invented Lifesaver bottle

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because I got angry.

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,

32
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when I was watching the devastating news

33
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,

34
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
playing out on TV.

35
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The days and weeks that followed,

36
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
people fleeing to the hills,

37
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
being forced to drink contaminated water

38
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
or face death.

39
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That really stuck with me.

40
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Then, a few months later,

41
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.

42
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."

43
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Day one: nothing.

44
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Day two: nothing.

45
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?

46
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
People were shooting each other on the streets

47
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for TV sets and water.

48
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
That's when I decided I had to do something.

49
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,

50
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)

51
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
However, after a few failed prototypes,

52
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.

53
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Okay, now for the science bit.

54
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable

55
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.

56
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.

57
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So a 200-nanometer bacteria

58
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.

59
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The smallest virus, on the other hand,

60
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is about 25 nanometers.

61
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.

62
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.

63
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So nothing is getting through.

64
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.

65
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Would you like to see that?

66
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.

67
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We're in the fine city of Oxford.

68
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So -- someone's done that up.

69
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone

70
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and got some water from the River Cherwell,

71
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the River Thames,

72
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that flow through here. And this is the water.

73
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But I got to thinking, you know,

74
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
if we were in the middle of a flood zone

75
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.

76
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.

77
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And this is from my pond.

78
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.

79
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Okay. (Laughs) Right.

80
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We're just going to pour that in there.

81
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Audience: Ugh!

82
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff

83
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
from a sewage plant farm.

84
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So I'm just going to put that in there.

85
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Put that in there. There we go.

87
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.

89
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.

90
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So we're just going to put that in there as well.

91
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Okay. (Laughter) Now.

93
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.

94
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You just scoop the water up.

95
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Today I'm going to use a jug

96
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.

97
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.

98
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,

99
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?

100
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Okay. There we go.

102
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Replace the top.

103
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Give it a few pumps. Okay?

104
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That's all that's necessary.

105
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now as soon as I pop the teat,

106
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
sterile drinking water is going to come out.

107
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I've got to be quick. Okay, ready?

108
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
There we go. Mind the electrics.

109
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That is safe, sterile drinking water.

110
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Applause)

111
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Cheers.

112
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There you go Chris.

114
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Applause)

115
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
What's it taste of?

116
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Chris Anderson: Delicious.

117
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Michael Pritchard: Okay.

118
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?

119
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.

121
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It'll last for 6,000 liters.

122
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology,

123
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the system will shut off, protecting the user.

124
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.

125
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's good for another 6,000 liters.

126
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So let's look at the applications.

127
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?

128
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We ship water.

129
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.

130
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.

131
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?

132
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Diseases spread. More resources are required.

133
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.

134
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But by thinking differently,

135
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and shipping these,

136
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
people can stay put.

137
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They can make their own sterile drinking water,

138
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.

139
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster

140
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for this to work.

141
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure

142
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and pipe work, is too expensive.

143
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
When you run the numbers on a calculator,

144
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you run out of noughts.

145
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So here is the "thinking different" bit.

146
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Instead of shipping water,

147
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and using man-made processes to do it,

148
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.

149
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
She picks the water up from there,

150
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
desalinates it, for free, transports it over there,

151
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.

152
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And where do people live? Near water.

153
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
All we've go to do

154
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is make it sterile. How do we do that?

155
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.

156
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Or we could use one of these.

157
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The same technology, in a jerry can.

158
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This will process 25,000 liters of water;

159
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that's good enough for a family of four,

160
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for three years.

161
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And how much does it cost?

162
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
About half a cent a day to run.

163
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Thank you.

164
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Applause)

165
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So, by thinking differently, and processing water

166
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
at the point of use,

167
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day

168
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to collect their water.

169
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They can get it from a source nearby.

170
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So with just eight billion dollars,

171
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
we can hit the millennium goal's target

172
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
of halving the number of people

173
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
without access to safe drinking water.

174
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
To put that into context,

175
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds

176
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
a year on foreign aid.

177
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But why stop there?

178
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.

179
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So the three-and-a-half billion people

180
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that suffer every year as a result,

181
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the two million kids that die every year,

182
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
will live.

183
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Thank you.

184
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

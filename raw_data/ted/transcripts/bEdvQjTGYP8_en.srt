1
0:00:12.809,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, there's an actor called Dustin Hoffman.

2
0:00:16.285,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And years ago, he made this movie which some of you may have heard of,

3
0:00:19.643,000 --> 0:00:2,000
called "The Graduate."

4
0:00:21.261,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And there's two key scenes in that movie.

5
0:00:24.559,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The first one is the seduction scene.

6
0:00:26.677,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm not going to talk about that tonight.

7
0:00:28.694,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:30.185,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool,

9
0:00:34.799,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word,

10
0:00:39.842,000 --> 0:00:4,000
just one word.

11
0:00:41.835,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And of course, all of you know what that word is.

12
0:00:44.151,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's "plastics."

13
0:00:45.365,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:47.19,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And the only problem with that is, it was completely the wrong advice.

15
0:00:51.146,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:53.229,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let me tell you why it was so wrong.

17
0:00:55.401,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The word should have been "silicon."

18
0:00:58.163,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the reason it should have been silicon

19
0:01:00.211,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is because the basic patents for semiconductors had already been made,

20
0:01:05.416,000 --> 0:01:06,000
had already been filed,

21
0:01:06.817,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and they were already building them.

22
0:01:08.606,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967,

23
0:01:11.717,000 --> 0:01:12,000
when this movie was released.

24
0:01:13.549,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the year after the movie was released,

25
0:01:15.661,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Intel was founded.

26
0:01:17.327,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So had the graduate heard the right one word,

27
0:01:20.177,000 --> 0:01:23,000
maybe he would have ended up onstage -- oh, I don't know --

28
0:01:23.733,000 --> 0:01:24,000
maybe with these two.

29
0:01:24.915,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:31.955,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So as you're thinking of that,

31
0:01:34.626,000 --> 0:01:37,000
let's see what bit of advice we might want to give

32
0:01:38.088,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so that your next graduate doesn't become a Tupperware salesman.

33
0:01:41.702,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:43.606,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So in 2015, what word of advice would you give people,

35
0:01:47.375,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when you took a college graduate out by the pool

36
0:01:50.04,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and you said one word, just one word?

37
0:01:52.698,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I think the answer would be "lifecode."

38
0:01:55.312,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So what is "lifecode?"

39
0:01:56.495,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Lifecode is the various ways we have of programming life.

40
0:01:59.256,000 --> 0:02:,000
So instead of programming computers,

41
0:02:01.115,000 --> 0:02:03,000
we're using things to program viruses

42
0:02:03.812,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or retroviruses or proteins

43
0:02:05.86,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or DNA or RNA

44
0:02:08.501,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or plants or animals, or a whole series of creatures.

45
0:02:11.632,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And as you're thinking about this incredible ability

46
0:02:14.186,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to make life do what you want it to do,

47
0:02:16.463,000 --> 0:02:18,000
what it's programmed to do,

48
0:02:18.604,000 --> 0:02:19,000
what you end up doing

49
0:02:20.421,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is taking what we've been doing for thousands of years,

50
0:02:23.89,000 --> 0:02:26,000
which is breeding, changing,

51
0:02:27.035,000 --> 0:02:29,000
mixing, matching

52
0:02:29.13,000 --> 0:02:31,000
all kinds of life-forms,

53
0:02:31.163,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we accelerate it.

54
0:02:32.648,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And this is not something new.

55
0:02:34.172,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This humble mustard weed has been modified

56
0:02:37.139,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so that if you change it in one way, you get broccoli.

57
0:02:40.714,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And if you change it in a second way, you get kale.

58
0:02:43.764,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And if you change it in a third way,

59
0:02:45.804,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you get cauliflower.

60
0:02:47.662,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So when you go to these all-natural, organic markets,

61
0:02:51.038,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you're really going to a place

62
0:02:52.642,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time.

63
0:02:57.464,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The difference today,

64
0:02:58.652,000 --> 0:03:,000
to pick a completely politically neutral term --

65
0:03:00.921,000 --> 0:03:01,000
[Intelligent design]

66
0:03:02.636,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:03.817,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We're beginning to practice intelligent design.

68
0:03:06.819,000 --> 0:03:08,000
That means that instead of doing this at random

69
0:03:09.081,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and seeing what happens over generations,

70
0:03:11.161,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we're inserting specific genes, we're inserting specific proteins,

71
0:03:14.871,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we're changing lifecode for very deliberate purposes.

72
0:03:18.745,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens.

73
0:03:22.473,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Let me just give you one example.

74
0:03:26.928,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Some of you occasionally might think about sex.

75
0:03:31.299,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And we kind of take it for granted how we've changed sex.

76
0:03:34.552,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So we think it's perfectly normal and natural to change it.

77
0:03:37.96,000 --> 0:03:39,000
What's happened with sex over time is --

78
0:03:40.323,000 --> 0:03:42,000
normally, sex equals baby, eventually.

79
0:03:43.971,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But in today's world,

80
0:03:45.505,000 --> 0:03:47,000
sex plus pill equals no baby.

81
0:03:48.408,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:49.916,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And again, we think that's perfectly normal and natural,

83
0:03:52.678,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but that has not been the case for most of human history.

84
0:03:55.552,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And it's not the case for animals.

85
0:03:57.608,000 --> 0:03:58,000
What it is does is it gives us control,

86
0:03:59.614,000 --> 0:04:01,000
so sex becomes separate from conception.

87
0:04:02.955,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And as you're thinking of the consequences of that,

88
0:04:05.424,000 --> 0:04:06,000
then we've been playing with stuff

89
0:04:07.112,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that's a little bit more advanced, like art.

90
0:04:09.447,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Not in the sense of painting and sculpture,

91
0:04:11.549,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies.

92
0:04:17.405,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So what are assisted reproductive technologies?

93
0:04:19.865,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Assisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization.

94
0:04:24.289,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And when you do in vitro fertilization, there's very good reasons to do it.

95
0:04:27.862,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Sometimes you just can't conceive otherwise.

96
0:04:31.622,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But when you do that,

97
0:04:32.801,000 --> 0:04:36,000
what you’re doing is separating sex, conception, baby.

98
0:04:37.786,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So you haven't just taken control of when you have a baby,

99
0:04:40.714,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized.

100
0:04:44.73,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So you've separated the baby

101
0:04:46.946,000 --> 0:04:47,000
from the body from the act.

102
0:04:49.332,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And as you're thinking of other things we've been doing,

103
0:04:52.436,000 --> 0:04:53,000
think about twins.

104
0:04:55.029,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So you can freeze sperm, you can freeze eggs,

105
0:04:57.173,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you can freeze fertilized eggs.

106
0:04:59.778,000 --> 0:05:,000
And what does that mean?

107
0:05:01.567,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Well, that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient.

108
0:05:04.085,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation,

109
0:05:07.113,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so you save these things.

110
0:05:08.367,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You don't irradiate them.

111
0:05:10.072,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But if you can save them and you can freeze them,

112
0:05:12.422,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and you can have a surrogate mother,

113
0:05:14.548,000 --> 0:05:16,000
it means that you've decoupled sex from time.

114
0:05:17.71,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It means you can have twins born -- oh, in 50 years?

115
0:05:23.287,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In a hundred years?

117
0:05:29.342,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Two hundred years?

118
0:05:31.566,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And these are three really profound changes

119
0:05:34.377,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that are not, like, future stuff.

120
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is stuff we take for granted today.

121
0:05:38.911,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower.

122
0:05:42.52,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses,

123
0:05:46.88,000 --> 0:05:48,000
of changing plants, of changing animals,

124
0:05:49.84,000 --> 0:05:51,000
perhaps even of evolving ourselves.

125
0:05:52.118,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's something that Steve Gullans and I have been thinking about for a while.

126
0:05:56.749,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Let's have some risks.

127
0:05:58.408,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Like every powerful technology, like electricity, like an automobile,

128
0:06:02.576,000 --> 0:06:05,000
like computers, this stuff potentially can be misused.

129
0:06:06.631,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And that scares a lot of people.

130
0:06:09.02,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And as you apply these technologies,

131
0:06:10.809,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you can even turn human beings into chimeras.

132
0:06:13.815,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Remember the Greek myth where you mix animals?

133
0:06:16.378,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Well, some of these treatments

134
0:06:18.388,000 --> 0:06:2,000
actually end up changing your blood type.

135
0:06:21.406,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Or they'll put male cells in a female body or vice versa,

136
0:06:26.326,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which sounds absolutely horrible

137
0:06:27.938,000 --> 0:06:29,000
until you realize, the reason you're doing that

138
0:06:30.239,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is you're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments.

139
0:06:33.668,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So by taking somebody else's bone marrow,

140
0:06:35.94,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself,

141
0:06:38.656,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but you're also saving your life.

142
0:06:40.568,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And as you're thinking about this stuff,

143
0:06:42.738,000 --> 0:06:44,000
here's something that happened 20 years ago.

144
0:06:45.337,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is Emma Ott.

145
0:06:46.886,000 --> 0:06:48,000
She's a recent college admittee.

146
0:06:49.719,000 --> 0:06:5,000
She's studying accounting.

147
0:06:51.648,000 --> 0:06:54,000
She played two varsity sports. She graduated as a valedictorian.

148
0:06:55.687,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And that's not particularly extraordinary,

149
0:06:57.731,000 --> 0:07:,000
except that she's the first human being born to three parents.

150
0:07:02.244,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Why?

151
0:07:03.419,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease

152
0:07:05.609,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that she might have inherited.

153
0:07:07.118,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So when you swap out a third person's DNA

154
0:07:09.523,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and you put it in there,

155
0:07:11.275,000 --> 0:07:12,000
you save the lives of people.

156
0:07:13.84,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But you also are doing germline engineering,

157
0:07:16.245,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which means her kids, if she has kids, will be saved

158
0:07:20.412,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and won't go through this.

159
0:07:21.846,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And [their] kids will be saved,

160
0:07:23.361,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and their grandchildren will be saved,

161
0:07:25.22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and this passes on.

162
0:07:26.929,000 --> 0:07:27,000
That makes people nervous.

163
0:07:28.578,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So 20 years ago, the various authorities said,

164
0:07:30.952,000 --> 0:07:31,000
why don't we study this for a while?

165
0:07:33.903,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There are risks to doing stuff, and there are risks to not doing stuff,

166
0:07:37.741,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology,

167
0:07:41.113,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and then we've been thinking about it for the next 20 years.

168
0:07:45.002,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So as we think about it,

169
0:07:46.209,000 --> 0:07:49,000
as we take the time to say, "Hey, maybe we should have longer studies,

170
0:07:50.043,000 --> 0:07:52,000
maybe we should do this, maybe we should do that,"

171
0:07:52.468,000 --> 0:07:55,000
there are consequences to acting, and there are consequences to not acting.

172
0:07:57.203,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Like curing deadly diseases --

173
0:07:59.688,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which, by the way, is completely unnatural.

174
0:08:02.997,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It is normal and natural for humans to be felled

175
0:08:06.103,000 --> 0:08:1,000
by massive epidemics of polio, of smallpox, of tuberculosis.

176
0:08:10.196,000 --> 0:08:13,000
When we put vaccines into people, we are putting unnatural things

177
0:08:13.863,000 --> 0:08:14,000
into their body

178
0:08:15.253,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because we think the benefit outweighs the risk.

179
0:08:20.129,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Because we've built unnatural plants, unnatural animals,

180
0:08:23.866,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we can feed about seven billion people.

181
0:08:26.413,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We can do things like create new life-forms.

182
0:08:30.302,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And as you create new life-forms, again, that sounds terribly scary

183
0:08:33.843,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and terribly bothersome,

184
0:08:35.548,000 --> 0:08:38,000
until you realize that those life-forms live on your dining room table.

185
0:08:39.539,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Those flowers you've got on your dining room table --

186
0:08:42.06,000 --> 0:08:44,000
there's not a lot that's natural about them,

187
0:08:44.253,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because people have been breeding the flowers to make this color,

188
0:08:47.369,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to be this size, to last for a week.

189
0:08:49.153,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You don't usually give your loved one wildflowers

190
0:08:51.566,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because they don't last a whole lot of time.

191
0:08:56.532,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What all this does

192
0:08:58.421,000 --> 0:09:,000
is it flips Darwin completely on his head.

193
0:09:01.159,000 --> 0:09:02,000
See, for four billion years,

194
0:09:02.924,000 --> 0:09:05,000
what lived and died on this planet depended on two principles:

195
0:09:06.608,000 --> 0:09:08,000
on natural selection and random mutation.

196
0:09:10.016,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And so what lived and died, what was structured,

197
0:09:13.167,000 --> 0:09:14,000
has now been flipped on its head.

198
0:09:16.262,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And what we've done

199
0:09:17.485,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is created this completely parallel evolutionary system

200
0:09:20.12,000 --> 0:09:23,000
where we are practicing unnatural selection and non-random mutation.

201
0:09:23.473,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So let me explain these things.

202
0:09:25.192,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is natural selection.

203
0:09:27.09,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is unnatural selection.

204
0:09:28.519,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

205
0:09:31.903,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So what happens with this stuff is,

206
0:09:34.571,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we started breeding wolves thousands of years ago

207
0:09:37.309,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in central Asia to turn them into dogs.

208
0:09:39.523,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And then we started turning them into big dogs

209
0:09:41.841,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and into little dogs.

210
0:09:43.616,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But if you take one of the chihuahuas

211
0:09:45.427,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue

212
0:09:48.299,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and you let it loose on the African plain,

213
0:09:50.98,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you can watch natural selection happen.

214
0:09:52.988,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

215
0:09:58.419,000 --> 0:10:,000
Few things on Earth are less natural than a cornfield.

216
0:10:02.188,000 --> 0:10:05,000
You will never, under any scenario, walk through a virgin forest

217
0:10:05.785,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and see the same plant growing in orderly rows

218
0:10:08.494,000 --> 0:10:09,000
at the same time,

219
0:10:09.842,000 --> 0:10:1,000
nothing else living there.

220
0:10:12.398,000 --> 0:10:13,000
When you do a cornfield,

221
0:10:13.581,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you're selecting what lives and what dies.

222
0:10:16.08,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And you're doing that through unnatural selection.

223
0:10:18.443,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's the same with a wheat field, it's the same with a rice field.

224
0:10:21.604,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It's the same with a city, it's the same with a suburb.

225
0:10:24.243,000 --> 0:10:25,000
In fact, half the surface of Earth

226
0:10:26.162,000 --> 0:10:27,000
has been unnaturally engineered

227
0:10:27.693,000 --> 0:10:3,000
so that what lives and what dies there is what we want,

228
0:10:30.9,000 --> 0:10:32,000
which is the reason why you don't have grizzly bears

229
0:10:33.387,000 --> 0:10:34,000
walking through downtown Manhattan.

230
0:10:37.077,000 --> 0:10:38,000
How about this random mutation stuff?

231
0:10:38.96,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Well, this is random mutation.

232
0:10:40.427,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is Antonio Alfonseca.

233
0:10:42.35,000 --> 0:10:44,000
He's otherwise known as the Octopus, his nickname.

234
0:10:45.085,000 --> 0:10:47,000
He was the Relief Pitcher of the Year in 2000.

235
0:10:47.955,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers

236
0:10:50.743,000 --> 0:10:52,000
on each hand,

237
0:10:52.995,000 --> 0:10:54,000
which turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher.

238
0:10:55.661,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

239
0:10:58.119,000 --> 0:10:59,000
How about non-random mutation?

240
0:11:00.415,000 --> 0:11:02,000
A non-random mutation is beer.

241
0:11:03.412,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's wine. It's yogurt.

242
0:11:05.928,000 --> 0:11:07,000
How many times have you walked through the forest

243
0:11:08.288,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and found all-natural cheese?

244
0:11:10.859,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Or all-natural yogurt?

245
0:11:13.046,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So we've been engineering this stuff.

246
0:11:14.855,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Now, the interesting thing is,

247
0:11:16.347,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we get to know the stuff better.

248
0:11:18.364,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We found one of the single most powerful gene-editing instruments,

249
0:11:22.101,000 --> 0:11:23,000
CRISPR, inside yogurt.

250
0:11:25.028,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And as we start engineering cells,

251
0:11:27.042,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we're producing eight out of the top 10 pharmaceutical products,

252
0:11:32.246,000 --> 0:11:34,000
including the stuff that you use to treat arthritis,

253
0:11:34.795,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which is the number one best-selling drug, Humira.

254
0:11:37.985,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So this lifecode stuff.

255
0:11:40.229,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It really is a superpower.

256
0:11:42.156,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It really is a way of programming stuff,

257
0:11:44.094,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and there's nothing that's going to change us

258
0:11:46.675,000 --> 0:11:48,000
more than this lifecode.

259
0:11:49.597,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So as you're thinking of lifecode,

260
0:11:51.602,000 --> 0:11:52,000
let's think of five principles

261
0:11:54.231,000 --> 0:11:55,000
as to how we start guiding,

262
0:11:56.11,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and I'd love you to give me more.

263
0:11:58.315,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So, principle number one:

264
0:12:00.282,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we have to take responsibility for this stuff.

265
0:12:03.042,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The reason we have to take responsibility

266
0:12:05.617,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is because we're in charge.

267
0:12:07.002,000 --> 0:12:08,000
These aren't random mutations.

268
0:12:08.939,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This is what we are doing, what we are choosing.

269
0:12:11.266,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's not, "Stuff happened."

270
0:12:12.989,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It didn't happen at random.

271
0:12:14.486,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It didn't come down by a verdict of somebody else.

272
0:12:17.114,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We engineer this stuff,

273
0:12:18.955,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and it's the Pottery Barn rule: you break it, you own it.

274
0:12:22.962,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Principle number two:

275
0:12:24.515,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff.

276
0:12:27.667,000 --> 0:12:3,000
There have been at least 33 versions of hominids

277
0:12:30.825,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that have walked around this Earth.

278
0:12:32.912,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Most all of them went extinct except us.

279
0:12:35.804,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But the normal and natural state of this Earth

280
0:12:37.989,000 --> 0:12:4,000
is we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time,

281
0:12:41.4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
which is why most of us have some Neanderthal in us.

282
0:12:44.559,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Some of us have some Denisova in us.

283
0:12:47.023,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And some in Washington have a lot more of it.

284
0:12:49.396,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Laughter)

285
0:12:51.998,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Principle number three:

286
0:12:53.907,000 --> 0:12:55,000
we have to respect other people's choices.

287
0:12:56.608,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Some people will choose to never alter.

288
0:12:58.907,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Some people will choose to alter all.

289
0:13:00.741,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Some people will choose to alter plants but not animals.

290
0:13:03.391,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Some people will choose to alter themselves.

291
0:13:05.466,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Some people will choose to evolve themselves.

292
0:13:07.753,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Diversity is not a bad thing,

293
0:13:09.346,000 --> 0:13:11,000
because even though we think of humans as very diverse,

294
0:13:12.012,000 --> 0:13:14,000
we came so close to extinction

295
0:13:14.321,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that all of us descend from a single African mother

296
0:13:16.96,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and the consequence of that

297
0:13:18.309,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is there's more genetic diversity in 55 African chimpanzees

298
0:13:22.838,000 --> 0:13:23,000
than there are in seven billion humans.

299
0:13:26.254,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Principle number four:

300
0:13:29.079,000 --> 0:13:31,000
we should take about a quarter of the Earth

301
0:13:31.78,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and only let Darwin run the show there.

302
0:13:34.981,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It doesn't have to be contiguous,

303
0:13:36.606,000 --> 0:13:37,000
doesn't have to all be tied together.

304
0:13:38.404,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It should be part in the oceans, part on land.

305
0:13:40.634,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet.

306
0:13:44.474,000 --> 0:13:46,000
We want to have our evolutionary system running.

307
0:13:46.936,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We want to have Darwin's evolutionary system running.

308
0:13:49.537,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And it's just really important to have these two things running in parallel

309
0:13:53.237,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and not overwhelm evolution.

310
0:13:54.778,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

311
0:14:02.307,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Last thing I'll say.

312
0:14:04.654,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on.

313
0:14:07.94,000 --> 0:14:1,000
This is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had.

314
0:14:11.005,000 --> 0:14:13,000
It would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff

315
0:14:13.897,000 --> 0:14:14,000
because you're scared of it,

316
0:14:15.333,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because you're hiding from it.

317
0:14:17.096,000 --> 0:14:2,000
You can participate in the ethics. You can participate in the politics.

318
0:14:20.491,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You can participate in the business.

319
0:14:22.264,000 --> 0:14:25,000
You can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going,

320
0:14:25.446,000 --> 0:14:26,000
where industry is going,

321
0:14:26.631,000 --> 0:14:27,000
where we're going to take the world.

322
0:14:28.458,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It would be a crime for all of us

323
0:14:30.347,000 --> 0:14:34,000
not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool

324
0:14:34.429,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and says one word, just one word,

325
0:14:37.499,000 --> 0:14:39,000
if you don't listen if that word is "lifecode."

326
0:14:39.922,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Thank you very much.

327
0:14:41.224,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Applause)

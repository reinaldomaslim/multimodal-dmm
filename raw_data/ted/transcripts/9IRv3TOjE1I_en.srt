1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm here today to share with you

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
an extraordinary journey -

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually -

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which brought me into

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
training rats

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to save human lives

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
by detecting landmines

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and tuberculosis.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
As a child, I had two passions.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
One was a passion for rodents.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I had all kinds of rats,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
mice, hamsters,

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
gerbils, squirrels.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I also had a passion for Africa.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Growing up in a multicultural environment,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we had African students in the house,

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I learned about their stories,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so different backgrounds,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
dependency on imported know-how,

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
goods, services,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
exuberant cultural diversity.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Africa was truly fascinating for me.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I became an industrial engineer,

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
engineer in product development,

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I focused on appropriate detection technologies,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
actually the first appropriate technologies

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for developing countries.

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I started working in the industry,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but I wasn't really happy to contribute

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to a material consumer society

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in a linear, extracting

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and manufacturing mode.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem:

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
landmines.

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We're talking '95 now.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Princess Diana is announcing on TV

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that landmines form a structural barrier

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to any development, which is really true.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
As long as these devices are there,

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or there is suspicion of landmines,

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you can't really enter into the land.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for new detectors

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
sustainable in the environments

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
where they're needed to produce,

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which is mainly in the developing world.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We chose rats.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Why would you choose rats?

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Because, aren't they vermin?

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Well, actually rats are,

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in contrary to what most people think about them,

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
rats are highly sociable creatures.

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And actually, our product -- what you see here.

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
There's a target somewhere here.

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You see an operator, a trained African

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
with his rats in front

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
who actually are left and right.

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
There, the animal finds a mine.

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It scratches on the soil.

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And the animal comes back for a food reward.

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Very, very simple.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Very sustainable in this environment.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Here, the animal gets its food reward.

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And that's how it works.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Very, very simple.

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now why would you use rats?

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Rats have been used since the '50s last century,

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in all kinds of experiments.

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Rats have more genetic material

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
allocated to olfaction

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
than any other mammal species.

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They're extremely sensitive to smell.

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and to communicate about it.

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now how do we communicate with rats?

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well don't talk rat,

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but we have a clicker,

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a standard method for animal training,

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which you see there.

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
A clicker, which makes a particular sound

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Once the animal knows click, food,

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
click, food, click, food --

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so click is food --

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we bring it in a cage with a hole,

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and actually the animal learns

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to stick the nose in the hole

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
under which a target scent is placed,

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and to do that for five seconds --

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
five seconds, which is long for a rat.

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It learns how to find the target smell

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Then the animal learns

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to walk on a leash in the open

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and find targets.

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In the next step, animals learn

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to find real mines in real minefields.

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They are tested and accredited

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
according to International Mine Action Standards,

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
just like dogs have to pass a test.

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This consists of 400 square meters.

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There's a number of mines

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
placed blindly,

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the team of trainer and their rat

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
have to find all the targets.

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
If the animal does that, it gets a license

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
as an accredited animal

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to be operational in the field --

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
just like dogs, by the way.

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Maybe one slight difference:

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we can train rats at a fifth of the price

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of training the mining dog.

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is our team in Mozambique:

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
one Tanzanian trainer,

120
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
who transfers the skills

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to these three Mozambican fellows.

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.

123
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They have a skill,

124
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which makes them much less dependent

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
on foreign aid.

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Moreover, this small team

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the manual de-miners to follow-up.

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But with this small investment in a rat capacity,

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we have demonstrated in Mozambique

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
up to 60 percent

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
of what is currently normal --

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and we can still bring that price down.

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Question of scale.

137
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If you can bring in more rats,

138
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we can actually make the output even bigger.

139
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.

140
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Eleven African governments

141
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
have seen that they can become less dependent

142
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
by using this technology.

143
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
They have signed the pact for peace

144
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and treaty in the Great Lakes region,

145
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and they endorse hero rats

146
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to clear their common borders of landmines.

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But let me bring you to a very different problem.

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And there's about 6,000 people last year

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that walked on a landmine,

150
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but worldwide last year,

151
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
as a first cause of infection.

153
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Especially in Africa

154
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,

155
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
there is a huge common problem.

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure,

157
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.

158
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It means that, if you have T.B.,

162
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
you have more chance that you won't be detected,

163
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And if, however,

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
you are detected very early, diagnosed early,

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
treatment can start,

167
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You can actually cure T.B.,

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
even in HIV-positives.

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So in our common language, Dutch,

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the name for T.B.

172
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is "tering,"

173
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which, etymologically,

174
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
refers to the smell of tar.

175
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Already the old Chinese

176
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and the Greek, Hippocrates,

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
have actually published,

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
based on the volatiles

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
exuding from patients.

181
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So what we did is we collected some samples --

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
just as a way of testing --

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
from hospitals,

184
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
trained rats on them

185
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and see if this works,

186
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and wonder, well,

187
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we can reach 89 percent sensitivity,

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
86 percent specificity

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
using multiple rats in a row.

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is how it works,

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and really, this is a generic technology.

192
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but can you imagine,

194
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
you can actually put anything under there.

195
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So how does it work?

196
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You have a cassette with 10 samples.

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.

198
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second

199
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.

200
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Here it's already at the third sample.

201
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
This is a positive sample.

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.

203
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And by doing so, very fast,

204
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we can have like a second-line opinion

205
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to see which patients are positive,

206
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
which are negative.

207
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Just as an indication,

208
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
whereas a microscopist can process

209
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
40 samples in a day,

210
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
a rat can process

211
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the same amount of samples

212
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in seven minutes only.

213
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
A cage like this --

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

215
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
A cage like this -- provided that you have rats,

216
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and we have now currently

217
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
25 tuberculosis rats --

218
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
a cage like this, operating throughout the day,

219
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
can process 1,680 samples.

220
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications --

221
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
environmental detection

222
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of pollutants in soils,

223
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
customs applications,

224
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.

225
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.

226
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I just want to briefly highlight,

227
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the blue rods

228
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
are the scores of microscopy only

229
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam

230
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
on a population of 500,000 people,

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
where 15,000 reported to get a test done.

232
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.

233
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats

234
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
and looping those results back,

235
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we were able to increase case detection rates

236
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
by over 30 percent.

237
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Throughout last year,

238
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
we've been -- depending on which intervals you take --

239
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
we've been consistently

240
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
increasing case detection rates

241
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam

242
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
between 30 and 40 percent.

243
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So this is really considerable.

244
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy

245
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
infects up to 15 people,

246
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
healthy people, per year,

247
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
you can be sure

248
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that we have saved lots of lives.

249
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.

250
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The way forward for us

251
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is now to standardize this technology.

252
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And there are simple things

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole

254
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
where the animal has to stick for five seconds.

255
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So, to standardize this.

256
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Also, to standardize the pellets,

257
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the food rewards,

258
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and to semi-automate this

259
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in order to replicate this on a much larger scale

260
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and affect the lives of many more people.

261
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.

262
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Here is a first prototype

263
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
of our camera rat,

264
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
which is a rat with a rat backpack

265
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
with a camera that can go under rubble

266
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to detect for victims

267
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
after earthquake and so on.

268
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This is in a prototype stage.

269
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We don't have a working system here yet.

270
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
To conclude, I would actually like to say,

271
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
you may think this is about rats, these projects,

272
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but in the end it is about people.

273
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It is about empowering vulnerable communities

274
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to tackle difficult, expensive

275
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,

276
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and doing that with a local resource,

277
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
plenty available.

278
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So something completely different

279
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is to keep on challenging your perception

280
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
about the resources surrounding you,

281
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
whether they are environmental,

282
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
technological, animal, or human.

283
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And to respectfully harmonize with them

284
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in order to foster a sustainable world.

285
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Thank you very much.

286
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Applause)

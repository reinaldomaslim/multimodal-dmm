2
0:00:15.916,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Living with a physical disability isn't easy

3
0:00:19.157,000 --> 0:00:21,000
anywhere in the world,

4
0:00:21.38,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but if you live in a country like the United States,

5
0:00:24.209,000 --> 0:00:27,000
there's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier.

6
0:00:27.302,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So if you're in a building, you can take an elevator.

7
0:00:29.975,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If you're crossing the street, you have sidewalk cutouts.

8
0:00:32.255,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And if you have to travel some distance farther

9
0:00:34.518,000 --> 0:00:37,000
than you can do under your own power, there's accessible vehicles,

10
0:00:37.685,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and if you can't afford one of those,

11
0:00:39.546,000 --> 0:00:41,000
there's accessible public transportation.

12
0:00:41.919,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But in the developing world, things are quite different.

13
0:00:44.61,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There's 40 million people who need a wheelchair but don't have one,

14
0:00:47.829,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the majority of these people live in rural areas,

15
0:00:51.184,000 --> 0:00:54,000
where the only connections to community, to employment, to education,

16
0:00:55.069,000 --> 0:00:57,000
are by traveling long distances on rough terrain

17
0:00:57.552,000 --> 0:00:59,000
often under their own power.

18
0:01:00.289,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And the devices usually available to these people

19
0:01:02.647,000 --> 0:01:04,000
are not made for that context, break down quickly,

20
0:01:05.105,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and are hard to repair.

21
0:01:07.415,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in 2005,

22
0:01:12.135,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when I spent the summer assessing the state of technology in Tanzania,

23
0:01:15.951,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair manufacturers, disability groups,

24
0:01:19.764,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and what stood out to me

25
0:01:21.621,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is that there wasn't a device available

26
0:01:24.073,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that was designed for rural areas, that could go fast

27
0:01:26.621,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and efficiently on many types of terrain.

28
0:01:29.237,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So being a mechanical engineer,

29
0:01:31.02,000 --> 0:01:33,000
being at MIT and having lots of resources available to me,

30
0:01:33.806,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I thought I'd try to do something about it.

31
0:01:36.12,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now when you're talking about trying to travel

32
0:01:39.073,000 --> 0:01:41,000
long distances on rough terrain,

33
0:01:41.279,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I immediately thought of a mountain bike,

34
0:01:43.012,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and a mountain bike's good at doing this

35
0:01:44.425,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because it has a gear train,

36
0:01:46.264,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill

37
0:01:49.098,000 --> 0:01:5,000
or go through mud or sand

38
0:01:50.724,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and you get a lot of torque but a low speed.

39
0:01:52.838,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And if you want to go faster, say on pavement,

40
0:01:54.953,000 --> 0:01:55,000
you can shift to a high gear,

41
0:01:56.358,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and you get less torque, but higher speeds.

42
0:01:58.43,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So the logical evolution here

43
0:02:00.011,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components,

44
0:02:02.845,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which many people have done.

45
0:02:04.203,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But these are two products available in the U.S. that

46
0:02:07.385,000 --> 0:02:09,000
would be difficult to transfer into developing countries

47
0:02:10.076,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because they're much, much too expensive.

48
0:02:12.626,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And the context I'm talking about is where

49
0:02:14.902,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars.

50
0:02:18.898,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And this ideal product would also be able to go

51
0:02:21.329,000 --> 0:02:24,000
about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job, get to school,

52
0:02:25.333,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and do it on many, many different types of terrain.

53
0:02:27.185,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work,

54
0:02:30.077,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.

55
0:02:34.498,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And furthermore, if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas,

56
0:02:37.903,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge

57
0:02:41.965,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in those contexts.

58
0:02:44.781,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So the real crux of the problem here is,

59
0:02:47.721,000 --> 0:02:5,000
how do you make a system that's a simple device

60
0:02:50.869,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but gives you a large mechanical advantage?

61
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
How do you make a mountain bike for your arms

62
0:02:55.187,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that doesn't have the mountain bike cost and complexity?

63
0:02:57.878,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So as is the case with simple solutions,

64
0:03:00.279,000 --> 0:03:03,000
oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face, and for us it was levers.

65
0:03:04.065,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We use levers all the time, in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.

66
0:03:08.699,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And that moment of inspiration, that key invention moment,

67
0:03:11.485,000 --> 0:03:13,000
was when I was sitting in front of my design notebook

68
0:03:14.033,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever,

69
0:03:16.805,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and if they grab near the end of the lever,

70
0:03:18.918,000 --> 0:03:19,000
they can get an effectively long lever

71
0:03:20.752,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth,

72
0:03:23.577,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and effectively get a low gear.

73
0:03:25.797,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And as they slide their hand down the lever,

74
0:03:28.204,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they can push with a smaller effective lever length,

75
0:03:31.04,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but push through a bigger angle every stroke,

76
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which makes a faster rotational speed, and gives you an effective high gear.

77
0:03:36.819,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So what's exciting about this system

78
0:03:38.571,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is that it's really, really mechanically simple,

79
0:03:41.174,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and you could make it using technology

80
0:03:43.008,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that's been around for hundreds of years.

81
0:03:44.99,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So seeing this in practice,

82
0:03:47.175,000 --> 0:03:48,000
this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that,

83
0:03:49.152,000 --> 0:03:5,000
after a few years of development,

84
0:03:50.892,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we're now going into production with,

85
0:03:52.829,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and this is a full-time wheelchair user --

86
0:03:54.853,000 --> 0:03:55,000
he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala,

87
0:03:56.394,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and you see he's able to traverse pretty rough terrain.

88
0:04:00.393,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Again, the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast,

89
0:04:04.924,000 --> 0:04:08,000
he just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke,

90
0:04:08.979,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and as the going gets tougher, he just slides his hands up the levers,

91
0:04:11.904,000 --> 0:04:13,000
creates more torque, and kind of bench-presses his way

92
0:04:14.5,000 --> 0:04:16,000
out of trouble through the rough terrain.

93
0:04:16.686,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now the big, important point here is that

94
0:04:19.698,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the person is the complex machine in this system.

95
0:04:22.411,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's the person that's sliding his hands up and down the levers,

96
0:04:25.757,000 --> 0:04:27,000
so the mechanism itself can be very simple

97
0:04:28.479,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world.

98
0:04:31.551,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Because those bicycle parts

99
0:04:33.142,000 --> 0:04:35,000
are so ubiquitously available, they're super-cheap.

100
0:04:35.647,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They're made by the gazillions in China and India,

101
0:04:37.827,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and we can source them anywhere in the world,

102
0:04:39.683,000 --> 0:04:41,000
build the chair anywhere, and most importantly repair it,

103
0:04:42.422,000 --> 0:04:44,000
even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic

104
0:04:44.875,000 --> 0:04:48,000
who has local tools, knowledge and parts available.

105
0:04:49.23,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now, when you want to use the LFC indoors,

106
0:04:51.907,000 --> 0:04:54,000
all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain,

107
0:04:55.427,000 --> 0:04:58,000
stow them in the frame, and it converts into a normal wheelchair

108
0:04:58.704,000 --> 0:05:,000
that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair,

109
0:05:01.348,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we sized it like a normal wheelchair,

110
0:05:03.365,000 --> 0:05:07,000
so it's narrow enough to fit through a standard doorway,

111
0:05:07.5,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it's low enough to fit under a table,

112
0:05:11.019,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and it's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom

113
0:05:15.012,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet,

114
0:05:18.036,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and be able to transfer off

115
0:05:19.74,000 --> 0:05:24,000
just like he could in a normal wheelchair.

116
0:05:25.331,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now, there's three important points that I want to stress

117
0:05:28.423,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that I think really hit home in this project.

118
0:05:32.055,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The first is that this product works well because

119
0:05:35.259,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we were effectively able to combine

120
0:05:37.29,000 --> 0:05:41,000
rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design

121
0:05:41.844,000 --> 0:05:44,000
focused on the social and usage and economic factors

122
0:05:45.221,000 --> 0:05:47,000
important to wheelchair users in the developing countries.

123
0:05:47.758,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So I'm an academic at MIT, and I'm a mechanical engineer,

124
0:05:50.246,000 --> 0:05:53,000
so I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on,

125
0:05:53.794,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and figure out how much resistance it should impose,

126
0:05:56.442,000 --> 0:05:58,000
look at the parts we have available and mix and match them

127
0:05:59.45,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use,

128
0:06:02.095,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body

129
0:06:05.204,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair

130
0:06:07.167,000 --> 0:06:09,000
as you put your arms up and down the levers.

131
0:06:09.538,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So as a wet-behind-the-ears student, excited,

132
0:06:13.197,000 --> 0:06:15,000
our team made a prototype,

133
0:06:15.322,000 --> 0:06:19,000
brought that prototype to Tanzania, Kenya and Vietnam in 2008,

134
0:06:20.197,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and found it was terrible

135
0:06:22.331,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because we didn't get enough input from users.

136
0:06:24.768,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So because we tested it with wheelchair users,

137
0:06:27.934,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with wheelchair manufacturers, we got that feedback from them,

138
0:06:30.44,000 --> 0:06:33,000
not just articulating their problems, but articulating their solutions,

139
0:06:33.894,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design,

140
0:06:37.442,000 --> 0:06:39,000
which we brought back to East Africa in '09

141
0:06:39.592,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain,

142
0:06:42.437,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big,

143
0:06:45.319,000 --> 0:06:46,000
it was heavy, it was hard to move around,

144
0:06:47.317,000 --> 0:06:5,000
so again with that user feedback, we went back to the drawing board,

145
0:06:50.871,000 --> 0:06:52,000
came up with a better design, 20 pounds lighter,

146
0:06:53.186,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested that in a field trial in Guatemala,

147
0:06:56.877,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and that advanced the product to the point

148
0:06:58.901,000 --> 0:07:01,000
where we have now that it's going into production.

149
0:07:02.124,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Now also being engineering scientists,

150
0:07:04.37,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we were able to quantify the performance benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,

151
0:07:08.252,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so here are some shots of our trial in Guatemala

152
0:07:10.892,000 --> 0:07:13,000
where we tested the LFC on village terrain,

153
0:07:14.434,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and tested people's biomechanical outputs,

154
0:07:16.458,000 --> 0:07:18,000
their oxygen consumption, how fast they go,

155
0:07:18.645,000 --> 0:07:19,000
how much power they're putting out,

156
0:07:20.336,000 --> 0:07:22,000
both in their regular wheelchairs and using the LFC,

157
0:07:23.235,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and we found that the LFC is about 80 percent faster

158
0:07:25.736,000 --> 0:07:27,000
going on these terrains than a normal wheelchair.

159
0:07:28.094,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It's also about 40 percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair,

160
0:07:31.477,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and because of the mechanical advantage you get from the levers,

161
0:07:34.02,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you can produce 50 percent higher torque

162
0:07:35.949,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and really muscle your way through the really, really rough terrain.

163
0:07:39.933,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now the second lesson that we learned in this is that

164
0:07:43.369,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the constraints on this design really push the innovation,

165
0:07:46.269,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because we had to hit such a low price point,

166
0:07:48.533,000 --> 0:07:5,000
because we had to make a device that could travel

167
0:07:50.843,000 --> 0:07:52,000
on many, many types of terrain but still be usable indoors,

168
0:07:53.662,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and be simple enough to repair,

169
0:07:55.953,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we ended up with a fundamentally new product,

170
0:07:58.32,000 --> 0:08:,000
a new product that is an innovation

171
0:08:00.436,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in a space that really hasn't changed in a hundred years.

172
0:08:03.353,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world.

173
0:08:06.806,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Why not in countries like the U.S. too?

174
0:08:09.245,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So we teamed up with Continuum,

175
0:08:10.981,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a local product design firm here in Boston

176
0:08:13.005,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to make the high-end version, the developed world version,

177
0:08:16.013,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that we'll probably sell primarily in the U.S. and Europe,

178
0:08:18.799,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but to higher-income buyers.

179
0:08:21.6,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the final point I want to make is that I think

180
0:08:24.586,000 --> 0:08:26,000
this project worked well because we engaged

181
0:08:27.412,000 --> 0:08:31,000
all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider

182
0:08:32.023,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in bringing the technology from inception of an idea

183
0:08:35.366,000 --> 0:08:39,000
through innovation, validation, commercialization and dissemination,

184
0:08:39.605,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and that cycle has to start and end with end users.

185
0:08:43.35,000 --> 0:08:45,000
These are the people that define the requirements of the technology,

186
0:08:46.125,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and these are the people that have to give the thumbs-up at the end,

187
0:08:48.463,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and say, "Yeah, it actually works. It meets our needs."

188
0:08:51.107,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So people like me in the academic space,

189
0:08:53.037,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we can do things like innovate and analyze and test,

190
0:08:56.408,000 --> 0:08:59,000
create data and make bench-level prototypes,

191
0:08:59.504,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but how do you get that bench-level prototype to commercialization?

192
0:09:02.671,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So we need gap-fillers like Continuum that can work on commercializing,

193
0:09:06.083,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and we started a whole NGO to bring our chair to market --

194
0:09:08.869,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Global Research Innovation Technology --

195
0:09:11.034,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and then we also teamed up with a big manufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,

196
0:09:14.766,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that's tooled up now to make 500 chairs a month

197
0:09:17.029,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and will make the first batch of 200 next month,

198
0:09:18.832,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which will be delivered in India.

199
0:09:20.8,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And then finally, to get this out to the people in scale,

200
0:09:23.539,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we teamed up with the largest disability organization

201
0:09:26.087,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in the world, Jaipur Foot.

202
0:09:28.374,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now what's powerful about this model

203
0:09:30.653,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is when you bring together all these stakeholders

204
0:09:33.46,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that represent each link in the chain

205
0:09:35.429,000 --> 0:09:37,000
from inception of an idea

206
0:09:37.97,000 --> 0:09:39,000
all the way to implementation in the field,

207
0:09:40.738,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that's where the magic happens.

208
0:09:42.289,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That's where you can take a guy like me, an academic,

209
0:09:44.837,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but analyze and test and create a new technology

210
0:09:47.865,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is.

211
0:09:51.401,000 --> 0:09:53,000
You can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers

212
0:09:54.062,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and talk with them face-to-face and leverage their

213
0:09:56.322,000 --> 0:09:58,000
local knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients

214
0:09:59.193,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge

215
0:10:01.932,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to create something greater than either of us could have done alone.

216
0:10:05.262,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And then you can also engage the end user

217
0:10:07.793,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in the design process, and not just ask him what he needs,

218
0:10:10.579,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved.

219
0:10:13.528,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And this picture was taken in India in our last field trial,

220
0:10:16.585,000 --> 0:10:18,000
where we had a 90-percent adoption rate where people

221
0:10:19.086,000 --> 0:10:22,000
switched to using our Leveraged Freedom Chair over their normal wheelchair,

222
0:10:22.692,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and this picture specifically is of Ashok,

223
0:10:25.653,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and Ashok had a spinal injury when he fell out of a tree,

224
0:10:28.685,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and he had been working at a tailor, but once he was injured

225
0:10:31.567,000 --> 0:10:33,000
he wasn't able to transport himself from his house

226
0:10:34.45,000 --> 0:10:36,000
over a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair.

227
0:10:37.25,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The road was too rough.

228
0:10:38.521,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But the day after he got an LFC, he hopped in it,

229
0:10:41.442,000 --> 0:10:43,000
rode that kilometer, opened up his shop

230
0:10:43.526,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms

231
0:10:46.242,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and started making money, started providing for his family again.

232
0:10:49.362,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Ashok: You also encouraged me to work.

233
0:10:51.211,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I rested for a day at home.

234
0:10:53.935,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The next day I went to my shop.

235
0:10:58.391,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now everything is back to normal.

236
0:11:01.369,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Amos Winter: And thank you very much for having me today.

237
0:11:05.454,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause)

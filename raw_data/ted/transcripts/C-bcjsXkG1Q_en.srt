1
0:00:12.639,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Now, this is Joanna.

2
0:00:14.436,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Joanna works at a university in Poland.

3
0:00:18.002,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And one Saturday morning at 3am,

4
0:00:20.951,000 --> 0:00:22,000
she got up, packed her rucksack

5
0:00:23.295,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and traveled more than a thousand kilometers,

6
0:00:26.068,000 --> 0:00:28,000
only to have a political argument

7
0:00:28.524,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with a stranger.

8
0:00:31.375,000 --> 0:00:34,000
His name is Christof, and he's a customer manager from Germany.

9
0:00:35.016,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And the two had never met before.

10
0:00:36.619,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They only knew that they were totally at odds over European politics,

11
0:00:41.357,000 --> 0:00:44,000
over migration, or the relationship to Russia or whatever.

12
0:00:45.289,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And they were arguing for almost one day.

13
0:00:49.227,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And after that, Joanna sent me a somewhat irritating email.

14
0:00:56.088,000 --> 0:01:,000
"That was really cool, and I enjoyed every single minute of it!"

15
0:01:00.296,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:01.708,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So these are Tom from the UK and Nils from Germany.

17
0:01:06.691,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They also were strangers,

18
0:01:08.362,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and they are both supporters of their local football team,

19
0:01:11.381,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as you may imagine, Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham Hotspurs.

20
0:01:16.551,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And so they met on the very spot where football roots were invented,

21
0:01:19.767,000 --> 0:01:21,000
on some field in Cambridge.

22
0:01:22.108,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And they didn't argue about football,

23
0:01:24.186,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but about Brexit.

24
0:01:26.781,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And after talking for many hours about this contentious topic,

25
0:01:31.41,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they also sent a rather unexpected email.

26
0:01:35.423,000 --> 0:01:39,000
"It was delightful, and we both enjoyed it very much."

27
0:01:39.904,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:41.163,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So in spring 2019,

29
0:01:46.879,000 --> 0:01:51,000
more than 17,000 Europeans from 33 countries

30
0:01:52.257,000 --> 0:01:54,000
signed up to have a political argument.

31
0:01:55.792,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Thousands crossed their borders to meet a stranger with a different opinion,

32
0:02:00.418,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they were all part of a project called "Europe Talks."

33
0:02:05.778,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, talking about politics amongst people with different opinions

34
0:02:09.912,000 --> 0:02:11,000
has become really difficult,

35
0:02:12.728,000 --> 0:02:13,000
not only in Europe.

36
0:02:14.171,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Families are splitting, friends no longer talk to each other.

37
0:02:17.754,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We stay in our bubbles.

38
0:02:19.742,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And these so-called filter bubbles are amplified by social media,

39
0:02:24.571,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but they are not, in the core, a digital product.

40
0:02:28.242,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The filter bubble has always been there.

41
0:02:30.641,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's in our minds.

42
0:02:32.963,000 --> 0:02:35,000
As many studies repeatedly have shown,

43
0:02:36.401,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we, for example, ignore effects that contradict our convictions.

44
0:02:42.696,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So correcting fake news is definitely necessary,

45
0:02:46.387,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but it's not sufficient to get a divided society

46
0:02:50.28,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to rethink itself.

47
0:02:52.73,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Fortunately, according to at least some research,

48
0:02:56.035,000 --> 0:02:59,000
there may be a simple way to get a new perspective:

49
0:02:59.79,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a personal one-on-one discussion

50
0:03:02.906,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with someone who doesn't have your opinion.

51
0:03:06.891,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It enables you to see the world in a new way,

52
0:03:10.371,000 --> 0:03:12,000
through someone else's eyes.

53
0:03:14.824,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, I'm the editor of "ZEIT ONLINE,"

54
0:03:18.147,000 --> 0:03:22,000
one of the major digital news organizations in Germany.

55
0:03:22.214,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And we started what became "Europe Talks" as a really modest editorial exercise.

56
0:03:28.392,000 --> 0:03:29,000
As many journalists,

57
0:03:29.927,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we were impressed by Trump and by Brexit,

58
0:03:33.642,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and Germany was getting divided, too, especially over the issue of migration.

59
0:03:38.278,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So the arrival of more than a million refugees in 2015 and 2016

60
0:03:43.521,000 --> 0:03:45,000
dominated somewhat the debate.

61
0:03:46.119,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And when we were thinking about our own upcoming election in 2017,

62
0:03:51.043,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we definitely knew that we had to reinvent the way we were dealing with politics.

63
0:03:56.92,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So digital nerds that we are,

64
0:03:59.86,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we came up with obviously many very strange digital product ideas,

65
0:04:06.466,000 --> 0:04:09,000
one of them being a Tinder for politics --

66
0:04:09.656,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

67
0:04:11.951,000 --> 0:04:15,000
a dating platform for political opposites,

68
0:04:16.743,000 --> 0:04:19,000
a tool that could help get people together with different opinions.

69
0:04:20.913,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And we decided to test it

70
0:04:23.117,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and launched what techies would call a "minimum viable product."

71
0:04:27.905,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So it was really simple.

72
0:04:29.969,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We called it "Deutschland spricht" -- "Germany Talks" --

73
0:04:33.943,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and we started with that in May 2017.

74
0:04:39.93,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And it was really simple.

75
0:04:42.539,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We used mainly Google Forms,

76
0:04:45.103,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a tool that each and every one of us here can use to make surveys online.

77
0:04:51.032,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And everywhere in our content, we embedded simple questions like this:

78
0:04:56.166,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"Did Germany take in too many refugees?"

79
0:05:00.158,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You click yes or no.

80
0:05:02.475,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We asked you more questions, like, "Does the West treat Russia fairly?"

81
0:05:07.174,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or, "Should gay couples be allowed to marry?"

82
0:05:10.061,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And if you answered all these questions, we asked one more question:

83
0:05:13.325,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Hey, would you like to meet a neighbor who totally disagrees with you?"

84
0:05:17.852,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

85
0:05:20.574,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So this was a really simple experiment with no budget whatsoever.

86
0:05:25.606,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We expected some hundred-ish people to register,

87
0:05:30.158,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and we planned to match them by hand, the pairs.

88
0:05:34.34,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And after one day, 1,000 people had registered.

89
0:05:39.666,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And after some weeks, 12,000 Germans had signed up

90
0:05:44.671,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to meet someone else with a different opinion.

91
0:05:47.189,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So we had a problem.

92
0:05:48.684,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:50.838,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We hacked a quick and dirty algorithm

94
0:05:53.721,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that would find the perfect Tinder matches,

95
0:05:56.834,000 --> 0:06:,000
like people living as close as possible having answered the questions

96
0:06:01.34,000 --> 0:06:02,000
as differently as possible.

97
0:06:04.312,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We introduced them via email.

98
0:06:07.767,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And, as you may imagine, we had many concerns.

99
0:06:12.359,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Maybe no one would show up in real life.

100
0:06:16.638,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Maybe all the discussions in real life would be awful.

101
0:06:21.575,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Or maybe we had an axe murderer in our database.

102
0:06:24.536,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

103
0:06:26.969,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But then, on a Sunday in June 2017,

104
0:06:31.663,000 --> 0:06:32,000
something beautiful happened.

105
0:06:34.626,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Thousands of Germans met in pairs and talked about politics peacefully.

106
0:06:40.823,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Like Anno.

107
0:06:42.038,000 --> 0:06:46,000
He's a former policeman who's against -- or was against -- gay marriage,

108
0:06:46.873,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and Anne, she's an engineer who lives in a domestic partnership

109
0:06:50.66,000 --> 0:06:51,000
with another woman.

110
0:06:52.641,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And they were talking for hours about all the topics

111
0:06:55.154,000 --> 0:06:57,000
where they had different opinions.

112
0:06:57.86,000 --> 0:06:59,000
At one point, Anno told us later,

113
0:07:00.389,000 --> 0:07:06,000
he realized that Anne was hurt by his statements about gay marriage,

114
0:07:06.711,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and he started to question his own assumptions.

115
0:07:09.783,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And after talking for three hours,

116
0:07:12.091,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Anne invited Anno to her summer party,

117
0:07:15.53,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and today, years later,

118
0:07:17.748,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they still meet from time to time and are friends.

119
0:07:21.096,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So our algorithm matched, for example, this court bailiff.

120
0:07:25.416,000 --> 0:07:31,000
He's also a spokesperson of the right-wing populist party AfD in Germany,

121
0:07:31.526,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and this counselor for pregnant women.

122
0:07:33.416,000 --> 0:07:35,000
She used to be an active member of the Green Party.

123
0:07:36.791,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We even matched this professor and his student.

124
0:07:41.802,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

125
0:07:45.435,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's an algorithm.

126
0:07:47.504,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

127
0:07:48.668,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We also matched a father-in-law and his very own daughter-in-law,

128
0:07:55.028,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because, obviously, they live close by but have really different opinions.

129
0:07:59.815,000 --> 0:08:,000
So as a general rule,

130
0:08:01.408,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we did not observe, record, document the discussions,

131
0:08:05.821,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because we didn't want people to perform in any way.

132
0:08:09.165,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But I made an exception.

133
0:08:11.313,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I took part myself.

134
0:08:12.98,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And so I met in my trendy Berlin neighborhood called Prenzlauer Berg,

135
0:08:18.19,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I met Mirko.

136
0:08:20.282,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is me talking to Mirko. Mirko didn't want to be in the picture.

137
0:08:24.042,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He's a young plant operator,

138
0:08:26.261,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and he looked like all the hipsters in our area,

139
0:08:28.738,000 --> 0:08:3,000
like with a beard and a beanie.

140
0:08:30.944,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We were talking for hours, and I found him to be a wonderful person.

141
0:08:36.422,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And despite the fact that we had really different opinions

142
0:08:39.234,000 --> 0:08:41,000
about most of the topics --

143
0:08:41.594,000 --> 0:08:43,000
maybe with the exception of women's rights,

144
0:08:43.859,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where I couldn't comprehend his thoughts --

145
0:08:47.174,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it was really nice.

146
0:08:48.959,000 --> 0:08:5,000
After our discussion, I Googled Mirko.

147
0:08:52.682,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And I found out that in his teenage years, he used to be a neo-Nazi.

148
0:08:59.349,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So I called him and asked,

149
0:09:01.373,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"Hey, why didn't you tell me?"

150
0:09:03.107,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And he said, "You know, I didn't tell you because I want to get over it.

151
0:09:07.467,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I just don't want to talk about it anymore."

152
0:09:13.005,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I thought that people with a history like that could never change,

153
0:09:20.01,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and I had to rethink my assumptions,

154
0:09:23.29,000 --> 0:09:27,000
as did many of the participants who sent us thousands of emails

155
0:09:27.76,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and also selfies.

156
0:09:32.535,000 --> 0:09:34,000
No violence was recorded whatsoever.

157
0:09:34.901,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

158
0:09:35.958,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And we just don't know if some of the pairs got married.

159
0:09:39.727,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

160
0:09:41.166,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But, at least, we were really excited and wanted to do it again,

161
0:09:46.102,000 --> 0:09:48,000
especially in version 2.0,

162
0:09:48.655,000 --> 0:09:51,000
wanted to expand the diversity of the participants,

163
0:09:52.404,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because obviously in the first round, they were mainly our readers.

164
0:09:57.118,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And so we embraced our competition

165
0:09:59.378,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and asked other media outlets to join.

166
0:10:03.681,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We coordinated via Slack.

167
0:10:06.556,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And this live collaboration among 11 major German media houses

168
0:10:11.634,000 --> 0:10:13,000
was definitely a first in Germany.

169
0:10:13.833,000 --> 0:10:18,000
The numbers more than doubled: 28,000 people applied this time.

170
0:10:19.611,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And the German president --

171
0:10:21.015,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you see him here in the center of the picture --

172
0:10:23.363,000 --> 0:10:24,000
became our patron.

173
0:10:24.958,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And so, thousands of Germans met again in the summer of 2018

174
0:10:31.352,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to talk to someone else with a different opinion.

175
0:10:33.687,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Some of the pairs we invited to Berlin to a special event.

176
0:10:37.399,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And there, this picture was taken,

177
0:10:39.384,000 --> 0:10:43,000
until today my favorite symbol for "Germany Talks."

178
0:10:43.593,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You see Henrik, a bus driver and boxing trainer,

179
0:10:47.124,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and Engelbert, the director of a children's help center.

180
0:10:51.261,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They answered all of the seven questions we asked differently.

181
0:10:55.704,000 --> 0:10:57,000
They had never met before this day,

182
0:10:58.438,000 --> 0:11:,000
and they had a really intensive discussion

183
0:11:00.634,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and seemed to get along anyway

184
0:11:04.013,000 --> 0:11:05,000
with each other.

185
0:11:05.877,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So this time we also wanted to know

186
0:11:07.86,000 --> 0:11:12,000
if the discussion would have any impact on the participants.

187
0:11:13.428,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So we asked researchers to survey the participants.

188
0:11:17.41,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And two-thirds of the participants said that they learned something

189
0:11:21.746,000 --> 0:11:23,000
about their partner's attitudes.

190
0:11:23.922,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Sixty percent agreed that their viewpoints converged.

191
0:11:28.503,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The level of trust in society seemed also higher after the event,

192
0:11:32.73,000 --> 0:11:33,000
according to the researchers.

193
0:11:34.356,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Ninety percent said that they enjoyed their discussion.

194
0:11:37.945,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Ten percent said they didn't enjoy their discussion,

195
0:11:40.925,000 --> 0:11:44,000
eight percent only because, simply, their partner didn't show up.

196
0:11:44.97,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Laughter)

197
0:11:46.708,000 --> 0:11:5,000
After "Germany Talks," we got approached by many international media outlets,

198
0:11:51.656,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and we decided this time to build a serious and secure platform.

199
0:11:57.411,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We called it "My Country Talks."

200
0:11:59.813,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And in this short period of time, "My Country Talks" has already been used

201
0:12:05.002,000 --> 0:12:07,000
for more than a dozen local and national events

202
0:12:07.897,000 --> 0:12:12,000
like "Het grote gelijk" in Belgium or "Suomi puhuu" in Finland

203
0:12:13.039,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or "Britain Talks" in the UK.

204
0:12:15.79,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And as I mentioned at the beginning, we also launched "Europe Talks,"

205
0:12:20.79,000 --> 0:12:22,000
together with 15 international media partners,

206
0:12:23.088,000 --> 0:12:29,000
from the "Financial Times" in the UK to "Helsingin Sanomat" in Finland.

207
0:12:29.384,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Thousands of Europeans met with a total stranger

208
0:12:32.301,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to argue about politics.

209
0:12:34.688,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So far, we have been approached by more than 150 global media outlets,

210
0:12:40.192,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and maybe someday there will be something like "The World Talks,"

211
0:12:43.327,000 --> 0:12:45,000
with hundreds of thousands of participants.

212
0:12:45.919,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But what matters here are not the numbers,

213
0:12:51.07,000 --> 0:12:52,000
obviously.

214
0:12:53.727,000 --> 0:12:54,000
What matters here is ...

215
0:12:55.764,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Whenever two people meet to talk in person for hours

216
0:12:59.838,000 --> 0:13:02,000
without anyone else listening,

217
0:13:03.057,000 --> 0:13:04,000
they change.

218
0:13:04.706,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And so do our societies.

219
0:13:06.309,000 --> 0:13:09,000
They change little by little, discussion by discussion.

220
0:13:10.097,000 --> 0:13:12,000
What matters here is that we relearn

221
0:13:13.113,000 --> 0:13:16,000
how to have these face-to-face discussions,

222
0:13:16.229,000 --> 0:13:18,000
without anyone else listening,

223
0:13:18.457,000 --> 0:13:19,000
with a stranger.

224
0:13:19.751,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Not only with a stranger we are introduced to

225
0:13:22.422,000 --> 0:13:24,000
by a Tinder for politics,

226
0:13:24.708,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but also with a stranger in a pub or in a gym or at a conference.

227
0:13:30.259,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So please meet someone

228
0:13:32.295,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and have an argument

229
0:13:33.829,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and enjoy it very much.

230
0:13:35.741,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Thank you.

231
0:13:37.037,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Applause)

232
0:13:40.88,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Wow!

233
0:13:42.056,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

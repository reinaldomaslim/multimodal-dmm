1
0:00:13.722,000 --> 0:00:15,000
For all that's ever been said about climate change,

2
0:00:16.556,000 --> 0:00:19,000
we haven't heard nearly enough about the psychological impacts

3
0:00:20.46,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of living in a warming world.

4
0:00:22.608,000 --> 0:00:23,000
If you've heard the grim climate research

5
0:00:24.593,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that science communicators like me weave into our books and documentaries,

6
0:00:28.101,000 --> 0:00:31,000
you've probably felt bouts of fear, fatalism or hopelessness.

7
0:00:32.617,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If you've been impacted by climate disaster,

8
0:00:34.696,000 --> 0:00:36,000
these feelings can set in much deeper,

9
0:00:36.998,000 --> 0:00:38,000
leading to shock, trauma,

10
0:00:39.418,000 --> 0:00:4,000
strained relationships, substance abuse

11
0:00:41.323,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the loss of personal identity and control.

12
0:00:44.314,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Vital political and technological work is underway to moderate our climate chaos,

13
0:00:48.57,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but I'm here to evoke a feeling in you

14
0:00:51.238,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for why we also need our actions and policies

15
0:00:54.381,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to reflect an understanding of how our changing environments

16
0:00:57.287,000 --> 0:01:,000
threaten our mental, social and spiritual well-being.

17
0:01:00.97,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The anxiety, grief and depression of climate scientists and activists

18
0:01:04.637,000 --> 0:01:06,000
have been reported on for years.

19
0:01:06.677,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Trends we've seen after extreme weather events

20
0:01:08.851,000 --> 0:01:09,000
like hurricane Sandy or Katrina

21
0:01:10.605,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for increased PTSD and suicidality.

22
0:01:13.8,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And there are rich mental-health data from northern communities

23
0:01:16.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
where warming is the fastest,

24
0:01:18.268,000 --> 0:01:2,000
like the Inuit in Labrador,

25
0:01:20.355,000 --> 0:01:22,000
who face existential distress as they witness the ice,

26
0:01:23.252,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a big part of their identity,

27
0:01:24.863,000 --> 0:01:25,000
vanishing before their eyes.

28
0:01:27.22,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now if that weren't enough,

29
0:01:28.609,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the American Psychological Association

30
0:01:30.483,000 --> 0:01:32,000
says that our psychological responses to climate change,

31
0:01:33.379,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like conflict avoidance, helplessness and resignation, are growing.

32
0:01:38.101,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This means that our conscious and unconscious mental processes

33
0:01:41.046,000 --> 0:01:42,000
are holding us back

34
0:01:42.236,000 --> 0:01:44,000
from identifying the causes of the problem for what they are,

35
0:01:45.141,000 --> 0:01:48,000
working on solutions and fostering our own psychological resilience,

36
0:01:48.363,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but we need all those things to take on what we've created.

37
0:01:52.878,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Lately, I've been studying a phenomenon

38
0:01:54.968,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that's just one example of the emotional hardships

39
0:01:57.507,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that we're seeing.

40
0:01:58.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And it comes in the form of a question

41
0:02:00.656,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that a significant amount of people in my generation are struggling to answer.

42
0:02:04.89,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That being:

43
0:02:06.097,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Should I have a child in the age of climate change?

44
0:02:09.613,000 --> 0:02:1,000
After all, any child born today

45
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
will have to live in a world where hurricanes, flooding, wildfires --

46
0:02:14.454,000 --> 0:02:15,000
what we used to call natural disasters --

47
0:02:16.448,000 --> 0:02:17,000
have become commonplace.

48
0:02:18.688,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The hottest 20 years on record occurred within the last 22.

49
0:02:23.172,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The UN expects that two-thirds of the global population

50
0:02:25.998,000 --> 0:02:27,000
may face water shortages only six years from now.

51
0:02:29.844,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The World Bank predicts that by 2050,

52
0:02:31.701,000 --> 0:02:33,000
there's going to be 140 million climate refugees

53
0:02:34.653,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South Asia.

54
0:02:37.617,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And other estimates put that number at over one billion.

55
0:02:41.284,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Mass migrations and resource scarcity

56
0:02:43.498,000 --> 0:02:46,000
increase the risk for violence, war and political instability.

57
0:02:48.146,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The UN just reported that we are pushing up to a million species to extinction,

58
0:02:52.812,000 --> 0:02:53,000
many within decades,

59
0:02:54.011,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and our emissions are still increasing, even after the Paris Agreement.

60
0:02:59.373,000 --> 0:03:,000
Over the last year and a half,

61
0:03:00.865,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I've been conducting workshops and interviews

62
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
with hundreds of people

63
0:03:04.222,000 --> 0:03:06,000
about parenting in the climate crisis.

64
0:03:06.58,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I can tell you

65
0:03:07.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that people who are worried about having kids because of climate change

66
0:03:11.141,000 --> 0:03:12,000
are not motivated by an ascetic pride.

67
0:03:13.117,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They're nerve-racked.

68
0:03:14.673,000 --> 0:03:16,000
There's even a movement called BirthStrike,

69
0:03:16.759,000 --> 0:03:18,000
whose members have declared they're not going to have kids

70
0:03:19.515,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because of the state of the ecological crisis

71
0:03:21.728,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and inaction from governments to address this existential threat.

72
0:03:24.879,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And yes, other generations have also faced their own apocalyptic dangers,

73
0:03:28.37,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but that is no reason to disregard the very real threat to our survival now.

74
0:03:32.489,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Some feel that it's better to adopt children.

75
0:03:35.323,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Or that it's unethical to have more than one,

76
0:03:37.458,000 --> 0:03:38,000
especially three, four or more,

77
0:03:39.22,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because kids increase greenhouse gas emissions.

78
0:03:42.625,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, it is a really unfortunate state of affairs

79
0:03:45.837,000 --> 0:03:47,000
when people who want kids sacrifice their right to

80
0:03:48.252,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because, somehow, they have been told that their lifestyle choices are to blame

81
0:03:52.349,000 --> 0:03:53,000
when the fault is far more systemic,

82
0:03:54.119,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but let's just unpack the logic here.

83
0:03:57.048,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So an oft-cited study shows that, on average,

84
0:03:59.385,000 --> 0:04:01,000
having one less child in an industrialized nation

85
0:04:02.109,000 --> 0:04:05,000
can save about 59 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

86
0:04:06.617,000 --> 0:04:07,000
While in comparison,

87
0:04:08.061,000 --> 0:04:1,000
living car-free saves nearly 2.5 tons,

88
0:04:11.028,000 --> 0:04:14,000
avoiding a transatlantic flight -- and this is just one --

89
0:04:14.108,000 --> 0:04:15,000
saves about 1.5 tons,

90
0:04:16.092,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and eating a plant-based diet can save almost one ton per year.

91
0:04:20.76,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And consider that a Bangladeshi child

92
0:04:23.18,000 --> 0:04:26,000
only adds 56 metric tons of carbon to their parents' carbon legacy

93
0:04:27.048,000 --> 0:04:28,000
over their lifetime,

94
0:04:28.524,000 --> 0:04:33,000
while an American child, in comparison, adds 9,441 to theirs.

95
0:04:34.428,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So this is why some people argue

96
0:04:35.984,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that it's parents from nations with huge carbon footprints

97
0:04:38.73,000 --> 0:04:4,000
who should think the hardest about how many kids they have.

98
0:04:41.901,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But the decision to have a child and one's feelings about the future

99
0:04:45.274,000 --> 0:04:46,000
are deeply personal,

100
0:04:46.734,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and wrapped up in all sorts of cultural norms,

101
0:04:48.98,000 --> 0:04:51,000
religious beliefs, socioeconomic status, education levels and more.

102
0:04:53.184,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And so to some, this debate about kids in the climate crisis

103
0:04:56.025,000 --> 0:04:58,000
can seem like it came from another planet.

104
0:04:58.58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Many have more immediate threats to their survival to think about,

105
0:05:01.787,000 --> 0:05:03,000
like, how they're going to put food on the table,

106
0:05:04.108,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when they're a single mom working three jobs,

107
0:05:06.229,000 --> 0:05:08,000
or they're HIV positive or on the move in a migrant caravan.

108
0:05:09.244,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Tragically, though, climate change is really great at intersectionality.

109
0:05:13.387,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It multiplies the stresses marginalized communities already face.

110
0:05:18.442,000 --> 0:05:2,000
A political scientist once said to me that a leading indicator

111
0:05:21.403,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that climate change is starting to hit home, psychologically,

112
0:05:24.537,000 --> 0:05:26,000
would be an increase in the rate of informed women

113
0:05:26.936,000 --> 0:05:27,000
deciding to not have children.

114
0:05:29.522,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Interesting.

115
0:05:31.236,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Is it hitting home with you, psychologically?

116
0:05:34.521,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Are you perhaps someone with climate-linked pre-traumatic stress?

117
0:05:38.737,000 --> 0:05:39,000
A climate psychiatrist coined that term,

118
0:05:40.713,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and that's a profession now, by the way, shrinks for climate woes.

119
0:05:44.126,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They're getting work at a time when some high schoolers

120
0:05:46.728,000 --> 0:05:48,000
don't want to apply to university any longer,

121
0:05:48.855,000 --> 0:05:5,000
because they can't foresee a future for themselves.

122
0:05:51.831,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And this brings me back to my main point.

123
0:05:54.91,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The growing concern about having kids in the climate crisis

124
0:05:57.785,000 --> 0:06:,000
is an urgent indicator of how hard-pressed people are feeling.

125
0:06:03.11,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Right now, students around the world are screaming for change

126
0:06:06.815,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in the piercing voice of despair.

127
0:06:09.645,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And the fact that we can see how we contribute to this problem

128
0:06:12.582,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that makes us feel unsafe

129
0:06:14.074,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is crazy-making in itself.

130
0:06:16.947,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Climate change is all-encompassing

131
0:06:18.903,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and so are the ways that it messes with our minds.

132
0:06:22.648,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Many activists will tell you

133
0:06:24.038,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that the best antidote to grief is activism.

134
0:06:26.75,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And some psychologists will tell you the answer can be found in therapy.

135
0:06:30.321,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Others believe the key is to imagine you're on your deathbed,

136
0:06:33.25,000 --> 0:06:35,000
reflecting back on what's mattered the most in your life,

137
0:06:35.964,000 --> 0:06:37,000
so you can identify what you should do more of now,

138
0:06:38.387,000 --> 0:06:39,000
with the time that you have left.

139
0:06:40.006,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We need all these ideas, and more,

140
0:06:41.887,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to take care of our innermost selves

141
0:06:43.657,000 --> 0:06:47,000
as the environments we've known become more punishing towards us.

142
0:06:47.807,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And whether you have children or not,

143
0:06:49.974,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we need to be honest about what is happening,

144
0:06:52.744,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and what we owe one another.

145
0:06:55.601,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We cannot afford to treat

146
0:06:56.871,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the psychological impacts of climate change

147
0:06:58.971,000 --> 0:06:59,000
as some afterthought,

148
0:07:00.156,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because the other issues, of science, technology and the politics and economy,

149
0:07:04.466,000 --> 0:07:07,000
feel hard, while this somehow feels soft.

150
0:07:08.807,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Mental health needs to be an integral part

151
0:07:11.205,000 --> 0:07:13,000
of any climate change survival strategy,

152
0:07:13.53,000 --> 0:07:16,000
requiring funding, and ethics of equity and care,

153
0:07:16.874,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and widespread awareness.

154
0:07:18.886,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Because even if you're the most emotionally avoidant person on the planet,

155
0:07:22.466,000 --> 0:07:25,000
there's no rug in the world that's big enough to sweep this up under.

156
0:07:25.731,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Thank you.

157
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

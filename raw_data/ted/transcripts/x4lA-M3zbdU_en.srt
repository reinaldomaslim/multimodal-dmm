1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Over the last 13 years --

2
0:00:17.33,000 --> 0:00:19,000
one, three, 13 years --

3
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel

4
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and partners around the world

5
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
for taking this idea, this concept,

6
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
noninvasive surgery,

7
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from the research lab to routine clinical use.

8
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And this is what I'll tell you about.

9
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
13 years --

10
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
for some of you, you can empathize with that number.

11
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
For me, today, on this date,

12
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it's like a second bar mitzvah experience.

13
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So this dream

15
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is really enabled

16
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
by the convergence

17
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of two known technologies.

18
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
One is the focused ultrasound,

19
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
and the other one is the

20
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.

21
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So let's first talk about focused ultrasound.

22
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I hold in my hand

23
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
a tissue-mimicking phantom.

24
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It is made out of silicon.

25
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It is transparent, made just for you.

26
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So you see, it's all intact,

27
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
completely transparent.

28
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I'll take you now to the acoustic lab.

29
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You see the phantom within the aquarium.

30
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This is a setup I put in a physics lab.

31
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
On the right-hand side,

32
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you see an ultrasonic transducer.

33
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So the ultrasonic transducer

34
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
emits basically an ultrasonic beam

35
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that focuses inside the phantom.

36
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Okay, when you hear the click,

37
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
this is when the energy starts to emit

38
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and you see a little lesion form

39
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
inside the phantom.

40
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Okay, so everything around it

41
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is whole and intact.

42
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's just a lesion formed inside.

43
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So think about, this is in your brain.

44
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We need to reach a target inside the brain.

45
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We can do it without harming any tissue.

46
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So this is, I think,

47
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.

48
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound,

50
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the force of ultrasound.

51
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.

52
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And you know also about lithotripsy --

53
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
breaking kidney stones.

54
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But ultrasound can be shaped

55
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to be anything in between,

56
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because it's a mechanical force.

57
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Basically, it's a force acting on a tissue

58
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that it transverses.

59
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So you can change the intensity, the frequency,

60
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasound

61
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to create anything

62
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from an airbrush to a hammer.

63
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I am going to show you

64
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
multiple applications in the medical field

65
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that can be enabled

66
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
just by focusing,

67
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
physically focusing.

68
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So this idea

69
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain

70
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is not new at all.

71
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
When I was born, this idea was already conceived

72
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
by pioneers such as the Fry brothers

73
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and Lars Leksell,

74
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
who is know actually

75
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as the inventor of the gammaknife.

76
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But you may not know

77
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,

78
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
noninvasively,

79
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
with focused ultrasound in the '50s.

80
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
He failed,

81
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so he then invented the gammaknife.

82
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it makes you ponder

83
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
why those pioneers failed.

84
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And there was something fundamental

85
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that they were missing.

86
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They were missing the vision.

87
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It wasn't until the invention of the MR

88
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and really the integration of MR

89
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with focused ultrasound

90
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that we could get the feedback --

91
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
both the anatomical and the physiological

92
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loop

93
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
surgical procedure.

94
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So this is how it looks, you know,

95
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the operating room of the future today.

96
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.

97
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I will give you several examples.

98
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So the first one is in the brain.

99
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
One of the neurological conditions

100
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that can be treated with focused ultrasound

101
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
are movement disorders,

102
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
like Parkinson's or essential tremor.

103
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
What is typical to those conditions,

104
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to essential tremor for example,

105
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is inability

106
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to drink or eat cereal or soup

107
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
without spilling everything all over you,

108
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or write legibly so people can understand it,

109
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and be really independent in your life

110
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
without the help of others.

111
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I'd like you to meet John.

112
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
John is a retired professor of history

113
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
from Virginia.

114
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years.

115
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And medication didn't help him anymore.

116
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery

117
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to have people cut into their brain.

118
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And about four or five months ago,

119
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
he underwent an experimental procedure.

120
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It is approved under an FDAIDE

121
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
at the University of Virginia

122
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in Charlottesville

123
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
using focused ultrasound

124
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to ablate a point in his thalamus.

125
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And this is his handwriting.

126
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
"On June 20th," if you can read it,

127
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"2011."

128
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is his handwriting

129
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
on the morning of the treatment

130
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
before going into the MR

131
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So now I'll take you through

132
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,

133
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
[what] noninvasive surgery looks like.

134
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So we put the patient on the MR table.

135
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,

136
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but if it will be a different organ,

137
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it will be a different transducer attached to the patient.

138
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the physician

139
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
will then take a regular MR scan.

140
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And the objective of that?

141
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I don't have a pointer here,

142
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?

143
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This is the sort of general area of the treatment.

144
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's a safety boundary

145
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
around the target.

146
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It's a target in the thalamus.

147
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So once those pictures are acquired

148
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the physician has drawn

149
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
all the necessary safety limits and so on,

150
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
he selects basically a point --

151
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is --

152
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and he presses this blue button called "sonicate."

153
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We call this instance of injecting the energy,

154
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we call it sonication.

155
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The only handwork the physician does here

156
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is moving a mouse.

157
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This is the only device he needs in this treatment.

158
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So he presses "sonicate," and this is what happens.

159
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
You see the transducer, the light blue.

160
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
There's water in between the skull and the transducer.

161
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And it does this burst of energy.

162
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It elevates the temperature.

163
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We first need to verify

164
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that we are on target.

165
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So the first sonication

166
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is at lower energy.

167
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It doesn't do any damage,

168
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but it elevates the temperature

169
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
by a few degrees.

170
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And one of the unique capabilities

171
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that we leverage with the MR

172
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.

173
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This is really a unique capability of the MR.

174
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It is not being used

175
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in regular diagnostic imaging.

176
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But here we can get

177
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.

178
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And you can see the points there on the graph.

179
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The temperature was raised

180
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to 43 degrees C temporarily.

181
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This doesn't cause any damage.

182
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But the point is we are right on target.

183
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So once the physician verifies

184
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,

185
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
then we move to perform

186
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
a full-energy ablation

187
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
like you see here.

188
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And you see the temperature rises

189
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to like 55 to 60 degrees C.

190
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
If you do it for more than a second,

191
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it's enough to basically destroy

192
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the proteins of the cells.

193
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is the outcome from a patient perspective --

194
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
same day after the treatment.

195
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is an immediate relief.

196
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Applause)

197
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Thank you.

198
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
John is one of [about] a dozen

199
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
very heroic, courageous people

200
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
who volunteered for the study.

201
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And you have to understand

202
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
what is in people's mind

203
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
when they are willing to take the risk.

204
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it.

205
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He said, "Miraculous."

206
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And his wife said, "This is the happiest moment of my life."

207
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And you wonder why.

208
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I mean, one of the messages I like to carry over

209
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is, what about defending quality of life?

210
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I mean, those people lose their independence.

211
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They are dependent on others.

212
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And John today is fully independent.

213
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
He returned to a normal life routine.

214
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And he also plays golf,

215
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
like you do in Virginia

216
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
when you are retired.

217
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Okay, so you can see here the spot.

218
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.

219
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
There's no damage outside.

220
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
He suffers from no neurodeficit.

221
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
There's no recovery needed, no nothing.

222
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
He's back to his normal life.

223
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Let's move now

224
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to a more painful subject.

225
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Pain is something

226
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that can make your life miserable.

227
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And people are suffering from all kinds of pain

228
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
like neuropathic pain, lower-back pain

229
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and cancer pain from bone metastases,

230
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
when the metastases get to your bones,

231
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
sometimes they are very painful.

232
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
All those I've indicated

233
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
have already been shown

234
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to be successfully treated

235
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
by focused ultrasound

236
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
relieving the pain, again, very fast.

237
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I would like to tell you

238
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
about PJ.

239
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
He's a 78 year-old farmer

240
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
who suffered from -- how should I say it? --

241
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
it's called pain in the butt.

242
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
He had metastases in his right buttock,

243
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and he couldn't sit

244
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
even with medication.

245
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
He had to forgo all the farm activities.

246
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
He was treated with radiation therapy,

247
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
state-of-the-art radiation therapy,

248
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but it didn't help.

249
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy.

250
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And again, he volunteered

251
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to a pivotal study

252
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that we ran worldwide,

253
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
also in the U.S.

254
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And his wife actually took him.

255
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They drove like three hours

256
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
from their farm to the hospital.

257
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
He had to sit on a cushion,

258
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
stand still, not move,

259
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because it was very painful.

260
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
He took the treatment,

261
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and on the way back,

262
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
he drove the truck by himself.

263
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So again, this is an immediate relief.

264
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And you have to understand

265
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
what those people feel

266
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and what their family experiences

267
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when it happens.

268
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
He returned again

269
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to his daily routine on the farm.

270
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
He rides his tractor.

271
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.

272
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And he has been very happy.

273
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But now, you ask me,

274
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but what about war, the war on cancer?

275
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Show us some primary cancer.

276
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
What can be done there?

277
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So I have good news and bad news.

278
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
The good news: there's a lot that can be done.

279
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.

280
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And doing that in the U.S.

281
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is very painful.

282
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I don't see, without this nation

283
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
taking it as some collective will

284
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
or something that is a national goal to make that happen,

285
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
it will not happen.

286
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And it's not just because of regulation;

287
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it's because of the amount of money needed

288
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
under the current evidence-based medicine

289
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and the size of trials and so on

290
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to make it happen.

291
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So the first two applications

292
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
are breast cancer and prostate cancer.

293
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.

294
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.

295
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
But I have a message for the men here.

296
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We heard here yesterday Quyen

297
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
talking about the adverse event trait

298
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in prostate cancer.

299
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
There is a unique opportunity now

300
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
with focused ultrasound guided by MR,

301
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because we can actually think about

302
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
prostate lumpectomy --

303
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
treating just the focal lesion

304
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and not removing the whole gland,

305
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and by that, avoiding all the issues

306
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
with potency and incontinence.

307
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Well, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen --

308
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
quite lethal, very lethal actually --

309
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
pancreas, liver, kidney.

310
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The challenge there

311
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
with a breathing and awake patient --

312
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and in all our treatments,

313
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
the patient is awake and conscious

314
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and speaks with the physician --

315
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is you have to teach the MR some tricks

316
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
how to do it in real time.

317
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And this will take time.

318
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
This will take two years.

319
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But I have now a message to the ladies.

320
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And this is, in 2004,

321
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds

322
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.

323
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Women suffer from that disease.

324
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
All those tumors

325
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
have heavy bleeding during periods,

326
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
abdominal pressure, back pain,

327
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
frequent urination.

328
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnant

329
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
because of the fibroid.

330
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
This is Frances.

331
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.

332
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
This is a big fibroid.

333
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
She was offered a hysterectomy,

334
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but this is an inconceivable proposition

335
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.

336
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure

337
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in 2008.

338
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.

339
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So new life was born.

340
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Applause)

341
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So in conclusion,

342
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I'd like to leave you with actually four messages.

343
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
One is, think about the amount

344
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
of suffering that is saved

345
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,

346
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and also the economical and emotional burden

347
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
removed from their families and communities

348
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and the society at large --

349
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and I think also from their physicians, by the way.

350
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And the other thing I would like you to think about

351
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is the new type of relationship

352
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
between physician and patients

353
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
when you have a patient on the table

354
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.

355
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
In all our treatments,

356
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
the patient holds a stop sonication button.

357
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
He can stop the surgery at any moment.

358
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And with that note,

359
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I would like to thank you for listening.

360
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

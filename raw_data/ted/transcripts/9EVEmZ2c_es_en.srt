0:00:12.976,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"Even in purely nonreligious terms,

3
0:00:17.23,000 --> 0:00:22,000
homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.

4
0:00:22.97,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality --

5
0:00:27.715,000 --> 0:00:28,000
a pitiable flight from life.

6
0:00:30.167,000 --> 0:00:33,000
As such, it deserves no compassion,

7
0:00:33.937,000 --> 0:00:38,000
it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom,

8
0:00:39.143,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness."

9
0:00:45.687,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That's from "Time" magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.

10
0:00:51.215,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And last year, the president of the United States

11
0:00:54.743,000 --> 0:00:56,000
came out in favor of gay marriage.

12
0:00:57.992,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Applause)

13
0:01:05.488,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And my question is:

14
0:01:07.069,000 --> 0:01:1,000
How did we get from there to here?

15
0:01:10.649,000 --> 0:01:14,000
How did an illness become an identity?

16
0:01:15.497,000 --> 0:01:18,000
When I was perhaps six years old,

17
0:01:18.588,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.

18
0:01:21.152,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And at the end of buying our shoes,

19
0:01:23.747,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.

20
0:01:27.611,000 --> 0:01:29,000
My brother wanted a red balloon,

21
0:01:29.751,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I wanted a pink balloon.

22
0:01:33.092,000 --> 0:01:37,000
My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.

23
0:01:37.718,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:38.773,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.

25
0:01:41.135,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.

26
0:01:46.752,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay --

27
0:01:51.143,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:54.396,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is evidence of both my mother's influence

29
0:01:57.271,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and its limits.

30
0:01:58.449,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

31
0:02:00.69,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Applause)

32
0:02:07.704,000 --> 0:02:09,000
When I was little, my mother used to say,

33
0:02:10.398,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.

34
0:02:15.009,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And until you have children, you don't know what it's like."

35
0:02:18.209,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world

36
0:02:21.683,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that she would say that about parenting my brother and me.

37
0:02:24.469,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And when I was an adolescent, I thought, "But I'm gay,

38
0:02:27.811,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and so I probably can't have a family."

39
0:02:30.167,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And when she said it, it made me anxious.

40
0:02:32.556,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And after I came out of the closet,

41
0:02:34.277,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when she continued to say it, it made me furious.

42
0:02:37.204,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I said, "I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in.

43
0:02:41.522,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I want you to stop saying that."

44
0:02:47.4,000 --> 0:02:48,000
About 20 years ago,

45
0:02:49.123,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I was asked by my editors at the "New York Times Magazine"

46
0:02:52.198,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to write a piece about Deaf culture.

47
0:02:54.918,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I was rather taken aback.

48
0:02:56.348,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness:

49
0:02:58.676,000 --> 0:02:59,000
those poor people, they couldn't hear,

50
0:03:00.66,000 --> 0:03:02,000
they lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?

51
0:03:03.304,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And then I went out into the Deaf world.

52
0:03:05.822,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I went to Deaf clubs.

53
0:03:07.727,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I saw performances of Deaf theater and of Deaf poetry.

54
0:03:12.129,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee,

55
0:03:17.859,000 --> 0:03:2,000
where people complained about that slurry Southern signing.

56
0:03:22.031,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:26.035,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the Deaf world,

58
0:03:30.172,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I became convinced that Deafness was a culture

59
0:03:33.17,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and that the people in the Deaf world who said,

60
0:03:35.416,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"We don't lack hearing; we have membership in a culture,"

61
0:03:38.911,000 --> 0:03:4,000
were saying something that was viable.

62
0:03:41.197,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It wasn't my culture,

63
0:03:42.649,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it,

64
0:03:45.602,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but I appreciated that it was a culture

65
0:03:48.136,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and that for the people who were members of it,

66
0:03:50.527,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.

67
0:03:56.881,000 --> 0:04:,000
It felt as valid, perhaps, even as American culture.

68
0:04:01.898,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.

69
0:04:05.214,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And when her daughter was born,

70
0:04:06.737,000 --> 0:04:08,000
she suddenly found herself confronting questions

71
0:04:09.11,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that now began to seem quite resonant to me.

72
0:04:11.767,000 --> 0:04:14,000
She was facing the question of what to do with this child.

73
0:04:15.377,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Should she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"

74
0:04:19.155,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,

75
0:04:22.396,000 --> 0:04:24,000
get involved in the Little People of America,

76
0:04:24.791,000 --> 0:04:26,000
become aware of what was happening for dwarfs?

77
0:04:27.704,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I suddenly thought,

78
0:04:29.211,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"Most deaf children are born to hearing parents.

79
0:04:31.74,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them.

80
0:04:34.213,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.

81
0:04:38.366,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Most gay people are born to straight parents.

82
0:04:40.526,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Those straight parents often want them to function

83
0:04:43.121,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in what they think of as the mainstream world,

84
0:04:45.373,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and those gay people have to discover identity later on.

85
0:04:48.848,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And here was this friend of mine,

86
0:04:50.51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.

87
0:04:54.054,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I thought, "There it is again:

88
0:04:55.792,000 --> 0:04:57,000
a family that perceives itself to be normal

89
0:04:58.311,000 --> 0:05:,000
with a child who seems to be extraordinary."

90
0:05:00.956,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.

91
0:05:05.518,000 --> 0:05:06,000
There are vertical identities,

92
0:05:07.011,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which are passed down generationally from parent to child.

93
0:05:10.206,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Those are things like ethnicity,

94
0:05:12.354,000 --> 0:05:15,000
frequently nationality, language, often religion.

95
0:05:15.703,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.

96
0:05:20.207,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And while some of them can be difficult,

97
0:05:22.659,000 --> 0:05:23,000
there's no attempt to cure them.

98
0:05:24.627,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You can argue that it's harder in the United States --

99
0:05:27.883,000 --> 0:05:29,000
our current presidency notwithstanding --

100
0:05:30.026,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to be a person of color.

101
0:05:31.69,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure

102
0:05:34.43,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians

103
0:05:38.5,000 --> 0:05:4,000
come out with creamy skin and yellow hair.

104
0:05:42.027,000 --> 0:05:46,000
There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group,

105
0:05:46.141,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I call them "horizontal identities,"

106
0:05:48.241,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because the peer group is the horizontal experience.

107
0:05:51.37,000 --> 0:05:53,000
These are identities that are alien to your parents

108
0:05:53.971,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.

109
0:05:58.189,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And those identities, those horizontal identities,

110
0:06:01.274,000 --> 0:06:04,000
people have almost always tried to cure.

111
0:06:05.031,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And I wanted to look at what the process is

112
0:06:07.39,000 --> 0:06:09,000
through which people who have those identities

113
0:06:09.969,000 --> 0:06:11,000
come to a good relationship with them.

114
0:06:12.462,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance

115
0:06:16.633,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that needed to take place.

116
0:06:18.295,000 --> 0:06:23,000
There's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.

117
0:06:23.67,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And they don't always coincide.

118
0:06:25.916,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry,

119
0:06:29.754,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because they feel as though their parents don't love them,

120
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.

121
0:06:37.012,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Love is something that, ideally, is there unconditionally

122
0:06:40.21,000 --> 0:06:43,000
throughout the relationship between a parent and a child.

123
0:06:43.503,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But acceptance is something that takes time.

124
0:06:46.661,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It always takes time.

125
0:06:49.199,000 --> 0:06:53,000
One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.

126
0:06:53.859,000 --> 0:06:56,000
When he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,

127
0:06:57.117,000 --> 0:06:58,000
a very disabling condition,

128
0:06:58.791,000 --> 0:07:,000
and his parents were told that he would never walk,

129
0:07:01.212,000 --> 0:07:02,000
he would never talk,

130
0:07:02.41,000 --> 0:07:04,000
he would have no intellectual capacity,

131
0:07:04.457,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and he would probably not even recognize them.

132
0:07:06.921,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital

133
0:07:10.475,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so that he could die there quietly.

134
0:07:12.539,000 --> 0:07:14,000
His mother said she wasn't going to do it,

135
0:07:14.723,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and she took her son home.

136
0:07:16.454,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,

137
0:07:20.255,000 --> 0:07:24,000
she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,

138
0:07:24.303,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and she got Clinton enrolled with him.

139
0:07:26.469,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And in the course of his childhood,

140
0:07:28.663,000 --> 0:07:3,000
he had 30 major surgical procedures.

141
0:07:31.495,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital

142
0:07:33.785,000 --> 0:07:34,000
while he was having those procedures,

143
0:07:35.602,000 --> 0:07:37,000
as a result of which, he now can walk.

144
0:07:37.705,000 --> 0:07:41,000
While he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his schoolwork,

145
0:07:42.189,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and he worked very hard, because there was nothing else to do.

146
0:07:45.19,000 --> 0:07:46,000
He ended up achieving at a level

147
0:07:46.765,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.

148
0:07:50.557,000 --> 0:07:53,000
He was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,

149
0:07:53.677,000 --> 0:07:56,000
where he lived on campus and drove a specially fitted car

150
0:07:56.841,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that accommodated his unusual body.

151
0:07:59.812,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And his mother told me the story of coming home one day --

152
0:08:02.941,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and he went to college nearby --

153
0:08:04.636,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize,

154
0:08:07.652,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in the parking lot of a bar," she said.

155
0:08:10.803,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

156
0:08:12.2,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"And I thought to myself,

157
0:08:13.962,000 --> 0:08:15,000
'They're six feet tall, he's three feet tall.

158
0:08:16.623,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Two beers for them is four beers for him.'"

159
0:08:19.056,000 --> 0:08:21,000
She said, "I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him,

160
0:08:21.89,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."

161
0:08:25.933,000 --> 0:08:26,000
She said, "And then I thought,

162
0:08:27.412,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if someone had said to me, when he was born,

163
0:08:29.534,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving

164
0:08:33.264,000 --> 0:08:34,000
with his college buddies ..."

165
0:08:34.781,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:36.376,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Applause)

167
0:08:43.861,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And I said to her,

168
0:08:45.05,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"What do you think you did that helped him to emerge

169
0:08:47.546,000 --> 0:08:49,000
as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"

170
0:08:50.419,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And she said, "What did I do?

171
0:08:53.088,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I loved him, that's all.

172
0:08:55.17,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Clinton just always had that light in him.

173
0:08:58.588,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."

174
0:09:04.887,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.

175
0:09:07.434,000 --> 0:09:09,000
This one is from 1968 --

176
0:09:10.094,000 --> 0:09:13,000
"The Atlantic Monthly," voice of liberal America --

177
0:09:13.525,000 --> 0:09:15,000
written by an important bioethicist.

178
0:09:15.939,000 --> 0:09:18,000
He said, "There is no reason to feel guilty

179
0:09:19.86,000 --> 0:09:22,000
about putting a Down's syndrome child away,

180
0:09:23.439,000 --> 0:09:27,000
whether it is 'put away' in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium

181
0:09:28.428,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or in a more responsible, lethal sense.

182
0:09:32.189,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It is sad, yes. Dreadful.

183
0:09:35.193,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But it carries no guilt.

184
0:09:37.082,000 --> 0:09:41,000
True guilt arises only from an offense against a person,

185
0:09:41.237,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and a Down's is not a person."

186
0:09:45.838,000 --> 0:09:48,000
There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made

187
0:09:49.641,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in the treatment of gay people.

188
0:09:51.689,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.

189
0:09:55.942,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,

190
0:10:00.342,000 --> 0:10:02,000
how we used to see people who were disabled,

191
0:10:02.665,000 --> 0:10:04,000
how inhuman we held people to be.

192
0:10:05.546,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And the change that's been accomplished there,

193
0:10:07.777,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which is almost equally radical,

194
0:10:09.361,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is one that we pay not very much attention to.

195
0:10:12.406,000 --> 0:10:15,000
One of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,

196
0:10:16.128,000 --> 0:10:19,000
were taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,

197
0:10:19.684,000 --> 0:10:21,000
their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.

198
0:10:23.316,000 --> 0:10:27,000
They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,

199
0:10:27.49,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and so they decided they would build a little center --

200
0:10:31.343,000 --> 0:10:34,000
two classrooms that they started with a few other parents --

201
0:10:34.944,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to educate kids with DS.

202
0:10:37.286,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,

203
0:10:41.37,000 --> 0:10:43,000
where there are now thousands upon thousands of children

204
0:10:44.092,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with intellectual disabilities

205
0:10:45.765,000 --> 0:10:46,000
who are being taught.

206
0:10:47.304,000 --> 0:10:5,000
In the time since that "Atlantic Monthly" story ran,

207
0:10:50.572,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.

208
0:10:55.119,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,

209
0:10:59.688,000 --> 0:11:04,000
those who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.

210
0:11:05.579,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The Robards had a lot to do with that.

211
0:11:07.443,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And I said, "Do you regret it?

212
0:11:08.92,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?

213
0:11:11.439,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Do you wish you'd never heard of it?"

214
0:11:13.288,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And interestingly, his father said,

215
0:11:15.966,000 --> 0:11:17,000
"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,

216
0:11:18.13,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world,

217
0:11:21.622,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and I'd like to give David an easier life.

218
0:11:24.451,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome,

219
0:11:27.282,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it would be a catastrophic loss."

220
0:11:29.667,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And Karen Robards said to me, "I'm with Tom.

221
0:11:32.956,000 --> 0:11:35,000
For David, I would cure it in an instant, to give him an easier life.

222
0:11:36.842,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But speaking for myself --

223
0:11:38.777,000 --> 0:11:41,000
well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born

224
0:11:42.278,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that I could come to such a point.

225
0:11:44.38,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Speaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder

226
0:11:48.715,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and so much more purposeful in my whole life that, speaking for myself,

227
0:11:53.645,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world."

228
0:11:58.422,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions

229
0:12:02.464,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is on the up and up.

230
0:12:04.111,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And yet we also live at the moment

231
0:12:06.196,000 --> 0:12:08,000
when our ability to eliminate those conditions

232
0:12:08.851,000 --> 0:12:1,000
has reached a height we never imagined before.

233
0:12:11.7,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Most deaf infants born in the United States now

234
0:12:14.572,000 --> 0:12:15,000
will receive cochlear implants,

235
0:12:16.572,000 --> 0:12:2,000
which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,

236
0:12:21.304,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing

237
0:12:24.312,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and to use oral speech.

238
0:12:26.459,000 --> 0:12:3,000
A compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,

239
0:12:30.724,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.

240
0:12:35.321,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,

241
0:12:38.3,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and mice who have been given that substance

242
0:12:40.412,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and who have the achondroplasia gene

243
0:12:42.28,000 --> 0:12:43,000
grow to full size.

244
0:12:44.017,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Testing in humans is around the corner.

245
0:12:46.961,000 --> 0:12:48,000
There are blood tests which are making progress

246
0:12:49.438,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies

247
0:12:53.518,000 --> 0:12:54,000
than ever before,

248
0:12:54.697,000 --> 0:12:58,000
making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,

249
0:12:59.611,000 --> 0:13:,000
or to terminate them.

250
0:13:00.958,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So we have both social progress and medical progress.

251
0:13:05.937,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I believe in both of them.

252
0:13:07.543,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,

253
0:13:11.858,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and I think the same thing about the medical progress.

254
0:13:14.84,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.

255
0:13:19.203,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And when I see the way they're intersecting

256
0:13:21.275,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in conditions like the three I've just described,

257
0:13:23.675,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera

258
0:13:27.32,000 --> 0:13:29,000
when the hero realizes he loves the heroine

259
0:13:29.901,000 --> 0:13:33,000
at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan.

260
0:13:34.189,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

261
0:13:37.401,000 --> 0:13:4,000
We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.

262
0:13:40.9,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is:

263
0:13:43.736,000 --> 0:13:44,000
What do we validate in our children,

264
0:13:45.511,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and what do we cure in them?

265
0:13:47.34,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Jim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,

266
0:13:51.511,000 --> 0:13:55,000
"When parents say, 'I wish my child did not have autism,'

267
0:13:56.112,000 --> 0:14:,000
what they're really saying is, 'I wish the child I have did not exist

268
0:14:00.947,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and I had a different, nonautistic child instead.'

269
0:14:04.858,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.

270
0:14:09.988,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This is what we hear when you pray for a cure:

271
0:14:13.037,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be,

272
0:14:17.463,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."

273
0:14:23.241,000 --> 0:14:25,000
It's a very extreme point of view,

274
0:14:25.734,000 --> 0:14:29,000
but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have

275
0:14:30.071,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.

276
0:14:34.636,000 --> 0:14:37,000
They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be.

277
0:14:38.245,000 --> 0:14:41,000
One of the families I interviewed for this project

278
0:14:41.88,000 --> 0:14:42,000
was the family of Dylan Klebold,

279
0:14:43.631,000 --> 0:14:46,000
who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.

280
0:14:47.04,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,

281
0:14:49.705,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and once they agreed, they were so full of their story

282
0:14:52.353,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that they couldn't stop telling it,

283
0:14:54.073,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and the first weekend I spent with them, the first of many,

284
0:14:56.896,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.

285
0:14:59.906,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.

286
0:15:01.952,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.

287
0:15:05.216,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And I said, "If Dylan were here now,

288
0:15:07.89,000 --> 0:15:09,000
do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?"

289
0:15:10.561,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And his father said, "I sure do.

290
0:15:12.789,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."

291
0:15:16.068,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.

292
0:15:20.286,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And then she looked back up and said,

293
0:15:22.655,000 --> 0:15:25,000
"I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother

294
0:15:26.312,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and never knowing what was going on inside his head."

295
0:15:30.586,000 --> 0:15:32,000
When I had dinner with her a couple of years later --

296
0:15:33.555,000 --> 0:15:35,000
one of many dinners that we had together --

297
0:15:35.792,000 --> 0:15:37,000
she said, "You know, when it first happened,

298
0:15:38.672,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.

299
0:15:42.755,000 --> 0:15:45,000
If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,

300
0:15:46.206,000 --> 0:15:47,000
this child wouldn't have existed,

301
0:15:47.927,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.

302
0:15:50.159,000 --> 0:15:54,000
But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much

303
0:15:54.212,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that I don't want to imagine a life without them.

304
0:15:57.563,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I recognize the pain they caused to others,

305
0:16:00.434,000 --> 0:16:02,000
for which there can be no forgiveness,

306
0:16:02.572,000 --> 0:16:05,000
but the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.

307
0:16:06.155,000 --> 0:16:09,000
"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world

308
0:16:09.767,000 --> 0:16:11,000
if Dylan had never been born,

309
0:16:12.337,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I've decided that it would not have been better for me."

310
0:16:18.42,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I thought it was surprising

311
0:16:19.962,000 --> 0:16:21,000
how all of these families had all of these children

312
0:16:22.638,000 --> 0:16:23,000
with all of these problems,

313
0:16:24.128,000 --> 0:16:27,000
problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,

314
0:16:27.204,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.

315
0:16:31.118,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And then I thought, all of us who have children

316
0:16:34.265,000 --> 0:16:36,000
love the children we have, with their flaws.

317
0:16:37.2,000 --> 0:16:4,000
If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living-room ceiling

318
0:16:41.153,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and offered to take away the children I have

319
0:16:43.379,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and give me other, better children --

320
0:16:45.732,000 --> 0:16:48,000
more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter --

321
0:16:49.202,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Laughter)

322
0:16:50.435,000 --> 0:16:54,000
I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.

323
0:16:55.053,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And ultimately,

324
0:16:56.446,000 --> 0:17:,000
I feel that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno

325
0:17:00.955,000 --> 0:17:04,000
to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,

326
0:17:05.164,000 --> 0:17:09,000
so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences

327
0:17:09.201,000 --> 0:17:11,000
reflect on the universal experience of parenting,

328
0:17:11.888,000 --> 0:17:15,000
which is always that sometimes, you look at your child, and you think,

329
0:17:16.432,000 --> 0:17:17,000
"Where did you come from?"

330
0:17:18.392,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Laughter)

331
0:17:20.94,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed --

332
0:17:25.677,000 --> 0:17:27,000
there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,

333
0:17:28.486,000 --> 0:17:3,000
only so many families of children who are transgender,

334
0:17:31.108,000 --> 0:17:32,000
only so many families of prodigies --

335
0:17:32.994,000 --> 0:17:34,000
who also face similar challenges in many ways --

336
0:17:35.507,000 --> 0:17:37,000
there are only so many families in each of those categories.

337
0:17:38.378,000 --> 0:17:39,000
But if you start to think

338
0:17:39.637,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that the experience of negotiating difference within your family

339
0:17:43.169,000 --> 0:17:45,000
is what people are addressing,

340
0:17:45.272,000 --> 0:17:48,000
then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.

341
0:17:48.617,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Ironically, it turns out,

342
0:17:50.271,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that it's our differences and our negotiation of difference

343
0:17:53.703,000 --> 0:17:54,000
that unite us.

344
0:17:55.832,000 --> 0:18:,000
I decided to have children while I was working on this project.

345
0:18:01.292,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And many people were astonished and said,

346
0:18:04.514,000 --> 0:18:05,000
"But how can you decide to have children

347
0:18:06.537,000 --> 0:18:08,000
in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"

348
0:18:10.55,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And I said, "I'm not studying everything that can go wrong.

349
0:18:13.68,000 --> 0:18:16,000
What I'm studying is how much love there can be,

350
0:18:16.816,000 --> 0:18:2,000
even when everything appears to be going wrong."

351
0:18:21.499,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,

352
0:18:27.064,000 --> 0:18:3,000
a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.

353
0:18:30.674,000 --> 0:18:33,000
And when his ashes were interred, his mother said,

354
0:18:34.745,000 --> 0:18:4,000
"I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed:

355
0:18:41.68,000 --> 0:18:43,000
once of the child I wanted,

356
0:18:44.416,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and once of the son I loved."

357
0:18:47.577,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And I figured it was possible, then, for anyone to love any child,

358
0:18:52.131,000 --> 0:18:54,000
if they had the effective will to do so.

359
0:18:55.003,000 --> 0:18:59,000
So, my husband is the biological father of two children

360
0:18:59.99,000 --> 0:19:01,000
with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.

361
0:19:03.293,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce

362
0:19:06.826,000 --> 0:19:07,000
and wanted to have children.

363
0:19:08.514,000 --> 0:19:09,000
And so she and I have a daughter,

364
0:19:10.251,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and mother and daughter live in Texas.

365
0:19:12.49,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time,

366
0:19:15.862,000 --> 0:19:17,000
of whom I am the biological father,

367
0:19:18.246,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,

368
0:19:21.994,000 --> 0:19:23,000
the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.

369
0:19:24.795,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Laughter)

370
0:19:26.246,000 --> 0:19:27,000
So --

371
0:19:27.429,000 --> 0:19:33,000
(Applause)

372
0:19:34.155,000 --> 0:19:38,000
The shorthand is: five parents of four children in three states.

373
0:19:38.554,000 --> 0:19:39,000
(Laughter)

374
0:19:39.672,000 --> 0:19:42,000
And there are people who think that the existence of my family

375
0:19:42.704,000 --> 0:19:46,000
somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.

376
0:19:47.217,000 --> 0:19:5,000
And there are people who think that families like mine

377
0:19:50.771,000 --> 0:19:51,000
shouldn't be allowed to exist.

378
0:19:52.449,000 --> 0:19:55,000
And I don't accept subtractive models of love,

379
0:19:56.373,000 --> 0:19:57,000
only additive ones.

380
0:19:58.137,000 --> 0:20:01,000
And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity

381
0:20:01.664,000 --> 0:20:03,000
to ensure that the planet can go on,

382
0:20:04.113,000 --> 0:20:08,000
so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family

383
0:20:08.414,000 --> 0:20:11,000
in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.

384
0:20:13.082,000 --> 0:20:15,000
The day after our son was born,

385
0:20:15.504,000 --> 0:20:17,000
the pediatrician came into the hospital room

386
0:20:17.967,000 --> 0:20:18,000
and said she was concerned.

387
0:20:19.882,000 --> 0:20:22,000
He wasn't extending his legs appropriately.

388
0:20:23.024,000 --> 0:20:25,000
She said that might mean that he had brain damage.

389
0:20:25.585,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Insofar as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,

390
0:20:29.34,000 --> 0:20:32,000
which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.

391
0:20:33.078,000 --> 0:20:34,000
And he had a very large head,

392
0:20:34.766,000 --> 0:20:36,000
which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.

393
0:20:37.725,000 --> 0:20:38,000
And as she told me all of these things,

394
0:20:39.637,000 --> 0:20:42,000
I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.

395
0:20:43.482,000 --> 0:20:45,000
And I thought, "Here I had been working for years

396
0:20:45.954,000 --> 0:20:47,000
on a book about how much meaning people had found

397
0:20:48.503,000 --> 0:20:51,000
in the experience of parenting children who were disabled,

398
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
and I didn't want to join their number

399
0:20:55.662,000 --> 0:20:57,000
because what I was encountering was an idea of illness."

400
0:20:58.46,000 --> 0:21:,000
And like all parents since the dawn of time,

401
0:21:01.226,000 --> 0:21:03,000
I wanted to protect my child from illness.

402
0:21:04.227,000 --> 0:21:07,000
And I wanted, also, to protect myself from illness.

403
0:21:07.494,000 --> 0:21:09,000
And yet, I knew from the work I had done

404
0:21:10.265,000 --> 0:21:13,000
that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,

405
0:21:14.105,000 --> 0:21:16,000
that those would ultimately be his identity,

406
0:21:17.092,000 --> 0:21:21,000
and if they were his identity, they would become my identity,

407
0:21:21.155,000 --> 0:21:25,000
that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.

408
0:21:25.447,000 --> 0:21:28,000
We took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,

409
0:21:28.6,000 --> 0:21:31,000
we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.

410
0:21:32.408,000 --> 0:21:33,000
We felt helpless.

411
0:21:33.693,000 --> 0:21:34,000
And at the end of five hours,

412
0:21:35.374,000 --> 0:21:37,000
they said that his brain was completely clear

413
0:21:37.61,000 --> 0:21:39,000
and that he was by then extending his legs correctly.

414
0:21:40.412,000 --> 0:21:43,000
And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,

415
0:21:43.436,000 --> 0:21:47,000
she said she thought in the morning, he had probably had a cramp.

416
0:21:47.62,000 --> 0:21:5,000
(Laughter)

417
0:21:51.095,000 --> 0:21:52,000
But I thought --

418
0:21:52.381,000 --> 0:21:55,000
(Laughter)

419
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:21:58,000
I thought how my mother was right.

420
0:21:58.953,000 --> 0:22:01,000
I thought, "The love you have for your children

421
0:22:02.449,000 --> 0:22:05,000
is unlike any other feeling in the world.

422
0:22:05.835,000 --> 0:22:09,000
And until you have children, you don't know what it feels like.

423
0:22:12.158,000 --> 0:22:14,000
I think children had ensnared me

424
0:22:14.318,000 --> 0:22:17,000
the moment I connected fatherhood with loss.

425
0:22:18.138,000 --> 0:22:2,000
But I'm not sure I would have noticed that

426
0:22:20.196,000 --> 0:22:24,000
if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.

427
0:22:25.462,000 --> 0:22:28,000
I'd encountered so much strange love,

428
0:22:28.602,000 --> 0:22:31,000
and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.

429
0:22:32.347,000 --> 0:22:37,000
And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities.

430
0:22:39.206,000 --> 0:22:42,000
During these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned

431
0:22:43.012,000 --> 0:22:46,000
the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,

432
0:22:46.588,000 --> 0:22:49,000
and I had come to see how it conquers everything else.

433
0:22:50.264,000 --> 0:22:54,000
And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,

434
0:22:54.337,000 --> 0:22:58,000
enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children

435
0:22:59.358,000 --> 0:23:02,000
and trying to breed identity out of misery,

436
0:23:02.54,000 --> 0:23:06,000
I realized that day that my research had built me a plank

437
0:23:07.187,000 --> 0:23:09,000
and that I was ready to join them on their ship.

438
0:23:10.581,000 --> 0:23:11,000
Thank you.

439
0:23:11.813,000 --> 0:23:17,000
(Applause and cheers)

440
0:23:20.096,000 --> 0:23:21,000
Thank you.

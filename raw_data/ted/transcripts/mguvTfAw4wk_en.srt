1
0:00:12.727,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Loneliness.

2
0:00:15.295,000 --> 0:00:17,000
All of us in this room will experience loneliness

3
0:00:17.67,000 --> 0:00:18,000
at some point in our lives.

4
0:00:19.834,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Loneliness is not a function of being alone,

5
0:00:22.809,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but rather, a function of how socially connected you are

6
0:00:25.492,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to those around you.

7
0:00:27.779,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There could be somebody in this room right now

8
0:00:29.997,000 --> 0:00:3,000
surrounded by a thousand people

9
0:00:31.558,000 --> 0:00:32,000
experiencing loneliness.

10
0:00:35.104,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And while loneliness can be attributed to many things,

11
0:00:38.781,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as an architect,

12
0:00:40.536,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm going to tell you today how loneliness can be the result

13
0:00:43.497,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of our built environments --

14
0:00:45.477,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the very homes we choose to live in.

15
0:00:49.285,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Let's take a look at this house.

16
0:00:51.339,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's a nice house.

17
0:00:52.584,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There's a big yard, picket fence,

18
0:00:55.023,000 --> 0:00:56,000
two-car garage.

19
0:00:58.018,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the home might be in a neighborhood like this.

20
0:01:01.379,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And for many people around the globe,

21
0:01:03.924,000 --> 0:01:05,000
this home, this neighborhood --

22
0:01:06.889,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it's a dream.

23
0:01:08.841,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And yet the danger of achieving this dream

24
0:01:11.543,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is a false sense of connection

25
0:01:14.426,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and an increase in social isolation.

26
0:01:17.251,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I know, I can hear you now,

27
0:01:18.732,000 --> 0:01:21,000
there's somebody in the room screaming at me inside their head,

28
0:01:22.083,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"That's my house, and that's my neighborhood,

29
0:01:24.398,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I know everyone on my block!"

30
0:01:26.876,000 --> 0:01:28,000
To which I would answer, "Terrific!"

31
0:01:29.199,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I wish there were more people like you,

32
0:01:32.486,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because I'd wager to guess there's more people in the room

33
0:01:35.378,000 --> 0:01:36,000
living in a similar situation

34
0:01:37.124,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that might not know their neighbors.

35
0:01:39.536,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They might recognize them and say hello,

36
0:01:42.301,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but under their breath,

37
0:01:45.236,000 --> 0:01:46,000
they're asking their spouse,

38
0:01:47.063,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"What was their name again?"

39
0:01:49.413,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so they can ask a question by name to signify they know them.

40
0:01:54.975,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Social media also contributes to this false sense of connection.

41
0:01:59.498,000 --> 0:02:,000
This image is probably all too familiar.

42
0:02:01.52,000 --> 0:02:02,000
You're standing in the elevator,

43
0:02:03.113,000 --> 0:02:04,000
sitting in a cafe,

44
0:02:04.291,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and you look around,

45
0:02:05.951,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and everyone's on their phone.

46
0:02:08.875,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You're not texting or checking Facebook,

47
0:02:11.122,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but everyone else is,

48
0:02:12.553,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and maybe, like me, you've been in a situation

49
0:02:14.796,000 --> 0:02:15,000
where you've made eye contact,

50
0:02:16.704,000 --> 0:02:18,000
smiled and said hello,

51
0:02:19.021,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and have that person yank out their earbuds

52
0:02:22.354,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?"

53
0:02:25.697,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I find this incredibly isolating.

54
0:02:28.321,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The concept I'd like to share with you today

55
0:02:30.529,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is an antidote to isolation.

56
0:02:32.523,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's not a new concept.

57
0:02:33.798,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In fact, it's an age-old way of living,

58
0:02:35.925,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and it still exists in many non-European cultures

59
0:02:38.429,000 --> 0:02:39,000
around the world.

60
0:02:40.337,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And about 50 years ago,

61
0:02:42.239,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the Danes decided to make up a new name,

62
0:02:45.38,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and since then,

63
0:02:46.562,000 --> 0:02:5,000
tens of thousands of Danish people have been living in this connected way.

64
0:02:52.29,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And it's being pursued more widely around the globe

65
0:02:55.682,000 --> 0:02:57,000
as people are seeking community.

66
0:02:59.265,000 --> 0:03:,000
This concept

67
0:03:01.638,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is cohousing.

68
0:03:05.441,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Cohousing is an intentional neighborhood where people know each other

69
0:03:08.718,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and look after one another.

70
0:03:10.728,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In cohousing, you have your own home,

71
0:03:13.252,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but you also share significant spaces, both indoors and out.

72
0:03:16.857,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Before I show you some pictures of cohousing,

73
0:03:19.203,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I'd like to first introduce you to my friends Sheila and Spencer.

74
0:03:22.319,000 --> 0:03:25,000
When I first met Sheila and Spencer, they were just entering their 60s,

75
0:03:26.275,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and Spencer was looking ahead at the end of a long career

76
0:03:29.026,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in elementary education.

77
0:03:30.776,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And he really disliked the idea

78
0:03:32.537,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that he might not have children in his life

79
0:03:35.074,000 --> 0:03:36,000
upon retirement.

80
0:03:38.873,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They're now my neighbors.

81
0:03:40.318,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We live in a cohousing community that I not only designed,

82
0:03:43.356,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but developed

83
0:03:44.544,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and have my architecture practice in.

84
0:03:47.02,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This community is very intentional about our social interactions.

85
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So let me take you on a tour.

86
0:03:53.316,000 --> 0:03:56,000
From the outside, we look like any other small apartment building.

87
0:03:56.555,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In fact, we look identical to the one next door,

88
0:03:59.237,000 --> 0:04:,000
except that we're bright yellow.

89
0:04:02.086,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Inside, the homes are fairly conventional.

90
0:04:04.496,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We all have living rooms and kitchens,

91
0:04:07.033,000 --> 0:04:08,000
bedrooms and baths,

92
0:04:08.955,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and there are nine of these homes around a central courtyard.

93
0:04:12.371,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This one's mine,

94
0:04:14.27,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and this one is Spencer and Sheila's.

95
0:04:16.755,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The thing that makes this building uniquely cohousing

96
0:04:19.416,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are not the homes,

97
0:04:21.563,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but rather, what happens here --

98
0:04:24.25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the social interactions that happen in and around that central courtyard.

99
0:04:28.728,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When I look across the courtyard,

100
0:04:30.438,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila.

101
0:04:32.477,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In fact, every morning, this is what I see,

102
0:04:34.537,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Spencer waving at me furiously as we're making our breakfasts.

103
0:04:38.884,000 --> 0:04:4,000
From our homes, we look down into the courtyard,

104
0:04:41.958,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and depending on the time of year,

105
0:04:43.774,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we see this:

106
0:04:45.147,000 --> 0:04:48,000
kids and grownups in various combinations

107
0:04:48.577,000 --> 0:04:5,000
playing and hanging out with each other.

108
0:04:50.965,000 --> 0:04:52,000
There's a lot of giggling and chatter.

109
0:04:53.299,000 --> 0:04:54,000
There's a lot of hula-hooping.

110
0:04:55.887,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And every now and then, "Hey, quit hitting me!"

111
0:05:00.181,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or a cry from one of the kids.

112
0:05:01.977,000 --> 0:05:03,000
These are the sounds of our daily lives,

113
0:05:05.405,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and the sounds of social connectedness.

114
0:05:08.296,000 --> 0:05:11,000
At the bottom of the courtyard, there are a set of double doors,

115
0:05:11.711,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and those lead into the common house.

116
0:05:14.323,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I consider the common house the secret sauce of cohousing.

117
0:05:18.203,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's the secret sauce

118
0:05:19.39,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because it's the place where the social interactions

119
0:05:22.288,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and community life begin,

120
0:05:24.834,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and from there, it radiates out through the rest of the community.

121
0:05:31.51,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Inside our common house, we have a large dining room

122
0:05:34.071,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to seat all 28 of us and our guests,

123
0:05:36.677,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and we dine together three times a week.

124
0:05:39.978,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In support of those meals, we have a large kitchen

125
0:05:42.793,000 --> 0:05:44,000
so that we can take turns cooking for each other

126
0:05:45.312,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in teams of three.

127
0:05:46.574,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So that means, with 17 adults,

128
0:05:49.916,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I lead cook once every six weeks.

129
0:05:52.392,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Two other times, I show up and help my team

130
0:05:54.794,000 --> 0:05:55,000
with the preparation and cleanup.

131
0:05:56.615,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And all those other nights,

132
0:05:58.204,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I just show up.

133
0:06:00.243,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I have dinner, talk with my neighbors,

134
0:06:02.719,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and I go home, having been fed a delicious meal

135
0:06:05.088,000 --> 0:06:07,000
by someone who cares about my vegetarian preferences.

136
0:06:11.059,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Our nine families have intentionally chosen

137
0:06:13.421,000 --> 0:06:14,000
an alternative way of living.

138
0:06:15.655,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Instead of pursuing the American dream,

139
0:06:17.799,000 --> 0:06:19,000
where we might have been isolated in our single-family homes,

140
0:06:20.721,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we instead chose cohousing,

141
0:06:23.287,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so that we can increase our social connections.

142
0:06:26.197,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And that's how cohousing starts:

143
0:06:28.083,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with a shared intention

144
0:06:29.761,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to live collaboratively.

145
0:06:31.269,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And intention is the single most important characteristic

146
0:06:34.172,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that differentiates cohousing from any other housing model.

147
0:06:38.545,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And while intention is difficult to see

148
0:06:40.614,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or even show,

149
0:06:42.468,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I'm an architect, and I can't help but show you more pictures.

150
0:06:45.436,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So here are a few examples to illustrate

151
0:06:47.526,000 --> 0:06:49,000
how intention has been expressed

152
0:06:49.834,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in some of the communities I've visited.

153
0:06:54.279,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Through the careful selection of furniture,

154
0:06:56.541,000 --> 0:06:59,000
lighting and acoustic materials to support eating together;

155
0:07:01.876,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in the careful visual location and visual access

156
0:07:05.032,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to kids' play areas around and inside the common house;

157
0:07:11.218,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in the consideration of scale

158
0:07:13.581,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and distribution of social gathering nodes

159
0:07:16.392,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in and around the community to support our daily lives,

160
0:07:19.733,000 --> 0:07:22,000
all of these spaces help contribute to and elevate

161
0:07:23.103,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the sense of communitas

162
0:07:24.445,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in each community.

163
0:07:26.893,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What was that word? "Communitas."

164
0:07:29.937,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Communitas is a fancy social science way of saying "spirit of community."

165
0:07:35.585,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And in visiting over 80 different communities,

166
0:07:38.071,000 --> 0:07:4,000
my measure of communitas became:

167
0:07:40.551,000 --> 0:07:42,000
How frequently did residents eat together?

168
0:07:44.665,000 --> 0:07:46,000
While it's completely up to each group

169
0:07:46.791,000 --> 0:07:48,000
how frequently they have common meals,

170
0:07:50.226,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I know some that have eaten together every single night

171
0:07:53.289,000 --> 0:07:54,000
for the past 40 years.

172
0:07:56.118,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I know others

173
0:07:58.059,000 --> 0:08:,000
that have an occasional potluck once or twice a month.

174
0:08:01.571,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And from my observations, I can tell you,

175
0:08:03.589,000 --> 0:08:05,000
those that eat together more frequently,

176
0:08:05.702,000 --> 0:08:07,000
exhibit higher levels of communitas.

177
0:08:09.99,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It turns out, when you eat together,

178
0:08:12.81,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you start planning more activities together.

179
0:08:16.02,000 --> 0:08:18,000
When you eat together, you share more things.

180
0:08:18.217,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You start to watch each other's kids.

181
0:08:20.025,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You lend our your power tools. You borrow each other's cars.

182
0:08:22.964,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And despite all this,

183
0:08:25.398,000 --> 0:08:26,000
as my daughter loves to say,

184
0:08:26.939,000 --> 0:08:29,000
everything is not rainbows and unicorns in cohousing,

185
0:08:31.101,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and I'm not best friends with every single person in my community.

186
0:08:34.902,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We even have differences and conflicts.

187
0:08:39.234,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But living in cohousing, we're intentional about our relationships.

188
0:08:43.505,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We're motivated to resolve our differences.

189
0:08:46.909,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We follow up, we check in,

190
0:08:49.266,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we speak our personal truths

191
0:08:51.384,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and, when appropriate,

192
0:08:53.552,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we apologize.

193
0:08:55.806,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Skeptics will say that cohousing is only interesting or attractive

194
0:08:59.966,000 --> 0:09:,000
to a very small group of people.

195
0:09:02.249,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And I'll agree with that.

196
0:09:04.468,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If you look at Western cultures around the globe,

197
0:09:06.833,000 --> 0:09:08,000
those living in cohousing are just a fractional percent.

198
0:09:10.73,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But that needs to change,

199
0:09:12.992,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because our very lives depend upon it.

200
0:09:16.64,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In 2015, Brigham Young University completed a study

201
0:09:20.347,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that showed a significant increase risk of premature death

202
0:09:25.1,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in those who were living in isolation.

203
0:09:28.725,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The US Surgeon General has declared isolation

204
0:09:31.143,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to be a public health epidemic.

205
0:09:33.244,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And this epidemic is not restricted to the US alone.

206
0:09:38.999,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So when I said earlier

207
0:09:41.097,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that cohousing is an antidote to isolation,

208
0:09:45.587,000 --> 0:09:46,000
what I should have said

209
0:09:47.232,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is that cohousing can save your life.

210
0:09:52.66,000 --> 0:09:54,000
If I was a doctor, I would tell you to take two aspirin,

211
0:09:55.643,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and call me in the morning.

212
0:09:58.356,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But as an architect,

213
0:09:59.699,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I'm going to suggest that you take a walk with your neighbor,

214
0:10:02.754,000 --> 0:10:03,000
share a meal together,

215
0:10:05.101,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and call me in 20 years.

216
0:10:07.83,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Thank you.

217
0:10:09.132,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Applause)

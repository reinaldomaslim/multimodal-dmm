1
0:00:12.74,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, imagine that you had your smartphone miniaturized

2
0:00:16.443,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and hooked up directly to your brain.

3
0:00:19.711,000 --> 0:00:2,000
If you had this sort of brain chip,

4
0:00:21.628,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you'd be able to upload and download to the internet

5
0:00:24.183,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at the speed of thought.

6
0:00:25.986,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Accessing social media or Wikipedia would be a lot like --

7
0:00:29.277,000 --> 0:00:3,000
well, from the inside at least --

8
0:00:30.941,000 --> 0:00:31,000
like consulting your own memory.

9
0:00:33.247,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It would be as easy and as intimate as thinking.

10
0:00:37.579,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But would it make it easier for you to know what's true?

11
0:00:40.76,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Just because a way of accessing information is faster

12
0:00:43.745,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it doesn't mean it's more reliable, of course,

13
0:00:46.014,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it doesn't mean that we would all interpret it the same way.

14
0:00:49.269,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And it doesn't mean that you would be any better at evaluating it.

15
0:00:52.887,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In fact, you might even be worse,

16
0:00:54.568,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because, you know, more data, less time for evaluation.

17
0:00:58.378,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Something like this is already happening to us right now.

18
0:01:01.797,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We already carry a world of information around in our pockets,

19
0:01:05.679,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but it seems as if the more information we share and access online,

20
0:01:09.932,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the more difficult it can be for us to tell the difference

21
0:01:12.758,000 --> 0:01:14,000
between what's real and what's fake.

22
0:01:15.507,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's as if we know more but understand less.

23
0:01:20.152,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now, it's a feature of modern life, I suppose,

24
0:01:23.113,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that large swaths of the public live in isolated information bubbles.

25
0:01:27.849,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We're polarized: not just over values, but over the facts.

26
0:01:32.527,000 --> 0:01:35,000
One reason for that is, the data analytics that drive the internet

27
0:01:36.148,000 --> 0:01:38,000
get us not just more information,

28
0:01:38.571,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but more of the information that we want.

29
0:01:40.781,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Our online life is personalized;

30
0:01:43.195,000 --> 0:01:44,000
everything from the ads we read

31
0:01:44.949,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to the news that comes down our Facebook feed

32
0:01:47.563,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is tailored to satisfy our preferences.

33
0:01:51.279,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And so while we get more information,

34
0:01:53.109,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a lot of that information ends up reflecting ourselves

35
0:01:56.363,000 --> 0:01:58,000
as much as it does reality.

36
0:01:59.198,000 --> 0:02:,000
It ends up, I suppose,

37
0:02:01.691,000 --> 0:02:03,000
inflating our bubbles rather than bursting them.

38
0:02:05.331,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And so maybe it's no surprise

39
0:02:07.484,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that we're in a situation, a paradoxical situation,

40
0:02:10.413,000 --> 0:02:12,000
of thinking that we know so much more,

41
0:02:12.568,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and yet not agreeing on what it is we know.

42
0:02:17.259,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So how are we going to solve this problem of knowledge polarization?

43
0:02:20.855,000 --> 0:02:24,000
One obvious tactic is to try to fix our technology,

44
0:02:25.047,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to redesign our digital platforms,

45
0:02:26.98,000 --> 0:02:29,000
so as to make them less susceptible to polarization.

46
0:02:30.884,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And I'm happy to report

47
0:02:32.107,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that many smart people at Google and Facebook are working on just that.

48
0:02:36.771,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And these projects are vital.

49
0:02:39.837,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I think that fixing technology is obviously really important,

50
0:02:42.991,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but I don't think technology alone, fixing it, is going to solve the problem

51
0:02:47.637,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of knowledge polarization.

52
0:02:49.015,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I don't think that because I don't think, at the end of the day,

53
0:02:52.114,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it is a technological problem.

54
0:02:53.767,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I think it's a human problem,

55
0:02:55.666,000 --> 0:02:58,000
having to do with how we think and what we value.

56
0:03:00.285,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In order to solve it, I think we're going to need help.

57
0:03:02.924,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We're going to need help from psychology and political science.

58
0:03:05.953,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But we're also going to need help, I think, from philosophy.

59
0:03:10.663,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Because to solve the problem of knowledge polarization,

60
0:03:15.522,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we're going to need to reconnect

61
0:03:18.455,000 --> 0:03:21,000
with one fundamental, philosophical idea:

62
0:03:23.219,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that we live in a common reality.

63
0:03:26.671,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The idea of a common reality is like, I suppose,

64
0:03:30.722,000 --> 0:03:31,000
a lot of philosophical concepts:

65
0:03:32.309,000 --> 0:03:33,000
easy to state

66
0:03:33.499,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but mysteriously difficult to put into practice.

67
0:03:37.003,000 --> 0:03:38,000
To really accept it,

68
0:03:38.332,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I think we need to do three things,

69
0:03:40.573,000 --> 0:03:42,000
each of which is a challenge right now.

70
0:03:44.749,000 --> 0:03:46,000
First, we need to believe in truth.

71
0:03:48.267,000 --> 0:03:49,000
You might have noticed

72
0:03:49.454,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that our culture is having something of a troubled relationship

73
0:03:52.493,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with that concept right now.

74
0:03:55.061,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It seems as if we disagree so much that,

75
0:03:58.298,000 --> 0:04:,000
as one political commentator put it not long ago,

76
0:04:01.131,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it's as if there are no facts anymore.

77
0:04:04.986,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But that thought is actually an expression

78
0:04:09.232,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of a sort of seductive line of argument that's in the air.

79
0:04:13.668,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It goes like this:

80
0:04:16.188,000 --> 0:04:18,000
we just can't step outside of our own perspectives;

81
0:04:19.063,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we can't step outside of our biases.

82
0:04:21.529,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Every time we try,

83
0:04:23.026,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we just get more information from our perspective.

84
0:04:27.536,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So, this line of thought goes,

85
0:04:31.016,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we might as well admit that objective truth is an illusion,

86
0:04:34.802,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or it doesn't matter,

87
0:04:35.98,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because either we'll never know what it is,

88
0:04:39.039,000 --> 0:04:41,000
or it doesn't exist in the first place.

89
0:04:43.173,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That's not a new philosophical thought --

90
0:04:46.193,000 --> 0:04:47,000
skepticism about truth.

91
0:04:49.332,000 --> 0:04:51,000
During the end of the last century, as some of you know,

92
0:04:52.237,000 --> 0:04:54,000
it was very popular in certain academic circles.

93
0:04:55.317,000 --> 0:05:,000
But it really goes back all the way to the Greek philosopher Protagoras,

94
0:05:00.474,000 --> 0:05:01,000
if not farther back.

95
0:05:02.252,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Protagoras said that objective truth was an illusion

96
0:05:04.725,000 --> 0:05:06,000
because "man is the measure of all things."

97
0:05:07.656,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Man is the measure of all things.

98
0:05:10.169,000 --> 0:05:12,000
That can seem like a bracing bit of realpolitik to people,

99
0:05:13.016,000 --> 0:05:14,000
or liberating,

100
0:05:14.199,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because it allows each of us to discover or make our own truth.

101
0:05:20.618,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But actually, I think it's a bit of self-serving rationalization

102
0:05:24.804,000 --> 0:05:25,000
disguised as philosophy.

103
0:05:27.507,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It confuses the difficulty of being certain

104
0:05:30.339,000 --> 0:05:32,000
with the impossibility of truth.

105
0:05:34.223,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Look --

106
0:05:36.768,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of course it's difficult to be certain about anything;

107
0:05:40.908,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we might all be living in "The Matrix."

108
0:05:44.018,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You might have a brain chip in your head

109
0:05:46.024,000 --> 0:05:47,000
feeding you all the wrong information.

110
0:05:49.593,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But in practice, we do agree on all sorts of facts.

111
0:05:53.796,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We agree that bullets can kill people.

112
0:05:57.616,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We agree that you can't flap your arms and fly.

113
0:06:02.023,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We agree -- or we should --

114
0:06:05.018,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that there is an external reality

115
0:06:07.339,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and ignoring it can get you hurt.

116
0:06:11.205,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Nonetheless, skepticism about truth can be tempting,

117
0:06:15.378,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because it allows us to rationalize away our own biases.

118
0:06:18.716,000 --> 0:06:2,000
When we do that, we're sort of like the guy in the movie

119
0:06:21.727,000 --> 0:06:23,000
who knew he was living in "The Matrix"

120
0:06:24.793,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but decided he liked it there, anyway.

121
0:06:29.031,000 --> 0:06:31,000
After all, getting what you want feels good.

122
0:06:32.271,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Being right all the time feels good.

123
0:06:34.991,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So, often it's easier for us

124
0:06:37.797,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to wrap ourselves in our cozy information bubbles,

125
0:06:42.049,000 --> 0:06:43,000
live in bad faith,

126
0:06:43.614,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and take those bubbles as the measure of reality.

127
0:06:48.595,000 --> 0:06:53,000
An example, I think, of how this bad faith gets into our action

128
0:06:54.464,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is our reaction to the phenomenon of fake news.

129
0:06:59.874,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The fake news that spread on the internet

130
0:07:02.828,000 --> 0:07:06,000
during the American presidential election of 2016

131
0:07:07.506,000 --> 0:07:09,000
was designed to feed into our biases,

132
0:07:10.157,000 --> 0:07:12,000
designed to inflate our bubbles.

133
0:07:12.295,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But what was really striking about it

134
0:07:14.37,000 --> 0:07:16,000
was not just that it fooled so many people.

135
0:07:17.595,000 --> 0:07:19,000
What was really striking to me about fake news,

136
0:07:20.46,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the phenomenon,

137
0:07:21.822,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is how quickly it itself became the subject of knowledge polarization;

138
0:07:27.582,000 --> 0:07:3,000
so much so, that the very term -- the very term -- "fake news"

139
0:07:31.285,000 --> 0:07:34,000
now just means: "news story I don't like."

140
0:07:35.367,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That's an example of the bad faith towards the truth that I'm talking about.

141
0:07:43.24,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But the really, I think, dangerous thing

142
0:07:47.981,000 --> 0:07:49,000
about skepticism with regard to truth

143
0:07:51.476,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is that it leads to despotism.

144
0:07:54.35,000 --> 0:07:56,000
"Man is the measure of all things"

145
0:07:57.297,000 --> 0:08:,000
inevitably becomes "The Man is the measure of all things."

146
0:08:01.852,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Just as "every man for himself"

147
0:08:04.526,000 --> 0:08:06,000
always seems to turn out to be "only the strong survive."

148
0:08:08.345,000 --> 0:08:1,000
At the end of Orwell's "1984,"

149
0:08:12.136,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing the protagonist Winston Smith

150
0:08:16.419,000 --> 0:08:19,000
into believing two plus two equals five.

151
0:08:20.571,000 --> 0:08:22,000
What O'Brien says is the point,

152
0:08:25.486,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is that he wants to convince Smith that whatever the party says is the truth,

153
0:08:29.931,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and the truth is whatever the party says.

154
0:08:33.484,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And what O'Brien knows is that once this thought is accepted,

155
0:08:38.387,000 --> 0:08:4,000
critical dissent is impossible.

156
0:08:41.857,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You can't speak truth to power

157
0:08:44.069,000 --> 0:08:47,000
if the power speaks truth by definition.

158
0:08:48.88,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I said that in order to accept that we really live in a common reality,

159
0:08:53.147,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we have to do three things.

160
0:08:54.458,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The first thing is to believe in truth.

161
0:08:56.467,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The second thing can be summed up

162
0:08:58.161,000 --> 0:09:03,000
by the Latin phrase that Kant took as the motto for the Enlightenment:

163
0:09:03.271,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"Sapere aude,"

164
0:09:04.932,000 --> 0:09:05,000
or "dare to know."

165
0:09:06.688,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Or as Kant wants, "to dare to know for yourself."

166
0:09:10.208,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I think in the early days of the internet,

167
0:09:12.274,000 --> 0:09:13,000
a lot of us thought

168
0:09:13.464,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that information technology was always going to make it easier

169
0:09:17.298,000 --> 0:09:18,000
for us to know for ourselves,

170
0:09:19.177,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and of course in many ways, it has.

171
0:09:21.893,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But as the internet has become more and more a part of our lives,

172
0:09:25.755,000 --> 0:09:26,000
our reliance on it, our use of it,

173
0:09:27.738,000 --> 0:09:29,000
has become often more passive.

174
0:09:30.322,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Much of what we know today we Google-know.

175
0:09:33.299,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We download prepackaged sets of facts

176
0:09:37.018,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and sort of shuffle them along the assembly line of social media.

177
0:09:41.357,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Now, Google-knowing is useful

178
0:09:42.811,000 --> 0:09:45,000
precisely because it involves a sort of intellectual outsourcing.

179
0:09:46.031,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We offload our effort onto a network of others and algorithms.

180
0:09:51.82,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And that allows us, of course, to not clutter our minds

181
0:09:54.851,000 --> 0:09:55,000
with all sorts of facts.

182
0:09:56.314,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We can just download them when we need them.

183
0:09:58.625,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And that's awesome.

184
0:10:01.348,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But there's a difference between downloading a set of facts

185
0:10:06.809,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and really understanding how or why those facts are as they are.

186
0:10:13.237,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Understanding why a particular disease spreads,

187
0:10:17.635,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or how a mathematical proof works,

188
0:10:19.718,000 --> 0:10:21,000
or why your friend is depressed,

189
0:10:21.755,000 --> 0:10:23,000
involves more than just downloading.

190
0:10:25.396,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's going to require, most likely,

191
0:10:27.501,000 --> 0:10:29,000
doing some work for yourself:

192
0:10:30.503,000 --> 0:10:31,000
having a little creative insight;

193
0:10:32.367,000 --> 0:10:33,000
using your imagination;

194
0:10:33.657,000 --> 0:10:34,000
getting out into the field;

195
0:10:34.999,000 --> 0:10:35,000
doing the experiment;

196
0:10:36.205,000 --> 0:10:37,000
working through the proof;

197
0:10:37.5,000 --> 0:10:38,000
talking to someone.

198
0:10:43.533,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, I'm not saying, of course, that we should stop Google-knowing.

199
0:10:48.402,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I'm just saying

200
0:10:49.577,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we shouldn't overvalue it, either.

201
0:10:51.287,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active,

202
0:10:56.512,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and don't always involve passing off our effort into our bubble.

203
0:11:02.242,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Because the thing about Google-knowing is that too often it ends up

204
0:11:05.607,000 --> 0:11:06,000
being bubble-knowing.

205
0:11:07.581,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And bubble-knowing means always being right.

206
0:11:11.183,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But daring to know,

207
0:11:13.404,000 --> 0:11:14,000
daring to understand,

208
0:11:16.151,000 --> 0:11:19,000
means risking the possibility that you could be wrong.

209
0:11:19.921,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It means risking the possibility

210
0:11:22.213,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that what you want and what's true are different things.

211
0:11:28.07,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Which brings me to the third thing that I think we need to do

212
0:11:31.854,000 --> 0:11:34,000
if we want to accept that we live in a common reality.

213
0:11:34.91,000 --> 0:11:36,000
That third thing is: have a little humility.

214
0:11:38.51,000 --> 0:11:4,000
By humility here, I mean epistemic humility,

215
0:11:40.656,000 --> 0:11:41,000
which means, in a sense,

216
0:11:43.701,000 --> 0:11:45,000
knowing that you don't know it all.

217
0:11:46.128,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But it also means something more than that.

218
0:11:48.205,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It means seeing your worldview as open to improvement

219
0:11:52.679,000 --> 0:11:54,000
by the evidence and experience of others.

220
0:11:54.834,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Seeing your worldview as open to improvement

221
0:11:56.907,000 --> 0:11:58,000
by the evidence and experience of others.

222
0:12:00.084,000 --> 0:12:02,000
That's more than just being open to change.

223
0:12:02.147,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It's more than just being open to self-improvement.

224
0:12:04.569,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It means seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing

225
0:12:08.878,000 --> 0:12:1,000
or being enriched by what others contribute.

226
0:12:12.224,000 --> 0:12:14,000
That's part of what is involved

227
0:12:14.962,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in recognizing there's a common reality

228
0:12:18.116,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that you, too, are responsible to.

229
0:12:21.633,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I don't think it's much of a stretch to say

230
0:12:23.862,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that our society is not particularly great at enhancing or encouraging

231
0:12:28.841,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that sort of humility.

232
0:12:30.08,000 --> 0:12:31,000
That's partly because,

233
0:12:32.81,000 --> 0:12:34,000
well, we tend to confuse arrogance and confidence.

234
0:12:36.263,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And it's partly because, well, you know,

235
0:12:39.341,000 --> 0:12:4,000
arrogance is just easier.

236
0:12:40.918,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's just easier to think of yourself as knowing it all.

237
0:12:43.619,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's just easier to think of yourself as having it all figured out.

238
0:12:48.513,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But that's another example of the bad faith towards the truth

239
0:12:51.47,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that I've been talking about.

240
0:12:55.391,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So the concept of a common reality,

241
0:12:57.652,000 --> 0:12:59,000
like a lot of philosophical concepts,

242
0:13:00.366,000 --> 0:13:01,000
can seem so obvious,

243
0:13:02.785,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that we can look right past it

244
0:13:05.945,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and forget why it's important.

245
0:13:09.394,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Democracies can't function if their citizens don't strive,

246
0:13:14.362,000 --> 0:13:15,000
at least some of the time,

247
0:13:15.756,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to inhabit a common space,

248
0:13:17.461,000 --> 0:13:2,000
a space where they can pass ideas back and forth

249
0:13:22.123,000 --> 0:13:23,000
when -- and especially when --

250
0:13:23.933,000 --> 0:13:24,000
they disagree.

251
0:13:25.749,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But you can't strive to inhabit that space

252
0:13:29.56,000 --> 0:13:32,000
if you don't already accept that you live in the same reality.

253
0:13:35.144,000 --> 0:13:37,000
To accept that, we've got to believe in truth,

254
0:13:37.339,000 --> 0:13:4,000
we've got to encourage more active ways of knowing.

255
0:13:41.394,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And we've got to have the humility

256
0:13:44.271,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to realize that we're not the measure of all things.

257
0:13:49.049,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We may yet one day realize the vision

258
0:13:52.597,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of having the internet in our brains.

259
0:13:56.545,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But if we want that to be liberating and not terrifying,

260
0:14:00.488,000 --> 0:14:02,000
if we want it to expand our understanding

261
0:14:03.274,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and not just our passive knowing,

262
0:14:06.585,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we need to remember that our perspectives,

263
0:14:10.248,000 --> 0:14:13,000
as wondrous, as beautiful as they are,

264
0:14:14.171,000 --> 0:14:15,000
are just that --

265
0:14:15.475,000 --> 0:14:17,000
perspectives on one reality.

266
0:14:19.096,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

267
0:14:20.391,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.722,000 --> 0:00:13,000
"Why?"

2
0:00:14.231,000 --> 0:00:15,000
"Why?" is a question

3
0:00:15.689,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that parents ask me all the time.

4
0:00:18.325,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"Why did my child develop autism?"

5
0:00:21.172,000 --> 0:00:25,000
As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,

6
0:00:25.626,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we try and address that question.

7
0:00:28.069,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But autism is not a single condition.

8
0:00:30.018,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's actually a spectrum of disorders,

9
0:00:32.733,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a spectrum that ranges, for instance,

10
0:00:35.267,000 --> 0:00:37,000
from Justin, a 13-year-old boy

11
0:00:37.94,000 --> 0:00:4,000
who's not verbal, who can't speak,

12
0:00:41.163,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who communicates by using an iPad

13
0:00:43.125,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to touch pictures to communicate

14
0:00:45.023,000 --> 0:00:47,000
his thoughts and his concerns,

15
0:00:47.174,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a little boy who, when he gets upset,

16
0:00:49.585,000 --> 0:00:5,000
will start rocking,

17
0:00:51.233,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and eventually, when he's disturbed enough,

18
0:00:52.83,000 --> 0:00:53,000
will bang his head to the point

19
0:00:54.433,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that he can actually cut it open and require stitches.

20
0:00:58.275,000 --> 0:01:,000
That same diagnosis of autism, though,

21
0:01:00.89,000 --> 0:01:01,000
also applies to Gabriel,

22
0:01:02.812,000 --> 0:01:03,000
another 13-year-old boy

23
0:01:04.779,000 --> 0:01:06,000
who has quite a different set of challenges.

24
0:01:07.474,000 --> 0:01:1,000
He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics.

25
0:01:10.588,000 --> 0:01:12,000
He can multiple three numbers by three numbers

26
0:01:12.609,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in his head with ease,

27
0:01:14.396,000 --> 0:01:17,000
yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation,

28
0:01:18.154,000 --> 0:01:2,000
he has great difficulty.

29
0:01:20.215,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He doesn't make eye contact.

30
0:01:22.274,000 --> 0:01:24,000
He has difficulty starting a conversation,

31
0:01:24.397,000 --> 0:01:25,000
feels awkward,

32
0:01:26.132,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and when he gets nervous,

33
0:01:27.95,000 --> 0:01:28,000
he actually shuts down.

34
0:01:29.675,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Yet both of these boys

35
0:01:31.157,000 --> 0:01:35,000
have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

36
0:01:35.341,000 --> 0:01:37,000
One of the things that concerns us

37
0:01:37.769,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is whether or not there really is

38
0:01:39.366,000 --> 0:01:4,000
an epidemic of autism.

39
0:01:41.339,000 --> 0:01:43,000
These days, one in 88 children

40
0:01:43.819,000 --> 0:01:45,000
will be diagnosed with autism,

41
0:01:45.861,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and the question is,

42
0:01:47.334,000 --> 0:01:49,000
why does this graph look this way?

43
0:01:49.337,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Has that number been increasing

44
0:01:51.304,000 --> 0:01:52,000
dramatically over time?

45
0:01:53.238,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Or is it because we have now started labeling

46
0:01:57.769,000 --> 0:01:58,000
individuals with autism,

47
0:01:59.331,000 --> 0:02:01,000
simply giving them a diagnosis

48
0:02:01.579,000 --> 0:02:03,000
when they were still present there before

49
0:02:04.132,000 --> 0:02:06,000
yet simply didn't have that label?

50
0:02:06.525,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,

51
0:02:10.516,000 --> 0:02:11,000
legislation was passed

52
0:02:11.926,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that actually provided individuals with autism

53
0:02:14.565,000 --> 0:02:17,000
with resources, with access to educational materials

54
0:02:18.291,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that would help them.

55
0:02:20.063,000 --> 0:02:23,000
With that increased awareness, more parents,

56
0:02:23.551,000 --> 0:02:25,000
more pediatricians, more educators

57
0:02:26.297,000 --> 0:02:29,000
learned to recognize the features of autism.

58
0:02:29.552,000 --> 0:02:33,000
As a result of that, more individuals were diagnosed

59
0:02:33.562,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and got access to the resources they needed.

60
0:02:36.75,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In addition, we've changed our definition over time,

61
0:02:40.182,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so in fact we've widened the definition of autism,

62
0:02:43.32,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and that accounts for some of

63
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the increased prevalence that we see.

64
0:02:47.455,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The next question everyone wonders is,

65
0:02:50.115,000 --> 0:02:51,000
what caused autism?

66
0:02:51.891,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And a common misconception

67
0:02:54.786,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is that vaccines cause autism.

68
0:02:57.57,000 --> 0:03:,000
But let me be very clear:

69
0:03:00.621,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Vaccines do not cause autism.

70
0:03:05.108,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Applause)

71
0:03:11.812,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In fact, the original research study

72
0:03:13.935,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that suggested that was the case

73
0:03:15.934,000 --> 0:03:17,000
was completely fraudulent.

74
0:03:18.809,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet,

75
0:03:21.985,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in which it was published,

76
0:03:23.577,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and that author, a physician,

77
0:03:25.467,000 --> 0:03:28,000
had his medical license taken away from him.

78
0:03:28.721,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause)

79
0:03:32.675,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The Institute of Medicine,

80
0:03:34.257,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The Centers for Disease Control,

81
0:03:35.82,000 --> 0:03:37,000
have repeatedly investigated this

82
0:03:38.164,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and there is no credible evidence

83
0:03:41.771,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that vaccines cause autism.

84
0:03:44.456,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Furthermore,

85
0:03:46.093,000 --> 0:03:48,000
one of the ingredients in vaccines,

86
0:03:48.562,000 --> 0:03:5,000
something called thimerosal,

87
0:03:50.614,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was thought to be what the cause of autism was.

88
0:03:53.93,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That was actually removed from vaccines

89
0:03:56.193,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in the year 1992,

90
0:03:57.918,000 --> 0:04:,000
and you can see that it really did not have an effect

91
0:04:00.962,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in what happened with the prevalence of autism.

92
0:04:03.601,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So again, there is no evidence

93
0:04:05.334,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that this is the answer.

94
0:04:07.416,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So the question remains, what does cause autism?

95
0:04:11.559,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In fact, there's probably not one single answer.

96
0:04:14.39,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Just as autism is a spectrum,

97
0:04:16.147,000 --> 0:04:18,000
there's a spectrum of etiologies,

98
0:04:18.337,000 --> 0:04:19,000
a spectrum of causes.

99
0:04:19.989,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Based on epidemiological data,

100
0:04:21.98,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we know that one of the causes,

101
0:04:23.773,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or one of the associations, I should say,

102
0:04:25.93,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is advanced paternal age,

103
0:04:28.214,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that is, increasing age of the father

104
0:04:30.151,000 --> 0:04:32,000
at the time of conception.

105
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In addition, another vulnerable

106
0:04:34.474,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and critical period in terms of development

107
0:04:37.104,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is when the mother is pregnant.

108
0:04:39.01,000 --> 0:04:41,000
During that period, while the fetal brain is developing,

109
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we know that exposure to certain agents

110
0:04:43.942,000 --> 0:04:46,000
can actually increase the risk of autism.

111
0:04:47.027,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,

112
0:04:49.962,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,

113
0:04:52.548,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we know can increase that risk of autism.

114
0:04:56.22,000 --> 0:04:58,000
In addition, there can be some infectious agents

115
0:04:58.519,000 --> 0:05:,000
that can also cause autism.

116
0:05:01.419,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And one of the things I'm going to spend

117
0:05:02.999,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a lot of time focusing on

118
0:05:05.06,000 --> 0:05:07,000
are the genes that can cause autism.

119
0:05:07.621,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I'm focusing on this not because genes

120
0:05:10.077,000 --> 0:05:12,000
are the only cause of autism,

121
0:05:12.221,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but it's a cause of autism

122
0:05:13.79,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that we can readily define

123
0:05:15.667,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and be able to better understand the biology

124
0:05:18.46,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and understand better how the brain works

125
0:05:20.729,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so that we can come up with strategies

126
0:05:22.714,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to be able to intervene.

127
0:05:25.044,000 --> 0:05:27,000
One of the genetic factors that we don't understand,

128
0:05:27.99,000 --> 0:05:3,000
however, is the difference that we see

129
0:05:31.138,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in terms of males and females.

130
0:05:33.044,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Males are affected four to one compared to females

131
0:05:36.049,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with autism,

132
0:05:37.151,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and we really don't understand what that cause is.

133
0:05:41.142,000 --> 0:05:42,000
One of the ways that we can understand

134
0:05:42.86,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that genetics is a factor

135
0:05:44.723,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is by looking at something called

136
0:05:46.06,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the concordance rate.

137
0:05:47.95,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In other words, if one sibling has autism,

138
0:05:51.138,000 --> 0:05:52,000
what's the probability

139
0:05:52.625,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that another sibling in that family will have autism?

140
0:05:55.629,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And we can look in particular

141
0:05:57.194,000 --> 0:05:59,000
at three types of siblings:

142
0:05:59.362,000 --> 0:06:,000
identical twins,

143
0:06:01.233,000 --> 0:06:03,000
twins that actually share 100 percent

144
0:06:03.452,000 --> 0:06:04,000
of their genetic information

145
0:06:05.054,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and shared the same intrauterine environment,

146
0:06:08.23,000 --> 0:06:1,000
versus fraternal twins,

147
0:06:10.475,000 --> 0:06:11,000
twins that actually share 50 percent

148
0:06:12.464,000 --> 0:06:14,000
of their genetic information,

149
0:06:14.491,000 --> 0:06:15,000
versus regular siblings,

150
0:06:15.707,000 --> 0:06:16,000
brother-sister, sister-sister,

151
0:06:17.576,000 --> 0:06:19,000
also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information,

152
0:06:20.444,000 --> 0:06:23,000
yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment.

153
0:06:23.523,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And when you look at those concordance ratios,

154
0:06:25.823,000 --> 0:06:27,000
one of the striking things that you will see

155
0:06:27.88,000 --> 0:06:29,000
is that in identical twins,

156
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that concordance rate is 77 percent.

157
0:06:33.353,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Remarkably, though,

158
0:06:34.457,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it's not 100 percent.

159
0:06:36.605,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism,

160
0:06:40.608,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but yet they account for a lot of that risk,

161
0:06:42.849,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because when you look at fraternal twins,

162
0:06:45.162,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that concordance rate is only 31 percent.

163
0:06:48.238,000 --> 0:06:49,000
On the other hand, there is a difference

164
0:06:50.149,000 --> 0:06:52,000
between those fraternal twins and the siblings,

165
0:06:53.092,000 --> 0:06:55,000
suggesting that there are common exposures

166
0:06:55.756,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for those fraternal twins

167
0:06:57.179,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that may not be shared as commonly

168
0:06:59.296,000 --> 0:07:01,000
with siblings alone.

169
0:07:01.47,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So this provides some of the data

170
0:07:03.156,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that autism is genetic.

171
0:07:04.778,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Well, how genetic is it?

172
0:07:06.742,000 --> 0:07:07,000
When we compare it to other conditions

173
0:07:08.585,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that we're familiar with,

174
0:07:10.197,000 --> 0:07:13,000
things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,

175
0:07:14.077,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in fact, genetics plays a much larger role in autism

176
0:07:18.03,000 --> 0:07:2,000
than it does in any of these other conditions.

177
0:07:20.47,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But with this, that doesn't tell us what the genes are.

178
0:07:23.812,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It doesn't even tell us in any one child,

179
0:07:26.479,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is it one gene

180
0:07:28.14,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or potentially a combination of genes?

181
0:07:30.396,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And so in fact, in some individuals with autism,

182
0:07:33.95,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it is genetic!

183
0:07:36.464,000 --> 0:07:38,000
That is, that it is one single,

184
0:07:38.694,000 --> 0:07:4,000
powerful, deterministic gene

185
0:07:40.866,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that causes the autism.

186
0:07:42.713,000 --> 0:07:43,000
However, in other individuals,

187
0:07:44.507,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it's genetic, that is,

188
0:07:46.213,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that it's actually a combination of genes

189
0:07:49.333,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in part with the developmental process

190
0:07:52.128,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that ultimately determines that risk for autism.

191
0:07:55.508,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We don't know in any one person, necessarily,

192
0:07:58.378,000 --> 0:08:,000
which of those two answers it is

193
0:08:00.471,000 --> 0:08:02,000
until we start digging deeper.

194
0:08:02.512,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So the question becomes,

195
0:08:03.799,000 --> 0:08:05,000
how can we start to identify

196
0:08:06.04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
what exactly those genes are.

197
0:08:07.912,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And let me pose something

198
0:08:09.021,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that might not be intuitive.

199
0:08:11.211,000 --> 0:08:13,000
In certain individuals,

200
0:08:13.57,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they can have autism

201
0:08:15.294,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for a reason that is genetic

202
0:08:17.747,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but yet not because of autism running in the family.

203
0:08:21.311,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the reason is because in certain individuals,

204
0:08:23.69,000 --> 0:08:26,000
they can actually have genetic changes or mutations

205
0:08:26.751,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that are not passed down from the mother

206
0:08:29.794,000 --> 0:08:3,000
or from the father,

207
0:08:31.281,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but actually start brand new in them,

208
0:08:34.014,000 --> 0:08:35,000
mutations that are present

209
0:08:35.601,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in the egg or the sperm

210
0:08:37.004,000 --> 0:08:38,000
at the time of conception

211
0:08:38.617,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but have not been passed down

212
0:08:40.359,000 --> 0:08:43,000
generation through generation within the family.

213
0:08:43.365,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And we can actually use that strategy

214
0:08:45.546,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to now understand and to identify

215
0:08:47.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
those genes causing autism in those individuals.

216
0:08:50.98,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So in fact, at the Simons Foundation,

217
0:08:52.99,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we took 2,600 individuals

218
0:08:55.716,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that had no family history of autism,

219
0:08:58.427,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and we took that child and their mother and father

220
0:09:01.597,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and used them to try and understand

221
0:09:04.068,000 --> 0:09:05,000
what were those genes

222
0:09:05.687,000 --> 0:09:07,000
causing autism in those cases?

223
0:09:08.005,000 --> 0:09:11,000
To do that, we actually had to comprehensively

224
0:09:11.072,000 --> 0:09:13,000
be able to look at all that genetic information

225
0:09:13.802,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and determine what those differences were

226
0:09:15.984,000 --> 0:09:18,000
between the mother, the father and the child.

227
0:09:19.685,000 --> 0:09:2,000
In doing so, I apologize,

228
0:09:21.639,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm going to use an outdated analogy

229
0:09:23.523,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,

230
0:09:26.181,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point

231
0:09:29.18,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that as we did this inventory,

232
0:09:31.538,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we needed to be able to look at

233
0:09:33.131,000 --> 0:09:35,000
massive amounts of information.

234
0:09:35.304,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Our genetic information is organized

235
0:09:37.591,000 --> 0:09:39,000
into a set of 46 volumes,

236
0:09:40.478,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and when we did that, we had to be able to account

237
0:09:42.387,000 --> 0:09:43,000
for each of those 46 volumes,

238
0:09:44.371,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because in some cases with autism,

239
0:09:46.224,000 --> 0:09:48,000
there's actually a single volume that's missing.

240
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We had to get more granular than that, though,

241
0:09:50.99,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and so we had to start opening those books,

242
0:09:53.31,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and in some cases, the genetic change

243
0:09:55.19,000 --> 0:09:56,000
was more subtle.

244
0:09:56.578,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It might have been a single paragraph that was missing,

245
0:09:59.764,000 --> 0:10:02,000
or yet, even more subtle than that,

246
0:10:03.042,000 --> 0:10:04,000
a single letter,

247
0:10:04.734,000 --> 0:10:06,000
one out of three billion letters

248
0:10:07.536,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that was changed, that was altered,

249
0:10:09.81,000 --> 0:10:1,000
yet had profound effects

250
0:10:11.407,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in terms of how the brain functions

251
0:10:13.32,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and affects behavior.

252
0:10:15.137,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In doing this within these families,

253
0:10:17.514,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we were able to account for approximately

254
0:10:19.832,000 --> 0:10:21,000
25 percent of the individuals

255
0:10:22.157,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and determine that there was a single

256
0:10:24.704,000 --> 0:10:26,000
powerful genetic factor

257
0:10:26.9,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that caused autism within those families.

258
0:10:30.024,000 --> 0:10:32,000
On the other hand, there's 75 percent

259
0:10:32.276,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that we still haven't figured out.

260
0:10:34.727,000 --> 0:10:35,000
As we did this, though,

261
0:10:36.197,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it was really quite humbling,

262
0:10:38.291,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because we realized that there was not simply

263
0:10:40.656,000 --> 0:10:41,000
one gene for autism.

264
0:10:42.597,000 --> 0:10:43,000
In fact, the current estimates are

265
0:10:44.346,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that there are 200 to 400 different genes

266
0:10:47.098,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that can cause autism.

267
0:10:48.99,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And that explains, in part,

268
0:10:50.359,000 --> 0:10:52,000
why we see such a broad spectrum

269
0:10:52.476,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in terms of its effects.

270
0:10:54.519,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Although there are that many genes,

271
0:10:56.744,000 --> 0:10:58,000
there is some method to the madness.

272
0:10:59.092,000 --> 0:11:,000
It's not simply random

273
0:11:01.04,000 --> 0:11:03,000
200, 400 different genes,

274
0:11:03.27,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but in fact they fit together.

275
0:11:05.064,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They fit together in a pathway.

276
0:11:06.93,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They fit together in a network

277
0:11:08.402,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that's starting to make sense now

278
0:11:10.234,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in terms of how the brain functions.

279
0:11:12.932,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We're starting to have a bottom-up approach

280
0:11:15.078,000 --> 0:11:16,000
where we're identifying those genes,

281
0:11:16.787,000 --> 0:11:18,000
those proteins, those molecules,

282
0:11:19.265,000 --> 0:11:2,000
understanding how they interact together

283
0:11:21.175,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to make that neuron work,

284
0:11:22.572,000 --> 0:11:24,000
understanding how those neurons interact together

285
0:11:25.309,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to make circuits work,

286
0:11:26.528,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and understand how those circuits work

287
0:11:28.544,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to now control behavior,

288
0:11:30.37,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and understand that both in individuals with autism

289
0:11:33.17,000 --> 0:11:36,000
as well as individuals who have normal cognition.

290
0:11:37.071,000 --> 0:11:39,000
But early diagnosis is a key for us.

291
0:11:39.529,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Being able to make that diagnosis

292
0:11:41.488,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of someone who's susceptible

293
0:11:42.995,000 --> 0:11:44,000
at a time in a window

294
0:11:45.05,000 --> 0:11:47,000
where we have the ability to transform,

295
0:11:47.397,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to be able to impact

296
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that growing, developing brain is critical.

297
0:11:51.74,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods

298
0:11:55.549,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to be able to take infants, small babies,

299
0:11:58.117,000 --> 0:12:,000
and be able to use biomarkers,

300
0:12:00.65,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in this case eye contact and eye tracking,

301
0:12:03.988,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to identify an infant at risk.

302
0:12:06.074,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This particular infant, you can see,

303
0:12:08.239,000 --> 0:12:1,000
making very good eye contact with this woman

304
0:12:10.44,000 --> 0:12:12,000
as she's singing "Itsy, Bitsy Spider,"

305
0:12:12.8,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in fact is not going to develop autism.

306
0:12:15.84,000 --> 0:12:17,000
This baby we know is going to be in the clear.

307
0:12:18.72,000 --> 0:12:2,000
On the other hand, this other baby

308
0:12:21.08,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is going to go on to develop autism.

309
0:12:23.415,000 --> 0:12:25,000
In this particular child, you can see,

310
0:12:25.642,000 --> 0:12:27,000
it's not making good eye contact.

311
0:12:27.843,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Instead of the eyes focusing in

312
0:12:29.81,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and having that social connection,

313
0:12:32.088,000 --> 0:12:34,000
looking at the mouth, looking at the nose,

314
0:12:34.726,000 --> 0:12:35,000
looking off in another direction,

315
0:12:36.509,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but not again socially connecting,

316
0:12:39.422,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and being able to do this on a very large scale,

317
0:12:42.135,000 --> 0:12:45,000
screen infants, screen children for autism,

318
0:12:45.135,000 --> 0:12:47,000
through something very robust, very reliable,

319
0:12:48.059,000 --> 0:12:5,000
is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being

320
0:12:50.775,000 --> 0:12:52,000
able to intervene at an early stage

321
0:12:52.869,000 --> 0:12:55,000
when we can have the greatest impact.

322
0:12:56.301,000 --> 0:12:58,000
How are we going to intervene?

323
0:12:58.547,000 --> 0:13:,000
It's probably going to be a combination of factors.

324
0:13:01.377,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In part, in some individuals,

325
0:13:03.416,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we're going to try and use medications.

326
0:13:05.295,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And so in fact, identifying the genes for autism

327
0:13:08.017,000 --> 0:13:09,000
is important for us

328
0:13:09.543,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to identify drug targets,

329
0:13:11.409,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to identify things that we might be able to impact

330
0:13:14.032,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and can be certain that that's really

331
0:13:15.73,000 --> 0:13:16,000
what we need to do in autism.

332
0:13:17.425,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But that's not going to be the only answer.

333
0:13:20.166,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Beyond just drugs, we're going to use educational strategies.

334
0:13:23.676,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Individuals with autism,

335
0:13:24.951,000 --> 0:13:26,000
some of them are wired a little bit differently.

336
0:13:27.248,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They learn in a different way.

337
0:13:29.107,000 --> 0:13:31,000
They absorb their surroundings in a different way,

338
0:13:31.441,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and we need to be able to educate them

339
0:13:33.66,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in a way that serves them best.

340
0:13:36.753,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Beyond that, there are a lot of individuals

341
0:13:38.671,000 --> 0:13:4,000
in this room who have great ideas

342
0:13:40.817,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in terms of new technologies we can use,

343
0:13:43.361,000 --> 0:13:46,000
everything from devices we can use to train the brain

344
0:13:46.48,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to be able to make it more efficient

345
0:13:48.029,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and to compensate for areas in which

346
0:13:49.702,000 --> 0:13:5,000
it has a little bit of trouble,

347
0:13:51.296,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to even things like Google Glass.

348
0:13:53.575,000 --> 0:13:54,000
You could imagine, for instance, Gabriel,

349
0:13:55.359,000 --> 0:13:56,000
with his social awkwardness,

350
0:13:57.18,000 --> 0:13:58,000
might be able to wear Google Glass

351
0:13:58.638,000 --> 0:13:59,000
with an earpiece in his ear,

352
0:14:00.169,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and have a coach be able to help him,

353
0:14:02.096,000 --> 0:14:04,000
be able to help think about conversations,

354
0:14:04.754,000 --> 0:14:05,000
conversation-starters,

355
0:14:06.07,000 --> 0:14:08,000
being able to even perhaps one day

356
0:14:08.181,000 --> 0:14:1,000
invite a girl out on a date.

357
0:14:10.549,000 --> 0:14:12,000
All of these new technologies

358
0:14:12.761,000 --> 0:14:14,000
just offer tremendous opportunities

359
0:14:14.767,000 --> 0:14:15,000
for us to be able to impact

360
0:14:16.672,000 --> 0:14:18,000
the individuals with autism,

361
0:14:19.357,000 --> 0:14:21,000
but yet we have a long way to go.

362
0:14:21.893,000 --> 0:14:22,000
As much as we know,

363
0:14:23.203,000 --> 0:14:25,000
there is so much more that we don't know,

364
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and so I invite all of you

365
0:14:28.293,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to be able to help us think about

366
0:14:30.535,000 --> 0:14:31,000
how to do this better,

367
0:14:31.946,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to use as a community our collective wisdom

368
0:14:34.825,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to be able to make a difference,

369
0:14:36.631,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and in particular,

370
0:14:37.888,000 --> 0:14:39,000
for the individuals in families with autism,

371
0:14:40.592,000 --> 0:14:43,000
I invite you to join the interactive autism network,

372
0:14:43.847,000 --> 0:14:45,000
to be part of the solution to this,

373
0:14:46.041,000 --> 0:14:48,000
because it's going to take really a lot of us

374
0:14:48.92,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to think about what's important,

375
0:14:51.19,000 --> 0:14:52,000
what's going to be a meaningful difference.

376
0:14:53.115,000 --> 0:14:54,000
As we think about something

377
0:14:54.62,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that's potentially a solution,

378
0:14:56.452,000 --> 0:14:57,000
how well does it work?

379
0:14:58.111,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Is it something that's really going to make a difference

380
0:15:00.059,000 --> 0:15:02,000
in your lives, as an individual,

381
0:15:02.428,000 --> 0:15:03,000
as a family with autism?

382
0:15:04.081,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We're going to need individuals of all ages,

383
0:15:06.501,000 --> 0:15:07,000
from the young to the old,

384
0:15:08.228,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and with all different shapes and sizes

385
0:15:10.387,000 --> 0:15:11,000
of the autism spectrum disorder

386
0:15:12.224,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to make sure that we can have an impact.

387
0:15:14.4,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So I invite all of you to join the mission

388
0:15:16.605,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and to help to be able to make the lives

389
0:15:19.579,000 --> 0:15:2,000
of individuals with autism

390
0:15:21.265,000 --> 0:15:22,000
so much better and so much richer.

391
0:15:23.196,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Thank you.

392
0:15:25.921,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Applause)

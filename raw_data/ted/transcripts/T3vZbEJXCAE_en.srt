When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
is HIV positive.

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.

7
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,

9
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
He liked to sit on her lap

11
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap

13
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.

14
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.

15
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,

16
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and he asked me for slippers,

17
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because he said that his feet were cold.

18
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.

19
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Single mother, HIV positive.

20
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I photographed her before and after

21
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.

22
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan

23
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and got a call from a woman who I didn't know,

24
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away

25
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
at the age of 23.

26
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,

27
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
like so many other Zimbabwean children

28
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
who've been orphaned by the epidemic.

29
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So a few of the stories.

30
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
With every picture,

31
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
there are individuals who have full lives

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and stories that deserve to be told.

33
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.

34
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute,

35
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?

36
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.

37
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
CA: Just --

38
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production

39
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
for a fashion photographer.

40
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I was constantly reading the New York Times,

41
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.

42
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It was just frightening.

43
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So I quit my job

44
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.

45
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month --

46
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
this is in December 2000 --

47
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,

48
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and then went back again this March 2002

49
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.

50
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
CA: That's an amazing story, thank you.

51
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
KB: Thanks for letting me show these.

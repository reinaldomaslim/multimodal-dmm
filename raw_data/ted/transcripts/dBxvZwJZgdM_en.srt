1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When I was 10 years old,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And as a special treat,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
he took me to the pathology lab

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and took a real human brain

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
out of the jar

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and placed it in my hands.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And there it was,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the seat of human consciousness,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the powerhouse of the human body,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
sitting in my hands.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And that day I knew that when I grew up,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was going to become a brain doctor,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
scientist, something or the other.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Years later, when I finally grew up,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
my dream came true.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
on the neurological causes

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of dyslexia in children

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that I encountered a startling fact

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that I'd like to share with you all today.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It is estimated that one in six children,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that's one in six children,

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
suffer from some developmental disorder.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is a disorder that

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
retards mental development in the child

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and causes permanent mental impairments.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Which means that each and every one of you here today

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
knows at least one child that is suffering

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from a developmental disorder.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But here's what really perplexed me.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Despite the fact that each

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and every one of these disorders

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
originates in the brain,

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
most of these disorders

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are diagnosed solely on the basis

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of observable behavior.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But diagnosing a brain disorder

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
without actually looking at the brain

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
based on their physical symptoms,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to look at the heart.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It seemed so intuitive to me.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Looking at behavior alone

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
can miss a vital piece of the puzzle

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
picture of the child's problems.

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology,

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the diagnosis of brain disorders

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in one in six children

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
still remained so limited.

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And then I came across a team at Harvard University

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that had taken one such advanced medical technology

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and finally applied it,

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
instead of in brain research,

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Their groundbreaking technology

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
records the EEG, or the electrical activity

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of the brain, in real time,

63
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
allowing us to watch the brain

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
as it performs various functions

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then detect even the slightest abnormality

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in any of these functions:

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
vision, attention, language, audition.

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
A program called Brain Electrical

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Activity Mapping

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
then triangulates the source

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
of that abnormality in the brain.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And another program called

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Statistical Probability Mapping

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
then performs mathematical calculations

75
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to determine whether any of these abnormalities

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
are clinically significant,

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
allowing us to provide a much more accurate

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
neurological diagnosis

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of the child's symptoms.

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so I became the head of neurophysiology

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
for the clinical arm of this team,

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and we're finally able to use this technology

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
towards actually helping

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
children with brain disorders.

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of setting up this technology here in India.

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'd like to tell you about one such child,

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
whose story was also covered by ABC News.

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
came to our clinic with this diagnosis

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of very severe autism.

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Like many autistic children,

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
his mind was locked inside his body.

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
There were moments when he would

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
actually space out for seconds at a time.

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the doctors told his parents

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
he was never going to be able

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to communicate or interact socially,

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and he would probably never have too much language.

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to actually look at Justin's brain,

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the results were startling.

103
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It turned out that Justin was almost

104
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
certainly not autistic.

105
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
He was suffering from brain seizures

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that were impossible to see with the naked eye,

107
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but that were actually causing symptoms

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that mimicked those of autism.

109
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication,

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
the change in him was amazing.

111
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Within a period of 60 days,

112
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
his vocabulary went from two to three words

113
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to 300 words.

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And his communication and social interaction

115
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
were improved so dramatically

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that he was enrolled into a regular school

117
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and even became a karate super champ.

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Research shows that 50 percent of children,

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
almost 50 percent of children

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
diagnosed with autism

121
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.

122
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
These are the faces of the children

123
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that I have tested

124
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with stories just like Justin.

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
All these children

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
came to our clinic with a diagnosis

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
of autism, attention deficit disorder,

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
mental retardation, language problems.

129
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Instead, our EEG scans revealed

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
very specific problems hidden within their brains

131
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that couldn't possibly have been detected

132
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
by their behavioral assessments.

133
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So these EEG scans

134
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
enabled us to provide these children

135
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis

136
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and much more targeted treatment.

137
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
For too long now, children with developmental disorders

138
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
have suffered from misdiagnosis

139
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
while their real problems have gone undetected

140
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and left to worsen.

141
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And for too long, these children and their parents

142
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
have suffered undue frustration and desperation.

143
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience,

144
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
one in which we can finally look

145
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
directly at brain function in real time

146
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,

147
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and find the true source

148
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of so many disabilities in children.

149
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So if I could inspire

150
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
even a fraction of you in the audience today

151
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to share this pioneering diagnostic approach

152
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
with even one parent whose child

153
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
is suffering from a developmental disorder,

154
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
then perhaps one more puzzle

155
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in one more brain will be solved.

156
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
One more mind will be unlocked.

157
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed

158
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or even undiagnosed by the system

159
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
will finally realize his or her true potential

160
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
while there's still time

161
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
for his or her brain to recover.

162
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.

163
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Thank you.

164
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

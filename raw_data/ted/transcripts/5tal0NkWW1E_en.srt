Translator: Morton Bast Reviewer: Thu-Huong Ha

2
0:00:15.871,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to start on a slightly somber note.

3
0:00:19.736,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Two thousand and seven, five years ago,

4
0:00:22.707,000 --> 0:00:25,000
my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.

5
0:00:26.41,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Stage IIB.

6
0:00:29.372,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now, looking back, the most harrowing part of that experience

7
0:00:32.379,000 --> 0:00:33,000
was not just the hospital visits --

8
0:00:34.21,000 --> 0:00:36,000
these were very painful for my wife, understandably so.

9
0:00:37.451,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer

10
0:00:40.925,000 --> 0:00:41,000
at just 39 years old,

11
0:00:42.1,000 --> 0:00:44,000
absolutely no history of cancer in her family.

12
0:00:45.463,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience

13
0:00:49.684,000 --> 0:00:52,000
was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions

14
0:00:53.475,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that were being thrust upon us.

15
0:00:55.436,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Should it be a mastectomy? Should it be a lumpectomy?

16
0:00:58.579,000 --> 0:01:,000
Should it be a more aggressive form of treatment,

17
0:01:00.904,000 --> 0:01:01,000
given that it was stage IIB?

18
0:01:02.774,000 --> 0:01:03,000
With all the side effects?

19
0:01:04.073,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment?

20
0:01:07.134,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And these were being thrust upon us by the doctors.

21
0:01:11.665,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now you could ask this question,

22
0:01:13.306,000 --> 0:01:14,000
why were the doctors doing this?

23
0:01:14.868,000 --> 0:01:15,000
A simplistic answer would be,

24
0:01:16.351,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the doctors are doing this

25
0:01:17.632,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because they want to protect themselves legally.

26
0:01:21.153,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I think that is too simplistic.

27
0:01:22.86,000 --> 0:01:23,000
These are well-meaning doctors,

28
0:01:24.4,000 --> 0:01:26,000
some of them have gone on to become very good friends.

29
0:01:27.059,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They probably were simply following the wisdom

30
0:01:29.236,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that has come down through the ages,

31
0:01:31.013,000 --> 0:01:33,000
this adage that when you're making decisions,

32
0:01:33.152,000 --> 0:01:34,000
especially decisions of importance,

33
0:01:34.858,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it's best to be in charge, it's best to be in control,

34
0:01:37.425,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's best to be in the driver's seat.

35
0:01:40.375,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And we were certainly in the driver's seat,

36
0:01:42.501,000 --> 0:01:43,000
making all these decisions.

37
0:01:43.835,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And let me tell you -- if some of you have been there,

38
0:01:46.453,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience.

39
0:01:49.937,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Which got me thinking.

40
0:01:51.115,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I said, is there any validity to this whole adage

41
0:01:54.424,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that when you're making decisions,

42
0:01:56.512,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it's best to take the driver's seat,

43
0:01:58.633,000 --> 0:01:59,000
be in charge, be in control?

44
0:02:00.039,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Or are there contexts where we're far better off

45
0:02:03.851,000 --> 0:02:04,000
taking the passenger's seat

46
0:02:05.357,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and have someone else drive?

47
0:02:06.731,000 --> 0:02:07,000
For example, a trusted financial advisor,

48
0:02:08.737,000 --> 0:02:09,000
could be a trusted doctor, etc.

49
0:02:11.483,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And since I study human decision making,

50
0:02:14.1,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I said, I'm going to run some studies

51
0:02:16.577,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to find some answers.

52
0:02:18.057,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I'm going to share one of these studies with you today.

53
0:02:21.49,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So, imagine that all of you are participants in the study.

54
0:02:25.395,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I want to tell you that what you're going to do in the study is,

55
0:02:28.663,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you're going to drink a cup of tea.

56
0:02:31.176,000 --> 0:02:34,000
If you're wondering why, I'll tell you why in a few seconds from now.

57
0:02:34.653,000 --> 0:02:36,000
You are going to solve a series of puzzles,

58
0:02:37.002,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily.

59
0:02:41.462,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And the more puzzles you solve,

60
0:02:42.984,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the greater the chances that you'll win some prizes.

61
0:02:46.427,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, why do you have to consume the tea?

62
0:02:48.369,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Why? Because it makes a lot of sense:

63
0:02:50.212,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In order to solve these puzzles effectively, if you think about it,

64
0:02:53.45,000 --> 0:02:56,000
your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously, right?

65
0:02:57.221,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It needs to be alert,

66
0:02:59.392,000 --> 0:03:,000
for which caffeine is very good.

67
0:03:02.083,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Simultaneously, it needs to be calm --

68
0:03:04.807,000 --> 0:03:05,000
not agitated, calm --

69
0:03:06.554,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for which chamomile is very good.

70
0:03:10.675,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now comes the between-subjects design,

71
0:03:13.456,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the AB design, the AB testing.

72
0:03:15.291,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So what I'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups.

73
0:03:19.012,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So imagine that there is an imaginary line out here,

74
0:03:21.633,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so everyone here will be group A,

75
0:03:24.841,000 --> 0:03:25,000
everyone out here will be group B.

76
0:03:27.687,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, for you folks, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas,

77
0:03:32.399,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea.

78
0:03:35.615,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So you can choose whichever tea you want.

79
0:03:37.607,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You can decide, what is your mental state:

80
0:03:39.781,000 --> 0:03:4,000
OK, I choose the caffeinated tea,

81
0:03:41.417,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I choose the chamomile tea.

82
0:03:42.732,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So you're going to be in charge, you're going to be in control,

83
0:03:45.742,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you're going to be in the driver's seat.

84
0:03:48.128,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You folks, I'm going to show you these two teas,

85
0:03:51.305,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but you don't have a choice.

86
0:03:53.401,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I'm going to give you one of these two teas,

87
0:03:55.484,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and keep in mind, I'm going to pick one of these two teas

88
0:03:58.206,000 --> 0:03:59,000
at random for you.

89
0:03:59.625,000 --> 0:04:,000
And you know that.

90
0:04:01.475,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So if you think about it, this is an extreme-case scenario,

91
0:04:04.297,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because in the real world,

92
0:04:05.607,000 --> 0:04:06,000
whenever you are taking passenger's seat,

93
0:04:07.628,000 --> 0:04:09,000
very often the driver is going to be someone you trust,

94
0:04:10.248,000 --> 0:04:11,000
an expert, etc.

95
0:04:11.495,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So this is an extreme-case scenario.

96
0:04:14.319,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, you're all going to consume the tea.

97
0:04:19.28,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So imagine that you're taking the tea now,

98
0:04:21.343,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we'll wait for you to finish the tea.

99
0:04:23.147,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects.

100
0:04:27.027,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now you're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles.

101
0:04:32.588,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Here's an example of the puzzle you're going to solve.

102
0:04:35.905,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Anyone in the audience want to take a stab?

103
0:04:38.022,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Audience member: Pulpit! Baba Shiv: Whoa! OK.

104
0:04:40.207,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's cool.

105
0:04:41.381,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Yeah, so what we'd do if we had you who gave the answer

106
0:04:44.409,000 --> 0:04:45,000
as a participant,

107
0:04:45.712,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we would have calibrated the difficulty level

108
0:04:47.894,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of the puzzles to your expertise.

109
0:04:50.001,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Because we want these puzzles to be difficult.

110
0:04:52.35,000 --> 0:04:53,000
These are tricky puzzles,

111
0:04:53.589,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because your first instinct is to say "tulip."

112
0:04:56.7,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And then you have to unstick yourself.

113
0:04:59.22,000 --> 0:05:,000
Right?

114
0:05:00.395,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So these have been calibrated to your level of expertise,

115
0:05:03.134,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because we want this to be difficult,

116
0:05:05.015,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I'll tell you why, momentarily.

117
0:05:07.209,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, here's another example.

118
0:05:09.789,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Anyone? This is much more difficult.

119
0:05:11.55,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Audience member: Embark. BS: Yeah. Wow! OK.

120
0:05:13.59,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.

121
0:05:15.489,000 --> 0:05:17,000
You'll say "kamber," then you'll go, "maker," and all that,

122
0:05:18.346,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and then you can unstick yourself.

123
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles.

124
0:05:24.096,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now, the question we're asking here is, in terms of the outcome --

125
0:05:28.181,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it comes in the number of puzzles solved --

126
0:05:30.8,000 --> 0:05:34,000
will you in the driver's seat end up solving more puzzles

127
0:05:35.024,000 --> 0:05:36,000
because you are in control,

128
0:05:36.351,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you could decide which tea you would choose,

129
0:05:38.533,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or would you be better off,

130
0:05:40.064,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in terms of the number of puzzles solved?

131
0:05:42.611,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And, systemically, what we will show,

132
0:05:45.664,000 --> 0:05:46,000
across a series of studies,

133
0:05:47.242,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is that you, the passengers,

134
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:52,000
even though the tea was picked for you at random,

135
0:05:53.133,000 --> 0:05:55,000
will end up solving more puzzles than you, the drivers.

136
0:05:57.385,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We also observe another thing,

137
0:05:59.776,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and that is, you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles,

138
0:06:02.558,000 --> 0:06:05,000
you're also putting less juice into the task -- less effort,

139
0:06:06.399,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you're less persistent, and so on.

140
0:06:08.089,000 --> 0:06:09,000
How do we know that?

141
0:06:09.264,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Well, we have two objective measures.

142
0:06:11.583,000 --> 0:06:14,000
One is, what is the time, on average, you're taking

143
0:06:14.755,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in attempting to solve these puzzles?

144
0:06:17.226,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You will spend less time compared to you.

145
0:06:20.031,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Second, you have 30 minutes to solve these;

146
0:06:22.071,000 --> 0:06:23,000
are you taking the entire 30 minutes

147
0:06:23.833,000 --> 0:06:25,000
or are you giving up before the 30 minutes elapse?

148
0:06:26.246,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You will be more likely to give up before the 30 minutes elapse,

149
0:06:30.181,000 --> 0:06:31,000
compared to you.

150
0:06:31.36,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So you're putting in less juice,

151
0:06:33.016,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and therefore, the outcome: fewer puzzles solved.

152
0:06:36.991,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That brings us now to: why does this happen?

153
0:06:41.05,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And under what situations -- when -- would we see this pattern of results

154
0:06:45.673,000 --> 0:06:48,000
where the passenger is going to show better, more favorable outcomes,

155
0:06:49.388,000 --> 0:06:5,000
compared to the driver?

156
0:06:52.027,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA.

157
0:06:57.618,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting

158
0:07:01.545,000 --> 0:07:02,000
after you made the decision.

159
0:07:03.491,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So if you think about it, in this particular puzzle task --

160
0:07:06.347,000 --> 0:07:08,000
it could happen in investing in the stock market,

161
0:07:08.695,000 --> 0:07:09,000
very volatile out there,

162
0:07:09.873,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it could be the medical situation --

163
0:07:11.699,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the feedback here is immediate.

164
0:07:13.366,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You know the feedback, whether you're solving the puzzles or not.

165
0:07:16.671,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Right? Second, it is negative.

166
0:07:19.306,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Remember, the deck was stacked against you,

167
0:07:21.898,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles.

168
0:07:24.714,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And this can happen in the medical domain.

169
0:07:26.752,000 --> 0:07:28,000
For example, very early on in the treatment,

170
0:07:28.878,000 --> 0:07:31,000
things are negative, the feedback, before things become positive.

171
0:07:31.966,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Right? It can happen in the stock market.

172
0:07:34.012,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Volatile stock market, getting negative feedback, it is also immediate.

173
0:07:37.392,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the feedback in all these cases is concrete, it's unambiguous;

174
0:07:41.064,000 --> 0:07:43,000
you know if you've solved the puzzles or not.

175
0:07:43.593,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, the added one,

176
0:07:45.25,000 --> 0:07:5,000
apart from this immediacy, negative, this concreteness --

177
0:07:50.728,000 --> 0:07:52,000
now you have a sense of agency.

178
0:07:54.264,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You were responsible for your decision.

179
0:07:57.234,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So what do you do?

180
0:07:58.71,000 --> 0:08:,000
You focus on the foregone option.

181
0:08:01.587,000 --> 0:08:02,000
You say, you know what?

182
0:08:03.263,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I should have chosen the other tea.

183
0:08:05.079,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:08.682,000 --> 0:08:1,000
That casts your decision in doubt,

185
0:08:11.464,000 --> 0:08:13,000
reduces the confidence you have in the decision,

186
0:08:13.79,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the confidence you have in the performance,

187
0:08:16.17,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the performance in terms of solving the puzzles.

188
0:08:18.465,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And therefore less juice into the task,

189
0:08:20.543,000 --> 0:08:21,000
fewer puzzles solved

190
0:08:22.32,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and less favorable outcomes compared to you folks.

191
0:08:25.572,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And this can happen in the medical domain, if you think about it, right?

192
0:08:29.019,000 --> 0:08:31,000
A patient in the driver's seat, for example.

193
0:08:31.162,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Less juice, which means keeping herself or himself

194
0:08:33.537,000 --> 0:08:36,000
less physically fit, physically active to hasten the recovery process,

195
0:08:37.085,000 --> 0:08:38,000
which is what is often advocated.

196
0:08:38.704,000 --> 0:08:39,000
You probably wouldn't do that.

197
0:08:40.916,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And therefore, there are times when you're facing the INCA,

198
0:08:46.84,000 --> 0:08:49,000
when the feedback is going to be immediate, negative, concrete

199
0:08:50.781,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and you have the sense of agency,

200
0:08:52.401,000 --> 0:08:55,000
where you're far better off taking the passenger's seat

201
0:08:55.88,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and have someone else drive.

202
0:08:58.864,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Now, I started off on a somber note.

203
0:09:02.088,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note.

204
0:09:04.151,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It has now been five years, slightly more than five years,

205
0:09:07.285,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and the good news, thank God, is that the cancer is still in remission.

206
0:09:13.878,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So it all ends well.

207
0:09:16.23,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment,

208
0:09:22.419,000 --> 0:09:25,000
my wife and I decided that we would take the passenger's seat.

209
0:09:26.331,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And that made so much of a difference

210
0:09:28.35,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in terms of the peace of mind that came with that;

211
0:09:31.149,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we could focus on her recovery.

212
0:09:33.035,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We let the doctors make all the decisions

213
0:09:35.99,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and take the driver's seat.

214
0:09:38.196,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Thank you.

215
0:09:39.372,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Applause)

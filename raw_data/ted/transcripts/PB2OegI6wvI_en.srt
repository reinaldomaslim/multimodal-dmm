1
0:00:12.509,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on

2
0:00:16.841,000 --> 0:00:19,000
involving a man named Steve Titus.

3
0:00:20.404,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Titus was a restaurant manager.

4
0:00:23.433,000 --> 0:00:27,000
He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,

5
0:00:27.523,000 --> 0:00:28,000
he was engaged to Gretchen,

6
0:00:29.418,000 --> 0:00:31,000
about to be married, she was the love of his life.

7
0:00:32.366,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And one night, the couple went out

8
0:00:34.65,000 --> 0:00:37,000
for a romantic restaurant meal.

9
0:00:37.655,000 --> 0:00:38,000
They were on their way home,

10
0:00:39.303,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and they were pulled over by a police officer.

11
0:00:42.253,000 --> 0:00:45,000
You see, Titus' car sort of resembled

12
0:00:45.57,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a car that was driven earlier in the evening

13
0:00:49.457,000 --> 0:00:52,000
by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,

14
0:00:52.863,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.

15
0:00:56.457,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So the police took a picture of Titus,

16
0:00:59.035,000 --> 0:01:01,000
they put it in a photo lineup,

17
0:01:01.802,000 --> 0:01:03,000
they later showed it to the victim,

18
0:01:03.962,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and she pointed to Titus' photo.

19
0:01:06.122,000 --> 0:01:09,000
She said, "That one's the closest."

20
0:01:09.743,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,

21
0:01:13.631,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,

22
0:01:16.972,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the rape victim got on the stand

23
0:01:19.068,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man."

24
0:01:23.41,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And Titus was convicted.

25
0:01:26.336,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He proclaimed his innocence,

26
0:01:28.31,000 --> 0:01:3,000
his family screamed at the jury,

27
0:01:30.892,000 --> 0:01:32,000
his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,

28
0:01:33.763,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and Titus is taken away to jail.

29
0:01:37.158,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So what would you do at this point?

30
0:01:40.616,000 --> 0:01:41,000
What would you do?

31
0:01:42.252,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,

32
0:01:46.02,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and yet he got an idea.

33
0:01:48.052,000 --> 0:01:5,000
He called up the local newspaper,

34
0:01:50.483,000 --> 0:01:53,000
he got the interest of an investigative journalist,

35
0:01:53.87,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and that journalist actually found the real rapist,

36
0:01:58.606,000 --> 0:02:01,000
a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,

37
0:02:01.959,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes

38
0:02:05.251,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in that area,

39
0:02:06.583,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and when this information was given to the judge,

40
0:02:09.757,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the judge set Titus free.

41
0:02:12.693,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And really, that's where this case should have ended.

42
0:02:16.724,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It should have been over.

43
0:02:17.847,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,

44
0:02:20.367,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a year of accusation and trial, but over.

45
0:02:24.203,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It didn't end that way.

46
0:02:26.25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Titus was so bitter.

47
0:02:28.928,000 --> 0:02:3,000
He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.

48
0:02:31.508,000 --> 0:02:32,000
He lost his fiancée.

49
0:02:33.351,000 --> 0:02:35,000
She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.

50
0:02:36.257,000 --> 0:02:38,000
He lost his entire savings,

51
0:02:38.403,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and so he decided to file a lawsuit

52
0:02:41.261,000 --> 0:02:43,000
against the police and others whom he felt

53
0:02:43.542,000 --> 0:02:45,000
were responsible for his suffering.

54
0:02:45.861,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And that's when I really started working on this case,

55
0:02:50.574,000 --> 0:02:51,000
trying to figure out

56
0:02:52.535,000 --> 0:02:54,000
how did that victim go from

57
0:02:54.609,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"That one's the closest"

58
0:02:56.137,000 --> 0:03:,000
to "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."

59
0:03:00.887,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.

60
0:03:04.166,000 --> 0:03:07,000
He spent every waking moment thinking about it,

61
0:03:07.2,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and just days before he was to have his day in court,

62
0:03:11.351,000 --> 0:03:13,000
he woke up in the morning,

63
0:03:13.57,000 --> 0:03:14,000
doubled over in pain,

64
0:03:15.378,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and died of a stress-related heart attack.

65
0:03:18.072,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He was 35 years old.

66
0:03:21.259,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So I was asked to work on Titus' case

67
0:03:26.069,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because I'm a psychological scientist.

68
0:03:28.584,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.

69
0:03:32.411,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And if I meet somebody on an airplane --

70
0:03:35.8,000 --> 0:03:37,000
this happened on the way over to Scotland --

71
0:03:37.896,000 --> 0:03:38,000
if I meet somebody on an airplane,

72
0:03:39.726,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?"

73
0:03:42.771,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and I say "I study memory,"

74
0:03:44.222,000 --> 0:03:47,000
they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,

75
0:03:47.602,000 --> 0:03:49,000
or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's

76
0:03:50.416,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or some kind of memory problem,

77
0:03:52.481,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but I have to tell them

78
0:03:54.697,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I don't study when people forget.

79
0:03:58.202,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I study the opposite: when they remember,

80
0:04:01.204,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when they remember things that didn't happen

81
0:04:03.957,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or remember things that were different

82
0:04:05.922,000 --> 0:04:07,000
from the way they really were.

83
0:04:07.947,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I study false memories.

84
0:04:12.683,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Unhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person

85
0:04:16.99,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to be convicted based on somebody's false memory.

86
0:04:21.295,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In one project in the United States,

87
0:04:24.603,000 --> 0:04:26,000
information has been gathered

88
0:04:26.855,000 --> 0:04:29,000
on 300 innocent people,

89
0:04:30.789,000 --> 0:04:33,000
300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.

90
0:04:34.684,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,

91
0:04:39.984,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and now DNA testing has proven

92
0:04:42.411,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that they are actually innocent.

93
0:04:45.327,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And when those cases have been analyzed,

94
0:04:47.848,000 --> 0:04:49,000
three quarters of them

95
0:04:49.989,000 --> 0:04:54,000
are due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.

96
0:04:55.6,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Well, why?

97
0:04:56.863,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people

98
0:05:00.314,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the jurors who convicted Titus,

99
0:05:02.598,000 --> 0:05:04,000
many people believe that memory

100
0:05:04.839,000 --> 0:05:05,000
works like a recording device.

101
0:05:06.486,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You just record the information,

102
0:05:08.743,000 --> 0:05:1,000
then you call it up and play it back

103
0:05:11.39,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when you want to answer questions or identify images.

104
0:05:14.817,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But decades of work in psychology

105
0:05:16.98,000 --> 0:05:19,000
has shown that this just isn't true.

106
0:05:20.133,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Our memories are constructive.

107
0:05:22.563,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They're reconstructive.

108
0:05:24.132,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:

109
0:05:27.613,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.

110
0:05:32.726,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I first started studying this constructive memory process

111
0:05:37.975,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in the 1970s.

112
0:05:40.39,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I did my experiments that involved showing people

113
0:05:44.813,000 --> 0:05:46,000
simulated crimes and accidents

114
0:05:47.318,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and asking them questions about what they remember.

115
0:05:50.836,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In one study, we showed people a simulated accident

116
0:05:54.775,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and we asked people,

117
0:05:56.053,000 --> 0:05:58,000
how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?

118
0:05:58.917,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And we asked other people,

119
0:06:00.551,000 --> 0:06:03,000
how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?

120
0:06:04.24,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And if we asked the leading "smashed" question,

121
0:06:07.242,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the witnesses told us the cars were going faster,

122
0:06:10.527,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and moreover, that leading "smashed" question

123
0:06:14.524,000 --> 0:06:16,000
caused people to be more likely to tell us

124
0:06:17.384,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that they saw broken glass in the accident scene

125
0:06:20.451,000 --> 0:06:23,000
when there wasn't any broken glass at all.

126
0:06:24.23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In another study, we showed a simulated accident

127
0:06:27.119,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,

128
0:06:30.779,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,

129
0:06:35.711,000 --> 0:06:38,000
many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign

130
0:06:39.56,000 --> 0:06:42,000
at the intersection, not a stop sign.

131
0:06:43.017,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And you might be thinking, well, you know,

132
0:06:45.206,000 --> 0:06:46,000
these are filmed events,

133
0:06:46.529,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they are not particularly stressful.

134
0:06:48.457,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Would the same kind of mistakes be made

135
0:06:51.191,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with a really stressful event?

136
0:06:54.142,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In a study we published just a few months ago,

137
0:06:57.233,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we have an answer to this question,

138
0:06:59.537,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because what was unusual about this study

139
0:07:02.301,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.

140
0:07:07.933,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The subjects in this study

141
0:07:10.162,000 --> 0:07:12,000
were members of the U.S. military

142
0:07:12.672,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise

143
0:07:17.097,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to teach them what it's going to be like for them

144
0:07:19.879,000 --> 0:07:22,000
if they are ever captured as prisoners of war.

145
0:07:23.797,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And as part of this training exercise,

146
0:07:26.227,000 --> 0:07:29,000
these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,

147
0:07:29.756,000 --> 0:07:34,000
hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes

148
0:07:34.842,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and later on they have to try to identify

149
0:07:37.659,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the person who conducted that interrogation.

150
0:07:40.682,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And when we feed them suggestive information

151
0:07:44.505,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that insinuates it's a different person,

152
0:07:47.283,000 --> 0:07:51,000
many of them misidentify their interrogator,

153
0:07:51.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely

154
0:07:55.155,000 --> 0:07:58,000
resemble the real interrogator.

155
0:07:58.259,000 --> 0:08:,000
And so what these studies are showing

156
0:08:00.56,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is that when you feed people misinformation

157
0:08:04.42,000 --> 0:08:07,000
about some experience that they may have had,

158
0:08:07.8,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.

159
0:08:13.455,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Well out there in the real world,

160
0:08:15.655,000 --> 0:08:17,000
misinformation is everywhere.

161
0:08:18.546,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We get misinformation

162
0:08:19.906,000 --> 0:08:21,000
not only if we're questioned in a leading way,

163
0:08:22.822,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but if we talk to other witnesses

164
0:08:25.269,000 --> 0:08:28,000
who might consciously or inadvertently feed us

165
0:08:28.302,000 --> 0:08:3,000
some erroneous information,

166
0:08:30.439,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,

167
0:08:35.169,000 --> 0:08:37,000
all of these provide the opportunity

168
0:08:37.962,000 --> 0:08:41,000
for this kind of contamination of our memory.

169
0:08:42.312,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In the 1990s, we began to see

170
0:08:46.1,000 --> 0:08:5,000
an even more extreme kind of memory problem.

171
0:08:50.783,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --

172
0:08:53.879,000 --> 0:08:55,000
maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --

173
0:08:56.793,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and they were coming out of therapy

174
0:08:59.546,000 --> 0:09:01,000
with a different problem.

175
0:09:02.207,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,

176
0:09:05.908,000 --> 0:09:06,000
sometimes in satanic rituals,

177
0:09:07.891,000 --> 0:09:11,000
sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.

178
0:09:12.588,000 --> 0:09:14,000
One woman came out of psychotherapy

179
0:09:15.142,000 --> 0:09:17,000
believing that she'd endured years

180
0:09:17.57,000 --> 0:09:2,000
of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy

181
0:09:21.472,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and that the baby was cut from her belly.

182
0:09:24.038,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But there were no physical scars

183
0:09:26.397,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or any kind of physical evidence

184
0:09:28.423,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that could have supported her story.

185
0:09:31.304,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And when I began looking into these cases,

186
0:09:34.312,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I was wondering,

187
0:09:35.762,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where do these bizarre memories come from?

188
0:09:38.09,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And what I found is that most of these situations

189
0:09:42.477,000 --> 0:09:47,000
involved some particular form of psychotherapy.

190
0:09:47.968,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And so I asked,

191
0:09:49.567,000 --> 0:09:52,000
were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --

192
0:09:52.955,000 --> 0:09:54,000
like the imagination exercises

193
0:09:55.839,000 --> 0:09:57,000
or dream interpretation,

194
0:09:57.896,000 --> 0:09:59,000
or in some cases hypnosis,

195
0:10:00.028,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or in some cases exposure to false information --

196
0:10:03.846,000 --> 0:10:05,000
were these leading these patients

197
0:10:06.633,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to develop these very bizarre,

198
0:10:09.31,000 --> 0:10:11,000
unlikely memories?

199
0:10:12.241,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And I designed some experiments

200
0:10:14.4,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to try to study the processes that were being used

201
0:10:19.425,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in this psychotherapy so I could study

202
0:10:22.498,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the development of these very rich false memories.

203
0:10:26.049,000 --> 0:10:28,000
In one of the first studies we did,

204
0:10:28.457,000 --> 0:10:3,000
we used suggestion,

205
0:10:30.81,000 --> 0:10:34,000
a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,

206
0:10:34.873,000 --> 0:10:36,000
we used this kind of suggestion

207
0:10:36.983,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and planted a false memory

208
0:10:38.835,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that when you were a kid, five or six years old,

209
0:10:41.912,000 --> 0:10:43,000
you were lost in a shopping mall.

210
0:10:44.163,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You were frightened. You were crying.

211
0:10:46.663,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person

212
0:10:49.177,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and reunited with the family.

213
0:10:51.029,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And we succeeded in planting this memory

214
0:10:53.637,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.

215
0:10:57.743,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And you might be thinking, well,

216
0:10:59.748,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that's not particularly stressful.

217
0:11:02.094,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But we and other investigators have planted

218
0:11:05.463,000 --> 0:11:07,000
rich false memories of things that were

219
0:11:08.221,000 --> 0:11:1,000
much more unusual and much more stressful.

220
0:11:11.136,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So in a study done in Tennessee,

221
0:11:13.675,000 --> 0:11:15,000
researchers planted the false memory

222
0:11:16.091,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned

223
0:11:18.665,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and had to be rescued by a life guard.

224
0:11:21.172,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And in a study done in Canada,

225
0:11:23.475,000 --> 0:11:25,000
researchers planted the false memory

226
0:11:25.999,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that when you were a kid,

227
0:11:27.227,000 --> 0:11:3,000
something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal

228
0:11:30.957,000 --> 0:11:31,000
happened to you,

229
0:11:32.339,000 --> 0:11:35,000
succeeding with about half of their subjects.

230
0:11:35.761,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And in a study done in Italy,

231
0:11:38.113,000 --> 0:11:4,000
researchers planted the false memory,

232
0:11:40.771,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.

233
0:11:45.983,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I do want to add that it might seem

234
0:11:48.19,000 --> 0:11:51,000
like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects

235
0:11:51.929,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in the name of science,

236
0:11:53.529,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation

237
0:11:58.167,000 --> 0:11:59,000
by research ethics boards

238
0:12:00.142,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that have made the decision

239
0:12:02.484,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that the temporary discomfort that some

240
0:12:05.557,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of these subjects might experience in these studies

241
0:12:08.641,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is outweighed by the importance of this problem

242
0:12:12.541,000 --> 0:12:15,000
for understanding memory processes

243
0:12:15.648,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and the abuse of memory that is going on

244
0:12:18.994,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in some places in the world.

245
0:12:22.287,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Well, to my surprise,

246
0:12:25.325,000 --> 0:12:28,000
when I published this work and began to speak out

247
0:12:28.754,000 --> 0:12:31,000
against this particular brand of psychotherapy,

248
0:12:32.649,000 --> 0:12:35,000
it created some pretty bad problems for me:

249
0:12:36.629,000 --> 0:12:4,000
hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,

250
0:12:41.53,000 --> 0:12:42,000
who felt under attack,

251
0:12:43.206,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and by the patients whom they had influenced.

252
0:12:46.734,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I had sometimes armed guards at speeches

253
0:12:49.671,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that I was invited to give,

254
0:12:51.576,000 --> 0:12:55,000
people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.

255
0:12:55.793,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But probably the worst

256
0:12:57.774,000 --> 0:12:59,000
was I suspected that a woman

257
0:13:00.541,000 --> 0:13:02,000
was innocent of abuse

258
0:13:02.965,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that was being claimed by her grown daughter.

259
0:13:05.801,000 --> 0:13:08,000
She accused her mother of sexual abuse

260
0:13:09.218,000 --> 0:13:1,000
based on a repressed memory.

261
0:13:11.077,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story

262
0:13:13.96,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to be filmed and presented in public places.

263
0:13:17.394,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I was suspicious of this story,

264
0:13:19.903,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and so I started to investigate,

265
0:13:22.203,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and eventually found information that convinced me

266
0:13:26.686,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that this mother was innocent.

267
0:13:28.975,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I published an exposé on the case,

268
0:13:31.936,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and a little while later, the accusing daughter

269
0:13:35.38,000 --> 0:13:36,000
filed a lawsuit.

270
0:13:36.901,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Even though I'd never mentioned her name,

271
0:13:39.256,000 --> 0:13:43,000
she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.

272
0:13:43.618,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And I went through nearly five years

273
0:13:46.341,000 --> 0:13:52,000
of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,

274
0:13:52.893,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but finally, finally, it was over and I could really

275
0:13:56.567,000 --> 0:13:58,000
get back to my work.

276
0:13:58.991,000 --> 0:14:,000
In the process, however, I became part

277
0:14:01.476,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of a disturbing trend in America

278
0:14:04.13,000 --> 0:14:06,000
where scientists are being sued

279
0:14:06.237,000 --> 0:14:1,000
for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.

280
0:14:10.836,000 --> 0:14:13,000
When I got back to my work, I asked this question:

281
0:14:14.194,000 --> 0:14:16,000
if I plant a false memory in your mind,

282
0:14:16.592,000 --> 0:14:17,000
does it have repercussions?

283
0:14:18.436,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Does it affect your later thoughts,

284
0:14:20.395,000 --> 0:14:22,000
your later behaviors?

285
0:14:22.496,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Our first study planted a false memory

286
0:14:24.523,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:

287
0:14:27.849,000 --> 0:14:29,000
hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.

288
0:14:30.848,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And we found that once we planted this false memory,

289
0:14:34.038,000 --> 0:14:36,000
people didn't want to eat the foods as much

290
0:14:36.489,000 --> 0:14:38,000
at an outdoor picnic.

291
0:14:38.749,000 --> 0:14:41,000
The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.

292
0:14:42.622,000 --> 0:14:44,000
If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory

293
0:14:44.98,000 --> 0:14:47,000
involving a healthy food like asparagus,

294
0:14:48.001,000 --> 0:14:51,000
we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.

295
0:14:51.476,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And so what these studies are showing

296
0:14:53.85,000 --> 0:14:55,000
is that you can plant false memories

297
0:14:55.965,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and they have repercussions

298
0:14:57.378,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.

299
0:15:02.463,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Well, along with this ability

300
0:15:04.887,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to plant memories and control behavior

301
0:15:07.81,000 --> 0:15:11,000
obviously come some important ethical issues,

302
0:15:11.991,000 --> 0:15:14,000
like, when should we use this mind technology?

303
0:15:15.05,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And should we ever ban its use?

304
0:15:18.73,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Therapists can't ethically plant false memories

305
0:15:21.513,000 --> 0:15:22,000
in the mind of their patients

306
0:15:23.1,000 --> 0:15:25,000
even if it would help the patient,

307
0:15:25.664,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but there's nothing to stop a parent

308
0:15:27.286,000 --> 0:15:31,000
from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.

309
0:15:31.735,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And when I suggested this publicly,

310
0:15:34.34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
it created an outcry again.

311
0:15:37.686,000 --> 0:15:41,000
"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."

312
0:15:41.719,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)

313
0:15:43.964,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I mean, another way to think about this is,

314
0:15:53.461,000 --> 0:15:55,000
which would you rather have,

315
0:15:55.494,000 --> 0:15:58,000
a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,

316
0:15:58.523,000 --> 0:15:59,000
all the things that go with it,

317
0:16:00.055,000 --> 0:16:03,000
or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?

318
0:16:03.071,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.

319
0:16:06.462,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But maybe my work has made me different from most people.

320
0:16:10.439,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Most people cherish their memories,

321
0:16:12.518,000 --> 0:16:14,000
know that they represent their identity,

322
0:16:14.672,000 --> 0:16:16,000
who they are, where they came from.

323
0:16:16.697,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.

324
0:16:19.555,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But I know from my work

325
0:16:21.76,000 --> 0:16:25,000
how much fiction is already in there.

326
0:16:26.241,000 --> 0:16:28,000
If I've learned anything from these decades

327
0:16:28.973,000 --> 0:16:3,000
of working on these problems, it's this:

328
0:16:31.383,000 --> 0:16:33,000
just because somebody tells you something

329
0:16:33.594,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and they say it with confidence,

330
0:16:35.169,000 --> 0:16:37,000
just because they say it with lots of detail,

331
0:16:37.849,000 --> 0:16:39,000
just because they express emotion when they say it,

332
0:16:40.608,000 --> 0:16:43,000
it doesn't mean that it really happened.

333
0:16:43.81,000 --> 0:16:46,000
We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.

334
0:16:47.675,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We need independent corroboration.

335
0:16:51.223,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Such a discovery has made me more tolerant

336
0:16:54.313,000 --> 0:16:56,000
of the everyday memory mistakes

337
0:16:56.452,000 --> 0:16:58,000
that my friends and family members make.

338
0:16:59.366,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,

339
0:17:03.9,000 --> 0:17:06,000
the man whose whole future was snatched away

340
0:17:07.476,000 --> 0:17:09,000
by a false memory.

341
0:17:09.714,000 --> 0:17:11,000
But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,

342
0:17:12.53,000 --> 0:17:13,000
we'd do well to,

343
0:17:14.166,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that memory, like liberty,

344
0:17:18.037,000 --> 0:17:21,000
is a fragile thing.

345
0:17:21.731,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Thank you. Thank you.

346
0:17:24.669,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you. (Applause)

347
0:17:27.397,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Thanks very much. (Applause)

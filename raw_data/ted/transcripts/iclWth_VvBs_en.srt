1
0:00:12.694,000 --> 0:00:13,000
My name is Stuart Duncan,

2
0:00:14.635,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I'm actually probably better known online as "AutismFather."

3
0:00:19.709,000 --> 0:00:2,000
That's me on the internet.

4
0:00:21.661,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I know the resemblance is uncanny.

5
0:00:23.565,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.114,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But I'm going to talk a little bit today about Minecraft.

7
0:00:27.829,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That's my Minecraft character.

8
0:00:29.38,000 --> 0:00:32,000
If you don't know the game very well, don't worry too much about it.

9
0:00:32.675,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's just the medium that I used at the time to fill a need.

10
0:00:36.229,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And what I want to talk about applies to pretty much every situation.

11
0:00:39.849,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So about four years ago, I started a Minecraft server

12
0:00:43.506,000 --> 0:00:45,000
for children with autism and their families,

13
0:00:45.964,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I called it "Autcraft."

14
0:00:47.734,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And since then, we've been in the news all around the world,

15
0:00:50.698,000 --> 0:00:52,000
on television and radio and magazines.

16
0:00:53.212,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Buzzfeed called us "one of the best places on the internet."

17
0:00:57.124,000 --> 0:01:,000
We're also the subject of an award-winning research paper called

18
0:01:00.846,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"Appropriating Minecraft as an Assistive Technology for Youth with Autism."

19
0:01:04.717,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's a bit of a mouthful.

20
0:01:06.507,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But you get the idea, I think.

21
0:01:08.689,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So I want to talk a little bit about that research paper

22
0:01:11.412,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and what it's about,

23
0:01:12.739,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but first I have to give you a little bit of history

24
0:01:15.257,000 --> 0:01:16,000
on how the server came to be.

25
0:01:16.711,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Back in 2013, everybody was playing Minecraft,

26
0:01:20.425,000 --> 0:01:22,000
kids and adults alike,

27
0:01:22.717,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with and without autism, of course.

28
0:01:24.929,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But it was the big thing.

29
0:01:26.375,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But I saw parents on social media reaching out to other parents,

30
0:01:29.446,000 --> 0:01:31,000
asking if their autistic children could play together.

31
0:01:32.255,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And the reason is that when they tried to play on public servers,

32
0:01:35.381,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they kept running into bullies and trolls.

33
0:01:37.69,000 --> 0:01:4,000
When you have autism, you behave a little differently sometimes,

34
0:01:40.844,000 --> 0:01:41,000
sometimes a lot differently.

35
0:01:42.572,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And we all know a little bit of difference is all you really need

36
0:01:45.718,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for a bully to make you their next target.

37
0:01:48.103,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So these terrible, terrible people online,

38
0:01:50.959,000 --> 0:01:52,000
they would destroy everything that they tried to make,

39
0:01:53.669,000 --> 0:01:54,000
they would steal all their stuff,

40
0:01:55.311,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and they would kill them over and over again,

41
0:01:57.453,000 --> 0:01:58,000
making the game virtually unplayable.

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But the worst part, the part that really hurt the most,

43
0:02:01.967,000 --> 0:02:03,000
was what these bullies would say to these kids.

44
0:02:04.762,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They'd call them rejects

45
0:02:06.758,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and defects

46
0:02:08.602,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and retards.

47
0:02:10.288,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And they would tell these kids, some as young as six years old,

48
0:02:13.646,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that society doesn't want them,

49
0:02:15.301,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and their own parents never wanted a broken child,

50
0:02:17.713,000 --> 0:02:18,000
so they should just kill themselves.

51
0:02:20.579,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And of course, these kids, you understand,

52
0:02:22.862,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they would sign off from these servers angry and hurt.

53
0:02:25.43,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They would break their keyboards, they'd quite literally hate themselves,

54
0:02:28.929,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and their parents felt powerless to do anything.

55
0:02:31.386,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So I decided I had to try and help.

56
0:02:34.328,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I have autism,

57
0:02:36.049,000 --> 0:02:37,000
my oldest son has autism,

58
0:02:38.423,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and both my kids and I love Minecraft,

59
0:02:40.455,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so I have to do something.

60
0:02:43.389,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So I got myself a Minecraft server,

61
0:02:47.32,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I spent some time, built a little village with some roads

62
0:02:50.372,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and a big welcome sign and this guy and a lodge up on a mountaintop,

63
0:02:53.678,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and tried to make it inviting.

64
0:02:55.563,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The idea was pretty simple.

65
0:02:56.961,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I had a white list, so only people that I approved could join,

66
0:03:00.392,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I would just monitor the server as much as I could,

67
0:03:03.014,000 --> 0:03:05,000
just to make sure that nothing went wrong.

68
0:03:05.061,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that was it, that was the whole promise: to keep the kids safe

69
0:03:08.236,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so they could play.

70
0:03:09.411,000 --> 0:03:1,000
When it was done, I went to Facebook

71
0:03:11.15,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and posted a pretty simple message to my friends list, not publicly.

72
0:03:14.389,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I wanted to see if there was any interest in this,

73
0:03:16.766,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and if it really could help.

74
0:03:18.131,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Turns out that I greatly underestimated just how much this was needed,

75
0:03:21.561,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because within 48 hours, I got 750 emails.

76
0:03:25.402,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I don't have that many Facebook friends.

77
0:03:27.509,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:29.458,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Within eight days, I had to upgrade the hosting package eight times,

79
0:03:33.095,000 --> 0:03:35,000
from the bottom package to the most expensive package they had,

80
0:03:36.1,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and now, almost four years later,

81
0:03:37.733,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I have 8,000 names on the white list from all around the world.

82
0:03:40.909,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But the reason I'm up here today to talk to you

83
0:03:43.168,000 --> 0:03:45,000
isn't just because I gave kids a safe place to play.

84
0:03:45.749,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's what happened while they played.

85
0:03:47.547,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I started hearing from parents

86
0:03:49.006,000 --> 0:03:51,000
who said their children were learning to read and write

87
0:03:51.658,000 --> 0:03:52,000
by playing on the server.

88
0:03:52.892,000 --> 0:03:54,000
At first they spelled things by sound, like most kids do,

89
0:03:55.631,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but because they were part of a community,

90
0:03:57.725,000 --> 0:03:59,000
they saw other people spelling the same words properly

91
0:04:00.331,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and just picked it up.

92
0:04:01.516,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I started hearing from parents who said that their nonverbal children

93
0:04:04.806,000 --> 0:04:05,000
were starting to speak.

94
0:04:05.986,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They only talked about Minecraft, but they were talking.

95
0:04:08.682,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:10.03,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Some kids made friends at school for the first time ever.

97
0:04:12.741,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Some started to share, even give things to other people.

98
0:04:15.401,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It was amazing.

99
0:04:16.583,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And every single parent came to me and said it was because of Autcraft,

100
0:04:19.981,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because of what you're doing.

101
0:04:21.408,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But why, though?

102
0:04:22.583,000 --> 0:04:24,000
How could all of this be just from a video game server?

103
0:04:26.074,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Well, it goes back to that research paper I was talking about.

104
0:04:29.287,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In it, she covers some of the guidelines I used when I created the server,

105
0:04:33.02,000 --> 0:04:36,000
guidelines that I think help encourage people to be their very best.

106
0:04:36.544,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I hope.

107
0:04:37.764,000 --> 0:04:38,000
For example, communication.

108
0:04:39.084,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It can be tough for kids with autism.

109
0:04:40.881,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It could be tough for grown-ups without autism.

110
0:04:44.114,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But I think that kids should not be punished,

111
0:04:46.24,000 --> 0:04:47,000
they should be talked to.

112
0:04:47.71,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Nine times out of ten, when the kids on the server act out,

113
0:04:50.52,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it's because of something that's happened in the day at school or home.

114
0:04:53.89,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Maybe a pet died.

115
0:04:55.066,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Sometimes it's just a miscommunication between two kids.

116
0:04:57.728,000 --> 0:04:59,000
One doesn't say what they're about to do.

117
0:04:59.875,000 --> 0:05:,000
And so we just offer to help.

118
0:05:01.307,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We always tell the children on the server that we're not mad,

119
0:05:04.218,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and they're not in trouble;

120
0:05:05.556,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we only want to help.

121
0:05:06.731,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And it shows that not only do we care,

122
0:05:08.609,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but we respect them enough to listen to their point of view.

123
0:05:11.83,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Respect goes a long way.

124
0:05:13.484,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Plus, it shows them that they have everything they need

125
0:05:16.121,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to be able to resolve these problems on their own in the future

126
0:05:19.117,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and maybe even avoid them, because, you know, communication.

127
0:05:23.559,000 --> 0:05:26,000
On most servers, as video games are,

128
0:05:26.628,000 --> 0:05:28,000
children are rewarded, well, players are rewarded,

129
0:05:29.442,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for how well they do in a competition, right?

130
0:05:31.626,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The better you do, the better reward you get.

131
0:05:33.833,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That can be automated; the server does the work, the code is there.

132
0:05:37.29,000 --> 0:05:38,000
On Autcraft, we don't do that.

133
0:05:38.79,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We have things like "Player of the Week" and "CBAs,"

134
0:05:41.264,000 --> 0:05:42,000
which is "Caught Being Awesome."

135
0:05:43.278,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

136
0:05:44.532,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We award players ranks on the servers based on the attributes they exhibit,

137
0:05:49.203,000 --> 0:05:52,000
such as the "Buddy" rank for people who are friendly towards others,

138
0:05:52.504,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and "Junior Helper" for people that are helpful towards others.

139
0:05:55.512,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We have "Senior Helper" for the adults.

140
0:05:59.324,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But they're obvious, right?

141
0:06:01.525,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Like, people know what to expect and how to earn these things

142
0:06:04.958,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because of how they're named.

143
0:06:06.492,000 --> 0:06:08,000
As soon as somebody signs onto the server,

144
0:06:08.907,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they know that they're going to be rewarded for who they are

145
0:06:11.829,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and not what they can do.

146
0:06:14.13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Our top award, the AutismFather Sword,

147
0:06:16.004,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which is named after me because I'm the founder,

148
0:06:18.769,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is a very powerful sword that you can't get in the game any other way

149
0:06:22.086,000 --> 0:06:25,000
than to show that you completely put the community above yourself,

150
0:06:25.728,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and that compassion and kindness is at the core of who you are.

151
0:06:28.733,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We've given away quite a few of those swords, actually.

152
0:06:31.337,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I figure, if we're watching the server to make sure nothing bad happens,

153
0:06:34.892,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we should also watch for the good things that happen and reward people for them.

154
0:06:38.719,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We're always trying to show all the players

155
0:06:40.804,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that everybody is considered to be equal, even me.

156
0:06:43.212,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But we know we can't treat people equally to do that.

157
0:06:45.944,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Some of the players get angry very easily.

158
0:06:48.455,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Some of them have additional struggles on top of autism,

159
0:06:51.154,000 --> 0:06:52,000
such as OCD or Tourette's.

160
0:06:53.856,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, I have this knack of remembering all of the players.

161
0:06:57.597,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I remember their first day, the conversations we've had,

162
0:07:00.267,000 --> 0:07:02,000
things we've talked about, things they've built.

163
0:07:02.546,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So when somebody comes to me with a problem,

164
0:07:04.633,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I handle that situation differently than I would with any other player,

165
0:07:08.034,000 --> 0:07:09,000
based on what I know about them.

166
0:07:09.697,000 --> 0:07:12,000
For the other admins and helpers, we document everything

167
0:07:12.808,000 --> 0:07:15,000
so that, whether it's good or bad or a concerning conversation,

168
0:07:16.144,000 --> 0:07:17,000
it's there, so everybody is aware.

169
0:07:18.562,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I want to give you one example of this one player.

170
0:07:20.995,000 --> 0:07:22,000
He was with us for a little while,

171
0:07:23.17,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but at some point he started spamming dashes in the chat,

172
0:07:26.319,000 --> 0:07:28,000
like a big long line of dashes all the way across the screen.

173
0:07:29.289,000 --> 0:07:3,000
A little while later, he'd do it again.

174
0:07:31.233,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The other players asked him not to do that, and he'd say, "OK."

175
0:07:34.434,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And then he'd do it again.

176
0:07:35.809,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It started to frustrate the other players.

177
0:07:37.838,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They asked me to mute him or to punish him for breaking the rules,

178
0:07:40.983,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but I knew there had to be something more to it.

179
0:07:43.25,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So I went to his aunt, who is the contact that I have for him.

180
0:07:46.281,000 --> 0:07:48,000
She explained that he had gone blind in one eye

181
0:07:48.513,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and was losing his vision in the other.

182
0:07:50.429,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So what he was doing was splitting up the chat

183
0:07:52.628,000 --> 0:07:53,000
into easier-to-see blocks of text,

184
0:07:54.498,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which is pretty smart.

185
0:07:55.99,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So that very same night, I talked to a friend of mine who writes code

186
0:07:59.276,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and we created a brand-new plug-in for the server

187
0:08:01.648,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that makes it so that any player on the server,

188
0:08:03.878,000 --> 0:08:04,000
including him, of course,

189
0:08:05.338,000 --> 0:08:08,000
could just enter a command and instantly have every single line

190
0:08:08.402,000 --> 0:08:09,000
separated by dashes.

191
0:08:10.452,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Plus, they can make it asterisks or blank lines

192
0:08:12.709,000 --> 0:08:14,000
or anything they want -- whatever works best for them.

193
0:08:15.335,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We even went a little bit extra and made it so it highlights your name,

194
0:08:18.796,000 --> 0:08:2,000
so that it's easier to see if somebody mentions you.

195
0:08:21.35,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's just one example of how doing a little bit extra,

196
0:08:24.509,000 --> 0:08:25,000
a small modification,

197
0:08:25.966,000 --> 0:08:27,000
still helps everybody be on equal footing,

198
0:08:28.033,000 --> 0:08:3,000
even though you did a little extra just for that one player.

199
0:08:31.221,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The big one is to be not afraid.

200
0:08:34.486,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The children on my server are not afraid.

201
0:08:36.894,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They are free to just be themselves,

202
0:08:39.101,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and it's because we support and encourage and celebrate each other.

203
0:08:43.85,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We all know what it feels like to be the outcast

204
0:08:46.172,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and to be hated simply for existing,

205
0:08:47.996,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and so when we're together on the server, we're not afraid anymore.

206
0:08:51.835,000 --> 0:08:53,000
For the first two years or so on the server,

207
0:08:54.117,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I talked to two children per week on average that were suicidal.

208
0:08:58.746,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But they came to me because I'm the one that made them feel safe.

209
0:09:01.819,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They felt like I was the only person in the world they could talk to.

210
0:09:05.776,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So I guess my message is:

211
0:09:07.396,000 --> 0:09:09,000
whether you have a charity or some other organization,

212
0:09:10.377,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or you're a teacher or a therapist

213
0:09:12.064,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or you're a parent who is just doing your very best,

214
0:09:14.563,000 --> 0:09:15,000
or you're an autistic, like I am,

215
0:09:16.305,000 --> 0:09:17,000
no matter who you are,

216
0:09:17.652,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you absolutely must help these children strip away those fears

217
0:09:22.1,000 --> 0:09:23,000
before you do anything else,

218
0:09:23.47,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because anything else is going to feel forced

219
0:09:25.707,000 --> 0:09:26,000
unless they're not afraid.

220
0:09:27.488,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's why positive reinforcement will always do better

221
0:09:30.047,000 --> 0:09:31,000
than any form of punishment.

222
0:09:31.829,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They want to learn when they feel safe and happy.

223
0:09:34.212,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It just happens naturally; they don't even try to learn.

224
0:09:36.899,000 --> 0:09:39,000
These are words from the kids on the server to describe the server.

225
0:09:40.232,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The one thing I would hope that you could take away

226
0:09:42.666,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is that no matter what somebody else is going through in life right now,

227
0:09:46.444,000 --> 0:09:49,000
whether they're being bullied at school or at home,

228
0:09:49.746,000 --> 0:09:51,000
if they're questioning their sexuality or even their gender,

229
0:09:52.61,000 --> 0:09:54,000
which happens a lot in the autism community,

230
0:09:55.099,000 --> 0:09:57,000
if they're feeling alone or even suicidal,

231
0:09:58.395,000 --> 0:10:01,000
you have to live your life in such a way

232
0:10:02.332,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that that person feels like they can come to and tell you.

233
0:10:05.12,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They have to feel perfectly safe in talking to you about it.

234
0:10:08.107,000 --> 0:10:1,000
If you want to see a group of autistic children --

235
0:10:11.389,000 --> 0:10:13,000
kids who society wrongly thinks are supposed to be antisocial

236
0:10:14.402,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and lacking in empathy --

237
0:10:15.978,000 --> 0:10:18,000
if you want to see them come together and build the most compassionate

238
0:10:19.315,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and friendly and generous community you've ever seen,

239
0:10:22.016,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the kind of place that people would write about

240
0:10:24.322,000 --> 0:10:26,000
as one of the best places on the internet,

241
0:10:26.533,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they'll do that.

242
0:10:27.708,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I've seen it.

243
0:10:28.883,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I'm there every day.

244
0:10:30.853,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But they have some huge obstacles that they have to overcome to do that,

245
0:10:34.743,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and it would be really helpful to have somebody there

246
0:10:37.413,000 --> 0:10:4,000
who could help to show them that the only thing they really have to fear

247
0:10:40.9,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is self-doubt.

248
0:10:42.077,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So I guess I'm asking you to please be that person for them,

249
0:10:44.978,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because to them,

250
0:10:48.446,000 --> 0:10:49,000
those kids --

251
0:10:49.621,000 --> 0:10:5,000
it means everything.

252
0:10:51.501,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Thank you very much.

253
0:10:52.699,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Applause)

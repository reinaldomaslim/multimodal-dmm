1
0:00:12.739,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Where do you come from?

2
0:00:14.607,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It's such a simple question,

3
0:00:16.678,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but these days, of course, simple questions

4
0:00:18.861,000 --> 0:00:21,000
bring ever more complicated answers.

5
0:00:21.907,000 --> 0:00:23,000
People are always asking me where I come from,

6
0:00:24.859,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and they're expecting me to say India,

7
0:00:28.039,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and they're absolutely right insofar as 100 percent

8
0:00:31.14,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of my blood and ancestry does come from India.

9
0:00:34.706,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Except, I've never lived one day of my life there.

10
0:00:38.771,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I can't speak even one word

11
0:00:41.179,000 --> 0:00:43,000
of its more than 22,000 dialects.

12
0:00:44.179,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So I don't think I've really earned the right

13
0:00:46.389,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to call myself an Indian.

14
0:00:48.835,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And if "Where do you come from?"

15
0:00:50.383,000 --> 0:00:53,000
means "Where were you born and raised and educated?"

16
0:00:53.45,000 --> 0:00:55,000
then I'm entirely of that funny little country

17
0:00:55.876,000 --> 0:00:56,000
known as England,

18
0:00:57.247,000 --> 0:00:59,000
except I left England as soon as I completed

19
0:00:59.658,000 --> 0:01:,000
my undergraduate education,

20
0:01:01.571,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and all the time I was growing up,

21
0:01:03.288,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I was the only kid in all my classes

22
0:01:06.084,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes

23
0:01:09.213,000 --> 0:01:11,000
represented in our textbooks.

24
0:01:11.891,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And if "Where do you come from?"

25
0:01:13.193,000 --> 0:01:14,000
means "Where do you pay your taxes?

26
0:01:14.884,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist?"

27
0:01:17.432,000 --> 0:01:19,000
then I'm very much of the United States,

28
0:01:19.795,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I have been for 48 years now,

29
0:01:22.363,000 --> 0:01:24,000
since I was a really small child.

30
0:01:24.451,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Except, for many of those years,

31
0:01:26.159,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I've had to carry around this funny little pink card

32
0:01:28.66,000 --> 0:01:29,000
with green lines running through my face

33
0:01:30.589,000 --> 0:01:32,000
identifying me as a permanent alien.

34
0:01:33.202,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there.

35
0:01:37.464,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:39.651,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And if "Where do you come from?"

37
0:01:41.238,000 --> 0:01:43,000
means "Which place goes deepest inside you

38
0:01:44.004,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and where do you try to spend most of your time?"

39
0:01:47.184,000 --> 0:01:48,000
then I'm Japanese,

40
0:01:48.357,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because I've been living as much as I can

41
0:01:50.61,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for the last 25 years in Japan.

42
0:01:53.995,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Except, all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa,

43
0:01:57.048,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese

44
0:01:59.19,000 --> 0:02:01,000
would want to consider me one of them.

45
0:02:02.081,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I say all this just to stress

46
0:02:05.332,000 --> 0:02:07,000
how very old-fashioned and straightforward

47
0:02:08.052,000 --> 0:02:08,000
my background is,

48
0:02:09.051,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,

49
0:02:13.099,000 --> 0:02:14,000
most of the kids I meet

50
0:02:14.995,000 --> 0:02:17,000
are much more international and multi-cultured than I am.

51
0:02:18.794,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And they have one home associated with their parents,

52
0:02:21.459,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but another associated with their partners,

53
0:02:24.615,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be,

54
0:02:28.004,000 --> 0:02:3,000
a fourth connected with the place they dream of being,

55
0:02:30.918,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and many more besides.

56
0:02:33.262,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And their whole life will be spent taking pieces

57
0:02:36.548,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of many different places and putting them together

58
0:02:40.035,000 --> 0:02:42,000
into a stained glass whole.

59
0:02:42.877,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Home for them is really a work in progress.

60
0:02:45.318,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's like a project on which they're constantly adding

61
0:02:47.914,000 --> 0:02:5,000
upgrades and improvements and corrections.

62
0:02:51.048,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And for more and more of us,

63
0:02:52.943,000 --> 0:02:56,000
home has really less to do with a piece of soil

64
0:02:57.398,000 --> 0:02:59,000
than, you could say, with a piece of soul.

65
0:03:00.149,000 --> 0:03:02,000
If somebody suddenly asks me, "Where's your home?"

66
0:03:02.554,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends

67
0:03:05.469,000 --> 0:03:09,000
or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be.

68
0:03:09.736,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I'd always felt this way,

69
0:03:11.593,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but it really came home to me, as it were,

70
0:03:14.336,000 --> 0:03:16,000
some years ago when I was climbing up the stairs

71
0:03:17.054,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in my parents' house in California,

72
0:03:19.756,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and I looked through the living room windows

73
0:03:22.582,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I saw that we were encircled by 70-foot flames,

74
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
one of those wildfires that regularly tear through

75
0:03:30.246,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the hills of California and many other such places.

76
0:03:34.077,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And three hours later, that fire had reduced

77
0:03:37.102,000 --> 0:03:39,000
my home and every last thing in it

78
0:03:39.846,000 --> 0:03:41,000
except for me to ash.

79
0:03:42.864,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when I woke up the next morning,

80
0:03:45.574,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I was sleeping on a friend's floor,

81
0:03:47.265,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the only thing I had in the world was a toothbrush

82
0:03:49.693,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I had just bought from an all-night supermarket.

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Of course, if anybody asked me then,

84
0:03:54.166,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"Where is your home?"

85
0:03:55.525,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I literally couldn't point to any physical construction.

86
0:03:59.517,000 --> 0:04:03,000
My home would have to be whatever I carried around inside me.

87
0:04:04.249,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And in so many ways, I think this is a terrific liberation.

88
0:04:08.241,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Because when my grandparents were born,

89
0:04:10.435,000 --> 0:04:12,000
they pretty much had their sense of home,

90
0:04:12.962,000 --> 0:04:15,000
their sense of community, even their sense of enmity,

91
0:04:16.454,000 --> 0:04:17,000
assigned to them at birth,

92
0:04:18.379,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and didn't have much chance of stepping outside of that.

93
0:04:21.357,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And nowadays, at least some of us can choose our sense of home,

94
0:04:25.064,000 --> 0:04:27,000
create our sense of community,

95
0:04:27.222,000 --> 0:04:3,000
fashion our sense of self, and in so doing

96
0:04:30.803,000 --> 0:04:32,000
maybe step a little beyond

97
0:04:32.94,000 --> 0:04:33,000
some of the black and white divisions

98
0:04:34.726,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of our grandparents' age.

99
0:04:36.558,000 --> 0:04:37,000
No coincidence that the president

100
0:04:38.442,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of the strongest nation on Earth is half-Kenyan,

101
0:04:41.173,000 --> 0:04:42,000
partly raised in Indonesia,

102
0:04:42.78,000 --> 0:04:45,000
has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.

103
0:04:46.379,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The number of people living in countries not their own

104
0:04:49.843,000 --> 0:04:53,000
now comes to 220 million,

105
0:04:54.63,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and that's an almost unimaginable number,

106
0:04:57.244,000 --> 0:05:,000
but it means that if you took the whole population of Canada

107
0:05:00.994,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and the whole population of Australia

108
0:05:02.91,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and then the whole population of Australia again

109
0:05:05.22,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and the whole population of Canada again

110
0:05:07.862,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and doubled that number,

111
0:05:09.545,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you would still have fewer people than belong

112
0:05:11.712,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to this great floating tribe.

113
0:05:13.919,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And the number of us who live outside

114
0:05:15.705,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the old nation-state categories is increasing so quickly,

115
0:05:19.789,000 --> 0:05:22,000
by 64 million just in the last 12 years,

116
0:05:23.419,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that soon there will be more of us than there are Americans.

117
0:05:26.899,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Already, we represent the fifth-largest nation on Earth.

118
0:05:31.573,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And in fact, in Canada's largest city, Toronto,

119
0:05:34.429,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the average resident today is what used to be called

120
0:05:38.119,000 --> 0:05:42,000
a foreigner, somebody born in a very different country.

121
0:05:42.211,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And I've always felt that the beauty of being surrounded by the foreign

122
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is that it slaps you awake.

123
0:05:47.597,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You can't take anything for granted.

124
0:05:50.401,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Travel, for me, is a little bit like being in love,

125
0:05:53.135,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked "on."

126
0:05:57.192,000 --> 0:06:,000
Suddenly you're alert to the secret patterns of the world.

127
0:06:01.193,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The real voyage of discovery, as Marcel Proust famously said,

128
0:06:05.509,000 --> 0:06:07,000
consists not in seeing new sights,

129
0:06:08.507,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but in looking with new eyes.

130
0:06:10.877,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And of course, once you have new eyes,

131
0:06:12.843,000 --> 0:06:14,000
even the old sights, even your home

132
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:17,000
become something different.

133
0:06:17.957,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Many of the people living in countries not their own

134
0:06:20.775,000 --> 0:06:23,000
are refugees who never wanted to leave home

135
0:06:23.858,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and ache to go back home.

136
0:06:26.574,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But for the fortunate among us,

137
0:06:28.221,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I think the age of movement brings exhilarating new possibilities.

138
0:06:32.502,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Certainly when I'm traveling,

139
0:06:33.567,000 --> 0:06:35,000
especially to the major cities of the world,

140
0:06:35.881,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the typical person I meet today

141
0:06:38.006,000 --> 0:06:42,000
will be, let's say, a half-Korean, half-German young woman

142
0:06:42.551,000 --> 0:06:43,000
living in Paris.

143
0:06:44.254,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And as soon as she meets a half-Thai,

144
0:06:47.312,000 --> 0:06:5,000
half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,

145
0:06:50.526,000 --> 0:06:52,000
she recognizes him as kin.

146
0:06:53.003,000 --> 0:06:57,000
She realizes that she probably has much more in common with him

147
0:06:57.342,000 --> 0:07:,000
than with anybody entirely of Korea or entirely of Germany.

148
0:07:00.935,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So they become friends. They fall in love.

149
0:07:03.693,000 --> 0:07:05,000
They move to New York City.

150
0:07:05.971,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:08.134,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Or Edinburgh.

152
0:07:09.52,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And the little girl who arises out of their union

153
0:07:12.794,000 --> 0:07:14,000
will of course be not Korean or German

154
0:07:14.925,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian

155
0:07:17.468,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or even American, but a wonderful

156
0:07:19.573,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and constantly evolving mix of all those places.

157
0:07:23.707,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And potentially, everything about the way

158
0:07:26.472,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that young woman dreams about the world,

159
0:07:29.221,000 --> 0:07:32,000
writes about the world, thinks about the world,

160
0:07:32.267,000 --> 0:07:33,000
could be something different,

161
0:07:34.237,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because it comes out of this almost unprecedented

162
0:07:37.432,000 --> 0:07:38,000
blend of cultures.

163
0:07:39.405,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Where you come from now is much less important

164
0:07:42.489,000 --> 0:07:43,000
than where you're going.

165
0:07:44.137,000 --> 0:07:46,000
More and more of us are rooted in the future

166
0:07:46.533,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or the present tense as much as in the past.

167
0:07:49.829,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And home, we know, is not just the place

168
0:07:52.392,000 --> 0:07:54,000
where you happen to be born.

169
0:07:54.502,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's the place where you become yourself.

170
0:07:58.975,000 --> 0:08:,000
And yet,

171
0:08:01.397,000 --> 0:08:03,000
there is one great problem with movement,

172
0:08:04.062,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and that is that it's really hard to get your bearings

173
0:08:07.273,000 --> 0:08:08,000
when you're in midair.

174
0:08:08.891,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Some years ago, I noticed that I had accumulated

175
0:08:12.177,000 --> 0:08:15,000
one million miles on United Airlines alone.

176
0:08:15.699,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You all know that crazy system,

177
0:08:17.749,000 --> 0:08:2,000
six days in hell, you get the seventh day free.

178
0:08:21.477,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:24.983,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I began to think that really,

180
0:08:27.259,000 --> 0:08:3,000
movement was only as good as the sense of stillness

181
0:08:30.538,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that you could bring to it to put it into perspective.

182
0:08:34.385,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And eight months after my house burned down,

183
0:08:37.239,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I ran into a friend who taught at a local high school,

184
0:08:39.961,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and he said, "I've got the perfect place for you."

185
0:08:43.493,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"Really?" I said. I'm always a bit skeptical

186
0:08:45.501,000 --> 0:08:46,000
when people say things like that.

187
0:08:46.979,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"No, honestly," he went on,

188
0:08:48.349,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"it's only three hours away by car,

189
0:08:50.195,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and it's not very expensive,

190
0:08:51.809,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and it's probably not like anywhere you've stayed before."

191
0:08:55.389,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"Hmm." I was beginning to get slightly intrigued. "What is it?"

192
0:08:59.588,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed —

193
0:09:02.367,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"Well, actually it's a Catholic hermitage."

194
0:09:05.949,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This was the wrong answer.

195
0:09:07.915,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,

196
0:09:10.462,000 --> 0:09:14,000
so I had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime.

197
0:09:15.06,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Several lifetimes, actually.

198
0:09:17.331,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But my friend assured me that he wasn't Catholic,

199
0:09:19.889,000 --> 0:09:2,000
nor were most of his students,

200
0:09:21.342,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but he took his classes there every spring.

201
0:09:24.123,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And as he had it, even the most restless, distractible,

202
0:09:28.886,000 --> 0:09:32,000
testosterone-addled 15-year-old Californian boy

203
0:09:32.92,000 --> 0:09:35,000
only had to spend three days in silence

204
0:09:36.156,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and something in him cooled down and cleared out.

205
0:09:40.41,000 --> 0:09:42,000
He found himself.

206
0:09:42.719,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I thought, "Anything that works for a 15-year-old boy

207
0:09:45.458,000 --> 0:09:46,000
ought to work for me."

208
0:09:46.797,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So I got in my car, and I drove three hours north

209
0:09:50.407,000 --> 0:09:51,000
along the coast,

210
0:09:51.883,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and the roads grew emptier and narrower,

211
0:09:54.443,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and then I turned onto an even narrower path,

212
0:09:57.207,000 --> 0:10:,000
barely paved, that snaked for two miles

213
0:10:00.847,000 --> 0:10:02,000
up to the top of a mountain.

214
0:10:03.37,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And when I got out of my car,

215
0:10:06.209,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the air was pulsing.

216
0:10:08.579,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The whole place was absolutely silent,

217
0:10:10.439,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but the silence wasn't an absence of noise.

218
0:10:13.899,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening.

219
0:10:17.94,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And at my feet was the great, still blue plate

220
0:10:21.451,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of the Pacific Ocean.

221
0:10:23.705,000 --> 0:10:27,000
All around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush.

222
0:10:28.139,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping.

223
0:10:30.925,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Small but eminently comfortable,

224
0:10:32.65,000 --> 0:10:34,000
it had a bed and a rocking chair

225
0:10:34.859,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and a long desk and even longer picture windows

226
0:10:38.033,000 --> 0:10:42,000
looking out on a small, private, walled garden,

227
0:10:42.322,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass

228
0:10:45.522,000 --> 0:10:47,000
running down to the sea.

229
0:10:48.514,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And I sat down, and I began to write,

230
0:10:51.683,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and write, and write,

231
0:10:53.187,000 --> 0:10:56,000
even though I'd gone there really to get away from my desk.

232
0:10:56.8,000 --> 0:11:,000
And by the time I got up, four hours had passed.

233
0:11:01.294,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Night had fallen,

234
0:11:03.423,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and I went out under this great overturned saltshaker of stars,

235
0:11:08.179,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and I could see the tail lights of cars

236
0:11:10.431,000 --> 0:11:14,000
disappearing around the headlands 12 miles to the south.

237
0:11:14.644,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day

238
0:11:18.352,000 --> 0:11:19,000
vanishing.

239
0:11:20.302,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And the next day, when I woke up

240
0:11:22.114,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in the absence of telephones and TVs and laptops,

241
0:11:25.582,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the days seemed to stretch for a thousand hours.

242
0:11:29.735,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It was really all the freedom I know when I'm traveling,

243
0:11:33.434,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but it also profoundly felt like coming home.

244
0:11:38.048,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And I'm not a religious person,

245
0:11:39.664,000 --> 0:11:4,000
so I didn't go to the services.

246
0:11:41.165,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I didn't consult the monks for guidance.

247
0:11:43.734,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I just took walks along the monastery road

248
0:11:46.514,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and sent postcards to loved ones.

249
0:11:48.863,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I looked at the clouds,

250
0:11:50.697,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and I did what is hardest of all for me to do usually,

251
0:11:55.022,000 --> 0:11:57,000
which is nothing at all.

252
0:11:57.516,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I started to go back to this place,

253
0:11:59.824,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and I noticed that I was doing my most important work there

254
0:12:03.392,000 --> 0:12:06,000
invisibly just by sitting still,

255
0:12:06.923,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and certainly coming to my most critical decisions

256
0:12:10.048,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the way I never could when I was racing

257
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
from the last email to the next appointment.

258
0:12:14.903,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And I began to think that something in me

259
0:12:17.532,000 --> 0:12:18,000
had really been crying out for stillness,

260
0:12:19.521,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but of course I couldn't hear it

261
0:12:21.069,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because I was running around so much.

262
0:12:22.855,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I was like some crazy guy who puts on a blindfold

263
0:12:25.508,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and then complains that he can't see a thing.

264
0:12:28.739,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And I thought back to that wonderful phrase

265
0:12:31.28,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I had learned as a boy from Seneca,

266
0:12:33.652,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in which he says, "That man is poor

267
0:12:37.31,000 --> 0:12:42,000
not who has little but who hankers after more."

268
0:12:42.683,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And, of course, I'm not suggesting

269
0:12:44.775,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that anybody here go into a monastery.

270
0:12:46.609,000 --> 0:12:47,000
That's not the point.

271
0:12:48.201,000 --> 0:12:51,000
But I do think it's only by stopping movement

272
0:12:51.919,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that you can see where to go.

273
0:12:54.215,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And it's only by stepping out of your life and the world

274
0:12:57.82,000 --> 0:13:,000
that you can see what you most deeply care about

275
0:13:01.389,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and find a home.

276
0:13:03.795,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And I've noticed so many people now

277
0:13:05.838,000 --> 0:13:08,000
take conscious measures to sit quietly for 30 minutes

278
0:13:08.926,000 --> 0:13:1,000
every morning just collecting themselves

279
0:13:11.459,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in one corner of the room without their devices,

280
0:13:14.019,000 --> 0:13:16,000
or go running every evening,

281
0:13:16.092,000 --> 0:13:17,000
or leave their cell phones behind

282
0:13:18.048,000 --> 0:13:21,000
when they go to have a long conversation with a friend.

283
0:13:21.965,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Movement is a fantastic privilege,

284
0:13:25.134,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents

285
0:13:28.491,000 --> 0:13:3,000
could never have dreamed of doing.

286
0:13:30.612,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But movement, ultimately,

287
0:13:32.517,000 --> 0:13:36,000
only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to.

288
0:13:37.058,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And home, in the end, is of course

289
0:13:39.849,000 --> 0:13:41,000
not just the place where you sleep.

290
0:13:42.717,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It's the place where you stand.

291
0:13:45.356,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Thank you.

292
0:13:46.813,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

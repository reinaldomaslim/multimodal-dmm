1
0:00:12.56,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My name is Mwende Katwiwa

2
0:00:15.68,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I am a poet,

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a Pan-Africanist

4
0:00:18.6,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and a freedom fighter.

5
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was 23 years old

6
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
when I first heard about Reproductive Justice.

7
0:00:25.44,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I was working at Women with a Vision,

8
0:00:27.6,000 --> 0:00:31,000
where I learned that Reproductive Justice was defined by Sister Song as:

9
0:00:31.68,000 --> 0:00:35,000
One: A woman's right to decide if and when she will have a baby

10
0:00:36.12,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the conditions under which she will give birth.

11
0:00:38.76,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Two: A woman's right to decide if she will not have a baby

12
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and her options for preventing or ending a pregnancy.

13
0:00:45.48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And three: A woman's right to parent the children she already has

14
0:00:49.64,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in safe and healthy environments

15
0:00:51.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
without fear of violence

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
from individuals or the government.

17
0:00:56.32,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I've always wanted to be a mother.

18
0:00:59.44,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Growing up, I heard all about the joys of motherhood.

19
0:01:02.92,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I used to dream of watching my womb weave wonder into this world.

20
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
See, I knew I was young.

21
0:01:08.76,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But I figured,

22
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it couldn't hurt to start planning for something so big, so early.

23
0:01:15.2,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But now,

24
0:01:17.319,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm 26 years old.

25
0:01:19.4,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I don't know if I have what it takes to stomach motherhood in this country.

26
0:01:23.76,000 --> 0:01:25,000
See, over the years, America has taught me more about parenting

27
0:01:26.76,000 --> 0:01:27,000
than any book on the subject.

28
0:01:28.56,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It has taught me how some women give birth to babies

29
0:01:31.04,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and others to suspects.

30
0:01:32.96,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It has taught me that this body will birth kin

31
0:01:35.56,000 --> 0:01:37,000
who are more likely to be held in prison cells

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
than to hold college degrees.

33
0:01:40.72,000 --> 0:01:43,000
There is something about being Black in America

34
0:01:44.48,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that has made motherhood seem

35
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
complicated.

36
0:01:49.48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Seem like,

37
0:01:50.72,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I don't know what to do to raise my kids right

38
0:01:52.92,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and keep them alive.

39
0:01:54.28,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Do I tell my son not to steal because it is wrong,

40
0:01:56.84,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or because they will use it to justify his death?

41
0:01:59.8,000 --> 0:02:,000
Do I tell him

42
0:02:01.04,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that even if he pays for his Skittles and sweet tea

43
0:02:03.64,000 --> 0:02:05,000
there will still be those who will watch him

44
0:02:05.76,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and see a criminal before child;

45
0:02:08.28,000 --> 0:02:1,000
who will call the police and not wait for them to come.

46
0:02:11.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Do I even want the police to come?

47
0:02:13.48,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Too many Sean Bells go off in my head when I consider calling 911.

48
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I will not take it for Oscar Grant-ed that they will not come and kill my son.

49
0:02:21.919,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So, we may have gotten rid of the nooses,

50
0:02:24.12,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but I still consider it lynching when they murder Black boys

51
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and leave their bodies for four hours in the sun.

52
0:02:30.04,000 --> 0:02:32,000
As a historical reminder

53
0:02:32.24,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that there is something about being Black in America

54
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that has made motherhood sound

55
0:02:37.8,000 --> 0:02:38,000
like mourning.

56
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Sound like one morning I could wake up

57
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and see my son as a repeat of last week's story.

58
0:02:44.84,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Sound like I could wake up and realize

59
0:02:46.76,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the death of my daughter wouldn't even be newsworthy.

60
0:02:49.28,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So you can't tell me that Sandra Bland is the only Black woman

61
0:02:52.52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
whose violence deserves more than our silence.

62
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:57,000
What about our other dark-skinned daughters in distress

63
0:02:57.76,000 --> 0:02:58,000
whose deaths we have yet to remember?

64
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:,000
What about our children

65
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:02,000
whose lives don't fit neatly between the lives of your genders?

66
0:03:03.8,000 --> 0:03:05,000
See, apparently, nothing is a great protector

67
0:03:05.96,000 --> 0:03:07,000
if you come out of a body that looks like this.

68
0:03:08.72,000 --> 0:03:11,000
See, there is something about being Black in America

69
0:03:12.64,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that has made motherhood sound

70
0:03:14.6,000 --> 0:03:16,000
like something I'm not sure I look forward to.

71
0:03:17.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I've written too many poems about dead Black children to be naïve

72
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:27,000
about the fact that there could one day be a poem written about my kids.

73
0:03:28.6,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But I do not want to be a mother who gave birth to poems.

74
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I do not want a stanza for a son

75
0:03:35.08,000 --> 0:03:37,000
nor a line for a little girl

76
0:03:37.28,000 --> 0:03:4,000
nor a footnote for a child who doesn't fit into this world.

77
0:03:40.96,000 --> 0:03:41,000
No.

78
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I do not want children who will live forever

79
0:03:44.44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in the pages of poetry,

80
0:03:46.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
yet can't seem to outlive

81
0:03:48.36,000 --> 0:03:49,000
me.

82
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

83
0:03:58.72,000 --> 0:04:,000
I was invited to the TEDWomen conference

84
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to perform a poem.

85
0:04:03.24,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But for me, poetry is not about art and performance.

86
0:04:07.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It is a form of protest.

87
0:04:10.64,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Yesterday,

88
0:04:11.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
during rehearsal,

89
0:04:13.6,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I was told that there had been

90
0:04:15.68,000 --> 0:04:18,000
two to three recent TED Talks about Black Lives Matter.

91
0:04:19.96,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That maybe I should cut down my TED Talk

92
0:04:23.48,000 --> 0:04:25,000
so it could "just" be about Reproductive Justice.

93
0:04:27.28,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But that poem and this talk

94
0:04:29.68,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is fundamentally about my inability to separate the two.

95
0:04:33.92,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I was 21 years old --

96
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Applause)

97
0:04:43.36,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I was 21 years old when Trayvon Martin was murdered.

98
0:04:47.36,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy,

99
0:04:51.08,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a Black child,

100
0:04:52.64,000 --> 0:04:53,000
reminded me

101
0:04:54.2,000 --> 0:04:55,000
reminded us

102
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:04:57,000
how little this nation actually values Black life.

103
0:04:59.76,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter

104
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
became the most recognized call

105
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for Black people and our children

106
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to live in safe environments and healthy communities

107
0:05:09.88,000 --> 0:05:1,000
without fear

108
0:05:11.24,000 --> 0:05:14,000
from violence from individuals or the state or government.

109
0:05:15.96,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Months later,

110
0:05:17.48,000 --> 0:05:19,000
when George Zimmerman was not held responsible

111
0:05:19.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
for murdering Trayvon Martin,

112
0:05:21.76,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I heard Sybrina Fulton,

113
0:05:23.32,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Trayvon Martin's mother, speak.

114
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Her testimony so deeply impacted me

115
0:05:29.24,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that I found myself constantly asking,

116
0:05:32.28,000 --> 0:05:34,000
what would it mean to mother in the United Stated of America

117
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in this skin?

118
0:05:37.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What does motherhood really mean,

119
0:05:38.88,000 --> 0:05:4,000
when for so many who look like me

120
0:05:41.04,000 --> 0:05:43,000
it is synonymous with mourning?

121
0:05:45.4,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Without realizing it,

122
0:05:46.72,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I had begun to link the Reproductive Justice framework

123
0:05:49.88,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the Movement for Black Lives.

124
0:05:52.8,000 --> 0:05:54,000
As I learned more about Reproductive Justice

125
0:05:54.92,000 --> 0:05:55,000
at Women With A Vision,

126
0:05:56.32,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and as I continued to be active in the Movement for Black Lives,

127
0:06:00.08,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I found myself wanting others to see and feel these similarities.

128
0:06:04.76,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I found myself asking:

129
0:06:06.8,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Whose job is it in times like this

130
0:06:09.6,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to connect ideas realities and people?

131
0:06:14.28,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I want to dedicate this talk and that poem

132
0:06:16.88,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to Constance Malcolm.

133
0:06:19.08,000 --> 0:06:21,000
She is the mother of Ramarley Graham

134
0:06:21.72,000 --> 0:06:22,000
who was another Black child

135
0:06:23.32,000 --> 0:06:24,000
who was murdered before their time.

136
0:06:26.32,000 --> 0:06:27,000
She reminded me once over dinner,

137
0:06:28.04,000 --> 0:06:3,000
as I was struggling to write that poem,

138
0:06:30.32,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that it is the artist's job

139
0:06:32.24,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to unearth stories that people try to bury

140
0:06:34.96,000 --> 0:06:36,000
with shovels of complacency and time.

141
0:06:38.84,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Recently,

142
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Toni Morrison wrote,

143
0:06:42.36,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"In times of dread,

144
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
artists must never choose to remain silent.

145
0:06:47.4,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There is no time for self-pity,

146
0:06:49.56,000 --> 0:06:5,000
no room for fear."

147
0:06:52.2,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Yesterday, during rehearsal,

148
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
when I was told that I should

149
0:06:55.6,000 --> 0:06:58,000
"maybe cut the Black Lives Matter portion from my talk,"

150
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:,000
I found myself fearful for a moment.

151
0:07:01.8,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Fearful that again our stories were being denied

152
0:07:04.36,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the very stages they deserve to be told on.

153
0:07:07.6,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And then I remembered the words I had just spoken.

154
0:07:11.32,000 --> 0:07:12,000
"In times of dread,

155
0:07:13.2,000 --> 0:07:15,000
artists must never choose to remain silent.

156
0:07:17.12,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There is no time for self-pity.

157
0:07:19.36,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Applause)

158
0:07:27.6,000 --> 0:07:29,000
There is no time for self-pity.

159
0:07:30.24,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And no room for fear."

160
0:07:32.56,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I have made my choice.

161
0:07:34.68,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And I am always choosing.

162
0:07:37.12,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Thank you.

163
0:07:38.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Applause)

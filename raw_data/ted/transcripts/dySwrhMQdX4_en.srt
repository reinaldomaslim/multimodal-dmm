1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So historically there has

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
been a huge divide between what people

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
consider to be non-living systems on one

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
side, and living systems on the other side.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So we go from, say, this beautiful and

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
complex crystal as non-life, and this rather

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
beautiful and complex cat on the other side.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
science has kind of blurred this distinction

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
between non-living and living systems, and

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
now we consider that there may be a kind

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of continuum that exists between the two.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We'll just take one example here:

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a virus is a natural system, right?

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But it's very simple. It's very simplistic.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it doesn't have all the characteristics

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of living systems and is in fact a parasite

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
on other living systems in order to, say,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
reproduce and evolve.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But what we're going to be talking about here

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
tonight are experiments done on this sort of

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
doing chemical experiments in the laboratory,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
mixing together nonliving ingredients

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to make new structures, and that these

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
new structures might have some of the

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
characteristics of living systems.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Really what I'm talking about here is

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
trying to create a kind of artificial life.

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So what are these characteristics that I'm

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
talking about? These are them.

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We consider first that life has a body.

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now this is necessary to distinguish the self

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
from the environment.

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
process by which life can convert resources

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
from the environment into building blocks

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so it can maintain and build itself.

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Life also has a kind of inheritable information.

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now we, as humans, we store our information

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as DNA in our genomes and we pass this

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
information on to our offspring.

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism --

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we can come up with a system that could

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
perhaps move and replicate, and if we

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
coupled these now to inheritable information,

48
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
we can come up with a system that would be

49
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.

50
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And so these are the things we will try to do

51
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in the lab, make some experiments that have

52
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
one or more of these characteristics of life.

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So how do we do this? Well, we use

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a model system that we term a protocell.

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You might think of this as kind of like a

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
primitive cell. It is a simple chemical

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
model of a living cell, and if you consider

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for example a cell in your body may have

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
on the order of millions of different types

60
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of molecules that need to come together,

61
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
play together in a complex network

62
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to produce something that we call alive.

63
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In the laboratory what we want to do

64
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is much the same, but with on the order of

65
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
tens of different types of molecules --

66
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still

67
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
trying to produce something that looks lifelike.

68
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And so what we do is, we start simple

69
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we work our way up to living systems.

70
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Consider for a moment this quote by

71
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a

72
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
kind of synthetic biology:

73
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,

74
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
will not be the sensational discovery which we

75
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
usually associate with the idea."

76
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
That's his first statement. So if we actually

77
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
create life in the laboratories, it's

78
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
probably not going to impact our lives at all.

79
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"If we accept the theory of evolution, then

80
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist

81
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in the production of forms intermediate

82
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
between the inorganic and the organic

83
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
world, or between the non-living

84
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and living world, forms which possess

85
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
only some of the rudimentary attributes of life"

86
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
-- so, the ones I just discussed --

87
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"to which other attributes will be slowly added

88
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in the course of development by the

89
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
evolutionary actions of the environment."

90
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So we start simple, we make some structures

91
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that may have some of these characteristics

92
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of life, and then we try to develop that

93
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to become more lifelike.

94
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is how we can start to make a protocell.

95
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We use this idea called self-assembly.

96
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
What that means is, I can mix some

97
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
chemicals together in a test tube in my lab,

98
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and these chemicals will start to self-associate

99
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to form larger and larger structures.

100
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So say on the order of tens of thousands,

101
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
hundreds of thousands of molecules will

102
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
come together to form a large structure

103
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that didn't exist before.

104
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And in this particular example,

105
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
what I took is some membrane molecules,

106
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
mixed those together in the right environment,

107
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and within seconds it forms these rather

108
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
complex and beautiful structures here.

109
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
These membranes are also quite similar,

110
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
morphologically and functionally,

111
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to the membranes in your body,

112
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and we can use these, as they say,

113
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to form the body of our protocell.

114
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Likewise,

115
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we can work with oil and water systems.

116
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
As you know, when you put oil and water together,

117
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
they don't mix, but through self-assembly

118
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we can get a nice oil droplet to form,

119
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and we can actually use this as a body for

120
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
our artificial organism or for our protocell,

121
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as you will see later.

122
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So that's just forming some body stuff, right?

123
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Some architectures.

124
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
What about the other aspects of living systems?

125
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So we came up with this protocell model here

126
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that I'm showing.

127
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We started with a natural occurring clay

128
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
called montmorillonite.

129
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This is natural from the environment, this clay.

130
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.

131
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It could run a metabolism on it.

132
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Certain kind of molecules like to associate

133
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red

134
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
-- this is a relative of DNA,

135
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
it's an informational molecule --

136
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it can come along and it starts to associate

137
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
with the surface of this clay.

138
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This structure, then, can organize the

139
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
formation of a membrane boundary around

140
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
itself, so it can make a body of

141
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
liquid molecules around itself, and that's

142
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
shown in green here on this micrograph.

143
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So just through self-assembly, mixing things

144
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
together in the lab, we can come up with, say,

145
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
a metabolic surface with some

146
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
informational molecules attached

147
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
inside of this membrane body, right?

148
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we're on a road towards living systems.

149
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But if you saw this protocell, you would not

150
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
confuse this with something that was actually alive.

151
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,

152
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
it doesn't really do anything.

153
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So, something is missing.

154
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Some things are missing.

155
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So some things that are missing is,

156
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
for example, if you had a flow of energy

157
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
through a system, what we'd want

158
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is a protocell that can harvest

159
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
some of that energy in order to maintain itself,

160
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
much like living systems do.

161
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So we came up with a different protocell

162
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.

163
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,

164
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but a chemical metabolism inside

165
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that allows this protocell to use energy

166
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to do something, to actually become dynamic,

167
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
as we'll see here.

168
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
You add the droplet to the system.

169
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's a pool of water, and the protocell

170
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
starts moving itself around in the system.

171
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Okay? Oil droplet forms

172
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
through self-assembly, has a chemical

173
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
metabolism inside so it can use energy,

174
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and it uses that energy to move itself

175
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
around in its environment.

176
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
As we heard earlier, movement is very

177
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
important in these kinds of living systems.

178
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It is moving around, exploring its environment,

179
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and remodeling its environment, as you see,

180
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.

181
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system

182
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
trying to preserve itself.

183
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We take this same moving protocell here,

184
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and we put it in another experiment,

185
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
get it moving. Then I'm going

186
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to add some food to the system,

187
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and you'll see that in blue here, right?

188
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So I add some food source to the system.

189
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The protocell moves. It encounters the food.

190
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It reconfigures itself and actually then

191
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
is able to climb to the highest concentration

192
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
of food in that system and stop there.

193
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Alright? So not only do we have this system

194
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that has a body, it has a metabolism,

195
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
it can use energy, it moves around.

196
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It can sense its local environment

197
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and actually find resources

198
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in the environment to sustain itself.

199
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have

200
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
a neural system. This is just a sack of

201
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
chemicals that is able to have this interesting

202
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and complex lifelike behavior.

203
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
If we count the number of chemicals

204
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in that system, actually, including the water

205
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that's in the dish, we have five chemicals

206
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that can do this.

207
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So then we put these protocells together in a

208
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
single experiment to see what they would do,

209
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and depending on the conditions, we have

210
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
some protocells on the left that are

211
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
moving around and it likes to touch the other

212
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
structures in its environment.

213
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
On the other hand we have two moving

214
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
protocells that like to circle each other,

215
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.

216
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Right? So not only do individual protocells

217
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
have behavior, what we've interpreted as

218
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
behavior in this system, but we also have

219
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
basically population-level behavior

220
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
similar to what organisms have.

221
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So now that you're all experts on protocells,

222
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
we're going to play a game with these protocells.

223
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We're going to make two different kinds.

224
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry

225
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
inside that, when activated, the protocell

226
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
starts to vibrate around, just dancing.

227
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So remember, these are primitive things,

228
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so dancing protocells, that's very

229
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
interesting to us. (Laughter)

230
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The second protocell has a different

231
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
chemistry inside, and when activated,

232
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the protocells all come together and they fuse

233
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
into one big one. Right?

234
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And we just put these two together

235
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in the same system.

236
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So there's population A,

237
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
there's population B, and then

238
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
we activate the system,

239
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,

240
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they all come together. They fuse together

241
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to form one big blob, and the other protocell

242
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
just dances around. And this just happens

243
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
until all of the energy in the system is

244
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
basically used up, and then, game over.

245
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So then I repeated this experiment

246
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
a bunch of times, and one time

247
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
something very interesting happened.

248
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
So, I added these protocells together

249
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to the system, and protocell A and protocell B

250
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.

251
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
That didn't happen before. There it goes.

252
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There's a protocell AB now in this system.

253
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,

254
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
while protocell B does the fusing, okay?

255
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But then something even more interesting happens.

256
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Watch when these two large protocells,

257
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the hybrid ones, fuse together.

258
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now we have a dancing protocell

259
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)

260
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Just with blobs of chemicals, again.

261
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So the way this works is, you have

262
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a simple system of five chemicals here,

263
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
a simple system here. When they hybridize,

264
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you then form something that's different than

265
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
before, it's more complex than before,

266
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and you get the emergence of another kind of

267
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
lifelike behavior which

268
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in this case is replication.

269
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So since we can make some interesting

270
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
protocells that we like, interesting colors and

271
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
interesting behaviors, and they're very easy

272
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to make, and they have interesting lifelike

273
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
properties, perhaps these protocells have

274
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
something to tell us about the origin of life

275
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an

276
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
easily accessible step, one of the first steps

277
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
by which life got started on the early Earth.

278
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Certainly, there were molecules present on

279
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the early Earth, but they wouldn't have been

280
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
these pure compounds that we worked with

281
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in the lab and I showed in these experiments.

282
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Rather, they'd be a real complex mixture of

283
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
all kinds of stuff, because

284
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
uncontrolled chemical reactions produce

285
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
a diverse mixture of organic compounds.

286
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?

287
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully

288
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
characterize, even by modern methods, and

289
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the product looks brown, like this tar here

290
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
on the left. A pure compound

291
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is shown on the right, for contrast.

292
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So this is similar to what happens when you

293
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,

294
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you put them in a pan, and you apply energy.

295
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
You turn up the heat, you start making

296
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,

297
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
forming a brownish caramel, right?

298
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
If you let that go unregulated, you'll

299
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
continue to make and break chemical bonds,

300
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
forming an even more diverse mixture of

301
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
molecules that then forms this kind of black

302
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
tarry stuff in your pan, right, that's

303
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
difficult to wash out. So that's what

304
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the origin of life would have looked like.

305
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You needed to get life out of this junk that

306
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
is present on the early Earth,

307
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
four, 4.5 billion years ago.

308
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So the challenge then is,

309
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab,

310
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and try to make some protocells with lifelike

311
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
properties from this kind of primordial ooze.

312
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So we're able to then see the self-assembly

313
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
of these oil droplet bodies again

314
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that we've seen previously,

315
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and the black spots inside of there

316
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse,

317
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
very complex, organic black tar.

318
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And we put them into one of these

319
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
experiments, as you've seen earlier, and then

320
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
we watch lively movement that comes out.

321
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
They look really good, very nice movement,

322
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and also they appear to have some kind of

323
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
behavior where they kind of circle

324
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
around each other and follow each other,

325
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
similar to what we've seen before -- but again,

326
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
working with just primordial conditions,

327
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
no pure chemicals.

328
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
These are also, these tar-fueled protocells,

329
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
are also able to locate resources

330
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in their environment.

331
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I'm going to add some resource from the left,

332
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
here, that defuses into the system,

333
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and you can see, they really like that.

334
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
They become very energetic, and able

335
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to find the resource in the environment,

336
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
similar to what we saw before.

337
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But again, these are done in these primordial

338
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
conditions, really messy conditions,

339
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
not sort of sterile laboratory conditions.

340
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
These are very dirty little protocells,

341
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
as a matter of fact. (Laughter)

342
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But they have lifelike properties, is the point.

343
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So, doing these artificial life experiments

344
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
helps us define a potential path between

345
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
non-living and living systems.

346
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And not only that, but it helps us

347
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
broaden our view of what life is

348
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and what possible life there could be

349
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
out there -- life that could be very different

350
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
from life that we find here on Earth.

351
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And that leads me to the next

352
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
term, which is "weird life."

353
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This is a term by Steve Benner.

354
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is used in reference to a report

355
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in 2007 by the National Research Council

356
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in the United States, wherein

357
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
they tried to understand how we can

358
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
look for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,

359
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
especially if that life is very different from life

360
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
on Earth. If we went to another planet and

361
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we thought there might be life there,

362
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
how could we even recognize it as life?

363
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Well, they came up with three very general

364
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
criteria. First is -- and they're listed here.

365
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The first is, the system has to be in

366
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
non-equilibrium. That means the system

367
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
cannot be dead, in a matter of fact.

368
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Basically what that means is, you have

369
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
an input of energy into the system that life

370
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
can use and exploit to maintain itself.

371
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This is similar to having the Sun shining

372
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
on the Earth, driving photosynthesis,

373
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
driving the ecosystem.

374
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Without the Sun, there's likely to be

375
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
no life on this planet.

376
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form,

377
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
so that means even if we had some

378
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
interesting structures, interesting molecules

379
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
together but they were frozen solid,

380
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
then this is not a good place for life.

381
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And thirdly, we need to be able to make

382
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and break chemical bonds. And again

383
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
this is important because life transforms

384
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
resources from the environment into

385
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
building blocks so it can maintain itself.

386
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Now today, I told you about very strange

387
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and weird protocells -- some that contain clay,

388
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
some that have primordial ooze in them,

389
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
some that have basically oil

390
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
instead of water inside of them.

391
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Most of these don't contain DNA,

392
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
but yet they have lifelike properties.

393
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
But these protocells satisfy

394
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
these general requirements of living systems.

395
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So by making these chemical, artificial

396
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
life experiments, we hope not only

397
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to understand something fundamental

398
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
about the origin of life and the existence

399
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
of life on this planet, but also

400
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
what possible life there could be

401
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
out there in the universe. Thank you.

402
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.278,000 --> 0:00:2,000
On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot

3
0:00:20.582,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery

4
0:00:25.045,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of

5
0:00:29.552,000 --> 0:00:33,000
making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.

6
0:00:33.599,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This one is more than 400 years old.

7
0:00:36.864,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,

8
0:00:41.328,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and it was the imperfections that people cherished.

9
0:00:45.624,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.

10
0:00:53.696,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself

11
0:00:56.805,000 --> 0:01:,000
takes another day or two to cool down, but raku

12
0:01:01.289,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln

13
0:01:06.092,000 --> 0:01:1,000
up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,

14
0:01:10.647,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,

15
0:01:14.305,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,

16
0:01:17.123,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and you reach in with these long metal tongs,

17
0:01:19.71,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot

18
0:01:24.195,000 --> 0:01:28,000
would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,

19
0:01:29.109,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.

20
0:01:32.341,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama

21
0:01:35.506,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,

22
0:01:39.171,000 --> 0:01:42,000
which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,

23
0:01:42.195,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.

24
0:01:47.107,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.

25
0:01:51.987,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.

26
0:01:57.085,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,

27
0:02:01.581,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,

28
0:02:05.885,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen,

29
0:02:08.35,000 --> 0:02:11,000
like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful

30
0:02:11.623,000 --> 0:02:13,000
on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees

31
0:02:14.234,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to room temperature in the space of just a minute.

32
0:02:18.313,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.

33
0:02:24.264,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I find in so many things that tension between

34
0:02:28.029,000 --> 0:02:31,000
what I can control and what I have to let go

35
0:02:31.464,000 --> 0:02:34,000
happens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show

36
0:02:35.258,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.

37
0:02:40.343,000 --> 0:02:43,000
When I sat down to write a book about creativity,

38
0:02:44.317,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I realized that the steps were reversed.

39
0:02:46.801,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to

40
0:02:50.45,000 --> 0:02:54,000
immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists

41
0:02:55.054,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened

42
0:02:59.529,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to these stories, I realized that creativity

43
0:03:04.841,000 --> 0:03:07,000
grows out of everyday experiences

44
0:03:08.169,000 --> 0:03:11,000
more often than you might think, including

45
0:03:11.873,000 --> 0:03:13,000
letting go.

46
0:03:14.793,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)

47
0:03:18.583,000 --> 0:03:2,000
That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens

48
0:03:21.532,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows

49
0:03:24.937,000 --> 0:03:26,000
from the broken places.

50
0:03:27.714,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The best way to learn about anything

51
0:03:30.361,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story

52
0:03:34.395,000 --> 0:03:39,000
about work and play and about four aspects of life

53
0:03:39.577,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that we need to embrace

54
0:03:41.973,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in order for our own creativity to flourish.

55
0:03:46.041,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The first embrace is something that we think,

56
0:03:48.057,000 --> 0:03:52,000
"Oh, this is very easy," but it's actually getting harder,

57
0:03:52.263,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and that's paying attention to the world around us.

58
0:03:56.258,000 --> 0:04:,000
So many artists speak about needing to be open,

59
0:04:00.713,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to embrace experience, and that's hard to do when

60
0:04:04.153,000 --> 0:04:07,000
you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that

61
0:04:07.771,000 --> 0:04:1,000
takes all of your focus.

62
0:04:11.358,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up

63
0:04:15.498,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,

64
0:04:20.103,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.

65
0:04:23.796,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.

66
0:04:26.668,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up

67
0:04:29.524,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,

68
0:04:32.78,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,

69
0:04:36.428,000 --> 0:04:39,000
was traveling folk theater that would come through the town

70
0:04:39.98,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I would go off and see these great battles

71
0:04:43.292,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of good and evil by two people in a school field

72
0:04:46.708,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with no props but with a lot of, you know,

73
0:04:49.244,000 --> 0:04:52,000
passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.

74
0:04:52.939,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,

75
0:04:55.733,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of

76
0:04:59.228,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,

77
0:05:02.758,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.

78
0:05:07.748,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?

79
0:05:09.655,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You can see the sort of break in the everyday.

80
0:05:12.075,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil,

81
0:05:14.794,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl

82
0:05:20.327,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with thousands of other people watching this performance,

83
0:05:23.925,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but she was ready. She was ready to open up

84
0:05:26.875,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to what it sparked in her, and it led her,

85
0:05:30.004,000 --> 0:05:32,000
as she said, down this path to become

86
0:05:32.619,000 --> 0:05:34,000
an award-winning filmmaker.

87
0:05:35.422,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So being open for that experience that might change you

88
0:05:38.243,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is the first thing we need to embrace.

89
0:05:41.176,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work

90
0:05:46.955,000 --> 0:05:5,000
comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.

91
0:05:51.827,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The novelist Richard Ford speaks about

92
0:05:55.481,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a childhood challenge that continues to be something

93
0:05:59.523,000 --> 0:06:03,000
he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.

94
0:06:04.283,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way

95
0:06:07.19,000 --> 0:06:1,000
through school not really reading more than the minimum,

96
0:06:11.022,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and still to this day can't read silently

97
0:06:13.55,000 --> 0:06:15,000
much faster than I can read aloud,

98
0:06:16.398,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me

99
0:06:20.174,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow

100
0:06:23.319,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly

101
0:06:27.814,000 --> 0:06:3,000
into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language

102
0:06:31.346,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and of sentences that are not just the cognitive

103
0:06:34.158,000 --> 0:06:37,000
aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,

104
0:06:37.271,000 --> 0:06:38,000
what words look like, where paragraphs break,

105
0:06:39.114,000 --> 0:06:42,000
where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that

106
0:06:42.141,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it

107
0:06:45.079,000 --> 0:06:49,000
really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences

108
0:06:49.622,000 --> 0:06:53,000
as I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities,

109
0:06:53.982,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which I think has helped me write sentences.

110
0:06:57.246,000 --> 0:07:01,000
JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize,

111
0:07:01.326,000 --> 0:07:06,000
says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.

112
0:07:06.478,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word

113
0:07:09.249,000 --> 0:07:13,000
intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.

114
0:07:13.362,000 --> 0:07:16,000
He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music

115
0:07:16.87,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in language.

116
0:07:19.934,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Artists also speak about how pushing up against

117
0:07:24.504,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing

118
0:07:27.898,000 --> 0:07:3,000
into what they can't do, helps them focus

119
0:07:31.246,000 --> 0:07:34,000
on finding their own voice.

120
0:07:34.485,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,

121
0:07:38.63,000 --> 0:07:4,000
as a young artist, he thought he was a painter,

122
0:07:41.55,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and he lived in Florence after graduate school.

123
0:07:45.829,000 --> 0:07:47,000
While he was there, he traveled to Madrid,

124
0:07:48.398,000 --> 0:07:5,000
where he went to the Prado to see this picture

125
0:07:51.112,000 --> 0:07:54,000
by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.

126
0:07:54.872,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas,"

127
0:07:59.976,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and it's the picture of a little princess

128
0:08:02.185,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over

129
0:08:05.872,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror,

130
0:08:09.248,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen

131
0:08:12.545,000 --> 0:08:15,000
of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand

132
0:08:15.95,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to look at the picture.

133
0:08:17.725,000 --> 0:08:22,000
As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.

134
0:08:22.792,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand

135
0:08:27.485,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and his palette in the other.

136
0:08:29.889,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,

137
0:08:31.917,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,

138
0:08:34.527,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."

139
0:08:38.522,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I thought, "I'm not going to be able to do that painting."

140
0:08:40.774,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch

141
0:08:43.975,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and painting squares out of randomness,

142
0:08:48.413,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped

143
0:08:50.431,000 --> 0:08:53,000
all my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.

144
0:08:53.661,000 --> 0:08:55,000
JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might

145
0:08:56.493,000 --> 0:08:59,000
have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy

146
0:09:00.101,000 --> 0:09:03,000
who'd been dead for 300 years, and realized,

147
0:09:03.869,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went back

148
0:09:07.741,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work

149
0:09:10.572,000 --> 0:09:13,000
up to that point, and threw it in a river.

150
0:09:14.375,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment,

151
0:09:18.311,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City,

152
0:09:21.837,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and he put together a list of verbs

153
0:09:24.751,000 --> 0:09:27,000
— to roll, to crease, to fold —

154
0:09:28.039,000 --> 0:09:3,000
more than a hundred of them, and as he said,

155
0:09:30.735,000 --> 0:09:32,000
he just started playing around. He did these things

156
0:09:32.772,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead

157
0:09:36.089,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing

158
0:09:39.887,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to rubber, and when he got to the direction "to lift,"

159
0:09:45.063,000 --> 0:09:5,000
he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.

160
0:09:50.161,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Richard Serra had to let go of painting

161
0:09:53.121,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in order to embark on this playful exploration

162
0:09:56.561,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that led him to the work that he's known for today:

163
0:09:59.831,000 --> 0:10:04,000
huge curves of steel that require our time and motion

164
0:10:05.409,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to experience. In sculpture,

165
0:10:09.146,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.

166
0:10:12.417,000 --> 0:10:16,000
He makes us the subject of his art.

167
0:10:16.913,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So experience and challenge

168
0:10:20.849,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and limitations are all things we need to embrace

169
0:10:24.509,000 --> 0:10:26,000
for creativity to flourish.

170
0:10:27.105,000 --> 0:10:3,000
There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.

171
0:10:30.665,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's the embrace of loss,

172
0:10:33.025,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the oldest and most constant of human experiences.

173
0:10:37.315,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In order to create, we have to stand in that space

174
0:10:40.138,000 --> 0:10:43,000
between what we see in the world and what we hope for,

175
0:10:43.938,000 --> 0:10:47,000
looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,

176
0:10:48.745,000 --> 0:10:5,000
at war, at death.

177
0:10:51.319,000 --> 0:10:53,000
That's a tough space to stand in.

178
0:10:53.709,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The educator Parker Palmer calls it "the tragic gap,"

179
0:10:59.098,000 --> 0:11:02,000
tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable,

180
0:11:03.065,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,

181
0:11:06.105,000 --> 0:11:08,000
"You can hold that tension like a violin string

182
0:11:09.049,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and make something beautiful."

183
0:11:12.485,000 --> 0:11:15,000
That tension resonates in the work of the photographer

184
0:11:15.623,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Joel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was

185
0:11:18.833,000 --> 0:11:21,000
known for his street photography, for capturing a moment

186
0:11:22.073,000 --> 0:11:25,000
on the street, and also for his beautiful photographs

187
0:11:25.755,000 --> 0:11:28,000
of landscapes -- of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,

188
0:11:29.439,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of light.

189
0:11:32.121,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years

190
0:11:35.39,000 --> 0:11:38,000
was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown

191
0:11:39.388,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to the World Trade Center, and he photographed

192
0:11:42.303,000 --> 0:11:46,000
those buildings in every sort of light.

193
0:11:46.636,000 --> 0:11:49,000
You know where this story goes.

194
0:11:50.286,000 --> 0:11:52,000
On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town,

195
0:11:52.774,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site

196
0:11:57.373,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of the destruction.

197
0:11:59.498,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,

198
0:12:01.677,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers

199
0:12:04.577,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke

200
0:12:06.775,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera

201
0:12:10.445,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,

202
0:12:13.445,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,

203
0:12:17.789,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and said, "Hey, no pictures!"

204
0:12:20.229,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And it was such a blow that it woke me up,

205
0:12:23.453,000 --> 0:12:27,000
in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.

206
0:12:27.509,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And when I asked her why no pictures, she said,

207
0:12:29.552,000 --> 0:12:32,000
"It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."

208
0:12:32.643,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And I asked her, "What would happen if I was a member

209
0:12:34.112,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of the press?" And she told me,

210
0:12:36.316,000 --> 0:12:4,000
"Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corps

211
0:12:40.41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
tied up in a little penned-in area,

212
0:12:44.22,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and I said, "Well, when do they go in?"

213
0:12:45.741,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and she said, "Probably never."

214
0:12:48.223,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,

215
0:12:52.714,000 --> 0:12:54,000
probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.

216
0:12:55.508,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I thought, "Oh, if there's no pictures,

217
0:12:57.683,000 --> 0:13:,000
then there'll be no record. We need a record."

218
0:13:01.189,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I thought, "I'm gonna make that record.

219
0:13:03.059,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to

220
0:13:05.346,000 --> 0:13:06,000
see this history disappear."

221
0:13:07.214,000 --> 0:13:11,000
JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,

222
0:13:11.457,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and got a pass into the World Trade Center site,

223
0:13:13.97,000 --> 0:13:17,000
where he photographed for nine months almost every day.

224
0:13:18.202,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Looking at these photographs today brings back

225
0:13:21.146,000 --> 0:13:23,000
the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes

226
0:13:24.051,000 --> 0:13:25,000
when I went home to my family at night.

227
0:13:26.048,000 --> 0:13:29,000
My office was just a few blocks away.

228
0:13:29.466,000 --> 0:13:32,000
But some of these photographs are beautiful,

229
0:13:33.082,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz

230
0:13:36.197,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to make such beauty out of such devastation?

231
0:13:40.539,000 --> 0:13:43,000
JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful

232
0:13:43.905,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and tragic and horrific and everything, but

233
0:13:47.276,000 --> 0:13:51,000
it was also as, in nature, an enormous event

234
0:13:51.572,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that was transformed after the fact into this residue,

235
0:13:56.738,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and like many other ruins

236
0:13:58.554,000 --> 0:14:01,000
— you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace —

237
0:14:02.403,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.

238
0:14:07.04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I mean, there were afternoons I was down there,

239
0:14:08.913,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air

240
0:14:12.563,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself

241
0:14:16.594,000 --> 0:14:19,000
recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature

242
0:14:20.478,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and the fact that nature, as time,

243
0:14:23.232,000 --> 0:14:26,000
is erasing this wound.

244
0:14:26.627,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.

245
0:14:30.461,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It gets further and further away from the day,

246
0:14:32.79,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and light and seasons temper it in some way,

247
0:14:37.145,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.

248
0:14:41.289,000 --> 0:14:44,000
The reality is, there's the Woolworth Building

249
0:14:44.773,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim

250
0:14:50.601,000 --> 0:14:53,000
across a theater, and it's turning pink,

251
0:14:54.545,000 --> 0:14:57,000
you know, and down below there are hoses spraying,

252
0:14:57.648,000 --> 0:15:,000
and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water

253
0:15:00.657,000 --> 0:15:04,000
is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,

254
0:15:04.685,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?"

255
0:15:06.862,000 --> 0:15:1,000
But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that,

256
0:15:11.063,000 --> 0:15:12,000
you have to take a picture.

257
0:15:12.957,000 --> 0:15:15,000
JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency,

258
0:15:16.15,000 --> 0:15:21,000
of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.

259
0:15:21.95,000 --> 0:15:24,000
When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much

260
0:15:25.303,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination

261
0:15:29.088,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work,

262
0:15:33.671,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and he laughed, and he said, "I'm stubborn,

263
0:15:35.847,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but I think what's more important

264
0:15:38.251,000 --> 0:15:41,000
is my passionate optimism."

265
0:15:41.712,000 --> 0:15:43,000
The first time I told these stories, a man in the audience

266
0:15:44.515,000 --> 0:15:47,000
raised his hand and said, "All these artists talk about

267
0:15:48.005,000 --> 0:15:52,000
their work, not their art, which has got me thinking about

268
0:15:52.743,000 --> 0:15:54,000
my work and where the creativity is there,

269
0:15:55.411,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and I'm not an artist." He's right. We all wrestle

270
0:16:00.039,000 --> 0:16:04,000
with experience and challenge, limits and loss.

271
0:16:04.655,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Creativity is essential to all of us,

272
0:16:06.906,000 --> 0:16:08,000
whether we're scientists or teachers,

273
0:16:09.559,000 --> 0:16:13,000
parents or entrepreneurs.

274
0:16:13.918,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I want to leave you with another

275
0:16:16.095,000 --> 0:16:19,000
image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one

276
0:16:19.189,000 --> 0:16:21,000
is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.

277
0:16:22.159,000 --> 0:16:24,000
It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see

278
0:16:24.695,000 --> 0:16:27,000
the fingermarks where the potter pinched it.

279
0:16:28.338,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But as you can also see, this one did break

280
0:16:31.255,000 --> 0:16:33,000
at some point in its hundred years.

281
0:16:33.975,000 --> 0:16:35,000
But the person who put it back together,

282
0:16:36.735,000 --> 0:16:38,000
instead of hiding the cracks,

283
0:16:39.299,000 --> 0:16:44,000
decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.

284
0:16:45.015,000 --> 0:16:49,000
This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,

285
0:16:49.459,000 --> 0:16:52,000
than it was when it was first made,

286
0:16:52.471,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and we can look at those cracks, because

287
0:16:54.701,000 --> 0:16:56,000
they tell the story that we all live,

288
0:16:57.066,000 --> 0:17:,000
of the cycle of creation and destruction,

289
0:17:00.743,000 --> 0:17:04,000
of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces

290
0:17:05.67,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and making something new.

291
0:17:07.669,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Thank you. (Applause)

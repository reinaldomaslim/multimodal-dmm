1
0:00:00.062,000 --> 0:00:04,000
We survey CEOs, police officers, truck drivers, cooks, engineers.

2
0:00:04.673,000 --> 0:00:06,000
If people are working, we've surveyed them.

3
0:00:06.721,000 --> 0:00:08,000
And what we know, in terms of their happiness:

4
0:00:08.919,000 --> 0:00:09,000
workers all want the same things.

5
0:00:10.79,000 --> 0:00:12,000
[The Way We Work]

6
0:00:15.427,000 --> 0:00:17,000
There's three billion working people in the world.

7
0:00:17.816,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And about 40 percent of them would say they're happy at work.

8
0:00:20.729,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That means about 1.8 billion, or almost two billion people,

9
0:00:24.583,000 --> 0:00:25,000
are not happy at work.

10
0:00:25.981,000 --> 0:00:26,000
What does that do,

11
0:00:27.208,000 --> 0:00:3,000
both to those people and the organizations that they work in?

12
0:00:30.457,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Well, let's talk about money.

13
0:00:31.909,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Organizations that have a lot of happy employees

14
0:00:34.769,000 --> 0:00:35,000
have three times the revenue growth,

15
0:00:36.523,000 --> 0:00:38,000
compared to organizations where that's not true.

16
0:00:38.816,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They outperform the stock market by a factor of three.

17
0:00:41.554,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And if you look at employee turnover,

18
0:00:43.459,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it's half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees.

19
0:00:48.007,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The miracle thing is,

20
0:00:49.207,000 --> 0:00:51,000
you don't have to spend more money to make this happen.

21
0:00:51.81,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's not about ping-pong tables and massages and pet walking.

22
0:00:54.84,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's not about the perks.

23
0:00:56.102,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's all about how they're treated by their leaders

24
0:00:58.578,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and by the people that they work with.

25
0:01:00.458,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So I'd like to share a few ideas that create happy employees.

26
0:01:04.474,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Idea number one:

27
0:01:06.118,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in organizations where employees are happy,

28
0:01:08.785,000 --> 0:01:1,000
what you find is two things are present:

29
0:01:10.892,000 --> 0:01:11,000
trust and respect.

30
0:01:12.432,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Leaders often say,

31
0:01:13.647,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"We trust our employees.

32
0:01:15.043,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We empower our employees."

33
0:01:16.559,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And then when an employee needs a laptop --

34
0:01:18.612,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and this is a true example --

35
0:01:20.058,000 --> 0:01:22,000
15 people have to approve that laptop.

36
0:01:22.808,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So for the employee, all the words are right,

37
0:01:25.126,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but 15 levels of approval for a $1,500 laptop?

38
0:01:28.987,000 --> 0:01:31,000
You've actually spent more money than the laptop, on the approval.

39
0:01:32.242,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And the employee feels maybe they're really not trusted.

40
0:01:35.987,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So what can an organization do to have a high level of trust?

41
0:01:40.422,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The first organization that comes to mind is Four Seasons.

42
0:01:43.372,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They have magnificent properties all around the world.

43
0:01:46.07,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And their employees are told,

44
0:01:47.619,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"Do whatever you think is right when servicing the customer."

45
0:01:50.721,000 --> 0:01:54,000
To hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right

46
0:01:55.102,000 --> 0:01:56,000
makes the employees feel great.

47
0:01:56.958,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And this is why they're known for delivering some of the best service

48
0:02:00.241,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in the world.

49
0:02:01.416,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Idea number two: fairness.

50
0:02:03.98,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The thing that erodes trust in an organization

51
0:02:07.209,000 --> 0:02:08,000
faster than anything else

52
0:02:08.747,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is when employees feel that they're being treated unfairly.

53
0:02:11.883,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Employees want to be treated the same,

54
0:02:13.761,000 --> 0:02:15,000
regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age

55
0:02:16.623,000 --> 0:02:18,000
or their experience or their job category,

56
0:02:18.937,000 --> 0:02:19,000
compared to anyone else.

57
0:02:20.412,000 --> 0:02:23,000
When I think about great organizations who get fairness right,

58
0:02:23.501,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the first organization that comes to mind is Salesforce.

59
0:02:26.15,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They found that men and women working in the same job

60
0:02:28.935,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with the same level of proficiency

61
0:02:30.689,000 --> 0:02:31,000
were making different amounts of money.

62
0:02:32.578,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So immediately, they calculated the difference,

63
0:02:34.959,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and they invested three million dollars to try and balance things out.

64
0:02:39.065,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Idea number three is listening.

65
0:02:41.617,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So, to be a listener who connects with all types of people,

66
0:02:45.332,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we have to unlearn a few things.

67
0:02:47.443,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We've all been taught about active listening and eye contact --

68
0:02:51.435,000 --> 0:02:52,000
an intense stare

69
0:02:53.189,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and a compassionate look.

70
0:02:54.935,000 --> 0:02:55,000
That's not listening.

71
0:02:56.138,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Repeating what the person says -- that's not listening.

72
0:02:59.224,000 --> 0:03:,000
Being humble

73
0:03:00.457,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible --

74
0:03:03.779,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that's what listening is.

75
0:03:05.239,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And employees can feel whether you're doing that or not.

76
0:03:07.899,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They want to know, when they talk to you and share an idea,

77
0:03:11.11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
did you consider it when you made a decision?

78
0:03:13.408,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they're speaking

79
0:03:17.697,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is to know that what they say matters so much

80
0:03:21.435,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you might actually change your mind.

81
0:03:23.538,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Otherwise, what's the point of the conversation?

82
0:03:27.533,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We all know the things we need to change,

83
0:03:29.946,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the things that we need to do differently.

84
0:03:32.003,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The way you behave, the way you treat others,

85
0:03:34.653,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the way you respond, the way you support,

86
0:03:37.959,000 --> 0:03:39,000
defines the work experience for everyone around you.

87
0:03:40.729,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Changing to be a better person --

88
0:03:42.793,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the world is littered with those failures.

89
0:03:44.84,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But changing because there's something you believe in,

90
0:03:47.77,000 --> 0:03:48,000
some purpose that you have,

91
0:03:49.777,000 --> 0:03:51,000
where you're willing to risk almost everything

92
0:03:52.362,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because it's so important to you --

93
0:03:54.285,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that's the reason to change.

94
0:03:55.983,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If it's not, you should probably find a different place to work.

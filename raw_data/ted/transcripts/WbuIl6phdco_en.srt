2
0:00:15.358,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I have bad news, I have good news,

3
0:00:18.419,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I have a task.

4
0:00:20.284,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So the bad news is that we all get sick.

5
0:00:23.227,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I get sick. You get sick.

6
0:00:25.499,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is,

7
0:00:28.041,000 --> 0:00:3,000
how sick do we get? Is it something that kills us?

8
0:00:30.918,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Is it something that we survive?

9
0:00:32.263,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Is it something that we can treat?

10
0:00:34.191,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.

11
0:00:37.447,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.

12
0:00:40.933,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And for a long time, it was the gods, right?

13
0:00:42.89,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me,

14
0:00:46.044,000 --> 0:00:48,000
right? Or God, singular, more recently,

15
0:00:48.46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is punishing me or judging me.

16
0:00:51.124,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And as long as we've looked for explanations,

17
0:00:53.804,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science,

18
0:00:57.515,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which is hypotheses as to why we get sick,

19
0:01:00.004,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.

20
0:01:04.744,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called "The Canon of Medicine,"

21
0:01:08.777,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and the rules he laid out for testing medicines

22
0:01:11.183,000 --> 0:01:12,000
are actually really similar to the rules we have today,

23
0:01:12.972,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength,

24
0:01:15.917,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the medicine needs to be pure, and in the end we need

25
0:01:18.314,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes

26
0:01:21.455,000 --> 0:01:25,000
of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing,

27
0:01:25.92,000 --> 0:01:27,000
right, you get some beautiful results,

28
0:01:28.576,000 --> 0:01:29,000
even when we didn't have very good technologies.

29
0:01:30.018,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis

30
0:01:33.08,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that was way outside the box for his time, in the late 1800s.

31
0:01:35.985,000 --> 0:01:37,000
He thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing.

32
0:01:38.833,000 --> 0:01:4,000
He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos.

33
0:01:41.259,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And they laughed at him. For 20 years, they called this guy

34
0:01:43.621,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"the mosquito man." But he ran an experiment in people,

35
0:01:47.11,000 --> 0:01:5,000
right? He had this hypothesis, and he tested it in people.

36
0:01:50.213,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents

37
0:01:54.855,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever.

38
0:01:57.89,000 --> 0:02:,000
So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes

39
0:02:00.912,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and some of the people were in tents that were full

40
0:02:02.131,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever.

41
0:02:04.387,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust

42
0:02:07.788,000 --> 0:02:1,000
called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever.

43
0:02:11.21,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.

44
0:02:14.586,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And this is what those people signed up for.

45
0:02:16.545,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba

46
0:02:19.635,000 --> 0:02:23,000
at that time. You suffered in a tent, in the heat, alone,

47
0:02:24.169,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and you probably died.

48
0:02:26.865,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But people volunteered for this.

49
0:02:30.082,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design

50
0:02:33.393,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing.

51
0:02:36.306,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They signed this document, and it's called an informed consent document.

52
0:02:40.225,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And informed consent is an idea that we should be

53
0:02:42.738,000 --> 0:02:44,000
very proud of as a society, right? It's something that

54
0:02:44.964,000 --> 0:02:46,000
separates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg,

55
0:02:47.73,000 --> 0:02:49,000
enforced medical experimentation. It's the idea

56
0:02:50.605,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement.

57
0:02:54.393,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters,

58
0:02:58.502,000 --> 0:03:,000
from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical

59
0:03:01.355,000 --> 0:03:04,000
study that we don't understand, or that we don't agree to.

60
0:03:05.107,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis,

61
0:03:09.436,000 --> 0:03:11,000
experimentation in humans, and informed consent,

62
0:03:12.033,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and you get what we call clinical study, and it's how we do

63
0:03:14.698,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter

64
0:03:17.713,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if you're in the north, the south, the east, the west.

65
0:03:20.055,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate,

66
0:03:24.168,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so if we're going to look at a new drug, right,

67
0:03:26.027,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments,

68
0:03:29.025,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and we gain consent for that study, to make sure

69
0:03:31.354,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that we're not screwing people over as part of it.

70
0:03:34.003,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But the world is changing around the clinical study,

71
0:03:37.667,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which has been fairly well established for tens of years

72
0:03:41.033,000 --> 0:03:42,000
if not 50 to 100 years.

73
0:03:42.933,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So now we're able to gather data about our genomes,

74
0:03:45.984,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but, as we saw earlier, our genomes aren't dispositive.

75
0:03:48.844,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We're able to gather information about our environment.

76
0:03:51.61,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And more importantly, we're able to gather information

77
0:03:53.52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
about our choices, because it turns out that what we think of

78
0:03:56.36,000 --> 0:03:58,000
as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies,

79
0:03:59.08,000 --> 0:04:02,000
our genomes, our choices and our environment.

80
0:04:02.729,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good

81
0:04:05.473,000 --> 0:04:07,000
at studying that because they are based on the idea

82
0:04:08.105,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of person-to-person interaction. You interact

83
0:04:10.019,000 --> 0:04:12,000
with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study.

84
0:04:12.114,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him,

85
0:04:14.729,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right?

86
0:04:18.524,000 --> 0:04:2,000
His choices ran through to me. He was a smoker,

87
0:04:21.415,000 --> 0:04:23,000
like most people were. This is my son.

88
0:04:23.999,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him,

89
0:04:27.441,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and my choices are going to affect his health.

90
0:04:29.993,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The technology between these two pictures

91
0:04:32.687,000 --> 0:04:35,000
cannot be more different, but the methodology

92
0:04:36.36,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.

93
0:04:40.484,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We just have better statistics.

94
0:04:43.152,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part

95
0:04:46.604,000 --> 0:04:48,000
after World War II, around the time that picture was taken.

96
0:04:49.195,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That was 70 years ago, and the way we gain informed consent,

97
0:04:53.129,000 --> 0:04:55,000
this tool that was created to protect us from harm,

98
0:04:56.006,000 --> 0:04:59,000
now creates silos. So the data that we collect

99
0:04:59.672,000 --> 0:05:01,000
for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials

100
0:05:02.398,000 --> 0:05:04,000
goes into silos where it can only be used

101
0:05:05.013,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research.

102
0:05:08.237,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Right? It can't be networked. It can't be integrated.

103
0:05:11.131,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed.

104
0:05:14.664,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.

105
0:05:17.617,000 --> 0:05:2,000
A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.

106
0:05:20.685,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Computer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork.

107
0:05:24.828,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And this is an accident. These are tools that we created

108
0:05:28.814,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to protect us from harm, but what they're doing

109
0:05:32.081,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is protecting us from innovation now.

110
0:05:34.611,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right?

111
0:05:37.876,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created

112
0:05:40.575,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to take us for good.

113
0:05:42.934,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And so if you think about it, the depressing thing is that

114
0:05:46.078,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Facebook would never make a change to something

115
0:05:48.211,000 --> 0:05:5,000
as important as an advertising algorithm

116
0:05:50.782,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial.

117
0:05:55.193,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We cannot take the information from past trials

118
0:05:58.855,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and put them together to form statistically significant samples.

119
0:06:03.009,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And that sucks, right? So 45 percent of men develop

120
0:06:06.493,000 --> 0:06:09,000
cancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer.

121
0:06:09.59,000 --> 0:06:11,000
One in four men dies of cancer.

122
0:06:11.934,000 --> 0:06:14,000
One in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States.

123
0:06:15.49,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And three out of the four drugs we give you

124
0:06:17.718,000 --> 0:06:2,000
if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me.

125
0:06:21.231,000 --> 0:06:22,000
My sister is a cancer survivor.

126
0:06:23.194,000 --> 0:06:26,000
My mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks.

127
0:06:26.783,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy

128
0:06:28.973,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time.

129
0:06:32.46,000 --> 0:06:35,000
People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you,

130
0:06:36.155,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created

131
0:06:39.596,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used,

132
0:06:42.694,000 --> 0:06:44,000
especially when only three to four percent of people

133
0:06:44.744,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study,

134
0:06:47.542,000 --> 0:06:5,000
their reaction is not, "Thank you, God, for protecting my privacy."

135
0:06:51.1,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's outrage

136
0:06:53.797,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that we have this information and we can't use it.

137
0:06:55.922,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And it's an accident.

138
0:06:58.398,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous.

139
0:07:01.453,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Two hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States.

140
0:07:05.108,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States.

141
0:07:08.327,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And it's getting worse.

142
0:07:10.9,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So the good news is that some things have changed,

143
0:07:13.882,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the most important thing that's changed

144
0:07:15.435,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is that we can now measure ourselves in ways

145
0:07:17.773,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that used to be the dominion of the health system.

146
0:07:20.831,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust.

147
0:07:22.989,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid.

148
0:07:26.031,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We can reach back and grab that dust,

149
0:07:28.407,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices

150
0:07:30.821,000 --> 0:07:32,000
are part of our health, what we eat is a really important

151
0:07:33.501,000 --> 0:07:35,000
aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple

152
0:07:36.19,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and basic and take a picture of your food,

153
0:07:38.147,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and if enough people do that, we can learn a lot about

154
0:07:41.031,000 --> 0:07:42,000
how our food affects our health.

155
0:07:42.456,000 --> 0:07:46,000
One interesting thing that came out of this — this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery —

156
0:07:46.972,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier

157
0:07:49.462,000 --> 0:07:52,000
than other people's pizza is. Okay? (Laughter)

158
0:07:52.9,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And it seems like a trivial result, but this is the sort of research

159
0:07:56.508,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that used to take the health system years

160
0:07:58.822,000 --> 0:08:,000
and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish.

161
0:08:01.115,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people.

162
0:08:04.839,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I don't have any financial interest in it.

163
0:08:07.463,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done,

164
0:08:10.159,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.

165
0:08:12.977,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's.

166
0:08:15.783,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This is the interpretation of it. As you can see,

167
0:08:18.015,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer,

168
0:08:20.615,000 --> 0:08:24,000
22 percent risk of psoriasis and a 14 percent risk of Alzheimer's disease.

169
0:08:24.838,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So that means, if you're a geneticist, you're freaking out,

170
0:08:27.445,000 --> 0:08:31,000
going, "Oh my God, you told everyone you carry the ApoE E4 allele. What's wrong with you?"

171
0:08:31.479,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Right? When I got these results, I started talking to doctors,

172
0:08:35.167,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and they told me not to tell anyone, and my reaction is,

173
0:08:37.576,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease?"

174
0:08:40.864,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And no one could tell me yes.

175
0:08:43.928,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And I live in a web world where, when you share things,

176
0:08:46.734,000 --> 0:08:48,000
beautiful stuff happens, not bad stuff.

177
0:08:49.444,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So I started putting this in my slide decks,

178
0:08:51.344,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and I got even more obnoxious, and I went to my doctor,

179
0:08:53.805,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and I said, "I'd like to actually get my bloodwork.

180
0:08:55.787,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Please give me back my data." So this is my most recent bloodwork.

181
0:08:58.577,000 --> 0:09:,000
As you can see, I have high cholesterol.

182
0:09:00.946,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I have particularly high bad cholesterol, and I have some

183
0:09:03.697,000 --> 0:09:06,000
bad liver numbers, but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine

184
0:09:06.7,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the night before we ran the test. (Laughter)

185
0:09:09.409,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Right. But look at how non-computable this information is.

186
0:09:13.822,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom

187
0:09:16.796,000 --> 0:09:19,000
from a data perspective, and I had to go into the system

188
0:09:20.395,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and get it out.

189
0:09:22.557,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So the thing that I'm proposing we do here

190
0:09:25.839,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust,

191
0:09:28.255,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype,

192
0:09:31.233,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records,

193
0:09:33.934,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and we use it to build something together, which is a commons.

194
0:09:37.374,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And there's been a lot of talk about commonses, right,

195
0:09:40.518,000 --> 0:09:42,000
here, there, everywhere, right. A commons is nothing more

196
0:09:43.466,000 --> 0:09:45,000
than a public good that we build out of private goods.

197
0:09:46.394,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We do it voluntarily, and we do it through standardized

198
0:09:49.163,000 --> 0:09:51,000
legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies.

199
0:09:51.963,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build

200
0:09:55.234,000 --> 0:09:57,000
together because we think it's important.

201
0:09:57.754,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And a commons of data is something that's really unique,

202
0:10:00.386,000 --> 0:10:02,000
because we make it from our own data. And although

203
0:10:03.254,000 --> 0:10:05,000
a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control

204
0:10:05.541,000 --> 0:10:07,000
around data, and obsess around privacy, at least

205
0:10:07.796,000 --> 0:10:1,000
some of us really like to share as a form of control,

206
0:10:10.844,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and what's remarkable about digital commonses

207
0:10:13.197,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough

208
0:10:16.729,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to generate something massive and beautiful.

209
0:10:19.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So not that many programmers write free software,

210
0:10:21.798,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but we have the Apache web server.

211
0:10:24.133,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit,

212
0:10:26.83,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but it works. So as long as some people like to share

213
0:10:30.839,000 --> 0:10:33,000
as their form of control, we can build a commons, as long as we can get the information out.

214
0:10:34.583,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And in biology, the numbers are even better.

215
0:10:36.959,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people, we'd like to take

216
0:10:39.511,000 --> 0:10:42,000
your biosamples, your blood, and share them in a biobank,

217
0:10:42.833,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and only five percent of the people opted out.

218
0:10:45.205,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science-positive state

219
0:10:48.297,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in the United States of America. (Laughter)

220
0:10:51.336,000 --> 0:10:53,000
But only five percent of the people wanted out.

221
0:10:53.714,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.

222
0:10:57.737,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects,

223
0:11:02.22,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians,

224
0:11:05.493,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data

225
0:11:08.407,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because they can use it to tease signals out of noise.

226
0:11:11.35,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And those correlations that they can tease out, they're not

227
0:11:14.318,000 --> 0:11:17,000
necessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age,

228
0:11:18.19,000 --> 0:11:2,000
is like a giant set of power tools

229
0:11:20.55,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health,

230
0:11:24.425,000 --> 0:11:26,000
while we use hand saws.

231
0:11:26.737,000 --> 0:11:3,000
If we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared

232
0:11:31.175,000 --> 0:11:33,000
outcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices,

233
0:11:33.923,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and a lot of shared environmental information, we can start

234
0:11:36.699,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to tease out the correlations between subtle variations

235
0:11:39.595,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices,

236
0:11:44.906,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.

237
0:11:47.392,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system

238
0:11:50.486,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that's waiting for data, but there isn't any.

239
0:11:55.058,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is

240
0:11:58.946,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed,

241
0:12:02.884,000 --> 0:12:07,000
unlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved

242
0:12:07.919,000 --> 0:12:1,000
clinical research study where you contribute the data.

243
0:12:11.574,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust,

244
0:12:13.78,000 --> 0:12:15,000
if you reach into your body and grab your genome,

245
0:12:16.406,000 --> 0:12:19,000
if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record,

246
0:12:19.453,000 --> 0:12:22,000
you can actually go through an online informed consent process --

247
0:12:22.776,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because the donation to the commons must be voluntary

248
0:12:25.422,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and it must be informed -- and you can actually upload

249
0:12:28.215,000 --> 0:12:3,000
your information and have it syndicated to the

250
0:12:30.807,000 --> 0:12:33,000
mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research,

251
0:12:33.903,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year

252
0:12:36.759,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and a million in the first five years so that we have

253
0:12:39.117,000 --> 0:12:42,000
a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take

254
0:12:42.951,000 --> 0:12:44,000
smaller sample sizes from traditional research

255
0:12:45.373,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and map it against,

256
0:12:46.972,000 --> 0:12:48,000
so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations

257
0:12:49.894,000 --> 0:12:51,000
between the variations that make us unique

258
0:12:52.423,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society.

259
0:12:56.447,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I've spent a lot of time around other commons.

260
0:12:59.471,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I've been around the early web. I've been around

261
0:13:02.151,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the early creative commons world, and there's four things

262
0:13:04.759,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that all of these share, which is, they're all really simple.

263
0:13:08.113,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study,

264
0:13:10.84,000 --> 0:13:12,000
you're not going to see something complicated.

265
0:13:13.095,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally,

266
0:13:18.144,000 --> 0:13:21,000
right, because you can always add power and control to a system,

267
0:13:21.167,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning,

268
0:13:25.131,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic,

269
0:13:27.676,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and being weak doesn't mean weakness.

270
0:13:29.86,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Those are strengths in the system.

271
0:13:32.211,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And open doesn't mean that there's no money.

272
0:13:34.876,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Closed systems, corporations, make a lot of money

273
0:13:37.896,000 --> 0:13:4,000
on the open web, and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives

274
0:13:41.435,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness

275
0:13:44.262,000 --> 0:13:46,000
of the system.

276
0:13:46.596,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created,

277
0:13:50.39,000 --> 0:13:53,000
so you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old,

278
0:13:53.819,000 --> 0:13:55,000
willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk,

279
0:13:55.846,000 --> 0:13:57,000
basically, and you're in.

280
0:13:58.511,000 --> 0:13:59,000
You can start analyzing the data.

281
0:14:00.084,000 --> 0:14:04,000
You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well. (Laughter)

282
0:14:04.243,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it,

283
0:14:07.824,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that's okay too. That's all in the consent,

284
0:14:10.97,000 --> 0:14:12,000
so if you don't like those terms, you don't come in.

285
0:14:13.534,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It's very much the design principles of a commons

286
0:14:16.626,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that we're trying to bring to health data.

287
0:14:19.22,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes

288
0:14:22.199,000 --> 0:14:25,000
a small number of really unreasonable people working together

289
0:14:25.378,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to create them. It didn't take that many people

290
0:14:28.56,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to make Wikipedia Wikipedia, or to keep it Wikipedia.

291
0:14:32.032,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health,

292
0:14:34.1,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and so I hate this word "patient."

293
0:14:36.376,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I don't like being patient when systems are broken,

294
0:14:39.543,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and health care is broken.

295
0:14:42.17,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I'm not talking about the politics of health care, I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care.

296
0:14:46.334,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you

297
0:14:49.604,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try,

298
0:14:52.65,000 --> 0:14:54,000
when you go home, to get your data.

299
0:14:55.367,000 --> 0:14:57,000
You'll be shocked and offended and, I would bet, outraged,

300
0:14:58.084,000 --> 0:15:,000
at how hard it is to get it.

301
0:15:00.96,000 --> 0:15:02,000
But it's a challenge that I hope you'll take,

302
0:15:03.579,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't.

303
0:15:06.04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
If you don't have anyone in your family who's sick,

304
0:15:07.484,000 --> 0:15:09,000
maybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do,

305
0:15:10.477,000 --> 0:15:12,000
or if you've been sick, then maybe you would.

306
0:15:12.684,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months

307
0:15:15.772,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there.

308
0:15:18.929,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study

309
0:15:21.051,000 --> 0:15:24,000
of 150,000 women in California, and they're going to

310
0:15:24.869,000 --> 0:15:26,000
return all the data to the participants of the study

311
0:15:27.587,000 --> 0:15:3,000
in a computable form, with one-clickability to load it into

312
0:15:30.733,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly

313
0:15:33.349,000 --> 0:15:35,000
how many people are willing to be unreasonable.

314
0:15:35.653,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So what I'd end [with] is,

315
0:15:38.037,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job

316
0:15:41.357,000 --> 0:15:44,000
almost a year ago to do this, is that it really doesn't take

317
0:15:44.74,000 --> 0:15:47,000
very many of us to achieve spectacular results.

318
0:15:48.548,000 --> 0:15:5,000
You just have to be willing to be unreasonable,

319
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men

320
0:15:53.591,000 --> 0:15:54,000
who got yellow fever ran. Right?

321
0:15:55.459,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more

322
0:15:58.32,000 --> 0:16:01,000
about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now.

323
0:16:01.753,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And being naked and alone can be terrifying.

324
0:16:05.383,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But to be naked in a group, voluntarily, can be quite beautiful.

325
0:16:09.85,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And so it doesn't take all of us.

326
0:16:11.738,000 --> 0:16:14,000
It just takes all of some of us. Thank you.

327
0:16:14.744,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep --

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was excited, with this phone call.

6
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

9
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So I went to bed that night pretty excited.

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:01:,000
Not sure of all the details, but excited.

12
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.

13
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Woke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.

14
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,

15
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?

16
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?

17
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So, I called back Major Heilshorn,

18
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.

19
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?"

20
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He's like, "Yes, Deborah?"

21
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Told him my idea, and you know,

22
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
he is one of the bravest men in the world,

23
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.

24
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Within 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.

25
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
He gave me my pick of units.

26
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I picked one unit -- Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,

27
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they're mountain infantry -- for two reasons.

28
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
One, they're infantry.

29
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Number two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,

30
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so I knew they would have Internet access.

31
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.

32
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This was a big thing that

33
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I think when Major H told me,

34
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.

35
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,

36
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.

37
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.

38
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The opening one was,

39
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?"

40
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.

41
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Gave them about a nine minute response,

42
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and there we went.

43
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.

44
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy,

45
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
many of you may not have had a chance to see it.

46
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So, I want to show the trailer,

47
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.

48
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
If we could roll?

49
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Video) Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink.

50
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Michael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.

51
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Zack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not.

52
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Soldier: We're not supposed to talk to the media.

53
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
SP: I'm not the media, dammit!

54
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
MM: The day is here. Life will change.

55
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
Voice: The real deal, man! Narrator: You ready?

56
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Soldier: Bring it on! Narrator: You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come!

57
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
ZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.

58
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's natural instinct.

59
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
SP: If you let fear get to you,

60
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
then you're not going to be doing your job.

61
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
MM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.

62
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's unbelievable.

63
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
ZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.

64
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Soldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!

65
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Man down! Man down!

66
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:31,000
MM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play?

67
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Michael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad.

68
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
MM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.

69
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Stephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, "Write something dirty!"

70
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
George W. Bush: The world's newest democracy.

71
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
MM: They're shooting at me.

72
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
SP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there,

73
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and say we're there to create democracy.

74
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
Soldier: We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.

75
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
SP: We're here to create money.

76
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
MM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.

77
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Jon Baril: The worst thing in my life.

78
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
SP: Baril, don't look at it, bud.

79
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Michael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore.

80
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
MM: I will not go back.

81
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Kevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help --

82
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and we just killed one.

83
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Soldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?

84
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There they are! Right there! Fire, fire!

85
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
JB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.

86
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I hope.

87
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause) Deborah Scranton: Thank you.

88
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
One of the things I'd like to talk to you about

89
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.

90
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.

91
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I don't know how many of you might imagine it,

92
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.

93
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Paul? Come on, stand up.

94
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is Paul Anthony.

95
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He served -- (Applause) -- with the Marines,

96
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and I want to tell you a little, brief story.

97
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We were one of the lucky ones

98
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.

99
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Right? And we started talking.

100
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
People will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes,"

101
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and then we'll start talking about war.

102
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We got in a conversation with some other people in the class,

103
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and it went on and on.

104
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I mean, we were there for an hour, talking.

105
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask

106
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you guys to think about and hopefully to help with,

107
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
which is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,

108
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and about politics.

109
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And really -- because maybe we're going to disagree.

110
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable.

111
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?

112
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And you know, Paul was talking,

113
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and he then turned to Constance and said,

114
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here,

115
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because I know she has my back."

116
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I want to say, I was nervous.

117
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Because I'm used to doing Q&As.

118
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I really related to what James was saying yesterday,

119
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because I'm behind the camera.

120
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You know, I can answer questions about my movie,

121
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.

122
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here,

123
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because I know you have my back.

124
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This film was not about the Internet,

125
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but it could not have been made without it.

126
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.

127
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:39,000
In the meantime, the soldiers -- we would email and IM.

128
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I didn't save all of them,

129
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because I didn't realize at the beginning

130
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that it would be something that I would want to keep track of.

131
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages

132
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that I was able to save.

133
0:06:55,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey

134
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to really get inside of it.

135
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So I wanted to show you a clip,

136
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.

137
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:1,000
If we could roll the clip.

138
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Video) SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.

139
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
SP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.

140
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So, what we do, we ride with the windows down.

141
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.

142
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.

143
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's not true. Very unsafe.

144
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Whoa.

145
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Soldier: Right there.

146
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
SP: All right, let's get over to that site.

147
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Be advised, we're leaving Taji right now.

148
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji,

149
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we're heading to that location now.

150
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Soldier: That's a fucking car bomb!

151
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Soldier: Motherfuckers!

152
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Soldiers: Get your vest on!

153
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Hey, get over the fucking -- yeah, yeah.

154
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Any one-four elements get to the gate!

155
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements,

156
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.

157
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Soldier: I'll walk you through it.

158
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Voices)

159
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
SP: Stay low. Head over to the right.

160
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Get your bag, get your bag!

161
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Screams)

162
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
SP: It was mass casualties.

163
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Probably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.

164
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
SP: It just looked like, you know,

165
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
someone had thrown a quarter through a guy,

166
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.

167
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Everything was cauterized,

168
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and it was just like there was a void going through the body.

169
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is the scene north.

170
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.

171
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.

172
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is blood.

173
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And you know, you walk,

174
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and you hear the pieces of skin.

175
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And that's it, that's all that's left.

176
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.

177
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.

178
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform.

179
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.

180
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.

181
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
They've got to die outside.

182
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:53,000
If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment,

183
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I would've slit his throat right there.

184
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
21:00 hours, and it's just our squad

185
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
going through today's events in our heads,

186
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
whether we want to or not.

187
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
News Anchor: More violence in Iraq.

188
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more

189
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
near a coalition base north of Baghdad.

190
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:23,000
SP: We made the news.

191
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I feel exploited and proud at the same time.

192
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I've lost all faith in the media --

193
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.

194
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.

195
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.

196
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Because these pages smell like Linds,

197
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.

198
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Another mission at 06:00.

199
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:52,000
DS: Now -- (Applause) -- thanks.

200
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:57,000
When I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in --

201
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:02,000
part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding.

202
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It's a new way of trying to make a documentary.

203
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
When I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras --

204
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in total, 21 ended up filming.

205
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Five soldiers filmed the entire time.

206
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
There are three featured in the film.

207
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,

208
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.

209
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And the tone from the email was,

210
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
you know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.

211
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.

212
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So, I pinged Mike and I said,

213
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"

214
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Because the thing that very often is missing is,

215
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in the military what they call "hot wash."

216
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.

217
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And if you let time go by,

218
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
it kind of softens and smooths the edges.

219
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And for me, I really wanted that.

220
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So, in order to get the intimacy,

221
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to share that experience with you, the guys --

222
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the two most popular mounts --

223
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
there was a camera on the turret, the gun turret,

224
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and then on the dashboard of the Humvee.

225
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Most of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.

226
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So you get to experience that in real time, right?

227
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:14,000
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did

228
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
within 24 hours of that episode happening.

229
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Steve Pink reading his journal

230
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
happened five months after he came home.

231
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.

232
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And you know, you earn someone's trust,

233
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
especially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.

234
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So, it wasn't until five months after he was home

235
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that he would read that journal.

236
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show --

237
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:42,000
you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can

238
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
in the format that they have.

239
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times,

240
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
American soldiers saying,

241
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"

242
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
OK, this is a perfect example.

243
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.

244
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,000
They didn't have to go outside the wire.

245
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
There were not Americans hurt out there.

246
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives --

247
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the Iraqis who work on the post.

248
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So, when you may hear soldiers complaining,

249
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that's what they're talking about, you know?

250
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this

251
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
as a way of bridging.

252
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&As,

253
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and people are really opinionated.

254
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But it seems like people don't want to hear so much,

255
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
or listen, or try to have an exchange.

256
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think --

257
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
you know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world,

258
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and my concern is that we have to have these conversations.

259
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know,

260
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
we think we know.

261
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.

262
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
There's such a disconnect.

263
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.

264
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
I'll share one story.

265
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me,

266
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:06,000
what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.

267
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And at screenings, inevitably --

268
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:12,000
you know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff --

269
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.

270
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And usually, the first questions are,

271
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
"Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?"

272
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Or you know, these things.

273
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.

274
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.

275
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.

276
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,

277
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that then became my story, was --

278
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:5,000
for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler --

279
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:52,000
it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,

280
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.

281
0:14:55,000 --> 0:15:,000
In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.

282
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:07,000
A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,

283
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
a foot away from me.

284
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
He's a big guy.

285
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And he looked at me, and I smiled,

286
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.

287
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And he wasn't going to blink.

288
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And he said, "My gunner was throwing candy."

289
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And I knew what he was going to say.

290
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:3,000
The gunner was throwing candy.

291
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:33,000
They used to throw candy to the kids.

292
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Kids got too close, very often.

293
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And he said, "I killed a child.

294
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And I'm a father. I have children.

295
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I haven't been able to tell my wife.

296
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster."

297
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I hugged him, of course,

298
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK."

299
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And he said, "I'm going to bring her to see your film.

300
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And then I'm going to tell her."

301
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:12,000
So when I talk about a disconnect,

302
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier,

303
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:17,000
which there obviously are. You know, these days,

304
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:2,000
it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,

305
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and everybody seemed involved.

306
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.

307
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And often, I'll hear people say,

308
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:29,000
who maybe know that I did this film,

309
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers."

310
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And I've started to ask them,

311
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
"Well, that's nice. What are you doing?

312
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Are you volunteering at a VA?

313
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
You go and see anybody?

314
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Do you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?

315
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?

316
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
Do you give money to any of the charities?"

317
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing,

318
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:08,000
but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.

319
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:13,000
I think, I challenge us to say --

320
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?

321
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Are you a friend to them?

322
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Do you really care?

323
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys

324
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to please, you know, reach out a hand.

325
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And really do give them a hug.

326
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Thank you.

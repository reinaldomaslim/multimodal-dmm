1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So how would you run a whole country without oil?

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
That's the question that sort of hit me

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It never left my brain.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So I went out and researched ethanol,

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which is, you actually use more

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
clean electrons than the ones you get

13
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
inside a car, if you use hydrogen.

14
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So that is not going to be the path to go.

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And then sort of through a process of

16
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
wandering around, I got to the thought

17
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,

18
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in a way that is convenient and affordable,

19
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you could get to a solution.

20
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now I started this from a point of view that

21
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it has to be something that scales en masse.

22
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Not how do you build one car,

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but how do you scale this so that it can become

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
something that is used by 99 percent of the population?

25
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good

26
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as any car that you would have today.

27
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.

28
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.

29
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?

30
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Alright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.

31
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.

32
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So we're bound with the laws of physics

33
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and the laws of economics.

34
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And so the thought that I started with was

35
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
how do you do this, still within the boundary

36
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of the science we know today --

37
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
no time for science fair, no time for playing around with things

38
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or waiting for the magic battery to show up.

39
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
How do you do it within the economics that we have today?

40
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up?

41
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And not from the power of an edict down.

42
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,

43
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I actually found out that the answer comes

44
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
from separating between the car ownership

45
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and the battery ownership.

46
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic

47
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"batteries not included."

48
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now if you separate between the two,

49
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you could actually answer the need for a convenient car

50
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
by creating a network,

51
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
by creating a network before the cars show up.

52
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The network has two components in them.

53
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop --

54
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive

55
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for about two hours and park for about 22 hours.

56
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon

57
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.

58
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And so the first thought that came to mind is,

59
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
everywhere we park we have electric power.

60
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,

61
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
like Scandinavia, you already have that.

62
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,

63
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.

64
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now that last mile,

65
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
last foot, in a sense,

66
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is the first step of the infrastructure.

67
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care

68
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of the range extension.

69
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
See we're bound by today's technology on batteries,

70
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within

71
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
reasonable space and weight limitations.

72
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.

73
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But you never want to get stuck.

74
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So what we added is a second element to our network,

75
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which is a battery swap system.

76
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You drive. You take your depleted battery out.

77
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
A full battery comes on. And you drive on.

78
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.

79
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.

80
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and

81
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
within two minutes you're back on the road

82
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and you can go again.

83
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If you had charge spots everywhere,

84
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and you had battery swap stations everywhere,

85
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
how often would you do it? And it ends up

86
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.

87
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.

88
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year

89
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we start paying you money

90
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because it's an inconvenience.

91
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Then we looked at the question of the affordability.

92
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We looked at the question, what happens when the battery is

93
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
disconnected from the car.

94
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
What is the cost of that battery?

95
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.

96
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,

97
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
something interesting happens.

98
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.

99
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.

100
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.

101
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You have the crude oil.

102
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil

103
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as what we call petrol or gasoline.

104
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.

105
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars

106
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
as the gas tank.

107
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.

108
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself

109
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
step after step after step.

110
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It has 2,000 life cycles these days.

111
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And so it's sort of a mini well.

112
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car

113
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.

114
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.

115
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In a sense what we've done is

116
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we've created a new consumable.

117
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You, today, buy gasoline miles.

118
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And we created electric miles.

119
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.

120
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Today 2010, in volume,

121
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.

122
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means --

123
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in the average consumer

124
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
environment we're in in the U.S.

125
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.

126
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.

127
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In Europe where taxes are in place,

128
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.

129
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But e-miles follow Moore's Law.

130
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They go from eight cents a mile in 2010,

131
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to four cents a mile in 2015,

132
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to two cents a mile by 2020.

133
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Why? Because batteries life cycle improve --

134
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.

135
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And these prices are actually with clean electrons.

136
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We do not use any electrons that come from coal.

137
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So in a sense this is

138
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
an absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel

139
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.

140
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon

141
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
by 2020, which is our desire.

142
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.

143
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
That is an 80 cent gallon.

144
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific

145
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
would convert to crude oil,

146
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,

147
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they still can't compete with two cents a mile.

148
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
That's a new economic factor,

149
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which is fascinating to most people.

150
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Now this would have been a wonderful paper.

151
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.

152
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
And some governments told me that it's fascinating

153
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that the younger generation actually thinks about these things.

154
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Until I got to the

156
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
true young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,

157
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.

158
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
First he let me go to the prime minister of the country,

159
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,

160
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
200 million dollars,

161
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and if you can find a car company

162
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that will build that car in mass volume,

163
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel --

164
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.

165
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Peres thought that was a great idea.

166
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So we went out, and we looked at all the car companies.

167
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We sent letters to all the car companies.

168
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us

169
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.

170
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,

171
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.

172
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
He said hybrids are like mermaids.

173
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
When you want a fish you get a woman and

174
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
when you need a woman you get a fish.

175
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And Ghosn came up and said,

177
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars."

178
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars

179
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model

180
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that will come into the market in mass volume --

181
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
mass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.

182
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's the first mass-volume electric car,

183
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
zero-emission electric car in the market.

184
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I was running, as Chris said,

185
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP

186
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?"

187
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,

188
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,

189
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
what is more important than saving your country and saving the world,

190
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that you would go and do?"

191
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.

192
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We then decided to scale it up.

193
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.

194
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And Denmark set this beautiful policy;

195
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it's called the IQ test.

196
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's inversely proportional to taxes.

197
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars

198
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and zero tax on zero-emission cars.

199
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.

200
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.

201
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.

202
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We then were sort of coined as the guys

204
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
who run only in small islands.

205
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,

206
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but Israel is an island -- it's a transportation island.

207
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.

208
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
If you're thinking about it in terms of islands,

210
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,

211
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.

212
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's got three centers --

213
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney --

214
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.

215
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The next island

216
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
was not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.

217
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We decided to come into the U.S.

218
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and pick the two best places --

219
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the one where you didn't need any range extension.

220
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.

221
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And if you really have a long day you can switch,

222
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and keep on driving around the island.

223
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area

224
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.

225
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
He decided that he's going to take over

226
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
the state, unofficially, and then officially,

227
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and then created this beautiful Region One policy.

228
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have

229
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the highest concentration of Priuses,

230
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but you also have the perfect range extender.

231
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It's called the other car.

232
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
As we stared scaling it up

233
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?

234
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Why is this a big issue?

235
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,

236
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
when you have small problems on the individual level,

237
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
like the price of gasoline to drive every morning.

238
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
You don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up

239
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you're dead. Alright?

240
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So the price of oil, much like

241
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
lots of other curves that we've seen,

242
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
goes along a depletion curve.

243
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.

244
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.

245
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.

246
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You think, well it's been up, it's been down,

247
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.

248
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Here is the problem:

249
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,

250
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.

251
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --

252
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.

253
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Now we're running a stimulus package.

254
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.

255
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,

256
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
somewhere in that space.

257
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
What happens when the economy recovers?

258
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars

259
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
even at the pace we're going at right now.

260
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
That's another 30 percent demand on oil.

261
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
That is another 25 million barrels a day.

262
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
That's all the U.S. usage today.

263
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.

264
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And then we do the OPEC stimulus package

265
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
also known as 200 dollars a barrel.

266
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We take our money and we give it away.

267
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
You know what happens at that point?

268
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We go back down. It's going to go up and down.

269
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And the downs are going to be much longer

270
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and the ups are going to be much shorter.

271
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And that's the difference between problems that are additive,

272
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,

273
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and problems that are depletive,

274
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in which we lose what we have,

275
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
which oscillate, and they oscillate until

276
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we lose everything we've got.

277
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Now we actually looked at what the answer would be.

278
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Right? Remember in the campaign: one million

279
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
hybrid cars by 2015.

280
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.

281
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.

282
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
That won't do much difference.

283
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We looked at an MIT study:

284
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
ten million electric cars on the global roads.

285
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.

286
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.

287
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's also the most optimistic number

288
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
because it means we will scale this industry

289
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
from 100 thousand cars is 2011,

290
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to 10 million cars by 2016 --

291
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
100 x growth in less than five years.

292
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.

293
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We have 10 million cars by region.

294
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
That's an enormous amount of cars.

295
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
China is adding those cars --

296
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
India, Russia, Brazil.

297
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We have all these regions.

298
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.

299
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They'll be the first in line to get off

300
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
because their prices are high.

301
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare

302
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.

303
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem

304
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.

305
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
For them to get a battery that goes 120 miles

306
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is an extension on range, not a reduction in range.

307
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We're the only ones who don't have the price set right.

308
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
We don't have the industry set right.

309
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it

310
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
across the U.S.

311
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now where is the car industry on that?

312
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.

313
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0

314
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we'll solve everything within the car itself."

315
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
No infrastructure, no problem.

316
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We forgot about the entire chain around us.

317
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
All this stuff that happens around.

318
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 --

319
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
a whole new market, a whole new business model.

320
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The business model in which the money that is actually coming in,

321
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to drive the car --

322
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the minutes, the miles if you want,

323
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that you are all familiar with --

324
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
subsidize the price of the car,

325
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.

326
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And some of it will go back to the car maker.

327
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Some of it will go back to your own pocket.

328
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.

329
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.

330
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark

331
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
from windmills, not from oil.

332
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm

333
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
in the south of Israel.

334
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."

335
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space

336
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
we found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"

337
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And they said, "We tried. There isn't any."

338
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"

339
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,

340
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
instead of digging down.

341
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
These are perfect matches to one another.

342
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Now all you need is about 10 percent

343
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
of the electricity generated.

344
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.

345
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
That's one percent a year.

346
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Now when we're looking at solving big problems,

347
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
we need to start thinking in two numbers.

348
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And those are not 20 percent by 2020.

349
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --

350
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and scale it infinity.

351
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year

352
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
we can't stop thinking of padding CO2.

353
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries

354
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that are willing to go to this kind of scale.

355
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
One car emits four tons.

356
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And actually 700 and change million cars today

357
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.

358
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.

359
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.

360
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
We have to come and attack this problem

361
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
with a focus, with an effort that actually says,

362
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
we're going to go to zero before the world ends.

363
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.

364
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.

365
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I told him one of the reasons that

366
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
his uncle was remembered

367
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,

368
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and we'll do it by the end of the decade.

369
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.

370
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.

371
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Laughter)

372
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
He actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.

373
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,

374
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
there was a long argument

375
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
over economy versus morality.

376
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars --

377
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
25 percent of their energy

378
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
for the entire industrial world in the U.K.

379
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
came from a source of energy that was immoral:

380
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
human slaves.

381
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?

382
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
And what would it do to our economy?

383
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.

384
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids

385
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and keep the slaves.

386
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,

387
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and the industrial revolution started within less than one year.

388
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.

389
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
We have to make the right moral decision.

390
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
We have to make it immediately.

391
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
We need to have presidential leadership

392
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil.

393
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years,

394
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
but within this presidential term

395
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
because if we don't, we will lose our economy,

396
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
right after we'd lost our morality.

397
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Thank you all very much.

398
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I'd like to change all that.

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Hit me.

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's very flat, kind of rigid.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,

9
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you know, 30 years.

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

11
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.

12
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.

13
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral

15
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
-- you know, what's visible, what's not.

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.

17
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.

19
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff.

20
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull,

21
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk,

22
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles

23
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:48,000
instead of just the folders that we have.

24
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or you know, flip through them like a book

26
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:,000
or I can lay them out like a deck of cards.

27
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:05,000
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things

28
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?

29
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.

30
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?

31
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.

32
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Also some of the stuff we can do is,

33
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
for these individual icons we thought -- I mean,

34
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?

35
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger

36
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.

37
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this,

38
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move

39
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?

40
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?

42
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.

43
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared,

44
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.

45
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system.

46
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them,

47
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later.

48
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up

49
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and, you know, toss it to the corner.

50
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Also just like paper, around our workspace

51
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later,

52
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I can do the same thing here,

53
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.

54
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And I can pull them off when I want to work with them.

55
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that,

56
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer."

57
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align,

58
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned.

59
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.

60
0:03:53,000 --> 0:04:,000
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.

61
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke.

62
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software --

63
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs.

64
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs

65
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.

66
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable --

67
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.

68
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.

69
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know --

70
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here,

71
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.

72
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And that's BumpTop. Thanks!

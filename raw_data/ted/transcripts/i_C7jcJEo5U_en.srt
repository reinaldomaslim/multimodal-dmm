1
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be --

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In fact what we're going to talk about,

5
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
by a conversation than an address.

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.

8
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,

9
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
many people have flocked to downtown New York to see

10
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.

11
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches

12
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.

13
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.

14
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
There's a new place in New York

15
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero.

16
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.

17
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City --

18
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
this was her number-one pick.

19
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.

20
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.

21
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
JA: Even on the coldest winter days.

22
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
To honor and remember.

23
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here.

24
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This is ours.

25
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become

26
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:54,000
a bit of a problem.

27
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated

28
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.

29
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
JA: But that is about to change.

30
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In record time,

31
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a team of architects and construction workers

32
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:11,000
designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration

33
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and bring people closer.

34
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Man: They'll get an incredible panorama

35
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and understand, I think more completely,

36
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the sheer totality of the destruction of the place.

37
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike

38
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
most any other tourist site in America.

39
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,

40
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
people come here to see what's no longer there.

41
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here

42
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
when they see this is not as a construction site

43
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but as this incredibly moving burial ground.

44
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them

45
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with their own memorials the way they already have

46
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
along the current perimeter.

47
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.

48
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
JA: The ramps are made of simple material --

49
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the kind of plywood you see at construction sites --

50
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which is really the whole point.

51
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In the face of America's worst destruction

52
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
people are building again.

53
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.

54
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:12,000
KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,

55
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate --

56
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
an entertainment architect.

57
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.

58
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
DR: I like that word.

59
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:35,000
KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants.

60
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York --

61
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:43,000
felt on the 11th of September transmute

62
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
into your desire to do this thing?

63
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:51,000
DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,

64
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I felt myself in the role originally --

65
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca

66
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:,000
and whose neighborhood was devastated,

67
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and as someone who works less than a mile from there --

68
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me

69
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm

70
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
about creating the places we had been creating.

71
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure,"

72
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.

73
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that.

74
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We were really paralyzed.

75
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I found myself the Friday after September 11th --

76
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
two days afterwards --

77
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.

78
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We gave the office a few days off.

79
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And in discussing this with other architects,

80
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we had seen people saying in the press

81
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that they should rebuild the towers as they were --

82
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they should rebuild them 50 stories taller.

83
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I thought it was astonishing to speculate,

84
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
as if this were a competition,

85
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
on something that was such a fresh wound.

86
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And I had a series of discussions --

87
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,

88
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and several other people --

89
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.

90
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help

91
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,

92
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but to help right now.

93
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we tried to come up with a way,

94
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.

95
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And that was the mission that we came up with.

96
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
KA: Were you conscious of suddenly --

97
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:43,000
as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants --

98
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:48,000
suddenly fulfilling needs?

99
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
DR: Well what I was aware of was,

100
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
there was this overwhelming need to act now.

101
0:05:52,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.

102
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:06,000
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.

103
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They moved to an abandoned school.

104
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,

105
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising --

106
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.

107
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It was just extraordinary.

108
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed

109
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and it became this cathartic experience for us.

110
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
KA: And that was done, effectively,

111
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
by October 8 or something?

112
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
DR: Yeah.

113
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something

114
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four

115
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that you've designed to surround the site --

116
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,

117
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be

118
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in New York real estate and New York politics.

119
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
DR: Well, it's a funny thing.

120
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.

121
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.

122
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And I sat in on several meetings.

123
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And there were the most circuitous grand plans

124
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.

125
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,

126
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.

127
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And it wasn't an inclusive group.

128
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So we said, what is --

129
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
KA: It was not an inclusive group?

130
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
DR: It was not an inclusive group.

131
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group

132
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that was not representative of the city.

133
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
KA: Shocking.

134
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
DR: Yeah, surprising.

135
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.

136
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The city actually approached us.

137
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We first approached the city about Pier 94.

138
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We saw how PS 234 worked.

139
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The families -- the victims of the families --

140
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.

141
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
KA: On the Hudson River?

142
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially,

143
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani --

144
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
said, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,

145
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero

146
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,

147
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and a way to protect it from the weather."

148
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,

149
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.

150
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,

151
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
where the families of the victims had left notes to them.

152
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And there was no mediation between us and the experience.

153
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There was no filter.

154
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,

155
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently --

156
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room

157
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:,000
on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.

158
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.

159
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And it was amazing how much harder it was

160
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to believe in real life than it was on TV.

161
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
There was something about the comfort of the filter

162
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and how much information was between us and the experience.

163
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So seeing this in a very simple,

164
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:21,000
dignified way was a very powerful experience.

165
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we went back to the city and said

166
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,

167
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but we've spent some time down there.

168
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:36,000
At the same time the city had this need.

169
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They were looking for a solution

170
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day

171
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
who were going down there, that had nowhere to go.

172
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.

173
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.

174
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
There was a way -- there had to be a way --

175
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to get people to move around the site.

176
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
KA: But then you've got to figure out a way --

177
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:01,000
we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits

178
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.

179
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It looks like a fairly simple thing,

180
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but this was a half a million dollar project?

181
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,

182
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it wasn't going to happen.

183
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen

184
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
by the end of the Giuliani administration,

185
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT

186
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and the Police Department and all of the --

187
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,

188
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.

189
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:33,000
This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,

190
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and they sensed that this needed to happen.

191
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,

192
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.

193
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this --

194
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we had to work with the families of the victims,

195
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.

196
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Because this didn't want to be a surprise.

197
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,

198
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because the key was not raising a lot of objection

199
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and sort of working as quietly as possible.

200
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,

201
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:15,000
mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,

202
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:21,000
he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.

203
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:22,000
There needed to be a foundation in place.

204
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was

205
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
one major developer in New York --

206
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?

207
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,

208
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help.

209
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And we met with him.

210
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:46,000
The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.

211
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,

212
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
volunteered to do it at cost.

213
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense."

214
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And we said, "That's incredible!"

215
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And I think this was the 21st,

216
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.

217
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And we had to start construction the next day.

218
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,

219
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform

220
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
about half the size that we had drawn it.

221
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get

222
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?

223
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Laughter)

224
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.

225
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:32,000
There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul --

226
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,

227
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and a place to reflect and remember.

228
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time

229
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul --

230
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
which is just to the right -- and moving around the site.

231
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.

232
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And I think people were amazed at two things --

233
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I think they were amazed at the destruction,

234
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but I think there was a sense of disbelief

235
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:03,000
about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.

236
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.

237
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,

238
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer

239
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this."

240
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And we said, "Well, this is half the size,

241
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:23,000
it doesn't have any of the design features

242
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city.

243
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this."

244
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And I convinced him that we should leave the room

245
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
with the agreement to build it as designed.

246
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The next day I got an email from the developer

247
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
saying that he was withdrawing all funding.

248
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So we didn't know what to do,

249
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but we decided to cast a very wide net.

250
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We emailed out letters to as many people as we could --

251
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful.

252
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?

253
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.

254
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.

255
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We knew that one way or another this was going to happen.

256
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And we just felt it had to happen.

257
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:18,000
KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.

258
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Richard, I think very correctly,

259
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
made the point at the beginning --

260
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
before all the chair designers came out --

261
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:35,000
about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions

262
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:39,000
on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.

263
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
It seems to me with this,

264
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that it was the opposite of that.

265
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This was an unprecedented, singular design problem.

266
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
DR: Well here's the issue:

267
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
we knew that this was not in the sense of --

268
0:14:54,000 --> 0:15:,000
we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.

269
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:03,000
It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.

270
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:09,000
That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember --

271
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
a kind of quiet place.

272
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So it led us to using design solutions

273
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that created as few filters between the viewer --

274
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:22,000
as we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible.

275
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It's all incredibly humble material.

276
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It's scaffolding and plywood.

277
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement,

278
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
up by Saint Paul's and down the other side --

279
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:4,000
it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground

280
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to where you get the 360 degree view.

281
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.

282
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:54,000
One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.

283
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site,

284
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:01,000
one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,

285
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:03,000
we knew that these had to be moveable

286
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to respond to changing conditions,

287
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.

288
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:14,000
KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before --

289
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:2,000
a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on

290
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,

291
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,"

292
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
sort of sense of existence.

293
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:36,000
This is clearly not a work for the ages.

294
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:4,000
You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.

295
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Did that require, as an architect,

296
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:46,000
a new way of thinking about what you were doing?

297
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:5,000
To think of it as this purely temporary installation?

298
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:52,000
DR: No, I don't think so.

299
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I think this is, obviously, substantially different

300
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:59,000
from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.

301
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,

302
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:1,000
number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.

303
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller

304
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and all the people within the city --

305
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,

306
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:29,000
offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.

307
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So the notion of collaboration --

308
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:34,000
I think this reinforces how important that is.

309
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And in terms of the temporary nature of it,

310
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
our goal was not to create something

311
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that would be there longer than it needed to be.

312
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue

313
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:52,000
that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,

314
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:55,000
about what's really happening there.

315
0:17:55,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,

316
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:04,000
where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.

317
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.

318
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And I think regardless of what the position is about how

319
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:16,000
this sacred piece of land is to be used,

320
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,

321
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I think makes it a more powerful dialogue.

322
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And that's what we were interested in.

323
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:28,000
So that, very much, is in the realm of things

324
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:3,000
I've been interested in before.

325
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:33,000
KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.

326
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
It enables that conversation to get serious.

327
0:18:37,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And six months after the fact --

328
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and only a few months away from the site being cleaned --

329
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:46,000
we are very quickly, now, getting to the point

330
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:51,000
where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.

331
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site

332
0:18:56,000 --> 0:18:58,000
as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about

333
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:,000
what should or shouldn't be done?

334
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:05,000
DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate --

335
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:11,000
I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.

336
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:16,000
The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,

337
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.

338
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:22,000
KA: But it had some really terrible ideas.

339
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:26,000
DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,

340
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.

341
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:34,000
And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be --

342
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:36,000
the dialogue is really opening up to,

343
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:38,000
what does this site really want to be?

344
0:19:38,000 --> 0:19:42,000
And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,

345
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:45,000
that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.

346
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:5,000
There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,

347
0:19:5,000 --> 0:19:54,000
about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,

348
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:57,000
so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.

349
0:19:57,000 --> 0:19:59,000
KA: Well, I think that's interesting.

350
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate

351
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:04,000
to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,

352
0:20:04,000 --> 0:20:1,000
which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,

353
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:14,000
as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.

354
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining --

355
0:20:17,000 --> 0:20:19,000
a silver lining, here -- to rebuild

356
0:20:19,000 --> 0:20:23,000
some more traditional city grid, or not?

357
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:25,000
DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage

358
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:27,000
in a discussion of why we live in cities.

359
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:31,000
And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people

360
0:20:31,000 --> 0:20:33,000
collide up against us each day?

361
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,

362
0:20:38,000 --> 0:20:4,000
regardless of what the number is.

363
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:44,000
So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.

364
0:20:44,000 --> 0:20:5,000
And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.

365
0:20:5,000 --> 0:20:52,000
KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?

366
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:54,000
DR: Right, which the towers fell into.

367
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:59,000
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage

368
0:20:59,000 --> 0:21:01,000
that they're not re-opening the street

369
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:03,000
to connect that back to the rest of the city.

370
0:21:03,000 --> 0:21:06,000
I think a public dialogue -- I think, you know,

371
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:1,000
I'd like to see an international competition,

372
0:21:1,000 --> 0:21:13,000
and a call for ideas for uses.

373
0:21:13,000 --> 0:21:15,000
KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,

374
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:17,000
whether it's what amount of shopping?

375
0:21:17,000 --> 0:21:19,000
DR: Right. And we're looking for other things.

376
0:21:19,000 --> 0:21:22,000
This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.

377
0:21:22,000 --> 0:21:26,000
Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site

378
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:3,000
and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice

379
0:21:3,000 --> 0:21:32,000
in New York to do artist housing.

380
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:34,000
And find other ways to encourage the discussion

381
0:21:34,000 --> 0:21:37,000
to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,

382
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:41,000
and more about a multiplicity of things.

383
0:21:41,000 --> 0:21:48,000
KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video

384
0:21:48,000 --> 0:21:51,000
of the experience of being on this platform?

385
0:21:51,000 --> 0:21:54,000
DR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together

386
0:21:54,000 --> 0:21:57,000
a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.

387
0:21:57,000 --> 0:22:02,000
So I thought that would be good to end with.

388
0:22:12,000 --> 0:22:18,000
DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.

389
0:22:18,000 --> 0:22:22,000
One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration

390
0:22:22,000 --> 0:22:25,000
was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.

391
0:22:25,000 --> 0:22:32,000
And essentially our structure was designed to be written on.

392
0:22:32,000 --> 0:22:34,000
KA: As you say, it's not a memorial.

393
0:22:34,000 --> 0:22:36,000
But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial?

394
0:22:36,000 --> 0:22:37,000
Those kinds of forms?

395
0:22:38,000 --> 0:22:43,000
DR: We certainly did as much research as we could,

396
0:22:43,000 --> 0:22:47,000
and we were conscious of other memorials.

397
0:22:47,000 --> 0:22:5,000
And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.

398
0:22:5,000 --> 0:22:54,000
It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City,

399
0:22:54,000 --> 0:22:59,000
which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution

400
0:22:59,000 --> 0:23:02,000
that expanded on Union Square

401
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:1,000
and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.

402
0:23:1,000 --> 0:23:15,000
The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.

403
0:23:26,000 --> 0:23:3,000
What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed,

404
0:23:3,000 --> 0:23:32,000
so that what you're aware of

405
0:23:32,000 --> 0:23:37,000
is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero,

406
0:23:37,000 --> 0:23:39,000
but all of the buildings around it --

407
0:23:39,000 --> 0:23:42,000
and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.

408
0:23:42,000 --> 0:23:46,000
This shows Saint Paul's on the left.

409
0:23:51,000 --> 0:23:56,000
KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers

410
0:23:56,000 --> 0:23:59,000
for making this happen and getting this done.

411
0:23:59,000 --> 0:24:04,000
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection,

412
0:24:04,000 --> 0:24:07,000
and its being there,

413
0:24:07,000 --> 0:24:1,000
almost before you could believe

414
0:24:1,000 --> 0:24:14,000
that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished,

415
0:24:14,000 --> 0:24:19,000
is part of its extraordinary --

416
0:24:19,000 --> 0:24:22,000
I don't know if beauty is the word --

417
0:24:22,000 --> 0:24:25,000
but presence.

418
0:24:25,000 --> 0:24:27,000
DR: It was an honor to do.

419
0:24:27,000 --> 0:24:3,000
And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.

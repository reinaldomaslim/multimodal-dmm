1
0:00:12.036,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I didn't know when I agreed to do this

2
0:00:16.605,000 --> 0:00:21,000
whether I was expected to talk or to sing.

3
0:00:22.285,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But when I was told that the topic was language,

4
0:00:27.333,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment.

5
0:00:32.104,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I have a problem.

6
0:00:36.453,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's not the worst thing in the world.

7
0:00:38.467,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm fine.

8
0:00:39.664,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm not on fire.

9
0:00:41.413,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I know that other people in the world

10
0:00:43.314,000 --> 0:00:47,000
have far worse things to deal with,

11
0:00:47.482,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but for me, language and music are

12
0:00:53.432,000 --> 0:00:57,000
inextricably linked through this one thing.

13
0:00:57.867,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And the thing is that I have a stutter.

14
0:01:05.556,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It might seem curious given that I spend

15
0:01:08.104,000 --> 0:01:11,000
a lot of my life on the stage.

16
0:01:11.902,000 --> 0:01:14,000
One would assume that I'm comfortable

17
0:01:14.926,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in the public sphere and comfortable here,

18
0:01:17.358,000 --> 0:01:19,000
speaking to you guys.

19
0:01:19.798,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But the truth is that I've spent my life up until this point

20
0:01:24.568,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and including this point, living in mortal dread

21
0:01:28.919,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of public speaking.

22
0:01:32.229,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Public singing, whole different thing. (Laughter)

23
0:01:36.939,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But we'll get to that in a moment.

24
0:01:40.432,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I've never really talked about it before so explicitly.

25
0:01:46.342,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I think that that's because I've always lived in hope

26
0:01:48.674,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that when I was a grown-up,

27
0:01:51.218,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I wouldn't have one.

28
0:01:57.49,000 --> 0:02:,000
I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown,

29
0:02:00.705,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'll have learned to speak French,

30
0:02:03.912,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and when I'm grown, I'll learn how to manage my money,

31
0:02:07.19,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter,

32
0:02:09.468,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister

33
0:02:11.791,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and anything's possible and, you know.

34
0:02:15.156,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:18.556,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So I can talk about it now

36
0:02:21.605,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because I've reached this point, where —

37
0:02:25.427,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I mean, I'm 28.

38
0:02:29.367,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now.

39
0:02:31.857,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:33.679,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I'm an adult woman

41
0:02:35.681,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who spends her life as a performer,

42
0:02:39.757,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with a speech impediment.

43
0:02:42.659,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So, I might as well come clean about it.

44
0:02:46.867,000 --> 0:02:49,000
There are some interesting angles to having a stutter.

45
0:02:50.849,000 --> 0:02:53,000
For me, the worst thing that can happen

46
0:02:54.223,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is meeting another stutterer.

47
0:02:57.485,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

48
0:03:00.701,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This happened to me in Hamburg, when

49
0:03:03.908,000 --> 0:03:05,000
this guy, we met and he said,

50
0:03:05.911,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"Hello, m-m-m-my name is Joe,"

51
0:03:09.532,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and I said, "Oh, hello, m-m-m-my name is Meg."

52
0:03:13.793,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Imagine my horror when I realized

53
0:03:16.45,000 --> 0:03:17,000
he thought I was making fun of him.

54
0:03:18.355,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:24.197,000 --> 0:03:29,000
People think I'm drunk all the time.

56
0:03:29.23,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:32.63,000 --> 0:03:35,000
People think that I've forgotten their name

58
0:03:36.306,000 --> 0:03:4,000
when I hesitate before saying it.

59
0:03:40.997,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it is a very weird thing, because

60
0:03:43.22,000 --> 0:03:47,000
proper nouns are the worst.

61
0:03:47.459,000 --> 0:03:5,000
If I'm going to use the word "Wednesday" in a sentence,

62
0:03:51.249,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I'm coming up to the word,

63
0:03:54.152,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something,

64
0:03:57.121,000 --> 0:04:,000
I can change the word to "tomorrow,"

65
0:04:00.431,000 --> 0:04:02,000
or "the day after Tuesday,"

66
0:04:02.49,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or something else.

67
0:04:04.883,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's clunky, but you can get away with it,

68
0:04:09.866,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because over time I've developed this

69
0:04:12.408,000 --> 0:04:16,000
loophole method of using speech

70
0:04:16.795,000 --> 0:04:19,000
where right at the last minute you

71
0:04:19.926,000 --> 0:04:23,000
change the thing and you trick your brain.

72
0:04:24.207,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But with people's names, you can't change them.

73
0:04:27.915,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:30.593,000 --> 0:04:33,000
When I was singing a lot of jazz,

75
0:04:33.762,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve.

76
0:04:39.285,000 --> 0:04:41,000
As you can probably gather,

77
0:04:41.899,000 --> 0:04:44,000
S's and T's, together or independently,

78
0:04:45.173,000 --> 0:04:48,000
are my kryptonite.

79
0:04:49.287,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But I would have to introduce the band

80
0:04:51.439,000 --> 0:04:54,000
over this rolling vamp,

81
0:04:54.651,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and when I got around to Steve,

82
0:04:57.5,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I'd often find myself stuck on the "St."

83
0:05:03.271,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable and it totally kills the vibe.

84
0:05:08.959,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So after a few instances of this,

85
0:05:11.287,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Steve happily became "Seve,"

86
0:05:16.387,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and we got through it that way. (Laughter)

87
0:05:21.887,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I've had a lot of therapy,

88
0:05:24.238,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and a common form of treatment is to use

89
0:05:26.525,000 --> 0:05:3,000
this technique that's called smooth speech,

90
0:05:31.433,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which is where you almost sing everything that you say.

91
0:05:36.858,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You kind of join everything together in this

92
0:05:39.21,000 --> 0:05:43,000
very singsong, kindergarten teacher way,

93
0:05:43.475,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and it makes you sound very serene, like you've had lots of Valium,

94
0:05:47.454,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and everything is calm. (Laughter)

95
0:05:51.246,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That's not actually me.

96
0:05:54.373,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I do use that. I do.

97
0:05:57.698,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I use it when I have to be on panel shows,

98
0:06:04.532,000 --> 0:06:07,000
or when I have to do radio interviews,

99
0:06:07.911,000 --> 0:06:11,000
when the economy of airtime is paramount.

100
0:06:12.774,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:15.828,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I get through it that way for my job.

102
0:06:20.216,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But as an artist who feels that their work

103
0:06:22.933,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is based solely on a platform of honesty

104
0:06:28.903,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and being real,

105
0:06:32.937,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that feels often like cheating.

106
0:06:36.671,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you

107
0:06:39.885,000 --> 0:06:42,000
what singing means to me.

108
0:06:43.544,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's more than making nice sounds,

109
0:06:47.595,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and it's more than making nice songs.

110
0:06:52.997,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's more than feeling known, or understood.

111
0:06:58.531,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's more than making you feel the things that I feel.

112
0:07:04.696,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It's not about mythology,

113
0:07:07.385,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or mythologizing myself to you.

114
0:07:12.427,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Somehow, through some miraculous

115
0:07:17.805,000 --> 0:07:21,000
synaptic function of the human brain,

116
0:07:22.305,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it's impossible to stutter when you sing.

117
0:07:27.761,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And when I was younger, that was a method of treatment

118
0:07:31.517,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that worked very well for me,

119
0:07:33.97,000 --> 0:07:38,000
singing, so I did it a lot.

120
0:07:39.85,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And that's why I'm here today.

121
0:07:43.993,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Applause)

122
0:07:48.358,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Thank you.

123
0:07:54.01,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Singing for me is sweet relief.

124
0:07:58.583,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It is the only time when I feel fluent.

125
0:08:07.43,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth

126
0:08:10.856,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is comprehensively exactly what I intended.

127
0:08:13.448,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

128
0:08:15.731,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So I know that this is a TED Talk,

129
0:08:18.668,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but now i'm going to TED sing.

130
0:08:22.417,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is a song that I wrote last year.

131
0:08:23.976,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

132
0:08:26.374,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

133
0:08:39.321,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Piano)

134
0:08:54.819,000 --> 0:08:57,000

0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Today I'm going to take you on a voyage

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to some place so deep,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so dark, so unexplored

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's a place of myth and legend.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's a place marked on ancient maps

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
as "here be monsters."

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Instead, they just make me green with envy

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that my colleague from IUCN

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to actually take photographs

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We are talking about the high seas.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The "high seas" is a legal term,

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
With an average depth of the oceans

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of 4,000 meters,

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in fact, the high seas covers and provides

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
nearly 90 percent of the habitat

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for life on this Earth.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It is, in theory, the global commons,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
belonging to us all.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But in reality,

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it is managed by and for

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
those who have the resources

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to go out and exploit it.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to cast light on some of the outdated myths

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and legends and assumptions

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that have kept us as the true stakeholders

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in the high seas in the dark.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We're going to voyage to some of these special places

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that we've been discovering in the past few years

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to show why we really need to care.

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And then finally, we're going to try

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to develop and pioneer a new perspective

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
on high seas governance

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but framed in an arena of global norms

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of precaution and respect.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So here is a picture of the high seas

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as seen from above --

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that area in the darker blue.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
To me, as an international lawyer,

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
this scared me far more

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the global ocean,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that provides us all with carbon storage,

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with heat storage, with oxygen,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
if you can only protect 36 percent.

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Some of the problems that we have to confront

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
are that the current international laws --

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for example, shipping --

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
provide more protection

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to the areas closest to shore.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
For example, garbage discharge,

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
something you would think just simply goes away,

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but the laws regulating

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
ship discharge of garbage

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
actually get weaker the further you are from shore.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
As a result, we have garbage patches

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the size of twice-Texas.

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's unbelievable.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We used to think the solution to pollution

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
was dilution,

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but that has proved to be no longer the case.

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So what we have learned from social scientists

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and economists like Elinor Ostrom,

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who are studying the phenomenon

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of management of the commons on a local scale,

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is that there are certain prerequisites

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that you can put into place

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that enable you to manage

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and access open space

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for the good of one and all.

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And these include a sense of shared responsibility,

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
common norms that bind people together as a community.

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Conditional access: You can invite people in,

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but they have to be able to play by the rules.

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules,

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you still need an effective system

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of monitoring and enforcement,

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
for as we've discovered,

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you can trust, but you also need to verify.

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
What I'd also like to convey

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is that it is not all doom and gloom

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that we are seeing in the high seas.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
For a group of very dedicated individuals --

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
scientists, conservationists,

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
photographers and states --

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
were able to actually change a tragic trajectory

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that was destroying fragile seascapes

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
such as this coral garden

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that you see in front of you.

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That is, we're able to save it from a fate

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of deep-sea bottom trawling.

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And how did we do that?

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and actually photographed the activities in process.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But we also spent many hours

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in the basements of the United Nations,

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
trying to work with governments to make them understand

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
what was going on so far away from land

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that few of us had ever even imagined

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that these creatures existed.

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So within three years,

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
from 2003 to 2006,

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we were able to get norm in place

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that actually changed the paradigm

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of how fishers went about

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
deep-sea bottom trawling.

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want,"

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we actually created a regime

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that required prior assessment of where you're going

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and a duty to prevent significant harm.

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they discovered

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
had been protected.

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This does not mean that it's the final solution,

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or that this even provides permanent protection.

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But what it does mean

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is that a group of individuals can form a community

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to actually shape

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the way high seas are governed,

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to create a new regime.

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for creating a true, blue perspective

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for this beautiful planet.

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Sylvia's wish

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
provides us with that leverage, that access

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to the heart of human beings,

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
you might say,

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but are now hopefully going to become interested

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,

142
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.

143
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of some of these special areas,

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
just to give you an idea of the flavor

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of the riches and wonders they do contain.

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The Sargasso Sea, for example,

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is not a sea bounded by coastlines,

149
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but it is bounded by oceanic currents

150
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that contain and envelope

151
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
this wealth of sargassum

152
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that grows and aggregates there.

153
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
from Northern European

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and Northern American rivers

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that are now so dwindling in numbers

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But the Sargasso Sea,

160
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the same way it aggregates sargassum weed,

161
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
actually is pulling in the plastic

162
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
from throughout the region.

163
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This picture doesn't exactly show

164
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But there has just been a study

166
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that was released in February

167
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that showed there are 200,000

168
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
pieces of plastic per square-kilometer

169
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,

170
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and that is affecting the habitat

171
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for the many species in their juvenile stages

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
who come to the Sargasso Sea

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for its protection and its food.

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for the aggregation of these unique species

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.

177
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It also provides a special habitat

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
for these flying fish to lay their eggs.

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But what I'd like to get from this picture

180
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is that we truly do have an opportunity

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to launch a global initiative for protection.

182
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and its responsibility

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as having some of the Sargasso Sea

185
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
within its national jurisdiction --

186
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but the vast majority is beyond --

187
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to help spearhead a movement

188
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to achieve protection for this vital area.

189
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:

190
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.

191
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's actually a bay.

192
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's considered high seas, because the continent

193
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
has been put off limits

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to territorial claims.

195
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.

196
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But what makes the Ross Sea important

197
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is the vast sea of pack ice

198
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that in the spring and summer

199
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that supports what, till recently,

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
has been a virtually intact

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
near-shore ecosystem.

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But unfortunately, CCAMLR,

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the regional commission

205
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks

206
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and other living marine resources,

207
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests

208
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and has authorized the expansion

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of toothfish fisheries in the region.

210
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The captain of a New Zealand vessel

211
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
who was just down there

212
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
is reporting a significant decline

213
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,

214
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish

215
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as their main source of food.

216
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly,

217
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
singly and together,

218
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to push governments,

219
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to push regional fisheries management organizations,

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to declare our right

221
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,

222
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so that the freedom to fish no longer means

223
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.

224
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is a recently discovered area --

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.

227
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
There's enough food there to last them

228
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the summer and the winter long.

229
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome

230
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.

231
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It's an oceanographic phenomenon

232
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.

233
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones

235
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
of these five Central American countries,

236
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but it moves with the season.

237
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
As such, it does create a challenge to protect,

238
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.

239
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We can use the same technologies that fishers use

240
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to identify where the species are,

241
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
in order to close the area

242
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
when it's most vulnerable,

243
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which may, in some cases, be year-round.

244
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Getting closer to shore, where we are,

245
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Many species are headed through this region,

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which is why there's been so much attention

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
put into conservation

249
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.

250
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This is the initiative that's been coordinated

251
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
by Conservation International

252
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
with a variety of partners and governments

253
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to actually try to bring integrated management regime

254
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
throughout the area.

255
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go

256
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
with a real regional initiative.

257
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.

258
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention

259
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
does not recognize the need to protect areas

260
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
beyond national jurisdiction, at present.

261
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome

262
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
could not technically qualify

263
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the time it's in the high seas.

264
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So what we've been suggesting

265
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,

266
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
so that it can adopt

267
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,

268
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or we need to change the name

269
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.

270
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles

271
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.

272
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,

273
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
where they spend most of their time

274
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and often end up getting hooked like this,

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
or as bycatch.

276
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.

277
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We need to work locally,

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.

279
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We have the tools and technologies now

280
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to enable us to take a broader

281
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
ocean-basin-wide initiative.

282
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,

283
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.

284
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's provided us data like this,

285
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of tiny, little sooty shearwaters

286
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that make the entire ocean basin their home.

287
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They fly 65,000 kilometers

288
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in less than a year.

289
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.

290
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And its culminating year

291
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that's going to be launched in October.

292
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So stay tuned for further information.

293
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
What I find so exciting

294
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is that the Census of Marine Life

295
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;

296
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,

297
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
where creatures like this flying sea cucumber

298
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
have been found.

299
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,

300
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to team up with the Census of Marine Life

301
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and many of the scientists working there

302
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to actually try to translate

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
much of this information to policymakers.

304
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We have the support of governments now behind us.

305
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.

306
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information

307
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to move ahead to protect some of these

308
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
significant hope spots, hotspots.

309
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
At the same time we're saying,

310
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."

311
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But many of you have said,

312
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
if you get these marine protected areas,

313
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,

314
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
how are you going to enforce it?

315
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,

316
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which is outer space technology.

317
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I wanted to be an astronaut,

318
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
so I've constantly followed

319
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
what are the tools available to monitor Earth

320
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
from outer space --

321
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,

322
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
in terms of being able to follow tagged species

323
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
throughout their life-cycles

324
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in the open ocean.

325
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.

326
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Many already have transponders on board

327
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.

328
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But not all the vessels have those to date.

329
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It does not take too much rocket science

330
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to actually try to create new laws to mandate,

331
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
if you're going to have the privilege

332
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
of accessing our high seas resources,

333
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
we need to know -- someone needs to know --

334
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
where you are and what you're doing.

335
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So it brings me to my main take-home message,

336
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.

337
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We can stop the collision course

338
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
of 50 percent of the planet

339
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
with the high seas.

340
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.

341
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We need to change how we actually go about

342
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
managing these resources.

343
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We need to get the new paradigm

344
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
of precaution and respect.

345
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
At the same time, we need to think locally,

346
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,

347
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is that we can shine a spotlight

348
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
on many of these previously unknown areas,

349
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and to bring people to the table, if you will,

350
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to actually make them feel part of this community

351
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that truly has a stake

352
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in their future management.

353
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.

354
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.

355
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Many of the deep-sea communities

356
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
have genetic distribution

357
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that goes ocean-basin-wide.

358
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We need to better understand,

359
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
but we also need to start to manage and protect.

360
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And in order to do that,

361
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
you also need ocean-basin management regimes.

362
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
That is, we have regional management regimes

363
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
within the exclusive economic zone,

364
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,

365
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
so they're like the Southern Ocean,

366
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
where they do have the two-pronged fisheries

367
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and conservation organization.

368
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor

369
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Sylvia Earle for her wish,

370
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas

371
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.

372
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's helping to bring an incredible group

373
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
of talented people together

374
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to really try to solve and penetrate

375
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
these problems that have created our obstacles

376
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to management and rational use

377
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
of this area that was once so far away and remote.

378
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So on this tour, I hope I provided you

379
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
with a new perspective of the high seas:

380
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
one, that it is our home too,

381
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and that we need to work together

382
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.

383
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Thank you.

384
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Applause)

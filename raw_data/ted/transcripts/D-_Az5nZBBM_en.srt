1
0:00:12.936,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.

3
0:00:16.349,000 --> 0:00:17,000
CA: It feels like the world is in a place

4
0:00:18.363,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that we haven't seen for a long time.

5
0:00:20.224,000 --> 0:00:24,000
People don't just disagree in the way that we're familiar with,

6
0:00:24.809,000 --> 0:00:25,000
on the left-right political divide.

7
0:00:26.733,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There are much deeper differences afoot.

8
0:00:29.758,000 --> 0:00:32,000
What on earth is going on, and how did we get here?

9
0:00:33.048,000 --> 0:00:36,000
JH: This is different.

10
0:00:36.075,000 --> 0:00:39,000
There's a much more apocalyptic sort of feeling.

11
0:00:39.326,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Survey research by Pew Research shows

12
0:00:41.676,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that the degree to which we feel that the other side is not just --

13
0:00:45.409,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we don't just dislike them; we strongly dislike them,

14
0:00:48.407,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we think that they are a threat to the nation.

15
0:00:51.907,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Those numbers have been going up and up,

16
0:00:53.895,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and those are over 50 percent now on both sides.

17
0:00:56.656,000 --> 0:00:57,000
People are scared,

18
0:00:57.831,000 --> 0:01:,000
because it feels like this is different than before; it's much more intense.

19
0:01:01.482,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Whenever I look at any sort of social puzzle,

20
0:01:04.026,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I always apply the three basic principles of moral psychology,

21
0:01:07.167,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and I think they'll help us here.

22
0:01:09.085,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So the first thing that you have to always keep in mind

23
0:01:11.842,000 --> 0:01:12,000
when you're thinking about politics

24
0:01:13.602,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is that we're tribal.

25
0:01:15.006,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We evolved for tribalism.

26
0:01:16.553,000 --> 0:01:19,000
One of the simplest and greatest insights into human social nature

27
0:01:19.746,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is the Bedouin proverb:

28
0:01:20.943,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"Me against my brother;

29
0:01:22.359,000 --> 0:01:23,000
me and my brother against our cousin;

30
0:01:24.31,000 --> 0:01:26,000
me and my brother and cousins against the stranger."

31
0:01:26.836,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And that tribalism allowed us to create large societies

32
0:01:31.584,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and to come together in order to compete with others.

33
0:01:34.64,000 --> 0:01:37,000
That brought us out of the jungle and out of small groups,

34
0:01:38.345,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but it means that we have eternal conflict.

35
0:01:40.392,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The question you have to look at is:

36
0:01:42.157,000 --> 0:01:44,000
What aspects of our society are making that more bitter,

37
0:01:44.845,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and what are calming them down?

38
0:01:46.399,000 --> 0:01:47,000
CA: That's a very dark proverb.

39
0:01:47.984,000 --> 0:01:51,000
You're saying that that's actually baked into most people's mental wiring

40
0:01:52.181,000 --> 0:01:53,000
at some level?

41
0:01:53.356,000 --> 0:01:56,000
JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just a basic aspect of human social cognition.

42
0:01:57.184,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But we can also live together really peacefully,

43
0:01:59.531,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and we've invented all kinds of fun ways of, like, playing war.

44
0:02:02.95,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I mean, sports, politics --

45
0:02:04.356,000 --> 0:02:07,000
these are all ways that we get to exercise this tribal nature

46
0:02:08.075,000 --> 0:02:09,000
without actually hurting anyone.

47
0:02:09.682,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We're also really good at trade and exploration and meeting new people.

48
0:02:14.051,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So you have to see our tribalism as something that goes up or down --

49
0:02:17.374,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it's not like we're doomed to always be fighting each other,

50
0:02:20.25,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but we'll never have world peace.

51
0:02:22.98,000 --> 0:02:25,000
CA: The size of that tribe can shrink or expand.

52
0:02:26.226,000 --> 0:02:27,000
JH: Right.

53
0:02:27.401,000 --> 0:02:28,000
CA: The size of what we consider "us"

54
0:02:29.412,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and what we consider "other" or "them"

55
0:02:31.857,000 --> 0:02:33,000
can change.

56
0:02:34.61,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And some people believed that process could continue indefinitely.

57
0:02:40.224,000 --> 0:02:41,000
JH: That's right.

58
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:44,000
CA: And we were indeed expanding the sense of tribe for a while.

59
0:02:44.67,000 --> 0:02:45,000
JH: So this is, I think,

60
0:02:45.855,000 --> 0:02:48,000
where we're getting at what's possibly the new left-right distinction.

61
0:02:49.234,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I mean, the left-right as we've all inherited it,

62
0:02:51.581,000 --> 0:02:53,000
comes out of the labor versus capital distinction,

63
0:02:54.444,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the working class, and Marx.

64
0:02:56.843,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But I think what we're seeing now, increasingly,

65
0:02:59.116,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is a divide in all the Western democracies

66
0:03:01.994,000 --> 0:03:04,000
between the people who want to stop at nation,

67
0:03:05.725,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the people who are more parochial --

68
0:03:07.499,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and I don't mean that in a bad way --

69
0:03:09.32,000 --> 0:03:11,000
people who have much more of a sense of being rooted,

70
0:03:12.144,000 --> 0:03:15,000
they care about their town, their community and their nation.

71
0:03:15.824,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And then those who are anti-parochial and who --

72
0:03:19.885,000 --> 0:03:22,000
whenever I get confused, I just think of the John Lennon song "Imagine."

73
0:03:23.309,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"Imagine there's no countries, nothing to kill or die for."

74
0:03:26.162,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And so these are the people who want more global governance,

75
0:03:29.399,000 --> 0:03:31,000
they don't like nation states, they don't like borders.

76
0:03:32.097,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You see this all over Europe as well.

77
0:03:33.946,000 --> 0:03:36,000
There's a great metaphor guy -- actually, his name is Shakespeare --

78
0:03:37.196,000 --> 0:03:38,000
writing ten years ago in Britain.

79
0:03:38.801,000 --> 0:03:39,000
He had a metaphor:

80
0:03:39.992,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Are we drawbridge-uppers or drawbridge-downers?"

81
0:03:43.289,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And Britain is divided 52-48 on that point.

82
0:03:46.218,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And America is divided on that point, too.

83
0:03:49.379,000 --> 0:03:52,000
CA: And so, those of us who grew up with The Beatles

84
0:03:52.98,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and that sort of hippie philosophy of dreaming of a more connected world --

85
0:03:56.578,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it felt so idealistic and "how could anyone think badly about that?"

86
0:04:00.736,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And what you're saying is that, actually,

87
0:04:02.771,000 --> 0:04:06,000
millions of people today feel that that isn't just silly;

88
0:04:07.097,000 --> 0:04:09,000
it's actually dangerous and wrong, and they're scared of it.

89
0:04:09.982,000 --> 0:04:12,000
JH: I think the big issue, especially in Europe but also here,

90
0:04:13.032,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is the issue of immigration.

91
0:04:14.423,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I think this is where we have to look very carefully

92
0:04:17.516,000 --> 0:04:2,000
at the social science about diversity and immigration.

93
0:04:21.171,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Once something becomes politicized,

94
0:04:22.909,000 --> 0:04:25,000
once it becomes something that the left loves and the right --

95
0:04:25.957,000 --> 0:04:28,000
then even the social scientists can't think straight about it.

96
0:04:29.082,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.

97
0:04:31.063,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It clearly creates more innovation.

98
0:04:33.294,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The American economy has grown enormously from it.

99
0:04:35.795,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Diversity and immigration do a lot of good things.

100
0:04:38.201,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But what the globalists, I think, don't see,

101
0:04:40.853,000 --> 0:04:41,000
what they don't want to see,

102
0:04:42.384,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is that ethnic diversity cuts social capital and trust.

103
0:04:48.686,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There's a very important study by Robert Putnam,

104
0:04:51.046,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the author of "Bowling Alone,"

105
0:04:52.926,000 --> 0:04:53,000
looking at social capital databases.

106
0:04:54.805,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And basically, the more people feel that they are the same,

107
0:04:57.776,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the more they trust each other,

108
0:04:59.307,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the more they can have a redistributionist welfare state.

109
0:05:02.071,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Scandinavian countries are so wonderful

110
0:05:04.066,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because they have this legacy of being small, homogenous countries.

111
0:05:07.439,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And that leads to a progressive welfare state,

112
0:05:11.18,000 --> 0:05:13,000
a set of progressive left-leaning values, which says,

113
0:05:14.007,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Drawbridge down! The world is a great place.

114
0:05:17.032,000 --> 0:05:2,000
People in Syria are suffering -- we must welcome them in."

115
0:05:20.088,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it's a beautiful thing.

116
0:05:21.934,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But if, and I was in Sweden this summer,

117
0:05:24.541,000 --> 0:05:27,000
if the discourse in Sweden is fairly politically correct

118
0:05:27.748,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and they can't talk about the downsides,

119
0:05:30.009,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you end up bringing a lot of people in.

120
0:05:32.02,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's going to cut social capital,

121
0:05:33.736,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it makes it hard to have a welfare state

122
0:05:35.705,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and they might end up, as we have in America,

123
0:05:38.285,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with a racially divided, visibly racially divided, society.

124
0:05:41.922,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So this is all very uncomfortable to talk about.

125
0:05:44.206,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But I think this is the thing, especially in Europe and for us, too,

126
0:05:47.475,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we need to be looking at.

127
0:05:48.692,000 --> 0:05:5,000
CA: You're saying that people of reason,

128
0:05:50.802,000 --> 0:05:52,000
people who would consider themselves not racists,

129
0:05:53.314,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but moral, upstanding people,

130
0:05:55.065,000 --> 0:05:57,000
have a rationale that says humans are just too different;

131
0:05:58.035,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that we're in danger of overloading our sense of what humans are capable of,

132
0:06:03.498,000 --> 0:06:05,000
by mixing in people who are too different.

133
0:06:06.012,000 --> 0:06:09,000
JH: Yes, but I can make it much more palatable

134
0:06:09.576,000 --> 0:06:11,000
by saying it's not necessarily about race.

135
0:06:12.819,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's about culture.

136
0:06:14.11,000 --> 0:06:18,000
There's wonderful work by a political scientist named Karen Stenner,

137
0:06:18.307,000 --> 0:06:21,000
who shows that when people have a sense

138
0:06:21.558,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that we are all united, we're all the same,

139
0:06:23.817,000 --> 0:06:26,000
there are many people who have a predisposition to authoritarianism.

140
0:06:27.091,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Those people aren't particularly racist

141
0:06:29.157,000 --> 0:06:31,000
when they feel as through there's not a threat

142
0:06:31.348,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to our social and moral order.

143
0:06:33.071,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But if you prime them experimentally

144
0:06:35.128,000 --> 0:06:38,000
by thinking we're coming apart, people are getting more different,

145
0:06:38.284,000 --> 0:06:41,000
then they get more racist, homophobic, they want to kick out the deviants.

146
0:06:41.831,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So it's in part that you get an authoritarian reaction.

147
0:06:44.762,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The left, following through the Lennonist line --

148
0:06:47.123,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the John Lennon line --

149
0:06:48.433,000 --> 0:06:5,000
does things that create an authoritarian reaction.

150
0:06:50.866,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We're certainly seeing that in America with the alt-right.

151
0:06:53.685,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We saw it in Britain, we've seen it all over Europe.

152
0:06:56.291,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But the more positive part of that

153
0:06:58.897,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is that I think the localists, or the nationalists, are actually right --

154
0:07:03.218,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that, if you emphasize our cultural similarity,

155
0:07:07.029,000 --> 0:07:09,000
then race doesn't actually matter very much.

156
0:07:09.28,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So an assimilationist approach to immigration

157
0:07:12.012,000 --> 0:07:13,000
removes a lot of these problems.

158
0:07:13.593,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And if you value having a generous welfare state,

159
0:07:16.004,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you've got to emphasize that we're all the same.

160
0:07:18.84,000 --> 0:07:21,000
CA: OK, so rising immigration and fears about that

161
0:07:21.958,000 --> 0:07:24,000
are one of the causes of the current divide.

162
0:07:25.149,000 --> 0:07:26,000
What are other causes?

163
0:07:26.886,000 --> 0:07:28,000
JH: The next principle of moral psychology

164
0:07:28.931,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is that intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second.

165
0:07:32.758,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You've probably heard the term "motivated reasoning"

166
0:07:35.262,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or "confirmation bias."

167
0:07:36.893,000 --> 0:07:37,000
There's some really interesting work

168
0:07:38.834,000 --> 0:07:41,000
on how our high intelligence and our verbal abilities

169
0:07:41.935,000 --> 0:07:44,000
might have evolved not to help us find out the truth,

170
0:07:45.161,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but to help us manipulate each other, defend our reputation ...

171
0:07:48.157,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We're really, really good at justifying ourselves.

172
0:07:51.147,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And when you bring group interests into account,

173
0:07:53.538,000 --> 0:07:55,000
so it's not just me, it's my team versus your team,

174
0:07:56.299,000 --> 0:07:58,000
whereas if you're evaluating evidence that your side is wrong,

175
0:07:59.236,000 --> 0:08:,000
we just can't accept that.

176
0:08:01.017,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So this is why you can't win a political argument.

177
0:08:03.758,000 --> 0:08:04,000
If you're debating something,

178
0:08:05.275,000 --> 0:08:08,000
you can't persuade the person with reasons and evidence,

179
0:08:08.346,000 --> 0:08:1,000
because that's not the way reasoning works.

180
0:08:10.715,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So now, give us the internet, give us Google:

181
0:08:14.522,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"I heard that Barack Obama was born in Kenya.

182
0:08:17.276,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Let me Google that -- oh my God! 10 million hits! Look, he was!"

183
0:08:21.248,000 --> 0:08:24,000
CA: So this has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people.

184
0:08:24.412,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Social media has often been framed by techno-optimists

185
0:08:27.284,000 --> 0:08:32,000
as this great connecting force that would bring people together.

186
0:08:32.555,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And there have been some unexpected counter-effects to that.

187
0:08:36.922,000 --> 0:08:37,000
JH: That's right.

188
0:08:38.097,000 --> 0:08:4,000
That's why I'm very enamored of yin-yang views

189
0:08:40.502,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of human nature and left-right --

190
0:08:42.144,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that each side is right about certain things,

191
0:08:44.634,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but then it goes blind to other things.

192
0:08:46.779,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And so the left generally believes that human nature is good:

193
0:08:49.781,000 --> 0:08:52,000
bring people together, knock down the walls and all will be well.

194
0:08:52.97,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The right -- social conservatives, not libertarians --

195
0:08:55.552,000 --> 0:08:59,000
social conservatives generally believe people can be greedy

196
0:08:59.829,000 --> 0:09:,000
and sexual and selfish,

197
0:09:01.235,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we need regulation, and we need restrictions.

198
0:09:04.214,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,

199
0:09:06.64,000 --> 0:09:08,000
allow people to communicate all over the world,

200
0:09:08.893,000 --> 0:09:1,000
you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.

201
0:09:10.975,000 --> 0:09:11,000
CA: So help us understand.

202
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
These principles of human nature have been with us forever.

203
0:09:18.918,000 --> 0:09:22,000
What's changed that's deepened this feeling of division?

204
0:09:24.36,000 --> 0:09:28,000
JH: You have to see six to ten different threads all coming together.

205
0:09:29.373,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I'll just list a couple of them.

206
0:09:31.398,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So in America, one of the big -- actually, America and Europe --

207
0:09:35.9,000 --> 0:09:36,000
one of the biggest ones is World War II.

208
0:09:37.837,000 --> 0:09:39,000
There's interesting research from Joe Henrich and others

209
0:09:40.504,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that says if your country was at war,

210
0:09:42.931,000 --> 0:09:43,000
especially when you were young,

211
0:09:44.512,000 --> 0:09:47,000
then we test you 30 years later in a commons dilemma

212
0:09:47.65,000 --> 0:09:48,000
or a prisoner's dilemma,

213
0:09:49.003,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you're more cooperative.

214
0:09:50.983,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Because of our tribal nature, if you're --

215
0:09:53.88,000 --> 0:09:55,000
my parents were teenagers during World War II,

216
0:09:56.821,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and they would go out looking for scraps of aluminum

217
0:09:59.406,000 --> 0:10:,000
to help the war effort.

218
0:10:00.619,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I mean, everybody pulled together.

219
0:10:02.821,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And so then these people go on,

220
0:10:04.374,000 --> 0:10:06,000
they rise up through business and government,

221
0:10:06.796,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they take leadership positions.

222
0:10:08.451,000 --> 0:10:11,000
They're really good at compromise and cooperation.

223
0:10:11.726,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They all retire by the '90s.

224
0:10:13.685,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So we're left with baby boomers by the end of the '90s.

225
0:10:17.01,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And their youth was spent fighting each other within each country,

226
0:10:21.001,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in 1968 and afterwards.

227
0:10:22.672,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The loss of the World War II generation, "The Greatest Generation,"

228
0:10:26.69,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is huge.

229
0:10:28.567,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So that's one.

230
0:10:30.44,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Another, in America, is the purification of the two parties.

231
0:10:33.949,000 --> 0:10:36,000
There used to be liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats.

232
0:10:37.02,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So America had a mid-20th century that was really bipartisan.

233
0:10:40.211,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But because of a variety of factors that started things moving,

234
0:10:44.602,000 --> 0:10:47,000
by the 90's, we had a purified liberal party and conservative party.

235
0:10:48.024,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So now, the people in either party really are different,

236
0:10:50.693,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and we really don't want our children to marry them,

237
0:10:53.2,000 --> 0:10:55,000
which, in the '60s, didn't matter very much.

238
0:10:55.292,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So, the purification of the parties.

239
0:10:57.113,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Third is the internet and, as I said,

240
0:10:59.609,000 --> 0:11:03,000
it's just the most amazing stimulant for post-hoc reasoning and demonization.

241
0:11:04.316,000 --> 0:11:08,000
CA: The tone of what's happening on the internet now is quite troubling.

242
0:11:09.132,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I just did a quick search on Twitter about the election

243
0:11:12.003,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and saw two tweets next to each other.

244
0:11:15.335,000 --> 0:11:19,000
One, against a picture of racist graffiti:

245
0:11:20.007,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"This is disgusting!

246
0:11:21.664,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Ugliness in this country, brought to us by #Trump."

247
0:11:25.424,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And then the next one is:

248
0:11:27.339,000 --> 0:11:3,000
"Crooked Hillary dedication page. Disgusting!"

249
0:11:31.176,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So this idea of "disgust" is troubling to me.

250
0:11:35.407,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Because you can have an argument or a disagreement about something,

251
0:11:38.666,000 --> 0:11:39,000
you can get angry at someone.

252
0:11:41.094,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Disgust, I've heard you say, takes things to a much deeper level.

253
0:11:44.711,000 --> 0:11:45,000
JH: That's right. Disgust is different.

254
0:11:46.622,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Anger -- you know, I have kids.

255
0:11:48.609,000 --> 0:11:49,000
They fight 10 times a day,

256
0:11:50.383,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and they love each other 30 times a day.

257
0:11:52.374,000 --> 0:11:54,000
You just go back and forth: you get angry, you're not angry;

258
0:11:55.308,000 --> 0:11:56,000
you're angry, you're not angry.

259
0:11:56.855,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But disgust is different.

260
0:11:58.189,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Disgust paints the person as subhuman, monstrous,

261
0:12:02.686,000 --> 0:12:03,000
deformed, morally deformed.

262
0:12:04.519,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Disgust is like indelible ink.

263
0:12:07.768,000 --> 0:12:1,000
There's research from John Gottman on marital therapy.

264
0:12:11.307,000 --> 0:12:16,000
If you look at the faces -- if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt,

265
0:12:16.456,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that's a predictor that they're going to get divorced soon,

266
0:12:19.576,000 --> 0:12:21,000
whereas if they show anger, that doesn't predict anything,

267
0:12:22.499,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because if you deal with anger well, it actually is good.

268
0:12:25.232,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So this election is different.

269
0:12:26.708,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Donald Trump personally uses the word "disgust" a lot.

270
0:12:30.386,000 --> 0:12:32,000
He's very germ-sensitive, so disgust does matter a lot --

271
0:12:33.267,000 --> 0:12:36,000
more for him, that's something unique to him --

272
0:12:37.201,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but as we demonize each other more,

273
0:12:40.128,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and again, through the Manichaean worldview,

274
0:12:43.561,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the idea that the world is a battle between good and evil

275
0:12:46.315,000 --> 0:12:47,000
as this has been ramping up,

276
0:12:47.686,000 --> 0:12:5,000
we're more likely not just to say they're wrong or I don't like them,

277
0:12:51.036,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but we say they're evil, they're satanic,

278
0:12:53.596,000 --> 0:12:54,000
they're disgusting, they're revolting.

279
0:12:55.541,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And then we want nothing to do with them.

280
0:12:58.806,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And that's why I think we're seeing it, for example, on campus now.

281
0:13:02.317,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We're seeing more the urge to keep people off campus,

282
0:13:04.981,000 --> 0:13:05,000
silence them, keep them away.

283
0:13:06.95,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I'm afraid that this whole generation of young people,

284
0:13:09.569,000 --> 0:13:12,000
if their introduction to politics involves a lot of disgust,

285
0:13:13.386,000 --> 0:13:16,000
they're not going to want to be involved in politics as they get older.

286
0:13:17.506,000 --> 0:13:18,000
CA: So how do we deal with that?

287
0:13:19.37,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Disgust. How do you defuse disgust?

288
0:13:24.874,000 --> 0:13:25,000
JH: You can't do it with reasons.

289
0:13:27.312,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I think ...

290
0:13:30.257,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I studied disgust for many years, and I think about emotions a lot.

291
0:13:33.498,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And I think that the opposite of disgust is actually love.

292
0:13:37.764,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Love is all about, like ...

293
0:13:41.239,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Disgust is closing off, borders.

294
0:13:43.834,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Love is about dissolving walls.

295
0:13:47.074,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So personal relationships, I think,

296
0:13:49.578,000 --> 0:13:51,000
are probably the most powerful means we have.

297
0:13:53.291,000 --> 0:13:55,000
You can be disgusted by a group of people,

298
0:13:56.012,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but then you meet a particular person

299
0:13:57.954,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and you genuinely discover that they're lovely.

300
0:14:00.754,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And then gradually that chips away or changes your category as well.

301
0:14:06.016,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The tragedy is, Americans used to be much more mixed up in the their towns

302
0:14:12.017,000 --> 0:14:14,000
by left-right or politics.

303
0:14:14.175,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And now that it's become this great moral divide,

304
0:14:16.53,000 --> 0:14:19,000
there's a lot of evidence that we're moving to be near people

305
0:14:19.697,000 --> 0:14:2,000
who are like us politically.

306
0:14:21.233,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It's harder to find somebody who's on the other side.

307
0:14:23.787,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So they're over there, they're far away.

308
0:14:26.101,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It's harder to get to know them.

309
0:14:27.695,000 --> 0:14:31,000
CA: What would you say to someone or say to Americans,

310
0:14:31.943,000 --> 0:14:32,000
people generally,

311
0:14:33.125,000 --> 0:14:35,000
about what we should understand about each other

312
0:14:35.758,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that might help us rethink for a minute

313
0:14:39.257,000 --> 0:14:41,000
this "disgust" instinct?

314
0:14:42.086,000 --> 0:14:43,000
JH: Yes.

315
0:14:43.262,000 --> 0:14:45,000
A really important thing to keep in mind --

316
0:14:45.439,000 --> 0:14:49,000
there's research by political scientist Alan Abramowitz,

317
0:14:50.179,000 --> 0:14:53,000
showing that American democracy is increasingly governed

318
0:14:54.196,000 --> 0:14:56,000
by what's called "negative partisanship."

319
0:14:56.875,000 --> 0:14:59,000
That means you think, OK there's a candidate,

320
0:15:00.01,000 --> 0:15:02,000
you like the candidate, you vote for the candidate.

321
0:15:02.44,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But with the rise of negative advertising

322
0:15:04.523,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and social media and all sorts of other trends,

323
0:15:06.771,000 --> 0:15:08,000
increasingly, the way elections are done

324
0:15:08.836,000 --> 0:15:11,000
is that each side tries to make the other side so horrible, so awful,

325
0:15:12.841,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that you'll vote for my guy by default.

326
0:15:15.319,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And so as we more and more vote against the other side

327
0:15:18.313,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and not for our side,

328
0:15:19.668,000 --> 0:15:24,000
you have to keep in mind that if people are on the left,

329
0:15:25.199,000 --> 0:15:27,000
they think, "Well, I used to think that Republicans were bad,

330
0:15:28.133,000 --> 0:15:29,000
but now Donald Trump proves it.

331
0:15:29.64,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And now every Republican, I can paint with all the things

332
0:15:32.515,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that I think about Trump."

333
0:15:33.921,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And that's not necessarily true.

334
0:15:35.538,000 --> 0:15:37,000
They're generally not very happy with their candidate.

335
0:15:38.254,000 --> 0:15:42,000
This is the most negative partisanship election in American history.

336
0:15:43.86,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So you have to first separate your feelings about the candidate

337
0:15:47.247,000 --> 0:15:49,000
from your feelings about the people who are given a choice.

338
0:15:50.208,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And then you have to realize that,

339
0:15:53.246,000 --> 0:15:55,000
because we all live in a separate moral world --

340
0:15:55.69,000 --> 0:15:58,000
the metaphor I use in the book is that we're all trapped in "The Matrix,"

341
0:15:59.165,000 --> 0:16:02,000
or each moral community is a matrix, a consensual hallucination.

342
0:16:02.713,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And so if you're within the blue matrix,

343
0:16:04.98,000 --> 0:16:07,000
everything's completely compelling that the other side --

344
0:16:08.198,000 --> 0:16:11,000
they're troglodytes, they're racists, they're the worst people in the world,

345
0:16:11.853,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and you have all the facts to back that up.

346
0:16:13.981,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But somebody in the next house from yours

347
0:16:16.28,000 --> 0:16:18,000
is living in a different moral matrix.

348
0:16:18.337,000 --> 0:16:19,000
They live in a different video game,

349
0:16:20.308,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and they see a completely different set of facts.

350
0:16:22.71,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And each one sees different threats to the country.

351
0:16:25.41,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And what I've found from being in the middle

352
0:16:27.524,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and trying to understand both sides is: both sides are right.

353
0:16:30.475,000 --> 0:16:32,000
There are a lot of threats to this country,

354
0:16:32.619,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and each side is constitutionally incapable of seeing them all.

355
0:16:36.963,000 --> 0:16:42,000
CA: So, are you saying that we almost need a new type of empathy?

356
0:16:43.506,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Empathy is traditionally framed as:

357
0:16:45.7,000 --> 0:16:47,000
"Oh, I feel your pain. I can put myself in your shoes."

358
0:16:48.415,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And we apply it to the poor, the needy, the suffering.

359
0:16:52.023,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We don't usually apply it to people who we feel as other,

360
0:16:55.87,000 --> 0:16:56,000
or we're disgusted by.

361
0:16:57.359,000 --> 0:16:58,000
JH: No. That's right.

362
0:16:58.534,000 --> 0:17:02,000
CA: What would it look like to build that type of empathy?

363
0:17:04.268,000 --> 0:17:05,000
JH: Actually, I think ...

364
0:17:06.145,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Empathy is a very, very hot topic in psychology,

365
0:17:08.474,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and it's a very popular word on the left in particular.

366
0:17:11.156,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Empathy is a good thing, and empathy for the preferred classes of victims.

367
0:17:15.18,000 --> 0:17:16,000
So it's important to empathize

368
0:17:16.657,000 --> 0:17:18,000
with the groups that we on the left think are so important.

369
0:17:19.505,000 --> 0:17:21,000
That's easy to do, because you get points for that.

370
0:17:22.442,000 --> 0:17:25,000
But empathy really should get you points if you do it when it's hard to do.

371
0:17:26.513,000 --> 0:17:27,000
And, I think ...

372
0:17:28.291,000 --> 0:17:33,000
You know, we had a long 50-year period of dealing with our race problems

373
0:17:33.403,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and legal discrimination,

374
0:17:35.682,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and that was our top priority for a long time

375
0:17:37.893,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and it still is important.

376
0:17:39.167,000 --> 0:17:4,000
But I think this year,

377
0:17:40.72,000 --> 0:17:42,000
I'm hoping it will make people see

378
0:17:43.148,000 --> 0:17:45,000
that we have an existential threat on our hands.

379
0:17:45.967,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Our left-right divide, I believe,

380
0:17:48.658,000 --> 0:17:5,000
is by far the most important divide we face.

381
0:17:50.842,000 --> 0:17:53,000
We still have issues about race and gender and LGBT,

382
0:17:53.897,000 --> 0:17:56,000
but this is the urgent need of the next 50 years,

383
0:17:57.292,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and things aren't going to get better on their own.

384
0:18:01.021,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So we're going to need to do a lot of institutional reforms,

385
0:18:03.88,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and we could talk about that,

386
0:18:05.313,000 --> 0:18:07,000
but that's like a whole long, wonky conversation.

387
0:18:07.667,000 --> 0:18:1,000
But I think it starts with people realizing that this is a turning point.

388
0:18:11.537,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.

389
0:18:14.37,000 --> 0:18:15,000
We need to realize:

390
0:18:15.899,000 --> 0:18:16,000
this is what our country needs,

391
0:18:17.465,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and this is what you need if you don't want to --

392
0:18:19.843,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Raise your hand if you want to spend the next four years

393
0:18:22.562,000 --> 0:18:25,000
as angry and worried as you've been for the last year -- raise your hand.

394
0:18:26.072,000 --> 0:18:27,000
So if you want to escape from this,

395
0:18:27.801,000 --> 0:18:29,000
read Buddha, read Jesus, read Marcus Aurelius.

396
0:18:29.976,000 --> 0:18:34,000
They have all kinds of great advice for how to drop the fear,

397
0:18:35.062,000 --> 0:18:36,000
reframe things,

398
0:18:36.264,000 --> 0:18:38,000
stop seeing other people as your enemy.

399
0:18:38.371,000 --> 0:18:41,000
There's a lot of guidance in ancient wisdom for this kind of empathy.

400
0:18:41.702,000 --> 0:18:42,000
CA: Here's my last question:

401
0:18:43.103,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Personally, what can people do to help heal?

402
0:18:47.462,000 --> 0:18:51,000
JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide to overcome your deepest prejudices.

403
0:18:51.569,000 --> 0:18:52,000
And there's research showing

404
0:18:53.054,000 --> 0:18:57,000
that political prejudices are deeper and stronger than race prejudices

405
0:18:57.427,000 --> 0:18:58,000
in the country now.

406
0:18:59.395,000 --> 0:19:02,000
So I think you have to make an effort -- that's the main thing.

407
0:19:02.851,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Make an effort to actually meet somebody.

408
0:19:04.879,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,

409
0:19:07.113,000 --> 0:19:08,000
somebody who's on the other side.

410
0:19:09.006,000 --> 0:19:1,000
So, after this election --

411
0:19:11.252,000 --> 0:19:12,000
wait a week or two,

412
0:19:12.627,000 --> 0:19:14,000
because it's probably going to feel awful for one of you --

413
0:19:15.487,000 --> 0:19:19,000
but wait a couple weeks, and then reach out and say you want to talk.

414
0:19:19.663,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And before you do it,

415
0:19:21.111,000 --> 0:19:24,000
read Dale Carnegie, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" --

416
0:19:24.28,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Laughter)

417
0:19:25.343,000 --> 0:19:26,000
I'm totally serious.

418
0:19:26.534,000 --> 0:19:28,000
You'll learn techniques if you start by acknowledging,

419
0:19:29.148,000 --> 0:19:3,000
if you start by saying,

420
0:19:30.333,000 --> 0:19:31,000
"You know, we don't agree on a lot,

421
0:19:32.027,000 --> 0:19:34,000
but one thing I really respect about you, Uncle Bob,"

422
0:19:34.589,000 --> 0:19:36,000
or "... about you conservatives, is ... "

423
0:19:36.672,000 --> 0:19:37,000
And you can find something.

424
0:19:38.03,000 --> 0:19:4,000
If you start with some appreciation, it's like magic.

425
0:19:40.817,000 --> 0:19:42,000
This is one of the main things I've learned

426
0:19:42.955,000 --> 0:19:43,000
that I take into my human relationships.

427
0:19:44.892,000 --> 0:19:45,000
I still make lots of stupid mistakes,

428
0:19:46.836,000 --> 0:19:48,000
but I'm incredibly good at apologizing now,

429
0:19:48.876,000 --> 0:19:5,000
and at acknowledging what somebody was right about.

430
0:19:51.317,000 --> 0:19:52,000
And if you do that,

431
0:19:52.495,000 --> 0:19:55,000
then the conversation goes really well, and it's actually really fun.

432
0:19:56.717,000 --> 0:19:58,000
CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating speaking with you.

433
0:19:59.386,000 --> 0:20:02,000
It really does feel like the ground that we're on

434
0:20:03.168,000 --> 0:20:07,000
is a ground populated by deep questions of morality and human nature.

435
0:20:08.366,000 --> 0:20:1,000
Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant.

436
0:20:10.814,000 --> 0:20:12,000
Thank you so much for sharing this time with us.

437
0:20:13.133,000 --> 0:20:14,000
JH: Thanks, Chris.

438
0:20:14.309,000 --> 0:20:15,000
JH: Thanks, everyone.

439
0:20:15.494,000 --> 0:20:17,000
(Applause)

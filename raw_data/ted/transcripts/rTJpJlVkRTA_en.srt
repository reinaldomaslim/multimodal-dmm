1
0:00:12.286,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Chris Anderson: So I guess what we're going to do is

2
0:00:14.807,000 --> 0:00:16,000
we're going to talk about your life,

3
0:00:17.268,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and using some pictures that you shared with me.

4
0:00:20.426,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I think we should start right here with this one.

5
0:00:23.375,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Okay, now who is this?

6
0:00:26.423,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Martine Rothblatt: This is me with our oldest son Eli.

7
0:00:31.492,000 --> 0:00:32,000
He was about age five.

8
0:00:33.382,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is taken in Nigeria

9
0:00:35.495,000 --> 0:00:38,000
right after having taken the Washington, D.C. bar exam.

10
0:00:39.489,000 --> 0:00:42,000
CA: Okay. But this doesn't really look like a Martine.

11
0:00:44.084,000 --> 0:00:49,000
MR: Right. That was myself as a male, the way I was brought up.

12
0:00:51.831,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Before I transitioned from male to female and Martin to Martine.

13
0:00:55.733,000 --> 0:00:57,000
CA: You were brought up Martin Rothblatt.

14
0:00:57.762,000 --> 0:00:58,000
MR: Correct.

15
0:00:58.807,000 --> 0:01:02,000
CA: And about a year after this picture, you married a beautiful woman.

16
0:01:03.431,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Was this love at first sight? What happened there?

17
0:01:05.947,000 --> 0:01:06,000
MR: It was love at the first sight.

18
0:01:07.757,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I saw Bina at a discotheque in Los Angeles,

19
0:01:12.17,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and we later began living together,

20
0:01:15.653,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but the moment I saw her, I saw just an aura of energy around her.

21
0:01:19.484,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I asked her to dance.

22
0:01:21.156,000 --> 0:01:23,000
She said she saw an aura of energy around me.

23
0:01:24.058,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I was a single male parent. She was a single female parent.

24
0:01:27.753,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We showed each other our kids' pictures,

25
0:01:30.188,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we've been happily married for a third of a century now.

26
0:01:34.298,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Applause)

27
0:01:38.832,000 --> 0:01:41,000
CA: And at the time, you were kind of this hotshot entrepreneur,

28
0:01:41.89,000 --> 0:01:42,000
working with satellites.

29
0:01:43.585,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I think you had two successful companies,

30
0:01:45.847,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and then you started addressing this problem

31
0:01:47.951,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of how could you use satellites to revolutionize radio.

32
0:01:52.162,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Tell us about that.

33
0:01:53.825,000 --> 0:01:55,000
MR: Right. I always loved space technology,

34
0:01:55.961,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and satellites, to me, are sort of like the canoes that our ancestors

35
0:01:59.862,000 --> 0:02:01,000
first pushed out into the water.

36
0:02:02.021,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation

37
0:02:05.388,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of the oceans of the sky,

38
0:02:07.826,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and as I developed different types of satellite communication systems,

39
0:02:12.354,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the main thing I did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites,

40
0:02:17.655,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas

41
0:02:21.316,000 --> 0:02:22,000
could be smaller and smaller,

42
0:02:23.29,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and after going through direct television broadcasting,

43
0:02:27.144,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite,

44
0:02:30.678,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the receiving dish could be so small

45
0:02:33.418,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish,

46
0:02:36.71,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a flat little plate embedded into the roof of an automobile,

47
0:02:40.449,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio,

48
0:02:44.35,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and that's Sirius XM today.

49
0:02:46.904,000 --> 0:02:48,000
CA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius?

50
0:02:48.924,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Applause)

51
0:02:51.506,000 --> 0:02:53,000
MR: Thank you for your monthly subscriptions.

52
0:02:53.684,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:56.447,000 --> 0:03:,000
CA: So that succeeded despite all predictions at the time.

54
0:03:00.649,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It was a huge commercial success,

55
0:03:02.878,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but soon after this, in the early 1990s,

56
0:03:07.197,000 --> 0:03:11,000
there was this big transition in your life and you became Martine.

57
0:03:11.713,000 --> 0:03:14,000
MR: Correct. CA: So tell me, how did that happen?

58
0:03:17.01,000 --> 0:03:23,000
MR: It happened in consultation with Bina and our four beautiful children,

59
0:03:23.877,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I discussed with each of them

60
0:03:28.749,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that I felt my soul was always female, and as a woman,

61
0:03:34.739,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but I was afraid people would laugh at me if I expressed it,

62
0:03:39.334,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so I always kept it bottled up

63
0:03:41.863,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and just showed my male side.

64
0:03:44.998,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And each of them had a different take on this.

65
0:03:48.016,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Bina said, "I love your soul,

66
0:03:52.497,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and whether the outside is Martin and Martine,

67
0:03:56.073,000 --> 0:03:58,000
it doesn't it matter to me, I love your soul."

68
0:03:58.488,000 --> 0:04:05,000
My son said, "If you become a woman, will you still be my father?"

69
0:04:06.15,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I said, "Yes, I'll always be your father,"

70
0:04:09.377,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I'm still his father today.

71
0:04:12.675,000 --> 0:04:16,000
My youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five-year-old thing.

72
0:04:17.226,000 --> 0:04:22,000
She told people, "I love my dad and she loves me."

73
0:04:23.897,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever.

74
0:04:28.432,000 --> 0:04:3,000
CA: And a couple years after this, you published this book:

75
0:04:31.349,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"The Apartheid of Sex."

76
0:04:33.229,000 --> 0:04:35,000
What was your thesis in this book?

77
0:04:35.458,000 --> 0:04:39,000
MR: My thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world,

78
0:04:39.8,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and actually, seven billion unique ways to express one's gender.

79
0:04:45.117,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And while people may have the genitals of a male or a female,

80
0:04:51.549,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the genitals don't determine your gender

81
0:04:54.591,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or even really your sexual identity.

82
0:04:57.4,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's just a matter of anatomy

83
0:04:59.095,000 --> 0:05:,000
and reproductive tracts,

84
0:05:00.906,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and people could choose whatever gender they want

85
0:05:04.111,000 --> 0:05:09,000
if they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female

86
0:05:09.477,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white.

87
0:05:13.778,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We know from anthropological science that race is fiction,

88
0:05:17.98,000 --> 0:05:19,000
even though racism is very, very real,

89
0:05:20.782,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we now know from cultural studies

90
0:05:23.382,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction.

91
0:05:27.57,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The reality is a gender fluidity

92
0:05:30.335,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that crosses the entire continuum from male to female.

93
0:05:34.225,000 --> 0:05:37,000
CA: You yourself don't always feel 100 percent female.

94
0:05:37.784,000 --> 0:05:39,000
MR: Correct. I would say in some ways

95
0:05:40.019,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I change my gender about as often as I change my hairstyle.

96
0:05:43.92,000 --> 0:05:5,000
CA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this is your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.

97
0:05:51.142,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened.

98
0:05:55.525,000 --> 0:06:,000
MR: Yes, she was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs

99
0:06:00.8,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in our house to her bedroom,

100
0:06:02.611,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and after several months of doctors,

101
0:06:04.813,000 --> 0:06:08,000
she was diagnosed to have a rare, almost invariably fatal disease

102
0:06:09.267,000 --> 0:06:13,000
called pulmonary arterial hypertension.

103
0:06:13.338,000 --> 0:06:15,000
CA: So how did you respond to that?

104
0:06:15.869,000 --> 0:06:18,000
MR: Well, we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could.

105
0:06:19.398,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We ended up at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.

106
0:06:23.415,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The head of pediatric cardiology

107
0:06:25.621,000 --> 0:06:29,000
told us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant,

108
0:06:30.105,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but not to hold out any hope,

109
0:06:31.984,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because there are very few lungs available,

110
0:06:34.096,000 --> 0:06:35,000
especially for children.

111
0:06:35.861,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He said that all people with this illness died,

112
0:06:40.319,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and if any of you have seen the film "Lorenzo's Oil,"

113
0:06:44.939,000 --> 0:06:45,000
there's a scene when the protagonist

114
0:06:46.843,000 --> 0:06:52,000
kind of rolls down the stairway crying and bemoaning the fate of his son,

115
0:06:53.089,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and that's exactly how we felt about Jenesis.

116
0:06:56.456,000 --> 0:06:59,000
CA: But you didn't accept that as the limit of what you could do.

117
0:07:00.078,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow.

118
0:07:04.915,000 --> 0:07:07,000
MR: Correct. She was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time,

119
0:07:08.739,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and Bina and I would tag team to stay at the hospital

120
0:07:12.709,000 --> 0:07:14,000
while the other watched the rest of the kids,

121
0:07:15.101,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and when I was in the hospital and she was sleeping,

122
0:07:17.678,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I went to the hospital library.

123
0:07:19.373,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I read every article that I could find on pulmonary hypertension.

124
0:07:24.221,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I had not taken any biology, even in college,

125
0:07:27.68,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so I had to go from a biology textbook to a college-level textbook

126
0:07:33.307,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and then medical textbook and the journal articles, back and forth,

127
0:07:37.572,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and eventually I knew enough to think that it might be possible

128
0:07:41.635,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that somebody could find a cure.

129
0:07:43.4,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So we started a nonprofit foundation.

130
0:07:47.254,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I wrote a description asking people to submit grants

131
0:07:51.597,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and we would pay for medical research.

132
0:07:54.336,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I became an expert on the condition -- doctors said to me, Martine,

133
0:07:57.981,000 --> 0:08:,000
we really appreciate all the funding you've provided us,

134
0:08:01.696,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but we are not going to be able to find a cure in time

135
0:08:05.736,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to save your daughter.

136
0:08:07.454,000 --> 0:08:08,000
However, there is a medicine

137
0:08:09.451,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company

138
0:08:14.652,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that could halt the progression of the disease,

139
0:08:17.764,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.

140
0:08:22.57,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They made a decision not to develop

141
0:08:24.723,000 --> 0:08:27,000
any medicines for rare and orphan diseases,

142
0:08:28.015,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications

143
0:08:32.612,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension.

144
0:08:37.191,000 --> 0:08:4,000
CA: So how on earth did you get access to this drug?

145
0:08:40.254,000 --> 0:08:42,000
MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome

146
0:08:42.428,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face

147
0:08:47.907,000 --> 0:08:5,000
because they weren't going to out-license the drug

148
0:08:51.415,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to a satellite communications expert,

149
0:08:54.208,000 --> 0:09:,000
they weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all,

150
0:09:00.643,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and they thought I didn't have the expertise,

151
0:09:03.682,000 --> 0:09:09,000
finally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me

152
0:09:10.276,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and develop enough credibility.

153
0:09:12.644,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I wore down their resistance,

154
0:09:14.525,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and they had no hope this drug would even work, by the way,

155
0:09:18.095,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and they tried to tell me, "You're just wasting your time.

156
0:09:20.813,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We're sorry about your daughter."

157
0:09:22.414,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But finally, for 25,000 dollars

158
0:09:25.432,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get,

159
0:09:29.89,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug.

160
0:09:34.31,000 --> 0:09:4,000
CA: And so you put this drug on the market in a really brilliant way,

161
0:09:40.616,000 --> 0:09:44,000
by basically charging what it would take to make the economics work.

162
0:09:45.354,000 --> 0:09:48,000
MR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up --

163
0:09:49.185,000 --> 0:09:51,000
after I wrote the check for 25,000,

164
0:09:52.18,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and I said, "Okay, where's the medicine for Jenesis?"

165
0:09:54.99,000 --> 0:09:57,000
they said, "Oh, Martine, there's no medicine for Jenesis.

166
0:09:58.171,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is just something we tried in rats."

167
0:10:00.377,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And they gave me, like, a little plastic Ziploc bag

168
0:10:04.092,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of a small amount of powder.

169
0:10:05.647,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They said, "Don't give it to any human,"

170
0:10:08.457,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent,

171
0:10:12.265,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and from that, we had to figure out a way to make this medicine.

172
0:10:16.096,000 --> 0:10:19,000
A hundred chemists in the U.S. at the top universities

173
0:10:19.161,000 --> 0:10:23,000
all swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine.

174
0:10:23.83,000 --> 0:10:26,000
If it was turned into a medicine, it could never be delivered

175
0:10:27.125,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because it had a half-life of only 45 minutes.

176
0:10:30.352,000 --> 0:10:34,000
CA: And yet, a year or two later, you were there with a medicine

177
0:10:34.81,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that worked for Jenesis.

178
0:10:38.967,000 --> 0:10:43,000
MR: Chris, the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless

179
0:10:44.001,000 --> 0:10:45,000
piece of powder

180
0:10:45.654,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that had the sparkle of a promise of hope for Jenesis

181
0:10:49.717,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is not only keeping Jenesis and other people alive today,

182
0:10:54.964,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue.

183
0:10:59.097,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

184
0:11:02.923,000 --> 0:11:04,000
CA: So here you go.

185
0:11:05.454,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So you took this company public, right?

186
0:11:09.007,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And made an absolute fortune.

187
0:11:11.537,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And how much have you paid Glaxo, by the way, after that 25,000?

188
0:11:15.531,000 --> 0:11:18,000
MR: Yeah, well, every year we pay them 10 percent of 1.5 billion,

189
0:11:19.339,000 --> 0:11:22,000
150 million dollars, last year 100 million dollars.

190
0:11:23.054,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It's the best return on investment they ever received. (Laughter)

191
0:11:26.165,000 --> 0:11:28,000
CA: And the best news of all, I guess,

192
0:11:28.232,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is this.

193
0:11:30.089,000 --> 0:11:34,000
MR: Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely brilliant young lady.

194
0:11:34.362,000 --> 0:11:36,000
She's alive, healthy today at 30.

195
0:11:36.985,000 --> 0:11:38,000
You see me, Bina and Jenesis there.

196
0:11:39.447,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The most amazing thing about Jenesis

197
0:11:42.326,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is that while she could do anything with her life,

198
0:11:45.228,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and believe me, if you grew up your whole life with people

199
0:11:48.924,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in your face saying that you've got a fatal disease,

200
0:11:51.846,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again.

201
0:11:56.559,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But instead she chooses to work in United Therapeutics.

202
0:11:59.694,000 --> 0:12:02,000
She says she wants to do all she can to help other people

203
0:12:03.304,000 --> 0:12:05,000
with orphan diseases get medicines,

204
0:12:05.522,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and today, she's our project leader for all telepresence activities,

205
0:12:10.212,000 --> 0:12:13,000
where she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together

206
0:12:13.741,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to find cures for pulmonary hypertension.

207
0:12:16.69,000 --> 0:12:19,000
CA: But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate.

208
0:12:19.987,000 --> 0:12:23,000
There are still many people dying, and you are tackling that too. How?

209
0:12:24.442,000 --> 0:12:28,000
MR: Exactly, Chris. There's some 3,000 people a year in the United States alone,

210
0:12:28.926,000 --> 0:12:3,000
perhaps 10 times that number worldwide,

211
0:12:31.805,000 --> 0:12:33,000
who continue to die of this illness

212
0:12:33.96,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because the medicines slow down the progression

213
0:12:36.49,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but they don't halt it.

214
0:12:38.185,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The only cure for pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis,

215
0:12:42.924,000 --> 0:12:44,000
cystic fibrosis, emphysema,

216
0:12:45.36,000 --> 0:12:47,000
COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,

217
0:12:48.355,000 --> 0:12:5,000
is a lung transplant,

218
0:12:50.863,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but sadly, there are only enough available lungs for 2,000 people

219
0:12:55.623,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in the U.S. a year to get a lung transplant,

220
0:12:58.525,000 --> 0:13:01,000
whereas nearly a half million people a year

221
0:13:01.822,000 --> 0:13:03,000
die of end-stage lung failure.

222
0:13:04.121,000 --> 0:13:06,000
CA: So how can you address that?

223
0:13:06.815,000 --> 0:13:08,000
MR: So I conceptualize the possibility

224
0:13:09.299,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that just like we keep cars and planes

225
0:13:12.712,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and buildings going forever

226
0:13:15.104,000 --> 0:13:19,000
with an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts,

227
0:13:19.331,000 --> 0:13:22,000
why can't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs

228
0:13:22.521,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to keep people living indefinitely,

229
0:13:25.459,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and especially people with lung disease.

230
0:13:28.106,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So we've teamed up with the decoder of the human genome, Craig Venter,

231
0:13:33.632,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and the company he founded

232
0:13:35.444,000 --> 0:13:38,000
with Peter Diamandis, the founder of the X Prize,

233
0:13:38.95,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to genetically modify

234
0:13:41.016,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the pig genome

235
0:13:42.711,000 --> 0:13:46,000
so that the pig's organs will not be rejected by the human body

236
0:13:47.216,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and thereby to create an unlimited supply

237
0:13:50.327,000 --> 0:13:52,000
of transplantable organs.

238
0:13:52.742,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We do this through our company, United Therapeutics.

239
0:13:55.714,000 --> 0:13:58,000
CA: So you really believe that within, what, a decade,

240
0:13:58.779,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that this shortage of transplantable lungs maybe be cured, through these guys?

241
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
MR: Absolutely, Chris.

242
0:14:04.839,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I'm as certain of that as I was of the success that we've had

243
0:14:08.531,000 --> 0:14:11,000
with direct television broadcasting, Sirius XM.

244
0:14:11.619,000 --> 0:14:13,000
It's actually not rocket science.

245
0:14:13.825,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It's straightforward engineering away one gene after another.

246
0:14:17.284,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes

247
0:14:21.626,000 --> 0:14:23,000
is a routine activity,

248
0:14:24.285,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and the brilliant folks at Synthetic Genomics

249
0:14:26.723,000 --> 0:14:28,000
are able to zero in on the pig genome,

250
0:14:28.929,000 --> 0:14:31,000
find exactly the genes that are problematic, and fix them.

251
0:14:32.321,000 --> 0:14:35,000
CA: But it's not just bodies that -- though that is amazing.

252
0:14:35.36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Applause)

253
0:14:38.681,000 --> 0:14:42,000
It's not just long-lasting bodies that are of interest to you now.

254
0:14:42.976,000 --> 0:14:44,000
It's long-lasting minds.

255
0:14:45.008,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And I think this graph for you says something quite profound.

256
0:14:50.848,000 --> 0:14:51,000
What does this mean?

257
0:14:52.032,000 --> 0:14:55,000
MR: What this graph means, and it comes from Ray Kurzweil,

258
0:14:55.68,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is that the rate of development in computer processing

259
0:15:00.46,000 --> 0:15:02,000
hardware, firmware and software,

260
0:15:03.293,000 --> 0:15:05,000
has been advancing along a curve

261
0:15:06.288,000 --> 0:15:1,000
such that by the 2020s, as we saw in earlier presentations today,

262
0:15:10.46,000 --> 0:15:13,000
there will be information technology

263
0:15:13.625,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that processes information and the world around us

264
0:15:17.108,000 --> 0:15:19,000
at the same rate as a human mind.

265
0:15:20.333,000 --> 0:15:23,000
CA: And so that being so, you're actually getting ready for this world

266
0:15:24.027,000 --> 0:15:28,000
by believing that we will soon be able to, what,

267
0:15:28.114,000 --> 0:15:34,000
actually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever?

268
0:15:34.457,000 --> 0:15:35,000
How do you describe that?

269
0:15:36.287,000 --> 0:15:4,000
MR: Well, Chris, what we're working on is creating a situation

270
0:15:40.728,000 --> 0:15:42,000
where people can create a mind file,

271
0:15:43.213,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms, personality,

272
0:15:47.221,000 --> 0:15:48,000
recollection, feelings,

273
0:15:49.101,000 --> 0:15:5,000
beliefs, attitudes and values,

274
0:15:50.657,000 --> 0:15:56,000
everything that we've poured today into Google, into Amazon, into Facebook,

275
0:15:56.999,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and all of this information stored there will be able, in the next couple decades,

276
0:16:03.174,000 --> 0:16:07,000
once software is able to recapitulate consciousness,

277
0:16:07.56,000 --> 0:16:11,000
be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file.

278
0:16:12.474,000 --> 0:16:14,000
CA: Now you're not just messing around with this.

279
0:16:15.039,000 --> 0:16:18,000
You're serious. I mean, who is this?

280
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
MR: This is a robot version of my beloved spouse, Bina.

281
0:16:22.549,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And we call her Bina 48.

282
0:16:25.01,000 --> 0:16:28,000
She was programmed by Hanson Robotics out of Texas.

283
0:16:28.609,000 --> 0:16:3,000
There's the centerfold from National Geographic magazine

284
0:16:31.581,000 --> 0:16:33,000
with one of her caregivers,

285
0:16:34.251,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and she roams the web

286
0:16:36.294,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and has hundreds of hours of Bina's mannerisms, personalities.

287
0:16:41.548,000 --> 0:16:43,000
She's kind of like a two-year-old kid,

288
0:16:43.794,000 --> 0:16:46,000
but she says things that blow people away,

289
0:16:46.975,000 --> 0:16:48,000
best expressed by perhaps

290
0:16:49.61,000 --> 0:16:52,000
a New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Amy Harmon

291
0:16:53.418,000 --> 0:16:55,000
who says her answers are often frustrating,

292
0:16:55.996,000 --> 0:17:01,000
but other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she's interviewed.

293
0:17:02.195,000 --> 0:17:06,000
CA: And is your thinking here, part of your hope here, is that

294
0:17:06.593,000 --> 0:17:12,000
this version of Bina can in a sense live on forever, or some future upgrade

295
0:17:13.038,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to this version can live on forever?

296
0:17:15.43,000 --> 0:17:17,000
MR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.

297
0:17:17.836,000 --> 0:17:21,000
You know, it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files

298
0:17:21.853,000 --> 0:17:23,000
on Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.

299
0:17:24.779,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Social media is I think one of the most extraordinary inventions of our time,

300
0:17:28.842,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and as apps become available that will allow us

301
0:17:32.836,000 --> 0:17:35,000
to out-Siri Siri, better and better,

302
0:17:35.924,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and develop consciousness operating systems,

303
0:17:38.571,000 --> 0:17:4,000
everybody in the world, billions of people,

304
0:17:41.473,000 --> 0:17:44,000
will be able to develop mind clones of themselves

305
0:17:45.211,000 --> 0:17:47,000
that will have their own life on the web.

306
0:17:47.765,000 --> 0:17:48,000
CA: So the thing is, Martine,

307
0:17:49.219,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that in any normal conversation, this would sound stark-staring mad,

308
0:17:53.342,000 --> 0:17:56,000
but in the context of your life, what you've done,

309
0:17:56.696,000 --> 0:17:58,000
some of the things we've heard this week,

310
0:17:58.786,000 --> 0:18:,000
the constructed realities that our minds give,

311
0:18:00.982,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I mean, you wouldn't bet against it.

312
0:18:04.776,000 --> 0:18:06,000
MR: Well, I think it's really nothing coming from me.

313
0:18:07.632,000 --> 0:18:13,000
If anything, I'm perhaps a bit of a communicator of activities

314
0:18:14.296,000 --> 0:18:17,000
that are being undertaken by the greatest companies

315
0:18:17.686,000 --> 0:18:2,000
in China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.

316
0:18:21.006,000 --> 0:18:25,000
There are tens of millions of people working on writing code

317
0:18:25.709,000 --> 0:18:28,000
that expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness,

318
0:18:29.424,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and you don't have to be a genius to see that all these threads

319
0:18:34.509,000 --> 0:18:38,000
are going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness,

320
0:18:38.641,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and it's something we'll value.

321
0:18:40.847,000 --> 0:18:42,000
There are so many things to do in this life,

322
0:18:43.285,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and if we could have a simulacrum, a digital doppelgänger of ourselves

323
0:18:47.888,000 --> 0:18:49,000
that helps us process books, do shopping,

324
0:18:50.785,000 --> 0:18:51,000
be our best friends,

325
0:18:52.735,000 --> 0:18:55,000
I believe our mind clones, these digital versions of ourselves,

326
0:18:55.777,000 --> 0:18:57,000
will ultimately be our best friends,

327
0:18:58.378,000 --> 0:19:,000
and for me personally and Bina personally,

328
0:19:00.398,000 --> 0:19:01,000
we love each other like crazy.

329
0:19:02.186,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Each day, we are always saying, like,

330
0:19:03.982,000 --> 0:19:05,000
"Wow, I love you even more than 30 years ago.

331
0:19:06.517,000 --> 0:19:09,000
And so for us, the prospect of mind clones

332
0:19:09.663,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and regenerated bodies

333
0:19:11.707,000 --> 0:19:14,000
is that our love affair, Chris, can go on forever.

334
0:19:14.797,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And we never get bored of each other. I'm sure we never will.

335
0:19:17.999,000 --> 0:19:19,000
CA: I think Bina's here, right? MR: She is, yeah.

336
0:19:20.371,000 --> 0:19:23,000
CA: Would it be too much, I don't know, do we have a handheld mic?

337
0:19:23.554,000 --> 0:19:26,000
Bina, could we invite you to the stage? I just have to ask you one question.

338
0:19:27.246,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Besides, we need to see you.

339
0:19:28.894,000 --> 0:19:3,000
(Applause)

340
0:19:35.442,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

341
0:19:36.998,000 --> 0:19:38,000
Come and join Martine here.

342
0:19:39.691,000 --> 0:19:43,000
I mean, look, when you got married,

343
0:19:44.544,000 --> 0:19:47,000
if someone had told you that, in a few years time,

344
0:19:47.633,000 --> 0:19:49,000
the man you were marrying would become a woman,

345
0:19:49.931,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and a few years after that, you would become a robot --

346
0:19:52.833,000 --> 0:19:55,000
(Laughter) --

347
0:19:55.898,000 --> 0:19:58,000
how has this gone? How has it been?

348
0:19:59.183,000 --> 0:20:01,000
Bina Rothblatt: It's been really an exciting journey,

349
0:20:01.749,000 --> 0:20:03,000
and I would have never thought that at the time,

350
0:20:04.089,000 --> 0:20:07,000
but we started making goals and setting those goals

351
0:20:07.926,000 --> 0:20:08,000
and accomplishing things,

352
0:20:09.197,000 --> 0:20:11,000
and before you knew it, we just keep going up and up

353
0:20:11.664,000 --> 0:20:13,000
and we're still not stopping, so it's great.

354
0:20:14.311,000 --> 0:20:17,000
CA: Martine told me something really beautiful,

355
0:20:17.376,000 --> 0:20:19,000
just actually on Skype before this,

356
0:20:20.135,000 --> 0:20:25,000
which was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years

357
0:20:25.966,000 --> 0:20:27,000
as a mind file,

358
0:20:28.292,000 --> 0:20:31,000
but not if it wasn't with you.

359
0:20:31.424,000 --> 0:20:33,000
BR: That's right, we want to do it together.

360
0:20:33.532,000 --> 0:20:36,000
We're cryonicists as well, and we want to wake up together.

361
0:20:36.785,000 --> 0:20:38,000
CA: So just so as you know, from my point of view,

362
0:20:39.221,000 --> 0:20:42,000
this isn't only one of the most astonishing lives I have heard,

363
0:20:42.936,000 --> 0:20:45,000
it's one of the most astonishing love stories I've ever heard.

364
0:20:45.94,000 --> 0:20:47,000
It's just a delight to have you both here at TED.

365
0:20:48.3,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Thank you so much.

366
0:20:49.646,000 --> 0:20:51,000
MR: Thank you.

367
0:20:51.968,000 --> 0:20:57,000
(Applause)

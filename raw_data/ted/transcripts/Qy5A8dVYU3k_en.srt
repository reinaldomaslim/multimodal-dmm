2
0:00:16.204,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, people want a lot of things out of life,

3
0:00:18.826,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.

4
0:00:22.721,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Aristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end

5
0:00:26.049,000 --> 0:00:29,000
towards which all other things aim.

6
0:00:29.321,000 --> 0:00:34,000
According to this view, the reason we want a big house

7
0:00:34.841,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or a nice car

8
0:00:37.474,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or a good job

9
0:00:39.554,000 --> 0:00:41,000
isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.

10
0:00:42.002,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's that we expect them to bring us

11
0:00:44.52,000 --> 0:00:45,000
happiness.

12
0:00:45.977,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten

13
0:00:48.609,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a lot of the things that we want. We're richer.

14
0:00:50.636,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We live longer. We have access to technology

15
0:00:53.713,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that would have seemed like science fiction

16
0:00:55.88,000 --> 0:00:57,000
just a few years ago.

17
0:00:58.121,000 --> 0:01:,000
The paradox of happiness is that even though the

18
0:01:00.545,000 --> 0:01:02,000
objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically,

19
0:01:03.447,000 --> 0:01:06,000
we haven't actually gotten any happier.

20
0:01:07.011,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress

21
0:01:09.93,000 --> 0:01:11,000
haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness,

22
0:01:12.406,000 --> 0:01:14,000
there's been an increased interest in recent years

23
0:01:14.536,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in happiness itself.

24
0:01:17.058,000 --> 0:01:19,000
People have been debating the causes of happiness

25
0:01:19.093,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years,

26
0:01:21.692,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.

27
0:01:25.149,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Well, as with many other domains in life, I think

28
0:01:27.208,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.

29
0:01:30.42,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion

30
0:01:32.954,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot

31
0:01:35.755,000 --> 0:01:38,000
about its demographics, how things like income

32
0:01:38.867,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and education, gender and marriage relate to it.

33
0:01:42.293,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that

34
0:01:44.515,000 --> 0:01:46,000
factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.

35
0:01:47.454,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less,

36
0:01:49.891,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or to graduate from college instead of dropping out,

37
0:01:52.603,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but the differences in happiness tend to be small.

38
0:01:55.364,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?

39
0:01:59.199,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,

40
0:02:01.896,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but I think something that has the potential to be an answer

41
0:02:04.608,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with

42
0:02:07.329,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.

43
0:02:09.773,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It certainly seems that we're going about our lives,

44
0:02:11.768,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about,

45
0:02:15.703,000 --> 0:02:17,000
have a big influence on our happiness, and yet

46
0:02:18.055,000 --> 0:02:2,000
these are the very factors that have been very difficult,

47
0:02:20.288,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.

48
0:02:22.675,000 --> 0:02:25,000
A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness

49
0:02:25.736,000 --> 0:02:27,000
moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives

50
0:02:28.315,000 --> 0:02:3,000
on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never

51
0:02:31.057,000 --> 0:02:33,000
been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org,

52
0:02:33.848,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.

53
0:02:38.134,000 --> 0:02:4,000
How does this work? Basically, I send people signals

54
0:02:40.923,000 --> 0:02:42,000
at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them

55
0:02:43.363,000 --> 0:02:45,000
a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience

56
0:02:45.651,000 --> 0:02:47,000
at the instant just before the signal.

57
0:02:48.185,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness

58
0:02:50.992,000 --> 0:02:52,000
goes up and down over the course of the day,

59
0:02:53.616,000 --> 0:02:54,000
minute to minute in some cases,

60
0:02:55.344,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and try to understand how what people are doing,

61
0:02:57.486,000 --> 0:02:59,000
who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all

62
0:03:00.329,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the other factors that describe our day, how those might

63
0:03:02.505,000 --> 0:03:04,000
relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able

64
0:03:05.216,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to discover some of the things that really have

65
0:03:06.762,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a big influence on happiness.

66
0:03:09.067,000 --> 0:03:11,000
We've been fortunate with this project to collect

67
0:03:11.373,000 --> 0:03:13,000
quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think

68
0:03:14.231,000 --> 0:03:15,000
has ever been collected before,

69
0:03:16.09,000 --> 0:03:19,000
over 650,000 real-time reports

70
0:03:19.311,000 --> 0:03:21,000
from over 15,000 people.

71
0:03:22.19,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group,

72
0:03:25.299,000 --> 0:03:28,000
people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s,

73
0:03:28.786,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a wide range of incomes, education levels,

74
0:03:31.714,000 --> 0:03:34,000
people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.

75
0:03:34.777,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They collectively represent every one of

76
0:03:37.041,000 --> 0:03:41,000
86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.

77
0:03:41.902,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today

78
0:03:44.804,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been

79
0:03:46.933,000 --> 0:03:49,000
investigating, and that's mind-wandering.

80
0:03:50.116,000 --> 0:03:52,000
As human beings, we have this unique ability

81
0:03:52.516,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to have our minds stray away from the present.

82
0:03:55.451,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This guy is sitting here working on his computer,

83
0:03:57.376,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and yet he could be thinking about

84
0:03:58.43,000 --> 0:04:,000
the vacation he had last month,

85
0:04:01.119,000 --> 0:04:02,000
wondering what he's going to have for dinner.

86
0:04:03.082,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Maybe he's worried that he's going bald. (Laughter)

87
0:04:06.915,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This ability to focus our attention on something other

88
0:04:09.7,000 --> 0:04:12,000
than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn

89
0:04:12.955,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.

90
0:04:17.449,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And yet it's not clear what the relationship is

91
0:04:19.847,000 --> 0:04:22,000
between our use of this ability and our happiness.

92
0:04:23.763,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You've probably heard people suggest that you should

93
0:04:25.621,000 --> 0:04:27,000
stay focused on the present. "Be here now,"

94
0:04:28.112,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you've probably heard a hundred times.

95
0:04:29.597,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely

96
0:04:32.278,000 --> 0:04:35,000
immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.

97
0:04:35.789,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering

98
0:04:37.623,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is a bad thing.

99
0:04:39.353,000 --> 0:04:41,000
On the other hand, when our minds wander,

100
0:04:41.772,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality

101
0:04:44.433,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.

102
0:04:47.821,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Since we know people want to be happy, maybe

103
0:04:49.634,000 --> 0:04:51,000
when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place

104
0:04:52.325,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.

105
0:04:54.558,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind

106
0:04:56.056,000 --> 0:05:,000
allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.

107
0:05:00.482,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to

108
0:05:02.493,000 --> 0:05:04,000
resolve this debate with some data, and in particular

109
0:05:05.17,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I'd like to present some data to you from three questions

110
0:05:07.658,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from

111
0:05:09.868,000 --> 0:05:11,000
sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.

112
0:05:12.52,000 --> 0:05:15,000
There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:

113
0:05:15.55,000 --> 0:05:17,000
How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad

114
0:05:18.425,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to very good? Second, an activity question:

115
0:05:22.564,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities

116
0:05:25.092,000 --> 0:05:28,000
including things like eating and working and watching TV?

117
0:05:28.317,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And finally a mind-wandering question:

118
0:05:31.905,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Are you thinking about something other

119
0:05:34.547,000 --> 0:05:36,000
than what you're currently doing?

120
0:05:37.17,000 --> 0:05:4,000
People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task --

121
0:05:40.612,000 --> 0:05:42,000
or yes -- I am thinking about something else --

122
0:05:43.141,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,

123
0:05:45.597,000 --> 0:05:46,000
neutral or unpleasant.

124
0:05:47.023,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.

125
0:05:52.482,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So what did we find?

126
0:05:54.947,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,

127
0:05:57.246,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and you can see that bar there representing how happy

128
0:05:59.486,000 --> 0:06:,000
people are when they're focused on the present,

129
0:06:00.819,000 --> 0:06:01,000
when they're not mind-wandering.

130
0:06:02.742,000 --> 0:06:05,000
As it turns out, people are substantially less happy

131
0:06:06.461,000 --> 0:06:1,000
when their minds are wandering than when they're not.

132
0:06:11.197,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure,

133
0:06:13.799,000 --> 0:06:15,000
on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,

134
0:06:16.221,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but surely when their minds are straying away

135
0:06:17.889,000 --> 0:06:19,000
from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,

136
0:06:20.008,000 --> 0:06:23,000
at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.

137
0:06:23.772,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Nope. As it turns out,

138
0:06:26.471,000 --> 0:06:27,000
people are less happy when they're mind-wandering

139
0:06:28.163,000 --> 0:06:31,000
no matter what they're doing. For example,

140
0:06:31.189,000 --> 0:06:33,000
people don't really like commuting to work very much.

141
0:06:33.366,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet

142
0:06:36.126,000 --> 0:06:38,000
they are substantially happier when they're focused

143
0:06:38.66,000 --> 0:06:4,000
only on their commute than when their mind is going

144
0:06:41.022,000 --> 0:06:44,000
off to something else.

145
0:06:44.069,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's amazing.

146
0:06:45.851,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,

147
0:06:49.696,000 --> 0:06:51,000
a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,

148
0:06:52.094,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we often think about unpleasant things, and they are

149
0:06:54.95,000 --> 0:06:57,000
enormously less happy when they do that,

150
0:06:58.557,000 --> 0:07:,000
our worries, our anxieties, our regrets,

151
0:07:01.222,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and yet even when people are thinking about something

152
0:07:04.182,000 --> 0:07:06,000
neutral, they're still considerably less happy

153
0:07:07.046,000 --> 0:07:08,000
than when they're not mind-wandering at all.

154
0:07:09.023,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,

155
0:07:11.858,000 --> 0:07:13,000
they're actually just slightly less happy

156
0:07:14.062,000 --> 0:07:17,000
than when they aren't mind-wandering.

157
0:07:17.319,000 --> 0:07:19,000
If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like

158
0:07:19.381,000 --> 0:07:22,000
having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars

159
0:07:22.414,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter)

160
0:07:28.565,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,

161
0:07:31.238,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all

162
0:07:34.05,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.

163
0:07:36.817,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case

164
0:07:39.602,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.

165
0:07:42.056,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever

166
0:07:44.425,000 --> 0:07:47,000
disentangle these two possibilites?

167
0:07:47.514,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact

168
0:07:49.858,000 --> 0:07:51,000
you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not

169
0:07:52.815,000 --> 0:07:55,000
backward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.

170
0:07:56.812,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,

171
0:08:00.242,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering

172
0:08:03.438,000 --> 0:08:05,000
tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness

173
0:08:05.931,000 --> 0:08:07,000
tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight

174
0:08:08.114,000 --> 0:08:1,000
into the causal direction.

175
0:08:10.275,000 --> 0:08:13,000
As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between

176
0:08:13.484,000 --> 0:08:16,000
mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,

177
0:08:17.169,000 --> 0:08:2,000
consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.

178
0:08:20.888,000 --> 0:08:23,000
In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy

179
0:08:24.048,000 --> 0:08:27,000
now and mind-wandering a short time later.

180
0:08:27.057,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be

181
0:08:29.379,000 --> 0:08:34,000
an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.

182
0:08:35.219,000 --> 0:08:37,000
A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering

183
0:08:37.443,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to a slot machine you'd never want to play.

184
0:08:39.706,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Well, how often do people's minds wander?

185
0:08:42.01,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Turns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.

186
0:08:46.467,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking

187
0:08:49.161,000 --> 0:08:52,000
about something other than what they're currently doing.

188
0:08:52.568,000 --> 0:08:54,000
How does that depend on what people are doing?

189
0:08:55.006,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities

190
0:08:57.759,000 --> 0:09:,000
ranging from a high of 65 percent — (Laughter) —

191
0:09:01.758,000 --> 0:09:03,000
when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth,

192
0:09:04.27,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to 50 percent when they're working,

193
0:09:07.171,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to 40 percent when they're exercising,

194
0:09:10.214,000 --> 0:09:11,000
all the way down to this one short bar on the right

195
0:09:12.133,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that I think some of you are probably laughing at.

196
0:09:14.121,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering

197
0:09:16.511,000 --> 0:09:2,000
when they're having sex. (Laughter)

198
0:09:21.082,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,

199
0:09:24.015,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and that is, basically with one exception,

200
0:09:27.063,000 --> 0:09:29,000
no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering

201
0:09:29.241,000 --> 0:09:32,000
at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,

202
0:09:32.919,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.

203
0:09:35.75,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It pervades basically everything that we do.

204
0:09:39.483,000 --> 0:09:42,000
In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,

205
0:09:42.679,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important

206
0:09:44.729,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in the equation for happiness.

207
0:09:46.385,000 --> 0:09:48,000
My hope is that over time, by tracking people's

208
0:09:48.4,000 --> 0:09:51,000
moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences

209
0:09:51.448,000 --> 0:09:54,000
in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,

210
0:09:54.85,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness

211
0:09:57.78,000 --> 0:09:59,000
will help us create a future that's not only richer

212
0:10:00.477,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and healthier, but happier as well.

213
0:10:03.339,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Thank you. (Applause)

214
0:10:06.563,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.404,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine

2
0:00:16.936,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and, just like getting over a cold,

3
0:00:18.69,000 --> 0:00:2,000
you could heal your wounds faster?

4
0:00:20.809,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Today, if we have an operation or an accident,

5
0:00:24.355,000 --> 0:00:25,000
we're in the hospital for weeks,

6
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and often left with scars and painful side effects

7
0:00:28.65,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of our inability to regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs.

8
0:00:34.436,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I work to create materials

9
0:00:36.486,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that instruct our immune system to give us the signals to grow new tissues.

10
0:00:41.497,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Just like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease,

11
0:00:44.595,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we could instead instruct our immune system

12
0:00:47.347,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds.

13
0:00:50.886,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic,

14
0:00:54.688,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but there are several organisms that can achieve this feat.

15
0:00:57.903,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Some lizards can regrow their tails,

16
0:01:00.37,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm,

17
0:01:04.339,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and even us mere humans can regrow our liver

18
0:01:07.252,000 --> 0:01:09,000
after losing more than half of its original mass.

19
0:01:10.615,000 --> 0:01:12,000
To make this magic a bit closer to reality,

20
0:01:13.274,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm investigating how our body can heal wounds and build tissue

21
0:01:17.393,000 --> 0:01:19,000
through instructions from the immune system.

22
0:01:20.387,000 --> 0:01:23,000
From a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection,

23
0:01:23.936,000 --> 0:01:25,000
our immune system defends our body from danger.

24
0:01:27.199,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm an immunologist,

25
0:01:28.684,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and by using what I know about our body's defense system,

26
0:01:31.738,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was able to identify key players

27
0:01:33.938,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises.

28
0:01:37.436,000 --> 0:01:39,000
When looking at materials that are currently being tested

29
0:01:40.129,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for their abilities to help regrow muscle,

30
0:01:42.351,000 --> 0:01:46,000
our team noticed that after treating an injured muscle with these materials,

31
0:01:46.534,000 --> 0:01:48,000
there was a large number of immune cells

32
0:01:48.881,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in that material and the surrounding muscle.

33
0:01:52.01,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So in this case,

34
0:01:53.192,000 --> 0:01:57,000
instead of the immune cells rushing off towards infection to fight bacteria,

35
0:01:57.43,000 --> 0:01:59,000
they're rushing toward an injury.

36
0:01:59.922,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I discovered a specific type of immune cell,

37
0:02:02.779,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the helper T cell,

38
0:02:04.097,000 --> 0:02:06,000
was present inside that material that I implanted

39
0:02:06.85,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and absolutely critical for wound healing.

40
0:02:10.325,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, just like when you were a kid and you'd break your pencil

41
0:02:13.791,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and try and tape it back together again,

42
0:02:16.353,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we can heal,

43
0:02:17.531,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but it might not be in the most functional way,

44
0:02:19.8,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and we'll get a scar.

45
0:02:21.515,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So if we don't have these helper T cells,

46
0:02:24.523,000 --> 0:02:25,000
instead of healthy muscle,

47
0:02:26.134,000 --> 0:02:28,000
our muscle develops fat cells inside of it,

48
0:02:28.769,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and if there's fat in our muscle, it isn't as strong.

49
0:02:32.033,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now, using our immune system,

50
0:02:34.457,000 --> 0:02:36,000
our body could grow back without these scars

51
0:02:36.978,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and look like what it was before we were even injured.

52
0:02:41.128,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I'm working to create materials

53
0:02:43.712,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that give us the signals to build new tissue

54
0:02:46.015,000 --> 0:02:47,000
by changing the immune response.

55
0:02:48.84,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We know that any time a material is implanted in our body,

56
0:02:53.079,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the immune system will respond to it.

57
0:02:55.158,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps

58
0:02:59.691,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to the materials that engineers are using to try and build new tissue.

59
0:03:03.932,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So when I place that material, or scaffold, in the body,

60
0:03:08.021,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the immune system creates a small environment of cells and proteins

61
0:03:12.45,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that can change the way that our stem cells behave.

62
0:03:15.817,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, just like the weather affects our daily activities,

63
0:03:19.739,000 --> 0:03:2,000
like going for a run

64
0:03:21.088,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or staying inside and binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix,

65
0:03:25.597,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the immune environment of a scaffold

66
0:03:27.589,000 --> 0:03:29,000
affects the way that our stem cells grow and develop.

67
0:03:30.883,000 --> 0:03:32,000
If we have the wrong signals,

68
0:03:32.923,000 --> 0:03:33,000
say the Netflix signals,

69
0:03:34.622,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we get fat cells instead of muscle.

70
0:03:38.79,000 --> 0:03:41,000
These scaffolds are made of a variety of different things,

71
0:03:41.941,000 --> 0:03:44,000
from plastics to naturally derived materials,

72
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
nanofibers of varying thicknesses,

73
0:03:48.105,000 --> 0:03:5,000
sponges that are more or less porous,

74
0:03:50.542,000 --> 0:03:52,000
gels of different stiffnesses.

75
0:03:52.685,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And researchers can even make the materials

76
0:03:54.819,000 --> 0:03:56,000
release different signals over time.

77
0:03:57.473,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So in other words, we can orchestrate this Broadway show of cells

78
0:04:02.743,000 --> 0:04:05,000
by giving them the correct stage, cues and props

79
0:04:06.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that can be changed for different tissues,

80
0:04:08.87,000 --> 0:04:1,000
just like a producer would change the set

81
0:04:11.09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
for "Les Mis" versus "Little Shop of Horrors."

82
0:04:14.398,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I'm combining specific types of signals

83
0:04:17.106,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that mimic how our body responds to injury to help us regenerate.

84
0:04:22.283,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In the future, we could see a scar-proof band-aid,

85
0:04:25.835,000 --> 0:04:28,000
a moldable muscle filler or even a wound-healing vaccine.

86
0:04:29.837,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow and be able to heal like Wolverine.

87
0:04:33.438,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Probably not next Tuesday, either.

88
0:04:35.328,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But with these advances,

89
0:04:36.536,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal wounds,

90
0:04:40.765,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we could begin seeing products on the market

91
0:04:43.018,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that work with our body's defense system to help us regenerate,

92
0:04:46.908,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and maybe one day be able to keep pace with a salamander.

93
0:04:51.876,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Thank you.

94
0:04:53.051,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Applause)

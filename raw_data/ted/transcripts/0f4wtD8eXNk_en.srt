0:00:14.858,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Music: "Wade in the Water" by Ella Jenkins)

2
0:00:17.095,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Wade in the water

3
0:00:20.603,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Wade in the water, children

4
0:00:24.181,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Wade in the water

5
0:00:27.657,000 --> 0:00:29,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

6
0:00:30.294,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Oh, why don't you wade in the water

7
0:00:34.712,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Wade in the water, children

8
0:00:38.207,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Wade in the water

9
0:00:41.728,000 --> 0:00:43,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

10
0:00:45.394,000 --> 0:00:48,000
See that man all dressed in white

11
0:00:48.721,000 --> 0:00:51,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

12
0:00:51.824,000 --> 0:00:54,000
He looks like a man of the Israelite

13
0:00:55.807,000 --> 0:00:58,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

14
0:00:59.116,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Wade in the water

15
0:01:02.822,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Wade in the water, children

16
0:01:06.335,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Wade in the water

17
0:01:09.87,000 --> 0:01:11,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

18
0:01:13.62,000 --> 0:01:16,000
See that man all dressed in red

19
0:01:17.012,000 --> 0:01:19,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

20
0:01:20.007,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It looks like the man that Moses led

21
0:01:23.974,000 --> 0:01:25,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

22
0:01:27.434,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Wade in the water

23
0:01:30.927,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Wade in the water, children

24
0:01:34.213,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Wade in the water

25
0:01:37.947,000 --> 0:01:4,000
God's a-gonna trouble the water

26
0:01:41.01,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

27
0:01:44.982,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Daniel, Daniel

28
0:01:47.903,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

29
0:01:51.939,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Then why not every man?

30
0:01:55.201,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

31
0:01:59.146,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Daniel, Daniel

32
0:02:02.202,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

33
0:02:06.162,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Why not every man?

34
0:02:09.665,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Man went down to the river

35
0:02:13.149,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Man went down to the river

36
0:02:16.696,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Man went down to the river

37
0:02:20.157,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Went down there for to pray

38
0:02:23.705,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Man went down to the river

39
0:02:27.237,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Man went down to the river

40
0:02:30.781,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Man went down to the river

41
0:02:34.152,000 --> 0:02:36,000
To wash his sins away

42
0:02:37.723,000 --> 0:02:4,000
He washed all day, he washed all night

43
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
He washed till his hands were sore

44
0:02:44.506,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He washed all day, he washed all night

45
0:02:48.226,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Till he couldn't wash a-no more

46
0:02:52.194,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Man went down to the river

47
0:02:55.75,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Man went down to the river

48
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Man went down to the river

49
0:03:01.934,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Music fades)

50
0:03:05.546,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Applause)

51
0:03:19.188,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Juliet Blake) And now, let's give a warm welcome

52
0:03:21.692,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to the artistic director emerita of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater,

53
0:03:27.592,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Judith Jamison.

54
0:03:29.362,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Applause)

55
0:03:36.108,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Judith Jamison: Thanks.

56
0:03:38.225,000 --> 0:03:39,000
How are y'all?

57
0:03:39.757,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Audience cheers)

58
0:03:40.987,000 --> 0:03:42,000
JJ: Yeah, you know you've just been to church?

59
0:03:43.17,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:44.195,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You just saw a baptism, yes?

61
0:03:47.855,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This is from this wonderful piece Mr. Ailey created in 1960,

62
0:03:52.283,000 --> 0:03:54,000
called "Revelations."

63
0:03:55.292,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Mr. Ailey was 29 years old when he choreographed this masterpiece.

64
0:03:59.093,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's been danced all over the world and understood universally,

65
0:04:03.022,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because he understood the humanity in us all.

66
0:04:07.085,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Revelations" is a reflection of a journey we all take in life,

67
0:04:11.204,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and, hopefully, triumphantly.

68
0:04:14.291,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That was the magic of Alvin Ailey.

69
0:04:16.823,000 --> 0:04:18,000
He was able to see you, in the audience,

70
0:04:19.689,000 --> 0:04:2,000
see me, as the dancer,

71
0:04:21.454,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and see the connection between us,

72
0:04:23.458,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and choreographed works that connected us all.

73
0:04:26.472,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So you felt he was telling your story,

74
0:04:29.639,000 --> 0:04:32,000
while I felt I was dancing mine.

75
0:04:34.163,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I started dancing when I was six years old

76
0:04:36.38,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in Philadelphia.

77
0:04:37.585,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I was skinny ...

78
0:04:40.196,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:43.172,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Dark chocolate,

80
0:04:45.458,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and a kid with legs up to my armpits.

81
0:04:48.546,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And the very first performance I had, at the Judimar School of Dance,

82
0:04:52.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
was in a red checkered shirt,

83
0:04:57.133,000 --> 0:05:,000
dungarees, pink ballet shoes,

84
0:05:00.49,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and we were dancing to "I'm an Old Cowhand from the Rio Grande."

85
0:05:06.18,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I loved every minute of it.

86
0:05:08.014,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I mean, I literally did love every minute of it,

87
0:05:10.848,000 --> 0:05:12,000
especially when I heard the applause,

88
0:05:13.03,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and I knew right there, when I was six, I said,

89
0:05:15.978,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"That's for me."

90
0:05:17.168,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:18.704,000 --> 0:05:19,000
At six, you're not thinking

92
0:05:20.031,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that's going to be a career of your lifetime,

93
0:05:22.166,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but that was perfect for that moment.

94
0:05:24.482,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I danced my way through school, and through college,

95
0:05:27.609,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it still didn't dawn on me that that's what I actually wanted to do.

96
0:05:31.03,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I went to an audition,

97
0:05:32.665,000 --> 0:05:33,000
which I was dreadful in --

98
0:05:34.403,000 --> 0:05:37,000
it's the only audition I've had in my life --

99
0:05:37.442,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and when I was let go from that audition --

100
0:05:39.522,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because I thought when they were saying, "Thank you very much,"

101
0:05:42.538,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that meant for me to stay.

102
0:05:43.824,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:46.728,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I ran up the steps,

104
0:05:48.339,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and there was a man sitting on the steps.

105
0:05:51.688,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I barely noticed him.

106
0:05:53.768,000 --> 0:05:54,000
He was an observer.

107
0:05:55.061,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Three days later, that man called me

108
0:05:57.046,000 --> 0:06:,000
and asked me, would I like to join the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

109
0:06:00.712,000 --> 0:06:02,000
That's how it happened, folks, that's it.

110
0:06:03.474,000 --> 0:06:04,000
There's no drama or trauma.

111
0:06:05.454,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

112
0:06:07.744,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So I spent 15 years dancing with the company,

113
0:06:10.482,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and then I directed it for something like 21 years.

114
0:06:14.339,000 --> 0:06:16,000
If you were black and African American and a dancer,

115
0:06:17.053,000 --> 0:06:19,000
any time between the '40s and the '70s,

116
0:06:19.403,000 --> 0:06:2,000
you had much to say,

117
0:06:20.799,000 --> 0:06:23,000
because your complete voice was not being heard.

118
0:06:24.331,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And you were not being represented as you truly were.

119
0:06:28.228,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Alvin Ailey had the courage,

120
0:06:30.617,000 --> 0:06:33,000
right in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement,

121
0:06:34.03,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to present the truth about who we were --

122
0:06:36.841,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that our creativity, our beauty,

123
0:06:39.174,000 --> 0:06:41,000
our intelligence, our talents

124
0:06:41.349,000 --> 0:06:45,000
were an intrinsic part of the panoply of American culture.

125
0:06:46.126,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Our mantra has always been to educate, to entertain,

126
0:06:53.011,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and to lift our audiences.

127
0:06:54.725,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Mr. Ailey believed that dance came from the people

128
0:06:58.974,000 --> 0:07:,000
and needed to be delivered back to the people.

129
0:07:01.696,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We didn't dance in a vacuum.

130
0:07:03.76,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It was our mission to serve people.

131
0:07:06.53,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We call it outreach now,

132
0:07:08.564,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but it's always been a part of who we were and still are,

133
0:07:13.07,000 --> 0:07:16,000
60 years later, to this day.

134
0:07:16.141,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Being inclusive of our audiences --

135
0:07:19.839,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's always been an important part of the company.

136
0:07:23.434,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We ask ourselves, who are we dancing for?

137
0:07:26.133,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Why are we dancing, if not to show people what it is to be human

138
0:07:31.308,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and to connect with the audiences that we dance for.

139
0:07:37.308,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We've always felt responsible to make sure the community understood

140
0:07:40.674,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that what we do is a part of their heritage.

141
0:07:43.91,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We just don't do this, also, in America,

142
0:07:45.855,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we do it all over the world.

143
0:07:47.228,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We tour more than any other dance company in the world.

144
0:07:51.855,000 --> 0:07:54,000
After Nelson Mandela was released from prison,

145
0:07:55.355,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I thought, well, this is the time to go to South Africa.

146
0:07:59.3,000 --> 0:08:,000
And that was some outreach.

147
0:08:01.593,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We went to Johannesburg, Soweto,

148
0:08:04.911,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and some other townships that were really in dire straits.

149
0:08:08.784,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And it dawned on me, as we were there, I'm going like,

150
0:08:11.364,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Here we are in the seat of Mother Africa,

151
0:08:14.204,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and we're trying to teach these people how to dance?"

152
0:08:16.72,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

153
0:08:17.745,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But it was our African Americanness that they were interested in,

154
0:08:21.569,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the culture that we had developed over the last 400 years.

155
0:08:26.641,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We toured all over the world many times,

156
0:08:29.3,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and whether we're in Europe or South America or Asia

157
0:08:31.983,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or somewhere else,

158
0:08:33.188,000 --> 0:08:35,000
audiences are thrilled and excited.

159
0:08:35.815,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You sounded thrilled and excited.

160
0:08:38.99,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Sometimes with tears in their eyes,

161
0:08:41.085,000 --> 0:08:45,000
because this nonverbal communication really works.

162
0:08:46.251,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And it's about embracing everyone.

163
0:08:50.554,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Alvin didn't need to explain to us

164
0:08:53.666,000 --> 0:08:56,000
what was going on at the time in the '60s and the '70s;

165
0:08:56.808,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it was obvious why were doing his work.

166
0:09:00.856,000 --> 0:09:02,000
He knew what the truth of the time was about,

167
0:09:03.746,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and he was unafraid to reveal it through dance.

168
0:09:08.079,000 --> 0:09:12,000
He tapped into every emotion he had and we had,

169
0:09:12.125,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and from angerness to happiness,

170
0:09:15.212,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to grief and everything in between,

171
0:09:17.807,000 --> 0:09:18,000
he knew us.

172
0:09:19.715,000 --> 0:09:21,000
He took our history and turned it into powerful dance.

173
0:09:22.715,000 --> 0:09:25,000
He and I overlapped generationally.

174
0:09:26.509,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We didn't have to talk about things so much,

175
0:09:28.982,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because we understood implicitly our shared responsibilities.

176
0:09:33.482,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So when he asked me to take over the company

177
0:09:35.577,000 --> 0:09:37,000
before he passed in 1989,

178
0:09:38.08,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I felt prepared to carry it forward.

179
0:09:41.295,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Alvin and I were like parts of the same tree.

180
0:09:44.437,000 --> 0:09:46,000
He, the roots and the trunk,

181
0:09:47.712,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and we were the branches.

182
0:09:49.474,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I was his muse.

183
0:09:51.609,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We were all his muses.

184
0:09:57.081,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The ballet "Cry,"

185
0:09:59.62,000 --> 0:10:02,000
which some of you might have seen --

186
0:10:02.914,000 --> 0:10:03,000
you're going to see an excerpt of it --

187
0:10:04.906,000 --> 0:10:05,000
it was made on me,

188
0:10:06.22,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and Alvin dedicated it to all black women,

189
0:10:08.665,000 --> 0:10:09,000
especially our mothers.

190
0:10:11.276,000 --> 0:10:12,000
When Alvin and I went in the studio,

191
0:10:13.281,000 --> 0:10:14,000
of course he wasn't thinking,

192
0:10:14.704,000 --> 0:10:15,000
"Here I am, creating an iconic work."

193
0:10:16.601,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Do you know any artist that does that?

194
0:10:18.974,000 --> 0:10:2,000
You don't go into the studio

195
0:10:21.948,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to create anything

196
0:10:24.459,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but what's coming truthfully from your heart and your spirit.

197
0:10:28.331,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And you trust that you have a dancer you can share that with.

198
0:10:32.093,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Rehearsal space is a sacred space,

199
0:10:35.141,000 --> 0:10:36,000
not to be intruded upon,

200
0:10:36.68,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because it's about talking to each other through spirit.

201
0:10:40.601,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You better have some technique on top of that

202
0:10:42.736,000 --> 0:10:43,000
so you can do the dance.

203
0:10:44.037,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

204
0:10:45.101,000 --> 0:10:48,000
He brought his Alvin to "Cry" and I brought my Judy to it.

205
0:10:49.323,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I just did the steps.

206
0:10:51.18,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And this was a birthday present for his mother,

207
0:10:53.895,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because he couldn't afford to get her a tactile gift.

208
0:10:57.085,000 --> 0:10:58,000
When I performed it the first time,

209
0:10:58.786,000 --> 0:11:,000
it was physically and emotionally draining.

210
0:11:00.847,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I hadn't yet run through the whole piece from beginning to end.

211
0:11:05.085,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The ballet is 16 minutes long.

212
0:11:09.518,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's about a proud woman who has been to hell and back,

213
0:11:13.835,000 --> 0:11:15,000
from her journey across the Atlantic.

214
0:11:17.509,000 --> 0:11:19,000
She's exhausted,

215
0:11:19.538,000 --> 0:11:2,000
she's a queen,

216
0:11:20.839,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and in this section, you're going to see she is triumphant.

217
0:11:24.942,000 --> 0:11:25,000
She made it,

218
0:11:26.458,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and she is, in that last step that she does,

219
0:11:31.768,000 --> 0:11:34,000
beating away anything negative

220
0:11:35.252,000 --> 0:11:37,000
with her tremendous strength.

221
0:11:38.688,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And in the last step, she digs into the earth

222
0:11:44.482,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and she reaches into the sky ...

223
0:11:48.763,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because she's clearing space for the next journey.

224
0:11:54.419,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I performed it in 1971,

225
0:11:57.61,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and we are still clearing space.

226
0:12:02.808,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now let me leave you with one last thought.

227
0:12:04.871,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Here we are, in the 21st century,

228
0:12:06.855,000 --> 0:12:09,000
still fighting for civil rights.

229
0:12:10.284,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Not a day goes by

230
0:12:12.085,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that we are not made aware of the struggle that continues.

231
0:12:16.95,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I believe that dance can elevate our human experience

232
0:12:23.521,000 --> 0:12:24,000
beyond words.

233
0:12:25.442,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And when you're sitting in the dark,

234
0:12:28.688,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in the theater,

235
0:12:30.734,000 --> 0:12:33,000
having a personal experience,

236
0:12:34.625,000 --> 0:12:37,000
you don't feel blocked or misunderstood.

237
0:12:39.157,000 --> 0:12:4,000
You feel open,

238
0:12:42.125,000 --> 0:12:43,000
alive,

239
0:12:44.03,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and, we hope,

240
0:12:46.419,000 --> 0:12:47,000
inspired.

241
0:12:48.323,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thank you.

242
0:12:50.028,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

243

(Music: "Right on. Be free." by East Harlem)

244
0:13:11.994,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I wanna go where the north wind blows

245
0:13:19.314,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I wanna know what the falcon knows

246
0:13:27.615,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I wanna go where the wild goose goes

247
0:13:34.972,000 --> 0:13:39,000
High flyin' bird, high flyin' bird, fly on

248
0:13:48.871,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I want the clouds over my head

249
0:13:55.682,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I don't want no store bought bed

250
0:14:03.914,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I'm gonna live until I'm dead

251
0:14:11.714,000 --> 0:14:16,000

Ain't no time to be afraid

Mother save your child

268
0:15:35.721,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I wanna see a rainbow in the sky

269
0:15:42.491,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I wanna watch the clouds go by

270
0:15:50.822,000 --> 0:15:54,000
It might make my load a little light

271
0:15:58.458,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Lord, Lord, Lord Where will I be tomorrow night?

272

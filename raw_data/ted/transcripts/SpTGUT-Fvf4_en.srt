1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to talk

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about some of my discoveries

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
around the world through my work.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
These are not discoveries of planets

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or new technologies

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or science.

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They're discoveries of people

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and the way people are, and new leadership.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is Benki.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
His people live in Brazil

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and in Peru.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Benki comes from a village

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so remote up in the Amazon

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that to get there, either you have to fly

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and land on water,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or go by canoe for several days.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
when I'd brought him and other leaders

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
from indigenous peoples

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to meet with me and leaders from around the world,

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because we wanted to learn from each other.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We wanted to share our stories with each other.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The Ashaninka people

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
are known throughout South America

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for their dignity, their spirit

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and their resistance,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
starting with the Incas

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and continuing through the 19th century

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with the rubber tappers.

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and to Benki

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
comes from illegal logging --

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the people who come into the beautiful forest

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and cut down ancient mahogany trees,

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
float them down the river to world markets.

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Benki knew this.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment,

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because he was taken under his grandfather's wing

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when he was only two years old

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to begin to learn about the forest

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and the way of life of his people.

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
His grandfather died when he was only 10.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And at that young age, 10 years old,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Benki became the paje of his community.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture,

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the paje is the most important

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
person in the community.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is the person who contains within him

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
all the knowledge, all the wisdom

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of centuries and centuries of life,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and not just about his people,

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but about everything that his people's survival depended on:

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the trees, the birds,

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the water, the soil, the forest.

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So when he was only 10 and he became the paje,

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
he began to lead his people.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
He began to talk to them

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
about the forest that they needed to protect,

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the way of life they needed to nurture.

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He explained to them

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that it was not a question of survival of the fittest;

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it was a question of understanding

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
what they needed to survive

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and to protect that.

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Eight years later,

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
when he was a young man of 18,

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Benki left the forest for the first time.

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to the Earth Summit

71
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to tell the world what was happening

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in his tiny, little corner.

73
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Some did, not everybody.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But if you can imagine this young man

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with his headdress and his flowing robe,

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
learning a new language, Portuguese,

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
not to mention English,

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
going to Rio,

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
building a bridge

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to reach out to people he'd never met before --

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a pretty hostile world.

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But he wasn't dismayed.

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Benki came back to his village full of ideas --

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
new technologies, new research,

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
new ways of understanding what was going on.

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Since that time,

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
he's continued to work with his people,

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and not only the Ashaninka Nation,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He's built schools

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
to teach children to care for the forest.

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Together, he's led the reforestation

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
of over 25 percent of the land

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that had been destroyed by the loggers.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He's created a cooperative

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to help people diversify their livelihoods.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And he's brought the internet and satellite technology

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to the forest --

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
both so that people themselves

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
could monitor the deforestation,

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but also that he could speak from the forest

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to the rest of the world.

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you were to meet Benki

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and ask him, "Why are you doing this?

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Why are you putting yourself at risk?

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Why are you making yourself vulnerable

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to what is often a hostile world?"

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
he would tell you,

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
as he told me,

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"I asked myself," he said,

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to protect the forest for me?

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And what am I doing?"

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So when I think of that,

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I wonder what our grandchildren

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and our great-grandchildren,

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
when they ask themselves that question,

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I wonder how they will answer.

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
For me, the world is veering

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
towards a future we don't much want

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when we really think about it deep inside.

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's a future we don't know the details of,

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but it's a future that has signs,

125
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
just like Benki saw the signs around him.

126
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We know we are running out of what we need.

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We're running out of fresh water.

128
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We're running out of fossil fuels.

129
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We're running out of land.

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We know climate change is going to affect all of us.

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We don't know how, but we know it will.

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And we know that there will be more of us than ever before --

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
five times as many people in 40 years

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
than 60 years ago.

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We are running out of what we need.

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And we also know

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that the world has changed in other ways,

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that since 1960

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
there are one-third as many new countries

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
that exist as independent entities on the planet.

141
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Egos, systems of government --

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
figuring it out --

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
massive change.

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And in addition to that,

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we know that five other really big countries

146
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
are going to have a say in the future,

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a say we haven't even really started to hear yet --

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
China, India,

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Russia, South Africa

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and Benki's own Brazil,

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
where Benki got his civil rights

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
only in the 1988 constitution.

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But you know all that.

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and went 3,000 miles.

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
You also know

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that we can't just keep doing what we've always done,

158
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because we'll get the results

159
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
we've always gotten.

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And this reminds me of something I understand

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,

162
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
when she was pressing him, "Please change."

163
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
He said, "Change?

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Why change?

165
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Things are bad enough as they are."

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We have to change.

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's imperative to me, when I look around the world,

168
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that we need to change ourselves.

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We need new models of what it means to be a leader.

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We need new models

171
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
of being a leader and a human in the world.

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I started life as a banker.

173
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Now I don't admit to that

174
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to anybody but my very close friends.

175
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But for the past eight years,

176
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I've done something completely different.

177
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
My work has taken me around the world,

178
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where I've had the real privilege

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of meeting people like Benki

180
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and many others who are making change happen

181
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in their communities --

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
people who see the world differently,

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
who are asking different questions,

184
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
who have different answers,

185
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
who understand the filters that they wear

186
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
when they go out into the world.

187
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
This is Sanghamitra.

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I met Sanghamitra eight years ago

190
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
when I was in Bangalore

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's

192
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
working in some of the hardest aspects of society.

193
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Sanghamitra didn't start life

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
as a leader of an NGO,

195
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
she started her career as university professor,

196
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
teaching English literature.

197
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.

198
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
She loved it, but she was too detached.

199
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And so in 1993,

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
a long time ago,

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
she decided to start a new organization

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
called Samraksha

203
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
focused on one of the hardest areas,

204
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
one of the hardest issues in India --

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
anywhere in the world at the time --

206
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
HIV/AIDS.

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Since that time, Samraksha has grown

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from strength to strength

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.

210
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But if you just think about the state of the world

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and knowledge of HIV/AIDS

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in 1993 --

213
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in India at that time it was skyrocketing

214
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and nobody understood why,

215
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and everyone was actually very, very afraid.

216
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Today there are still three million

217
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
HIV-positive people in India.

218
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
That's the second largest population in the world.

219
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
When I asked Sanghamitra,

220
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"How did you get from English literature

221
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to HIV/AIDS?"

222
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
not an obvious path,

223
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
she said to me,

224
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"It's all connected.

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Literature makes one sensitive,

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
sensitive to people,

227
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to their dreams and to their ideas."

228
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Since that time, under her leadership,

229
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Samraksha has been a pioneer

230
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in all fields related

231
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to HIV/AIDS.

232
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
They have respite homes, the first,

233
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the first care centers,

234
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the first counseling services --

235
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,

236
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but in the hardest to reach villages

237
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in the state of Karnataka.

238
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Even that wasn't enough.

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
She wanted to change policy at the government level.

240
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
10 of their programs that she pioneered

241
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
are now government policy and funded by the government.

242
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
They take care of 20,000-odd people today

243
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.

244
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
She works with people like Murali Krishna.

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.

246
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,

247
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and he's HIV-positive.

248
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But he saw the work, the care,

249
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the compassion

250
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,

251
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and he wanted to be part of it.

252
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.

253
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They've pioneered a different approach to villages.

254
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets,

255
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
as is so often the case,

256
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they bring theater troupes,

257
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
songs, music, dance.

258
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And they sit around,

259
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and they talk about dreams.

260
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Sanghamitra told me just last week --

261
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
she had just come back from two weeks in the villages,

262
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and she had a real breakthrough.

263
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.

264
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the young women in the village

265
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
spoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.

266
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Our dream

267
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is for our partners, our husbands,

268
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
not to be given to us because of a horoscope,

269
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but to be given to us

270
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because they've been tested for HIV."

271
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra

272
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and ask her why and how,

273
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
how have you achieved so much?

274
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
She would look at you

275
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and very quietly, very softly say,

276
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"It just happened.

277
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's the spirit inside."

278
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.

279
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province

280
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in southwest China.

281
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
He was born in 1957,

282
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and you can imagine what his childhood

283
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
looked like and felt like,

284
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and what his life has been like

285
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
over the last 50 tumultuous years.

286
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
He's been a soldier, a teacher,

287
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
a politician, a vice-mayor

288
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and a business man.

289
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,

290
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and what do you do?"

291
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
He would tell you, "I'm a collector,

292
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and I curate a museum."

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I was lucky; I had heard about him for years,

294
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and I finally met him earlier this year

295
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
at his museum in Chengdu.

296
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
He's been a collector all of his life,

297
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.

298
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.

299
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Over a lifetime, through everything,

300
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,

301
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
he's kept collecting,

302
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
so that he now has over eight million pieces

303
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in his museums

304
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
documenting contemporary Chinese history.

305
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,

306
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in part because they document parts of history

307
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Chinese choose to forget.

308
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
For example, he's got over one million pieces

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
documenting the Sino-Japanese War,

310
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
a war that's not talked about in China very much

311
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and whose heroes are not honored.

312
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Why did he do all this?

313
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Because he thought

314
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.

315
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So, from commissioning

316
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
slightly larger than life bronze statues

317
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,

318
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
including those Chinese

319
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
who then fought with each other

320
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and left mainland China to go to Taiwan,

321
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to commemorating all the unknown,

322
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
ordinary soldiers who survived,

323
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
by asking them to take prints of their hands,

324
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
he is making sure -- one man is making sure --

325
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that history is not forgotten.

326
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.

327
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This building contains the world's largest collection

328
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
of documents and artifacts

329
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
commemorating the U.S. role

330
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in fighting on the Chinese side

331
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in that long war --

332
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the Flying Tigers.

333
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
He has nine other buildings --

334
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that are already open to the public --

335
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
filled to the rafters with artifacts

336
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
documenting contemporary Chinese history.

337
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Two of the most sensitive buildings

338
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
include a lifetime of collection

339
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
about the Cultural Revolution,

340
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
a period that actually most Chinese

341
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
would prefer to forget.

342
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But he doesn't want his nation

343
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
ever to forget.

344
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
These people inspire me,

345
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and they inspire me because they show us

346
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
what is possible when you change the way

347
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
you look at the world,

348
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
change the way you look at your place in the world.

349
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
They looked outside,

350
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and then they changed what was on the inside.

351
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
They didn't go to business school.

352
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
They didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader

353
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
in 10 Easy Steps."

354
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.

355
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
They have drive, passion, commitment.

356
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
They've gone away

357
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
from what they did before,

358
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and they've gone

359
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to something they didn't know.

360
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
They've tried to connect worlds

361
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
they didn't know existed before.

362
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
They've built bridges, and they've walked across them.

363
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
They have a sense of the great arc of time

364
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and their tiny place in it.

365
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
They know people have come before them

366
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and will follow them.

367
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And they know that they're part of a whole,

368
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that they depend on other people.

369
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It's not about them, they know that,

370
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but it has to start with them.

371
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And they have humility.

372
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It just happens.

373
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?

374
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We know it takes a lot to make it happen,

375
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and we know the direction the world is going in.

376
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So I think we need succession planning

377
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
on a global basis.

378
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,

379
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.

380
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I think it has to start with us.

381
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And we know, just like they knew,

382
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
how hard it is.

383
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;

384
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
we have models, we have examples,

385
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.

386
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We can look at what they've done, if we look.

387
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We can learn from what they've learned.

388
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We can change the way we see ourselves in the world.

389
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And if we're lucky,

390
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
we can change the way

391
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
our great-grandchildren

392
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
will answer Benki's question.

393
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Thank you.

394
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

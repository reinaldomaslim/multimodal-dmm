1
0:00:12.563,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So my name is Amy Webb,

2
0:00:15.105,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and a few years ago I found myself at the end

3
0:00:17.802,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of yet another fantastic relationship

4
0:00:20.438,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that came burning down in a spectacular fashion.

5
0:00:24.042,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I thought, what's wrong with me?

6
0:00:26.802,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I don't understand why this keeps happening.

7
0:00:28.884,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought.

8
0:00:32.383,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice,

9
0:00:36.383,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and she said, "Stop being so picky.

10
0:00:39.375,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You've got to date around.

11
0:00:40.753,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And most importantly,

12
0:00:42.131,000 --> 0:00:45,000
true love will find you when you least expect it."

13
0:00:46.336,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now as it turns out,

14
0:00:48.055,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,

15
0:00:50.612,000 --> 0:00:51,000
as you'll soon find.

16
0:00:51.911,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I am constantly swimming in numbers, formulas and charts.

17
0:00:57.101,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I also have a very tight-knit family,

18
0:00:59.501,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I'm very, very close with my sister,

19
0:01:01.512,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and as a result, I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up.

20
0:01:04.988,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So I'm at the end of this bad breakup,

21
0:01:06.885,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I'm 30 years old,

22
0:01:08.112,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months

23
0:01:11.839,000 --> 0:01:12,000
before I'm ready to get monogamous

24
0:01:13.681,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and before we can sort of cohabitate,

25
0:01:15.484,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and we have to do that for a while before we can get engaged.

26
0:01:18.433,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35,

27
0:01:21.426,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage

28
0:01:24.627,000 --> 0:01:25,000
five years ago.

29
0:01:26.171,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So that wasn't going to work.

30
0:01:27.607,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love,

31
0:01:31.354,000 --> 0:01:33,000
then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity.

32
0:01:34.881,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In short, I was trying to figure out

33
0:01:37.041,000 --> 0:01:39,000
what's the probability of my finding Mr. Right?

34
0:01:40.381,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Well, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia,

35
0:01:43.206,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and it's a big city, and I figured,

36
0:01:45.325,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in this entire place, there are lots of possibilities.

37
0:01:48.316,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So again, I started doing some math.

38
0:01:50.66,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Population of Philadelphia: it has 1.5 million people.

39
0:01:54.394,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I figure about half of that are men,

40
0:01:56.133,000 --> 0:01:58,000
so that takes the number down to 750,000.

41
0:01:58.727,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36,

42
0:02:01.936,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which was only four percent of the population,

43
0:02:04.491,000 --> 0:02:06,000
so now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men.

44
0:02:07.092,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,

45
0:02:09.117,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because I am and that was important to me.

46
0:02:11.365,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That's only 2.3 percent of the population.

47
0:02:13.904,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men,

48
0:02:18.053,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer.

49
0:02:22.89,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So that basically meant there were 35 men for me

50
0:02:25.95,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that I could possibly date

51
0:02:28.178,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in the entire city of Philadelphia.

52
0:02:32.349,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In the meantime, my very large Jewish family

53
0:02:35.561,000 --> 0:02:37,000
was already all married and well on their way

54
0:02:38.363,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to having lots and lots of children,

55
0:02:40.274,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure

56
0:02:42.775,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to get my life going already.

57
0:02:44.565,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So I have two possible strategies at this point

58
0:02:46.97,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I'm sort of figuring out.

59
0:02:48.228,000 --> 0:02:5,000
One, I can take my grandmother's advice

60
0:02:50.528,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and sort of least-expect my way

61
0:02:52.784,000 --> 0:02:56,000
into maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men

62
0:02:56.999,000 --> 0:03:,000
in the entire 1.5-million-person city of Philadelphia,

63
0:03:01.196,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or I could try online dating.

64
0:03:04.221,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, I like the idea of online dating,

65
0:03:06.366,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because it's predicated on an algorithm,

66
0:03:08.367,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and that's really just a simple way of saying

67
0:03:10.516,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I've got a problem, I'm going to use some data,

68
0:03:12.832,000 --> 0:03:14,000
run it through a system and get to a solution.

69
0:03:16.317,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So online dating is the second most popular way

70
0:03:18.609,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that people now meet each other,

71
0:03:20.267,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but as it turns out, algorithms have been around

72
0:03:22.577,000 --> 0:03:25,000
for thousands of years in almost every culture.

73
0:03:25.862,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In fact, in Judaism, there were matchmakers a long time ago,

74
0:03:29.359,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se,

75
0:03:32.07,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they definitely were running through formulas in their heads,

76
0:03:35.109,000 --> 0:03:36,000
like, is the girl going to like the boy?

77
0:03:37.076,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Are the families going to get along?

78
0:03:38.816,000 --> 0:03:39,000
What's the rabbi going to say?

79
0:03:40.269,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Are they going to start having children right away?

80
0:03:42.68,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The matchmaker would sort of think through all of this,

81
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
put two people together, and that would be the end of it.

82
0:03:48.052,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So in my case, I thought,

83
0:03:49.818,000 --> 0:03:53,000
well, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming?

84
0:03:54.563,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So I decided to sign on.

85
0:03:56.019,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, there was one small catch.

86
0:03:57.869,000 --> 0:03:59,000
As I'm signing on to the various dating websites,

87
0:04:00.5,000 --> 0:04:02,000
as it happens, I was really, really busy.

88
0:04:02.795,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But that actually wasn't the biggest problem.

89
0:04:05.533,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind,

90
0:04:09.577,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes.

91
0:04:13.98,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So I just copied and pasted from my résumé.

92
0:04:16.478,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:21.935,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So in the descriptive part up top,

94
0:04:24.583,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I said that I was an award-winning journalist

95
0:04:26.909,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and a future thinker.

96
0:04:28.539,000 --> 0:04:31,000
When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date,

97
0:04:31.901,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I said monetization and fluency in Japanese.

98
0:04:36.111,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I talked a lot about JavaScript.

99
0:04:37.828,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:39.075,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward.

101
0:04:45.805,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date.

102
0:04:50.251,000 --> 0:04:52,000
These algorithms had a sea full of men

103
0:04:52.712,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that wanted to take me out on lots of dates --

104
0:04:55.418,000 --> 0:04:57,000
what turned out to be truly awful dates.

105
0:04:59.256,000 --> 0:05:01,000
There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.

106
0:05:01.93,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets,

107
0:05:05.152,000 --> 0:05:09,000
we share a love of math and data and '80s music,

108
0:05:09.221,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and so I agreed to go out with him.

109
0:05:11.194,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out

110
0:05:13.851,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth,

111
0:05:15.945,000 --> 0:05:16,000
extremely expensive restaurants.

112
0:05:17.652,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And we went in, and right off the bat,

113
0:05:19.715,000 --> 0:05:22,000
our conversation really wasn't taking flight,

114
0:05:22.975,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but he was ordering a lot of food.

115
0:05:24.804,000 --> 0:05:26,000
In fact, he didn't even bother looking at the menu.

116
0:05:27.257,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well,

117
0:05:31.156,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table,

118
0:05:34.038,000 --> 0:05:36,000
also lots and lots of bottles of wine.

119
0:05:36.116,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So we're nearing the end of our conversation

120
0:05:38.297,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the end of dinner, and I've decided

121
0:05:40.218,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Steve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other,

122
0:05:43.352,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but we'll part ways as friends,

123
0:05:44.939,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when he gets up to go to the bathroom,

124
0:05:47.388,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and in the meantime, the bill comes to our table.

125
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And listen, I'm a modern woman.

126
0:05:53.588,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I am totally down with splitting the bill.

127
0:05:56.549,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back.

128
0:05:59.105,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Gasping)

129
0:06:00.215,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And that was my entire month's rent.

130
0:06:03.62,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Audience gasps)

131
0:06:04.978,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So needless to say, I was not having a good night.

132
0:06:08.251,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So I run home, I call my mother, I call my sister,

133
0:06:11.952,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and as I do, at the end of each one of these terrible, terrible dates,

134
0:06:16.15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I regale them with the details.

135
0:06:18.271,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And they say to me,

136
0:06:20.402,000 --> 0:06:21,000
"Stop complaining."

137
0:06:22.021,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:23.98,000 --> 0:06:24,000
"You're just being too picky."

139
0:06:26.312,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates

140
0:06:29.51,000 --> 0:06:31,000
where I know there's Wi-Fi, and I'm bringing my laptop.

141
0:06:32.237,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I'm going to shove it into my bag,

142
0:06:33.896,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm going to have this email template,

143
0:06:35.753,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and I'm going to fill it out and collect information

144
0:06:38.206,000 --> 0:06:4,000
on all these different data points during the date

145
0:06:40.646,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to prove to everybody that empirically,

146
0:06:42.528,000 --> 0:06:43,000
these dates really are terrible.

147
0:06:44.129,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:45.176,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So I started tracking things like really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;

149
0:06:49.294,000 --> 0:06:51,000
bad vocabulary;

150
0:06:51.473,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the number of times a man forced me to high-five him.

151
0:06:54.528,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

152
0:06:56.702,000 --> 0:07:,000
So I started to crunch some numbers,

153
0:07:01.092,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and that allowed me to make some correlations.

154
0:07:03.767,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So as it turns out,

155
0:07:06.391,000 --> 0:07:11,000
for some reason, men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately.

156
0:07:11.489,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:13.626,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Well, it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys.

158
0:07:17.89,000 --> 0:07:18,000
There were just bad for me.

159
0:07:19.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And as it happens, the algorithms that were setting us up,

160
0:07:23.475,000 --> 0:07:24,000
they weren't bad either.

161
0:07:24.88,000 --> 0:07:27,000
These algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do,

162
0:07:28.173,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which was to take our user-generated information,

163
0:07:30.788,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in my case, my résumé,

164
0:07:32.292,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and match it up with other people's information.

165
0:07:35.319,000 --> 0:07:36,000
See, the real problem here is that,

166
0:07:37.01,000 --> 0:07:38,000
while the algorithms work just fine,

167
0:07:38.978,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you and I don't,

168
0:07:40.233,000 --> 0:07:42,000
when confronted with blank windows

169
0:07:42.37,000 --> 0:07:44,000
where we're supposed to input our information online.

170
0:07:44.895,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Very few of us have the ability

171
0:07:46.57,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves.

172
0:07:50.046,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The other problem is that these websites are asking us

173
0:07:52.642,000 --> 0:07:54,000
questions like, are you a dog person or a cat person?

174
0:07:55.52,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Do you like horror films or romance films?

175
0:07:58.505,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I'm not looking for a pen pal.

176
0:08:00.259,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I'm looking for a husband. Right?

177
0:08:02.169,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data.

178
0:08:05.584,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So I said fine, I've got a new plan.

179
0:08:08.154,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I'm going to keep using these online dating sites,

180
0:08:10.559,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but I'm going to treat them as databases,

181
0:08:13.044,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up,

182
0:08:15.733,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system.

183
0:08:19.44,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So knowing that there was superficial data

184
0:08:22.425,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that was being used to match me up with other people,

185
0:08:24.973,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I decided instead to ask my own questions.

186
0:08:27.424,000 --> 0:08:28,000
What was every single possible thing

187
0:08:29.178,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate?

188
0:08:31.839,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So I started writing

189
0:08:33.766,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and writing and writing,

190
0:08:36.482,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points.

191
0:08:41.301,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I wanted somebody was Jew-ish,

192
0:08:43.579,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so I was looking for somebody

193
0:08:45.176,000 --> 0:08:47,000
who had the same background and thoughts on our culture,

194
0:08:47.93,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday.

195
0:08:51.743,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I wanted somebody who worked hard,

196
0:08:53.387,000 --> 0:08:55,000
because work for me is extremely important,

197
0:08:55.459,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but not too hard.

198
0:08:57.035,000 --> 0:08:58,000
For me, the hobbies that I have

199
0:08:58.567,000 --> 0:09:,000
are really just new work projects that I've launched.

200
0:09:01.432,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children,

201
0:09:04.516,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do,

202
0:09:07.702,000 --> 0:09:09,000
so somebody who was going to be totally okay

203
0:09:09.789,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three,

204
0:09:13.167,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it.

205
0:09:18.333,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So things like that, but I also wanted somebody

206
0:09:20.643,000 --> 0:09:22,000
who would go to far-flung, exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.

207
0:09:24.148,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times,

208
0:09:27.71,000 --> 0:09:28,000
regardless of what I weighed.

209
0:09:29.116,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:31.227,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So I now have these 72 different data points,

211
0:09:34.139,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which, to be fair, is a lot.

212
0:09:36.374,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So what I did was, I went through and I prioritized that list.

213
0:09:39.525,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points,

214
0:09:43.342,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and I ranked everything starting at 100

215
0:09:46.567,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and going all the way down to 91,

216
0:09:48.817,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart,

217
0:09:52.247,000 --> 0:09:53,000
who would challenge and stimulate me,

218
0:09:54.034,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points.

219
0:09:57.78,000 --> 0:10:01,000
These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers.

220
0:10:02.035,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

221
0:10:04.127,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system,

222
0:10:07.231,000 --> 0:10:11,000
because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate

223
0:10:11.736,000 --> 0:10:13,000
whether or not I thought the guy that I found online

224
0:10:14.242,000 --> 0:10:15,000
would be a match with me.

225
0:10:15.657,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I figured there would be a minimum of 700 points

226
0:10:18.188,000 --> 0:10:21,000
before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message.

227
0:10:21.812,000 --> 0:10:23,000
For 900 points, I'd agree to go out on a date,

228
0:10:24.027,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship

229
0:10:26.708,000 --> 0:10:29,000
before somebody had crossed the 1,500 point threshold.

230
0:10:30.683,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Well, as it turns out, this worked pretty well.

231
0:10:33.866,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So I go back online now.

232
0:10:35.493,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I found Jewishdoc57

233
0:10:38.119,000 --> 0:10:4,000
who's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken,

234
0:10:41.056,000 --> 0:10:42,000
he had hiked Mt. Fuji,

235
0:10:42.774,000 --> 0:10:43,000
he had walked along the Great Wall.

236
0:10:44.704,000 --> 0:10:45,000
He likes to travel

237
0:10:45.879,000 --> 0:10:47,000
as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship.

238
0:10:48.029,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I thought,

239
0:10:49.566,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I've done it!

240
0:10:50.741,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I've cracked the code.

241
0:10:52.3,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming

242
0:10:56.387,000 --> 0:10:57,000
of my family's dreams.

243
0:10:58.736,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There was only one problem:

244
0:11:01.685,000 --> 0:11:02,000
He didn't like me back.

245
0:11:03.887,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered

246
0:11:06.973,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is the competition.

247
0:11:08.866,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Who are all of the other women on these dating sites?

248
0:11:12.799,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I found SmileyGirl1978.

249
0:11:16.584,000 --> 0:11:18,000
She said she was a "Fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing."

250
0:11:19.332,000 --> 0:11:2,000
She listed her job as "teacher."

251
0:11:20.962,000 --> 0:11:22,000
She said she is "silly, nice and friendly."

252
0:11:23.38,000 --> 0:11:25,000
She likes to make people laugh "alot."

253
0:11:25.829,000 --> 0:11:26,000
At this moment I knew,

254
0:11:27.4,000 --> 0:11:3,000
clicking profile after profile that looked like this,

255
0:11:30.509,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that I needed to do some market research.

256
0:11:33.483,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So I created 10 fake male profiles.

257
0:11:35.778,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Now, before I lose all of you --

258
0:11:38.722,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter) --

259
0:11:41.954,000 --> 0:11:45,000
understand that I did this strictly to gather data

260
0:11:46.2,000 --> 0:11:47,000
about everybody else in the system.

261
0:11:47.948,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody.

262
0:11:52.259,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I really was just scraping their data.

263
0:11:54.156,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But I didn't want everybody's data.

264
0:11:56.124,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted

265
0:11:59.571,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to the type of man that I really, really wanted to marry.

266
0:12:02.834,000 --> 0:12:05,000
When I released these men into the wild,

267
0:12:06.4,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I did follow some rules.

268
0:12:07.702,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So I didn't reach out to any woman first.

269
0:12:09.842,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract,

270
0:12:12.819,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets.

271
0:12:16.134,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So I was looking at qualitative data,

272
0:12:17.92,000 --> 0:12:18,000
so what was the humor, the tone,

273
0:12:19.621,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the voice, the communication style

274
0:12:21.265,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that these women shared in common?

275
0:12:23.033,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And also quantitative data,

276
0:12:24.343,000 --> 0:12:26,000
so what was the average length of their profile,

277
0:12:26.654,000 --> 0:12:28,000
how much time was spent between messages?

278
0:12:29.047,000 --> 0:12:32,000
What I was trying to get at here was that I figured, in person,

279
0:12:32.495,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978.

280
0:12:35.97,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online.

281
0:12:40.899,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Well, one month later,

282
0:12:42.537,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I had a lot of data, and I was able to do another analysis.

283
0:12:46.29,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And as it turns out, content matters a lot.

284
0:12:49.17,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So smart people tend to write a lot --

285
0:12:52.145,000 --> 0:12:55,000
3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words about themselves,

286
0:12:55.494,000 --> 0:12:57,000
which may all be very, very interesting.

287
0:12:57.821,000 --> 0:12:59,000
The challenge here, though, is that the popular men and women

288
0:13:00.725,000 --> 0:13:03,000
are sticking to 97 words on average

289
0:13:03.946,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that are written very, very well,

290
0:13:05.89,000 --> 0:13:07,000
even though it may not seem like it all the time.

291
0:13:08.558,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The other hallmark of the people who do this well

292
0:13:10.921,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is that they're using non-specific language.

293
0:13:13.048,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So in my case,

294
0:13:14.374,000 --> 0:13:17,000
"The English Patient" is my most favorite movie ever,

295
0:13:17.984,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but it doesn't work to use that in a profile,

296
0:13:21.157,000 --> 0:13:22,000
because that's a superficial data point,

297
0:13:23.135,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and somebody may disagree

298
0:13:24.351,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and decide they don't want to go out

299
0:13:26.118,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because they didn't like sitting through the three-hour movie.

300
0:13:29.106,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Also, optimistic language matters a lot.

301
0:13:31.11,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So this is a word cloud

302
0:13:32.346,000 --> 0:13:34,000
highlighting the most popular words that were used

303
0:13:34.806,000 --> 0:13:35,000
by the most popular women,

304
0:13:36.138,000 --> 0:13:38,000
words like "fun" and "girl" and "love."

305
0:13:38.828,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile.

306
0:13:42.392,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Remember, I'm somebody who said

307
0:13:43.924,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript

308
0:13:46.967,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and I was okay with that.

309
0:13:48.712,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The difference is that it's about being more approachable

310
0:13:51.494,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you.

311
0:13:55.045,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And as it turns out, timing is also really, really important.

312
0:13:58.089,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number

313
0:14:01.361,000 --> 0:14:02,000
or their instant message account

314
0:14:03.117,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake,

315
0:14:06.056,000 --> 0:14:09,000
doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people.

316
0:14:09.395,000 --> 0:14:1,000
The popular women on these online sites

317
0:14:11.362,000 --> 0:14:14,000
spend an average of 23 hours in between each communication.

318
0:14:15.265,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship.

319
0:14:19.571,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And finally --

320
0:14:21.592,000 --> 0:14:22,000
there were the photos.

321
0:14:23.171,000 --> 0:14:26,000
All of the women who were popular showed some skin.

322
0:14:26.22,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They all looked really great,

323
0:14:28.446,000 --> 0:14:3,000
which turned out to be in sharp contrast

324
0:14:31.348,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to what I had uploaded.

325
0:14:32.872,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Laughter)

326
0:14:34.634,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Once I had all of this information,

327
0:14:36.364,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I was able to create a super profile,

328
0:14:38.501,000 --> 0:14:4,000
so it was still me,

329
0:14:40.526,000 --> 0:14:42,000
but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem.

330
0:14:44.431,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And as it turns out, I did a really good job.

331
0:14:49.134,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I was the most popular person online.

332
0:14:52.19,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Laughter)

333
0:14:54.709,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Applause)

334
0:14:58.923,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And as it turns out, lots and lots of men wanted to date me.

335
0:15:02.41,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So I call my mom, I call my sister, I call my grandmother.

336
0:15:05.235,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I'm telling them about this fabulous news,

337
0:15:07.388,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and they say, "This is wonderful! How soon are you going out?"

338
0:15:10.641,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I said, "Actually, I'm not going to go out with anybody."

339
0:15:13.347,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Because remember, in my scoring system,

340
0:15:15.245,000 --> 0:15:17,000
they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points,

341
0:15:17.765,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and none of them have done that.

342
0:15:19.75,000 --> 0:15:21,000
They said, "What? You're still being too damn picky."

343
0:15:22.431,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Well, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin,

344
0:15:25.989,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and he said that he was culturally Jewish,

345
0:15:29.004,000 --> 0:15:32,000
he said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter,

346
0:15:32.544,000 --> 0:15:33,000
which I thought was very clever.

347
0:15:34.344,000 --> 0:15:36,000
He talked in detail about travel.

348
0:15:37.221,000 --> 0:15:39,000
He made a lot of really interesting cultural references.

349
0:15:39.912,000 --> 0:15:41,000
He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted,

350
0:15:42.678,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and immediately, he scored 850 points.

351
0:15:45.836,000 --> 0:15:46,000
It was enough for a date.

352
0:15:47.524,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Three weeks later, we met up in person

353
0:15:49.64,000 --> 0:15:52,000
for what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation

354
0:15:53.144,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that went from coffee shop to restaurant

355
0:15:55.215,000 --> 0:15:57,000
to another coffee shop to another restaurant,

356
0:15:57.396,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and when he dropped me back off at my house that night

357
0:15:59.944,000 --> 0:16:,000
I re-scored him --

358
0:16:01.119,000 --> 0:16:02,000
[1,050 points!]

359
0:16:02.309,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Thought, you know what,

360
0:16:03.606,000 --> 0:16:05,000
this entire time, I haven't been picky enough.

361
0:16:06.849,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Well, a year and a half after that,

362
0:16:08.579,000 --> 0:16:1,000
we were non-cruise ship traveling

363
0:16:11.126,000 --> 0:16:13,000
through Petra, Jordan,

364
0:16:13.211,000 --> 0:16:15,000
when he got down on his knee and proposed.

365
0:16:16.68,000 --> 0:16:18,000
A year after that, we were married,

366
0:16:19.183,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and about a year and a half after that,

367
0:16:21.086,000 --> 0:16:23,000
our daughter, Petra, was born.

368
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Audience: Oh!

369
0:16:25.099,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Applause)

370
0:16:27.664,000 --> 0:16:28,000
[What it means...]

371
0:16:30.846,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Obviously, I'm having a fabulous life, so --

372
0:16:33.09,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Laughter)

373
0:16:34.65,000 --> 0:16:36,000
The question is, what does all of this mean for you?

374
0:16:37.146,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Well, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love.

375
0:16:40.994,000 --> 0:16:43,000
It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online.

376
0:16:44.69,000 --> 0:16:46,000
In fact, it's something that you write yourself.

377
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife

378
0:16:49.358,000 --> 0:16:5,000
or you're trying to find your passion

379
0:16:51.239,000 --> 0:16:52,000
or you're trying to start a business,

380
0:16:53.025,000 --> 0:16:55,000
all you have to really do is figure out your own framework

381
0:16:55.903,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and play by your own rules,

382
0:16:57.687,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and feel free to be as picky as you want.

383
0:17:00.327,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Well, on my wedding day,

384
0:17:01.787,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I had a conversation again with my grandmother,

385
0:17:04.05,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and she said, "All right, maybe I was wrong.

386
0:17:06.49,000 --> 0:17:09,000
It looks like you did come up with a really, really great system.

387
0:17:09.929,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Now, your matzah balls ...

388
0:17:13.072,000 --> 0:17:14,000
They should be fluffy, not hard."

389
0:17:14.977,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Laughter)

390
0:17:16.159,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And I'll take her advice on that.

391
0:17:17.767,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

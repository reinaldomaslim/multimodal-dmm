1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have been a police officer for a very, very long time.

2
0:00:15.492,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher.

3
0:00:21.305,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:23.012,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And if you know anything about black preachers,

5
0:00:25.251,000 --> 0:00:28,000
we'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes.

6
0:00:28.487,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.548,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I need this to keep pushing this thing forward.

8
0:00:31.965,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I've been a police officer for a very long time,

9
0:00:34.238,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I mean I predated technology.

10
0:00:35.842,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm talking about before pagers.

11
0:00:37.462,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:38.719,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Laugh if you want to, but I'm telling the truth.

13
0:00:41.004,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I predate War on Our Fellow Man -- I mean, War on Drugs.

14
0:00:45.73,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I predate all of that.

15
0:00:47.855,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I predate so much

16
0:00:49.033,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I've been through ebbs and flows

17
0:00:50.84,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I've been through good and bad times,

18
0:00:53.231,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and still I absolutely love being a police officer.

19
0:00:58.207,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me

20
0:01:01.982,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and never a job.

21
0:01:04.219,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And even with that,

22
0:01:06.538,000 --> 0:01:1,000
my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis.

23
0:01:11.616,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's an invisible crisis,

24
0:01:13.154,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and it has been for many, many years.

25
0:01:16.787,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Even though we in law enforcement say,

26
0:01:18.68,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this."

27
0:01:23.258,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We say in law enforcement things like,

28
0:01:25.093,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"Yeah, it's illegal to profile."

29
0:01:28.008,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You know what?

30
0:01:29.19,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In law enforcement, we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking

31
0:01:32.572,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and become more oriented to community policing.

32
0:01:34.801,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And yet all the while, still,

33
0:01:37.735,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we continue in the same vein,

34
0:01:39.956,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted.

35
0:01:45.131,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And so that's the reason for me, several years ago.

36
0:01:48.313,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Because I was tired of the racism, I was tired of discrimination,

37
0:01:51.432,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I was tired of the "-isms" and the schisms.

38
0:01:54.049,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I was just so tired.

39
0:01:55.904,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I was tired of the vicious cycle,

40
0:01:58.081,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I was tired of it even in the beloved agency

41
0:02:01.334,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in the department that I still love today.

42
0:02:04.771,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And so my wife and I, we sat down

43
0:02:06.924,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire.

44
0:02:10.13,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We would retire and I would go off into the sunset,

45
0:02:12.758,000 --> 0:02:14,000
maybe do ministry full time, love my wife a long time.

46
0:02:15.615,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Y'all know what I'm talking about.

47
0:02:17.28,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:18.709,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But we decided that I would retire.

49
0:02:20.456,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But then there was a higher power than I.

50
0:02:24.492,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There was a love for the city

51
0:02:27.384,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that I loved, that I grew up in, that I was educated in --

52
0:02:30.609,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a city that pulled my heart back into the system.

53
0:02:34.959,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So we didn't retire.

54
0:02:36.916,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We didn't retire

55
0:02:38.334,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and so what happened was,

56
0:02:40.822,000 --> 0:02:43,000
over the next -- I would say, 18 months, 19 months,

57
0:02:45.05,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I had this passion to implement some radical policing.

58
0:02:49.393,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And so now, over the next 19 months,

59
0:02:51.148,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I shifted, and I transcended from being a drug sergeant --

60
0:02:56.277,000 --> 0:02:57,000
ready to retire as a drug sergeant --

61
0:02:58.865,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and went from level to level to level,

62
0:03:00.723,000 --> 0:03:02,000
until I find myself as a district commander,

63
0:03:03.176,000 --> 0:03:05,000
commander of the worst district in Baltimore city.

64
0:03:06.453,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We call it the Eastern District,

65
0:03:08.178,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the most violent district,

66
0:03:09.812,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the most impoverished district --

67
0:03:11.543,000 --> 0:03:14,000
46 percent unemployment in that district.

68
0:03:16.018,000 --> 0:03:18,000
National rating at that time,

69
0:03:18.262,000 --> 0:03:2,000
national rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating],

70
0:03:21.258,000 --> 0:03:23,000
was always on the top 10 list

71
0:03:23.683,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for zip codes for cities across the nation,

72
0:03:26.73,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or just zip codes across the nation.

73
0:03:28.493,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The top 10 -- I didn't say state, I didn't say city --

74
0:03:31.135,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that little neighborhood.

75
0:03:33.911,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I said, you know what? We gotta do something different.

76
0:03:36.738,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We gotta do something different. We gotta think radical.

77
0:03:39.422,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We gotta think outside the box.

78
0:03:41.73,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted

79
0:03:44.436,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I desperately felt in my heart,

80
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I had to start listening to that inner spirit.

81
0:03:48.48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I had to start listening to that man on the inside

82
0:03:50.937,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that went against everything that I had been trained to do.

83
0:03:54.772,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But we still did it.

84
0:03:56.19,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We still did it because we listened to that inner spirit,

85
0:03:58.911,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because I realized this:

86
0:04:00.196,000 --> 0:04:04,000
if I was to see real police reform

87
0:04:04.269,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in the communities that I had authority over for public safety,

88
0:04:08.69,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.

89
0:04:12.728,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We had to change it.

90
0:04:13.905,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And so what we did is we started to think holistically

91
0:04:16.652,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and not paramilitarily.

92
0:04:18.538,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So we thought differently.

93
0:04:20.819,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And we started to realize

94
0:04:22.042,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that it could never be and never should have been

95
0:04:24.376,000 --> 0:04:25,000
us versus them.

96
0:04:26.91,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And so I decided to come to that intersection

97
0:04:29.142,000 --> 0:04:32,000
where I could meet all classes, all races, all creeds, all colors;

98
0:04:32.387,000 --> 0:04:34,000
where I would meet the businesses and the faith-based,

99
0:04:34.952,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the eds, the meds,

100
0:04:36.262,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and I would meet all the people

101
0:04:37.794,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that made up the communities that I had authority over.

102
0:04:41.205,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I met them and I began to listen.

103
0:04:43.189,000 --> 0:04:44,000
See, police have a problem.

104
0:04:44.665,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Off the top, we want to bring things into the community

105
0:04:47.284,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments,

106
0:04:50.276,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but we never talk to the community about them.

107
0:04:52.475,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And we shove them into the community and say, "Take that."

108
0:04:55.806,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin',

109
0:04:58.227,000 --> 0:04:59,000
so we talked to our communities.

110
0:04:59.799,000 --> 0:05:,000
We said, "This is your community table.

111
0:05:01.691,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you.

112
0:05:03.978,000 --> 0:05:04,000
What's going to work in your community?"

113
0:05:05.942,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And then some great things started to happen.

114
0:05:08.095,000 --> 0:05:09,000
See, here's the thing:

115
0:05:09.27,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I had to figure out a way to shift 130 cops that were under my tutelage

116
0:05:15.014,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from being occupiers of communities

117
0:05:17.15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to being partners.

118
0:05:19.355,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I had to figure out how to do that.

119
0:05:21.071,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Because here's the crazy thing:

120
0:05:23.074,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in law enforcement, we have evolved into something incredible.

121
0:05:26.743,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Listen, we have become great protectors.

122
0:05:28.704,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We know how to protect you.

123
0:05:30.909,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But we have exercised that arm so much, so very much.

124
0:05:34.972,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If I was a natural police department

125
0:05:38.162,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I represented a police department,

126
0:05:40.067,000 --> 0:05:42,000
you would see this incredible, beautiful, 23-inch arm.

127
0:05:42.98,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:45.607,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.

129
0:05:48.641,000 --> 0:05:5,000
No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good!

130
0:05:51.592,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

131
0:05:53.75,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That's a great arm -- protection!

132
0:05:55.675,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's who we are, but we've exercised it so much sometimes

133
0:05:59.255,000 --> 0:06:,000
that it has led to abuse.

134
0:06:02.008,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us.

135
0:06:06.941,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And we've forgotten

136
0:06:08.117,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the mantra across this nation

137
0:06:09.554,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is to protect and serve.

138
0:06:12.068,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve.

139
0:06:14.068,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:15.093,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So you look at the other arm,

141
0:06:16.522,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and then you look at it and ... there it is.

142
0:06:18.681,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:20.267,000 --> 0:06:21,000
You know, it's kinda weak.

144
0:06:22.926,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It looks sickly.

145
0:06:24.972,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's withering and it's dying

146
0:06:27.861,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because we've invested so much in our protective arm.

147
0:06:31.302,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But we forgot to treat our communities

148
0:06:34.183,000 --> 0:06:35,000
like they're our customers;

149
0:06:36.026,000 --> 0:06:38,000
like they're our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters,

150
0:06:39.015,000 --> 0:06:4,000
our mothers and fathers.

151
0:06:40.6,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And so somehow, along the way,

152
0:06:42.873,000 --> 0:06:43,000
we've gotten out of balance.

153
0:06:44.958,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And because we are a proud profession,

154
0:06:47.952,000 --> 0:06:5,000
it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes.

155
0:06:51.117,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It's even harder to make a change.

156
0:06:53.775,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And so, as I try to hurry and get through this,

157
0:06:57.204,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I need to say this:

158
0:06:58.389,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it's not just law enforcement, though.

159
0:07:00.818,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Because every one of us makes up a community.

160
0:07:03.674,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Everybody makes up a community.

161
0:07:05.678,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And as communities -- can I say this? --

162
0:07:07.63,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement.

163
0:07:12.261,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Too much.

164
0:07:13.443,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause)

165
0:07:18.706,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset

166
0:07:21.377,000 --> 0:07:23,000
with law enforcement when we take action.

167
0:07:24.265,000 --> 0:07:25,000
There is no way in the world

168
0:07:26.615,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that we, as a community, should be calling the police

169
0:07:30.182,000 --> 0:07:31,000
for kids playing ball in the street.

170
0:07:34.071,000 --> 0:07:36,000
No way in the world that we should be calling the police

171
0:07:36.831,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because my neighbor's music is up too loud,

172
0:07:38.941,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two;

173
0:07:41.719,000 --> 0:07:43,000
there's no way we should be calling the police.

174
0:07:44.264,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But we have surrendered so much of our responsibility.

175
0:07:46.93,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Listen, when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore --

176
0:07:50.088,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and listen, we played rough in the street --

177
0:07:52.249,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I ain't never see the police come and break us up.

178
0:07:55.026,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You know who came? It was the elders.

179
0:07:56.975,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It was the parental figures in the community.

180
0:07:59.44,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It was those guardians, it was that village mentality.

181
0:08:02.051,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They came and said, "Stop that!" and "Do this." and "Stop that."

182
0:08:05.689,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We had mentors throughout all of the community.

183
0:08:09.769,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So it takes all of us, all of us.

184
0:08:12.62,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And when I say community,

185
0:08:13.844,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm talking about everything that makes up a community, even --

186
0:08:16.895,000 --> 0:08:18,000
listen, because I'm a preacher, I'm very hard on the churches,

187
0:08:19.85,000 --> 0:08:21,000
because I believe the churches too often have become MIA,

188
0:08:22.621,000 --> 0:08:23,000
missing in action.

189
0:08:23.802,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I believe they have shifted over the last 10, 20 years

190
0:08:26.394,000 --> 0:08:27,000
from being community churches,

191
0:08:27.894,000 --> 0:08:3,000
where you walk outside your door, round the corner and you're in church.

192
0:08:31.386,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They shifted from that and became commuter churches.

193
0:08:34.27,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So you now have churches who have become disconnected by default

194
0:08:38.754,000 --> 0:08:4,000
from the very community where they're planted.

195
0:08:42.06,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And they don't take care of that community.

196
0:08:45.153,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I could go on and on, but I really need to wrap this up.

197
0:08:47.845,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Community and policing:

198
0:08:50.52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we've all lost that precious gift, and I call it relational equity.

199
0:08:55.498,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We've lost it with one another.

200
0:08:57.445,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It's not somebody else's fault --

201
0:08:59.484,000 --> 0:09:,000
it's all of our fault.

202
0:09:01.371,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We all take responsibility in this.

203
0:09:03.361,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But I say this: it's not too late for all of us to build our cities

204
0:09:06.586,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and nation to make it great again.

205
0:09:08.248,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It is never too late.

206
0:09:09.431,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It is never too late.

207
0:09:11.428,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You see, after three years

208
0:09:12.853,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district,

209
0:09:16.115,000 --> 0:09:17,000
three years in,

210
0:09:17.293,000 --> 0:09:19,000
after putting pastors in the car with my police

211
0:09:19.996,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because I knew this -- it's a little secret --

212
0:09:22.195,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I knew this:

213
0:09:23.378,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it was hard to stay a nasty police officer

214
0:09:26.067,000 --> 0:09:28,000
while you're riding around with a clergy.

215
0:09:28.192,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:30.398,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Applause)

217
0:09:38.476,000 --> 0:09:41,000
You'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about:

218
0:09:42.029,000 --> 0:09:45,000
"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long -- you can't do it!

219
0:09:45.589,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So we came up with some incredible initiatives,

220
0:09:47.866,000 --> 0:09:5,000
engagements for our community and police to build that trust back.

221
0:09:51.385,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We began to deal with our youth

222
0:09:52.968,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence.

223
0:09:56.17,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We knew we had an economic problem,

224
0:09:57.927,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so we began to create jobs.

225
0:09:59.443,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We knew there was sickness in our community

226
0:10:01.515,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and they didn't have access to proper medical care,

227
0:10:04.033,000 --> 0:10:05,000
so we'd partner up.

228
0:10:05.216,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We got to that intersection and partnered up

229
0:10:07.313,000 --> 0:10:09,000
with anybody that wanted to partner with us

230
0:10:09.424,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and talked about what we needed holistically,

231
0:10:11.615,000 --> 0:10:12,000
never thinking about the crime.

232
0:10:13.152,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Because at the end of the day,

233
0:10:14.871,000 --> 0:10:16,000
if we took care of the needs of the people,

234
0:10:16.958,000 --> 0:10:17,000
if we got to the root cause,

235
0:10:19.251,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the crime would take care of itself.

236
0:10:22.599,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It would take care of itself.

237
0:10:24.089,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Applause)

238
0:10:29.897,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And so, after three years of a four-and-a-half-year stint,

239
0:10:34.665,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we looked back and we looked over

240
0:10:36.365,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and found out that we were at a 40-year historical low:

241
0:10:39.754,000 --> 0:10:41,000
our crime numbers, our homicides --

242
0:10:42.659,000 --> 0:10:44,000
everything had dropped down, back to the 1970s.

243
0:10:45.14,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And it might go back further,

244
0:10:46.58,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but the problem is, we only started keeping data since 1970.

245
0:10:49.521,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Forty-year crime low, so much so, I had other commanders call me,

246
0:10:52.641,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?

247
0:10:54.082,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"

248
0:10:56.21,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

249
0:10:57.649,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And so we gave them some of that.

250
0:11:00.968,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And in a short period of time,

251
0:11:02.444,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the city went to a 30-year crime low.

252
0:11:05.181,000 --> 0:11:07,000
For the first time in 30 years, we fell, Baltimore city,

253
0:11:07.854,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.

254
0:11:10.242,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And we celebrated,

255
0:11:11.425,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because we had learned to become great servers,

256
0:11:15.132,000 --> 0:11:16,000
become great servers first.

257
0:11:16.893,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But I gotta tell you this: these last few years,

258
0:11:20.607,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as much as we had learned

259
0:11:22.856,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to become great proactive police officers

260
0:11:25.827,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and great relational police officers rather than reactive,

261
0:11:29.612,000 --> 0:11:31,000
these last years have disappointed me.

262
0:11:32.71,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They have broken my heart.

263
0:11:34.644,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The uprising still hurts.

264
0:11:37.584,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It still hurts my heart,

265
0:11:39.294,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because truly I believe that it should've never happened.

266
0:11:43.014,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I believe it should've never happened

267
0:11:44.831,000 --> 0:11:46,000
if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in,

268
0:11:47.799,000 --> 0:11:48,000
servicing our community,

269
0:11:49.503,000 --> 0:11:51,000
treating them like human beings, treating them with respect,

270
0:11:52.463,000 --> 0:11:53,000
loving on them first.

271
0:11:54.67,000 --> 0:11:56,000
If we continued in that vein,

272
0:11:56.854,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it would've never happened.

273
0:11:58.727,000 --> 0:12:,000
But somehow, we went back to business as usual.

274
0:12:01.956,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But I'm excited again!

275
0:12:04.164,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I'm excited again, because now we have a police commissioner

276
0:12:07.533,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who not only talks about community policing,

277
0:12:11.8,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but he absolutely understands it,

278
0:12:14.142,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and more importantly, he embraces it.

279
0:12:16.238,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So I'm very excited now.

280
0:12:17.981,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,

281
0:12:20.954,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because we, as many cities, I believe shall rise from the ashes.

282
0:12:25.973,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I believe -- I truly believe --

283
0:12:28.886,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause)

284
0:12:29.932,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that we will be great again.

285
0:12:32.639,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I believe,

286
0:12:34.47,000 --> 0:12:37,000
as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say,

287
0:12:37.565,000 --> 0:12:38,000
"We're in this together,"

288
0:12:38.787,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because it's not just an intersection:

289
0:12:40.654,000 --> 0:12:43,000
once we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals,

290
0:12:44.312,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and this city will become great again.

291
0:12:46.384,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This nation will become great again.

292
0:12:48.369,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Because we have the same goal: we all want peace.

293
0:12:50.812,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We all want respect for one another.

294
0:12:52.57,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We all want love.

295
0:12:53.744,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And I believe we are back on that road,

296
0:12:55.66,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and I'm so excited about it.

297
0:12:57.054,000 --> 0:13:,000
So listen, I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.

298
0:13:00.426,000 --> 0:13:01,000
God bless you all.

299
0:13:01.68,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Applause)

300
0:13:02.705,000 --> 0:13:03,000
God bless you.

301
0:13:03.88,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Applause)

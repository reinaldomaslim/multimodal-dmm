1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:15,000
By the year 2050, the population of Africa will have doubled.

2
0:00:17.406,000 --> 0:00:2,000
One in four people on Earth will be African at that point,

3
0:00:20.81,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and this is both really exciting and daunting all at once.

4
0:00:24.519,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's really exciting because, for the first time in the modern era,

5
0:00:27.687,000 --> 0:00:3,000
there will be enough Africans on the Earth to bully everybody else.

6
0:00:30.894,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:32.108,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm only kidding.

8
0:00:34.105,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But it's daunting, because we're going to have to have economies

9
0:00:37.131,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that can sustain this population growth,

10
0:00:39.093,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and many of the people are going to be very young.

11
0:00:41.621,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now most of governments in Africa have a plan for this economic growth --

12
0:00:45.315,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in Kenya, we call ours Vision2030 --

13
0:00:47.947,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they're all predicated on industrialization.

14
0:00:51.327,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The thing is, though, that the world

15
0:00:53.126,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is going through the Fourth Industrial Revolution right now,

16
0:00:55.992,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which means that there's a merger

17
0:00:57.589,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of the physical, cyber, and biological worlds.

18
0:00:59.788,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It means that because of massive interconnectivity

19
0:01:03.574,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and the availability of artificial intelligence and robotics,

20
0:01:07.115,000 --> 0:01:09,000
many of the jobs that we know and are used to right now

21
0:01:09.712,000 --> 0:01:1,000
won't exist in the future.

22
0:01:11.187,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So the challenge is a lot greater, in many ways,

23
0:01:13.449,000 --> 0:01:16,000
than it even was when Asia was industrializing, for example.

24
0:01:17.39,000 --> 0:01:21,000
To add to this, one of the kinds of person that you need

25
0:01:21.692,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for industrialization is an engineer,

26
0:01:23.867,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and they're really in short supply on the continent.

27
0:01:26.343,000 --> 0:01:28,000
If you compare, for example, the number of engineers

28
0:01:28.864,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that those same Asian countries had

29
0:01:30.646,000 --> 0:01:32,000
a couple of decades ago when they were industrializing,

30
0:01:33.318,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we fall far short.

31
0:01:36.289,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I've taught for a while,

32
0:01:37.679,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and many of the students who are studying engineering

33
0:01:40.201,000 --> 0:01:43,000
end up actually working in auditing firms and banks,

34
0:01:43.5,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and many of them spend half their time doing accounting and so on

35
0:01:46.58,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as they're preparing.

36
0:01:48.538,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now, I was fortunate enough to do my undergrad and postgrad education

37
0:01:52.849,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in the UK and the US, in countries, environments,

38
0:01:55.412,000 --> 0:01:57,000
where there was all the equipment that you required,

39
0:01:58.118,000 --> 0:02:,000
all the sophistication in the systems,

40
0:02:00.245,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and then I worked for about three years in Japan

41
0:02:02.563,000 --> 0:02:03,000
doing R&D for a large firm.

42
0:02:04.523,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And so I was very used to having good equipment,

43
0:02:06.809,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and went back home

44
0:02:07.997,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and joined the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Nairobi,

45
0:02:11.199,000 --> 0:02:13,000
wanting to contribute and be on the continent.

46
0:02:13.379,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I quickly found I was really quite useless,

47
0:02:15.887,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because there wasn't all the equipment that I had become accustomed to available.

48
0:02:20.572,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I was teaching students who I would find very bright ideas in their minds

49
0:02:24.62,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and they'd be presenting things that I knew

50
0:02:26.645,000 --> 0:02:27,000
if only we had sufficient equipment,

51
0:02:28.446,000 --> 0:02:32,000
they'd be able to really contribute to the challenge of industrialization.

52
0:02:33.708,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So I kind of had to change hats, and became quite entrepreneurial

53
0:02:37.701,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and started looking for money to buy the equipment that we required.

54
0:02:41.201,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I heard about a concept out of MIT, called the Fab Labs.

55
0:02:45.072,000 --> 0:02:47,000
These are digital fabrication labs

56
0:02:47.099,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that allow, in a rather small space with not very expensive equipment,

57
0:02:50.711,000 --> 0:02:52,000
people to have access to these tools

58
0:02:52.85,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to be able to make almost anything,

59
0:02:55.002,000 --> 0:02:56,000
as the slogan goes.

60
0:02:56.728,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so I was able to convince a government official

61
0:02:59.454,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to buy one of these for the university where I was teaching.

62
0:03:02.312,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And immediately, we had wonderful results.

63
0:03:04.336,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We saw all kinds of innovations coming through,

64
0:03:06.653,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and for the first time in this context at the university,

65
0:03:09.487,000 --> 0:03:12,000
engineering students from different disciplines

66
0:03:13.122,000 --> 0:03:16,000
were doing the lab and practical exercises together in the same space.

67
0:03:17.049,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Normally, they'd be siloed.

68
0:03:18.924,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And not just that, but students who weren't engineers at all

69
0:03:21.824,000 --> 0:03:22,000
were also working in the same place,

70
0:03:23.75,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and non-students, people who had nothing to do with the university,

71
0:03:26.957,000 --> 0:03:27,000
were also coming into this space.

72
0:03:28.584,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So you had this rich mix of people,

73
0:03:30.275,000 --> 0:03:32,000
people who think differently from one another,

74
0:03:32.444,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and this always is really good for innovation.

75
0:03:34.853,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I was really proud of what we were seeing.

76
0:03:36.965,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So you can imagine my surprise

77
0:03:38.433,000 --> 0:03:41,000
when one day the dean of engineering came and said to me,

78
0:03:41.471,000 --> 0:03:44,000
"Kamau, the students who spend most of the time in the Fab Lab

79
0:03:45.392,000 --> 0:03:46,000
are failing their exams."

80
0:03:47.251,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I said, "What do you mean?"

81
0:03:49.791,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I looked into it, and he was right,

82
0:03:52.203,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the reason they were failing

83
0:03:53.79,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is that they'd honed their skills so well in certain things

84
0:03:56.605,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that they were going out into the city and offering services for money.

85
0:04:00.081,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So they were making money --

86
0:04:01.522,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:02.597,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and they therefore weren't focusing on their studies.

88
0:04:05.352,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I thought, what a good problem to have.

89
0:04:07.433,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:08.473,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Don't quote me on that. I'm an academician.

91
0:04:11.613,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So we needed to scale this,

92
0:04:14.241,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and at the university, things were a bit too bureaucratic,

93
0:04:17.447,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and so I moved out and I hooked up with people who, in Nairobi,

94
0:04:20.686,000 --> 0:04:22,000
were providing spaces for IT experts

95
0:04:23.36,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to share fast internet and things like that.

96
0:04:26.067,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And some of these places are really quite famous.

97
0:04:28.414,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They've made Kenya famous for IT.

98
0:04:31.774,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And together we set up a space which we are setting up right now.

99
0:04:36.306,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We've moved from where we were.

100
0:04:37.919,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We are in a much larger space,

101
0:04:39.463,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and we're sort of making available a wide range of equipment,

102
0:04:42.991,000 --> 0:04:44,000
including the digital fabrication tools that I mentioned,

103
0:04:45.848,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and analog tools,

104
0:04:47.349,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to anybody really, on a membership basis.

105
0:04:49.889,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's a bit like a gym, so you come in, you pay,

106
0:04:52.168,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you get taught how to use the equipment,

107
0:04:54.106,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and then you're set free to innovate and do whatever it is that you want,

108
0:04:57.845,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and you don't have to be an engineer, necessarily.

109
0:05:00.498,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And some of the people in the space are setting up a small company.

110
0:05:03.713,000 --> 0:05:04,000
They just need a space at a desk,

111
0:05:05.407,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and so we provide that at a fee,

112
0:05:07.004,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and others take up bigger spaces and are able to set up their offices.

113
0:05:10.314,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They're further along.

114
0:05:11.57,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Maybe their company has been running for a certain period of time.

115
0:05:14.69,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And so we're able to accommodate all of this

116
0:05:16.783,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in an innovation space that is really quite active.

117
0:05:20.966,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What you're seeing in this image over here is Douglas,

118
0:05:23.785,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and Douglas is an electrical engineer,

119
0:05:25.705,000 --> 0:05:27,000
one of the people who was really active in the Fab Lab.

120
0:05:28.379,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I'm pretty sure he passed his exams.

121
0:05:30.221,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And the image on the top left is a copper sheet.

122
0:05:33.857,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And he designed a circuit that the client came to him and said,

123
0:05:36.866,000 --> 0:05:39,000
"I need this circuit for a pay-as-you-go system."

124
0:05:39.954,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And so this is a model for business

125
0:05:42.365,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that's made accessibility to goods and services for very poor people

126
0:05:47.19,000 --> 0:05:49,000
really much easier, because they're able to pay a little bit,

127
0:05:50.127,000 --> 0:05:51,000
like a dollar a day, for example,

128
0:05:51.946,000 --> 0:05:52,000
for a specific service.

129
0:05:53.618,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And so this company wanted to pilot a new idea that they had,

130
0:05:56.627,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and so they just needed 50 circuits,

131
0:05:58.436,000 --> 0:05:59,000
so they hired him to make them,

132
0:05:59.938,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and what you're seeing him doing there is,

133
0:06:02.041,000 --> 0:06:05,000
he's able to design on the computer what the circuit will be

134
0:06:05.381,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and then transfer it to an etching process --

135
0:06:07.509,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that's the image on the top right --

136
0:06:09.249,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and then populate the board using this robot.

137
0:06:12.517,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And so what would normally take him maybe a day or something to solder by hand,

138
0:06:17.232,000 --> 0:06:19,000
he can do in a few minutes using this machine.

139
0:06:19.455,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So he was able to complete the entire order within Gearbox,

140
0:06:22.272,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and this is really important,

141
0:06:23.716,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because if it wasn't for what we provided right now,

142
0:06:26.503,000 --> 0:06:29,000
he would have had to have hired a company in China to do this,

143
0:06:30.41,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and because it's such a small order, it would have taken a long time.

144
0:06:33.694,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It would be a small company,

145
0:06:35.234,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because big companies wouldn't take small orders,

146
0:06:37.583,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and even then, if they got a bigger order,

147
0:06:39.608,000 --> 0:06:41,000
they'd bump him off in favor of that.

148
0:06:41.766,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And there's language problems and so on,

149
0:06:43.696,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so being able to do it in country is really very important,

150
0:06:46.497,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and of course piloting as a phase within the progress of the business idea

151
0:06:51.895,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is extremely important, because you can go back and make corrections and so on.

152
0:06:56.836,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In this image -- Thank you.

153
0:06:58.633,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Applause)

154
0:07:00.483,000 --> 0:07:01,000
In this image you see on the top left,

155
0:07:02.318,000 --> 0:07:05,000
what you're looking at is a 3D render of a digital fabrication machine.

156
0:07:05.677,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In this instance, it doubles as a plasma cutter

157
0:07:08.619,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and also a wood router.

158
0:07:10.35,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And so the plasma cutter makes possible the cutting of plate and sheet metal,

159
0:07:15.358,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and basically, you make a design on the computer

160
0:07:17.627,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and send it over to the machine,

161
0:07:19.207,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and then quickly and precisely, it will cut the shapes you want.

162
0:07:22.287,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But in this machine,

163
0:07:23.468,000 --> 0:07:26,000
you can also change the plasma cutter and put on a spindle,

164
0:07:27.177,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and then you can carve wood as well.

165
0:07:29.367,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So this was designed by my Head of Engineering.

166
0:07:31.995,000 --> 0:07:32,000
His name is Wachira,

167
0:07:33.487,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and when I hired him about two years ago,

168
0:07:36.215,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I asked him, "Just give me two years,

169
0:07:38.123,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and by the time you've trained a lot of people

170
0:07:40.329,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so that we have good staff under you,

171
0:07:42.378,000 --> 0:07:44,000
then you can move out and become a good story for us."

172
0:07:44.954,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And that's exactly what's just happened.

173
0:07:46.926,000 --> 0:07:48,000
He's got two types of customers.

174
0:07:49.22,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The higher-tier customer

175
0:07:51.848,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is a company that's actually using his machine

176
0:07:54.443,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to cut sheet metal for Isuzu truck fabrication in Nairobi,

177
0:07:58.301,000 --> 0:08:,000
which is being done by General Motors.

178
0:08:00.372,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So we're really proud to be able to say

179
0:08:02.277,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that we have an original equipment manufacturer in Nairobi

180
0:08:05.635,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that's provided what's effectively an industrial robot

181
0:08:08.406,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to supply parts for General Motors.

182
0:08:11.451,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Now this is really important --

183
0:08:12.993,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Applause)

184
0:08:15.774,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and it's really important because the population growth being what it is,

185
0:08:19.996,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a lot of very large companies are looking very closely

186
0:08:22.719,000 --> 0:08:24,000
at the market that's developing in Africa.

187
0:08:24.809,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So in Kenya right now, we have Volkswagen, Peugeot, Renault,

188
0:08:27.658,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we have Mercedes doing lorries,

189
0:08:29.227,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and we've also got Toyota, they've been there a long time.

190
0:08:31.994,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And these are all manufacturers planning to assemble vehicles

191
0:08:34.877,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and in the future, to manufacture in the country.

192
0:08:37.203,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Many of them are planning to train lots of people that they'd hire,

193
0:08:40.371,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and that's really important for the economy,

194
0:08:42.444,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but when the magic really happens,

195
0:08:44.101,000 --> 0:08:48,000
when these companies begin to buy their parts for the vehicles

196
0:08:48.126,000 --> 0:08:49,000
from local companies,

197
0:08:49.441,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so supply chain development is something that's very important

198
0:08:52.401,000 --> 0:08:55,000
for us to be able to pivot and to have very productive economies,

199
0:08:55.608,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and that's something we're focused on at our space.

200
0:08:58.799,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This other image shows another class of customer that he has.

201
0:09:02.602,000 --> 0:09:03,000
On the top left,

202
0:09:03.777,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you have these people who are actually using very crude tools

203
0:09:06.745,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to work metal and wood.

204
0:09:08.652,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And Kenya has a population of about 44 million people.

205
0:09:12.792,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The work force is about 13 million,

206
0:09:14.832,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and about 80 to 90 percent of those are in the informal sector.

207
0:09:18.42,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And what you're seeing in the image at the top left over there

208
0:09:21.381,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is very typical of semi-skilled artisans

209
0:09:25.048,000 --> 0:09:27,000
who are making products for the marketplace

210
0:09:27.636,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that are really crude.

211
0:09:28.823,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Their production rate is very slow.

212
0:09:30.748,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The quality of the product isn't high.

213
0:09:33.013,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And so we've teamed Wachira up with a bank,

214
0:09:36.061,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and the bank is paying him to train people from this sector

215
0:09:39.203,000 --> 0:09:4,000
on how to use this industrial robot.

216
0:09:42.131,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And the result is that some of them

217
0:09:44.624,000 --> 0:09:47,000
are going to be able to get loans to buy the machine for themselves.

218
0:09:48.609,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Others will be able to go to centers where they can carry their material,

219
0:09:52.132,000 --> 0:09:53,000
get the design done,

220
0:09:53.427,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and take the materials back that have been made really, really fast

221
0:09:56.951,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and assemble them in their own spaces.

222
0:09:58.833,000 --> 0:10:,000
So somebody making a gate, for example, out of metal,

223
0:10:01.642,000 --> 0:10:02,000
may take a week to make just one gate,

224
0:10:03.602,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but with this machine, they might make 10 in a day.

225
0:10:06.079,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So the productivity of a large swathe of our population

226
0:10:08.775,000 --> 0:10:12,000
should be able to jump by a quantum amount, quite significantly,

227
0:10:13.677,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because of this kind of machine.

228
0:10:15.256,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And that's what we're at the beginning of, so this is really very exciting.

229
0:10:19.35,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This is another person who uses our space.

230
0:10:21.415,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Her name is Esther.

231
0:10:22.59,000 --> 0:10:23,000
She's in her mid-20s,

232
0:10:23.765,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and she came in very passionate about a problem that she explained.

233
0:10:26.961,000 --> 0:10:29,000
She said that schools days are missed every month by young girls

234
0:10:30.367,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because of their menstrual cycle,

235
0:10:31.986,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and they're not able to buy a sanitary towel.

236
0:10:34.523,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And the reason that she described

237
0:10:36.579,000 --> 0:10:39,000
was that the manufacturers packaged these in bundles of seven to 10,

238
0:10:40.571,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and breaking it down is unhygienic at the retail level,

239
0:10:44.056,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and packaging each one of them is too expensive.

240
0:10:46.762,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So she thought up an idea, which is brilliant, and simple.

241
0:10:49.961,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Why don't we just use vending machines?

242
0:10:51.844,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And she, in a very clean environment, can break down the bundles

243
0:10:55.059,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and fill up the vending machines,

244
0:10:56.956,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and then girls can buy these sanitary towels

245
0:11:00.005,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in the privacy of a toilet, in a public space, in a school, and so on.

246
0:11:04.195,000 --> 0:11:06,000
She was able to pilot this and it worked really very well,

247
0:11:07.172,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and she's been able to sort of get the bugs out and so on.

248
0:11:09.912,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So the significance here is that the piloting process is possible.

249
0:11:13.397,000 --> 0:11:14,000
She's not an engineer.

250
0:11:14.654,000 --> 0:11:17,000
She was able to engage people in our space to be able to help her to do this,

251
0:11:18.311,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and she's off and running now with a business accelerator,

252
0:11:21.063,000 --> 0:11:22,000
so we expect to see great results.

253
0:11:22.728,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Applause)

254
0:11:25.829,000 --> 0:11:26,000
In this image you're looking at --

255
0:11:27.837,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the result of a master's project that was done at University of Nairobi

256
0:11:31.805,000 --> 0:11:32,000
by Tony Nyagah, an engineering student,

257
0:11:33.755,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and he just integrated a solar cell into a roof tile

258
0:11:36.886,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and decided to make it a business.

259
0:11:38.593,000 --> 0:11:4,000
He joined up with his sister who is an architect,

260
0:11:40.915,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and they have this business,

261
0:11:42.286,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and they present the roof tile to a person who is doing development and say,

262
0:11:45.976,000 --> 0:11:48,000
"You can buy it for the cost of just the roof tile without the solar."

263
0:11:49.575,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So they're giving it at a discount,

264
0:11:51.421,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and then they'll build them using the internet of things over time,

265
0:11:55.049,000 --> 0:11:59,000
they'll pay about a third of the utility charges for the electricity

266
0:11:59.243,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and they can sell the excess back to the grid.

267
0:12:02.22,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And so they'll make their money over time,

268
0:12:04.506,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and they've been able to do quite a few installments.

269
0:12:07.783,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We were very proud to be able to show this to somebody kind of famous,

270
0:12:11.863,000 --> 0:12:12,000
as you can see there,

271
0:12:13.538,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and this other famous guy actually presented the same idea,

272
0:12:16.523,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but as far as we're concerned, if it was after us, so --

273
0:12:19.168,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Laughter)

274
0:12:20.236,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

275
0:12:24.538,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So in closing, going forward, of course being able to prototype

276
0:12:28.784,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and do low manufacturing in this kind of a setting

277
0:12:31.18,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is very important for the industrialization process,

278
0:12:33.728,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but we're also taking advantage of a lot of new ways of doing things:

279
0:12:36.991,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the open source movement,

280
0:12:38.271,000 --> 0:12:4,000
distributive manufacturing, circular production.

281
0:12:40.587,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So it's all very important for not just industrializing

282
0:12:43.95,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and being able to meet people's needs,

283
0:12:45.785,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but also making sure that the environment is taken care of.

284
0:12:48.73,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We're also really interested in culture.

285
0:12:50.905,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We have lots of discussions in our space around who we were as Africans,

286
0:12:54.311,000 --> 0:12:55,000
who we are today, and who we want to be

287
0:12:56.247,000 --> 0:13:,000
vis-à-vis things like consumerism and ethnicity and corruption and so on.

288
0:13:00.745,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So we see ourselves as providing, adding value to people

289
0:13:04.588,000 --> 0:13:07,000
by teaching them to add value to things or materials

290
0:13:08.215,000 --> 0:13:1,000
so that they can build things that matter.

291
0:13:10.39,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Thank you very much for your attention.

292
0:13:12.273,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Applause)

293
0:13:15.208,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Thank you.

294
0:13:16.383,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Applause)

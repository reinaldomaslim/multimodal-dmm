1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It feels like we're all suffering

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
from information overload or data glut.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and that's using our eyes more.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So, visualizing information, so that we can see

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the patterns and connections that matter

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and then designing that information so it makes more sense,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or it tells a story,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or allows us to focus only on the information that's important.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So, let's see.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and this image arose

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
out of frustration I had

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
That is, they're meaningless without context:

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
500 billion for this pipeline,

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
20 billion for this war.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is visually and relatively.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So I scraped a load of reported figures

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
from various news outlets

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So purple is "fighting,"

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering."

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And what you can see straight away

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You can literally see them.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But more importantly, you start to see

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
patterns and connections between numbers

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Let me point out some that I really like.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here --

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
780 billion a year.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And this little pixel in the corner -- three billion --

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that's their climate change fund.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Americans, incredibly generous people --

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
over 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
compared with the amount of foreign aid

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
given by the top 17 industrialized nations

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
at 120 billion.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Then of course,

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
back in 2003.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to 3,000 billion.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So now it's great

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
by the debt that Africa owes to the West?

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Let's take a look.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So there it is:

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
227 billion is what Africa owes.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And the recent financial crisis,

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
how much of this diagram might that figure take up?

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Dooosh -- Which I think is the appropriate sound effect

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
for that much money:

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
11,900 billion.

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So, by visualizing this information,

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we turned it into a landscape

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that you can explore with your eyes,

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
a kind of map really, a sort of information map.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And when you're lost in information,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
an information map is kind of useful.

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So I want to show you another landscape now.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We need to imagine what a landscape

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of the world's fears might look like.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Let's take a look.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
This is Mountains Out of Molehills,

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
a timeline of global media panic.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So, I'll label this for you in a second.

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But the height here, I want to point out,

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is the intensity of certain fears

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
as reported in the media.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Let me point them out.

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So this, swine flu -- pink.

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Bird flu.

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
SARS -- brownish here. Remember that one?

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The millennium bug,

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
terrible disaster.

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
These little green peaks

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
are asteroid collisions.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And in summer, here, killer wasps.

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So these are what our fears look like

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
over time in our media.

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But what I love -- and I'm a journalist --

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that you can only see when you visualize it.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Let me highlight it for you.

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
See this line, this is a landscape for violent video games.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
As you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data,

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
twin peaks every year.

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
If we look closer, we see those peaks occur

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
at the same month every year.

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Why?

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Well, November, Christmas video games come out,

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content.

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But April isn't a particularly massive month

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for video games.

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Why April?

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Well, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting,

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and since then, that fear

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
has been remembered by the media

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You have retrospectives, anniversaries,

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
court cases, even copy-cat shootings,

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
all pushing that fear into the agenda.

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
See that gap there? There's a gap,

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and it affects all the other stories.

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Why is there a gap there?

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You see where it starts? September 2001,

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
when we had something very real

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to be scared about.

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year,

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I keep hearing a phrase

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
all the time, which is this:

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Data is the new oil."

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I would say that data is the new soil.

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Over the years, online,

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we've laid down

136
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
a huge amount of information and data,

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity,

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.

139
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.

140
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But it's a really fertile medium,

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But if you look at it directly,

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way,

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed.

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Let me show you this.

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Can you guess what this data set is?

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
What rises twice a year,

150
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
once in Easter

151
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and then two weeks before Christmas,

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
has a mini peak every Monday,

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and then flattens out over the summer?

154
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'll take answers.

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You might want to get some chocolate in.

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Any other guesses?

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.

159
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Yeah, retail therapy might help.

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Audience: Sick leave.)

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
DM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.

162
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Shall we see?

163
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Applause)

165
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, the information guru Lee Byron and myself,

166
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates

167
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
for the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up"

168
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and this is the pattern we found --

169
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
people clearing out for Spring Break,

170
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday,

172
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
being single over the summer,

173
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.

174
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Who would do that?

175
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So there's a titanic amount of data out there now,

176
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
unprecedented.

177
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But if you ask the right kind of question,

178
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or you work it in the right kind of way,

179
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
interesting things can emerge.

180
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful.

181
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful.

182
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And here's my visual C.V.

183
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I'm not quite sure I've succeeded.

184
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Pretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.

185
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But I wanted to convey something to you.

186
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I started as a programmer,

187
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,

188
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in print, online and then in advertising,

189
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and only recently have I started designing.

190
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And I've never been to design school.

191
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I've never studied art or anything.

192
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I just kind of learned through doing.

193
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And when I started designing,

194
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I discovered an odd thing about myself.

195
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I already knew how to design,

196
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,

197
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but more like I was sensitive

198
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to the ideas of grids and space

199
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and alignment and typography.

200
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It's almost like being exposed

201
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to all this media over the years

202
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.

203
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And I don't feel like I'm unique.

204
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I feel that everyday, all of us now

205
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
are being blasted by information design.

206
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's being poured into our eyes through the Web,

207
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and we're all visualizers now;

208
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we're all demanding a visual aspect

209
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to our information.

210
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
There's something almost quite magical about visual information.

211
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It's effortless, it literally pours in.

212
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And if you're navigating a dense information jungle,

213
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
coming across a beautiful graphic

214
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
or a lovely data visualization,

215
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle.

216
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I was curious about this, so it led me

217
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to the work of a Danish physicist

218
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
called Tor Norretranders,

219
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms.

220
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So here we go. This is your senses,

221
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
pouring into your senses every second.

222
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Your sense of sight is the fastest.

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.

224
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.

225
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And then you have hearing and smell,

226
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which has the throughput of a hard disk.

227
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And then you have poor old taste,

228
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,

230
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that's the amount we're actually aware of.

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So a lot of your vision --

232
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.

233
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's unconscious.

234
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The eye is exquisitely sensitive

235
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.

236
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful.

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's the language of the eye.

238
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind,

239
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which is about words and numbers and concepts,

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you start speaking two languages simultaneously,

241
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
each enhancing the other.

242
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.

243
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And that whole thing -- it's two languages

244
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
both working at the same time.

245
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So we can use this new kind of language, if you like,

246
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to alter our perspective or change our views.

247
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Let me ask you a simple question

248
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with a really simple answer:

249
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Who has the biggest military budget?

250
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It's got to be America, right?

251
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Massive. 609 billion in 2008 --

252
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
607, rather.

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So massive, in fact, that it can contain

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
all the other military budgets in the world inside itself.

255
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

256
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, you can see Africa's total debt there

257
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and the U.K. budget deficit for reference.

258
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So that might well chime

259
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
with your view that America

260
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is a sort of warmongering military machine,

261
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
out to overpower the world

262
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
with its huge industrial-military complex.

263
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But is it true that America has the biggest military budget?

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Because America is an incredibly rich country.

265
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
In fact, it's so massively rich

266
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that it can contain the four other

267
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
top industrialized nations' economies

268
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
inside itself, it's so vastly rich.

269
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.

270
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So, to be fair and to alter our perspective,

271
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we have to bring in another data set,

272
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and that data set is GDP, or the country's earnings.

273
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP?

274
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Let's have a look.

275
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
That changes the picture considerably.

276
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,

277
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and American drops into eighth.

278
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now you can also do this with soldiers.

279
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Who has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.

280
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Of course, 2.1 million.

281
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Again, chiming with your view

282
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that China has a militarized regime

283
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
ready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.

284
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But of course, China has an enormous population.

285
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So if we do the same,

286
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
we see a radically different picture.

287
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
China drops to 124th.

288
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It actually has a tiny army

289
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
when you take other data into consideration.

290
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So, absolute figures, like the military budget,

291
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in a connected world,

292
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
don't give you the whole picture.

293
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
They're not as true as they could be.

294
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We need relative figures that are connected to other data

295
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
so that we can see a fuller picture,

296
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and then that can lead to us changing our perspective.

297
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
As Hans Rosling, the master,

298
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
my master, said,

299
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"Let the dataset change your mindset."

300
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior.

301
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Take a look at this one.

302
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I'm a bit of a health nut.

303
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I love taking supplements and being fit,

304
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence.

305
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
There's always conflicting evidence.

306
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Should I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass?

307
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
This is a visualization of all the evidence

308
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
for nutritional supplements.

309
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This kind of diagram is called a balloon race.

310
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So the higher up the image,

311
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the more evidence there is for each supplement.

312
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits.

313
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So you can immediately apprehend

314
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the relationship between efficacy and popularity,

315
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but you can also, if you grade the evidence,

316
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
do a "worth it" line.

317
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So supplements above this line are worth investigating,

318
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but only for the conditions listed below,

319
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and then the supplements below the line

320
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
are perhaps not worth investigating.

321
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work.

322
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed,

323
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the biomedical database,

324
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and we compiled them and graded them all.

325
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And it was incredibly frustrating for me

326
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,

327
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and I spent a month doing this,

328
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and I only filled two pages.

329
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But what it points to

330
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
is that visualizing information like this

331
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is a form of knowledge compression.

332
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount

333
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of information and understanding

334
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
into a small space.

335
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data,

336
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and once it's there,

337
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
you can do cool stuff like this.

338
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
So I converted this into an interactive app,

339
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
so I can now generate this application online --

340
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
this is the visualization online --

341
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and I can say, "Yeah, brilliant."

342
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So it spawns itself.

343
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff

344
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that affects heart health."

345
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So let's filter that out.

346
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.

347
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics,

348
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I just want to see plants and --

349
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients."

350
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Now this app is spawning itself

351
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
from the data.

352
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The data is all stored in a Google Doc,

353
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and it's literally generating itself from that data.

354
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So the data is now alive; this is a living image,

355
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and I can update it in a second.

356
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet.

357
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Doosh! Again, the image recreates itself.

358
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So it's cool.

359
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It's kind of living.

360
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But it can go beyond data,

361
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and it can go beyond numbers.

362
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I like to apply information visualization

363
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to ideas and concepts.

364
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
This is a visualization

365
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
of the political spectrum,

366
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
an attempt for me to try

367
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and understand how it works

368
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and how the ideas percolate down

369
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
from government into society and culture,

370
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
into families, into individuals, into their beliefs

371
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and back around again in a cycle.

372
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
What I love about this image

373
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
is it's made up of concepts,

374
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it explores our worldviews

375
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and it helps us -- it helps me anyway --

376
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to see what others think,

377
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to see where they're coming from.

378
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that.

379
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
What was most exciting for me

380
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
designing this

381
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
was that, when I was designing this image,

382
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I desperately wanted this side, the left side,

383
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to be better than the right side --

384
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
being a journalist, a Left-leaning person --

385
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
but I couldn't, because I would have created

386
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
a lopsided, biased diagram.

387
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
So, in order to really create a full image,

388
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side

389
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
and at the same time, uncomfortably recognize

390
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
how many of those qualities were actually in me,

391
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
which was very, very annoying and uncomfortable.

392
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Laughter)

393
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But not too uncomfortable,

394
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
because there's something unthreatening

395
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
about seeing a political perspective,

396
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
versus being told or forced to listen to one.

397
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints

398
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
joyously when you can see them.

399
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
It's even fun to engage with them

400
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
because it's visual.

401
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So that's what's exciting to me,

402
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
seeing how data can change my perspective

403
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and change my mind midstream --

404
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
beautiful, lovely data.

405
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So, just to wrap up,

406
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I wanted to say

407
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
that it feels to me that design is about solving problems

408
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and providing elegant solutions,

409
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and information design is about

410
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
solving information problems.

411
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
It feels like we have a lot of information problems

412
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
in our society at the moment,

413
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
from the overload and the saturation

414
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
to the breakdown of trust and reliability

415
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,

416
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
or even just interestingness.

417
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I mean, I find information just too interesting.

418
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
It has a magnetic quality that draws me in.

419
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So, visualizing information

420
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.

421
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Even when the information is terrible,

422
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
the visual can be quite beautiful.

423
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Often we can get clarity

424
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
or the answer to a simple question very quickly,

425
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
like this one,

426
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
the recent Icelandic volcano.

427
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Which was emitting the most CO2?

428
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Was it the planes or the volcano,

429
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
the grounded planes or the volcano?

430
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
So we can have a look.

431
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
We look at the data and we see:

432
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Yep, the volcano emitted 150,000 tons;

433
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
the grounded planes would have emitted

434
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
345,000 if they were in the sky.

435
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
So essentially, we had our first carbon-neutral volcano.

436
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Laughter)

437
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
(Applause)

438
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And that is beautiful. Thank you.

439
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
(Applause)

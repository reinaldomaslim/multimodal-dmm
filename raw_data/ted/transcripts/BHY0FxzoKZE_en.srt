1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What if I told you there was something that you can do right now

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that would have an immediate, positive benefit for your brain

3
0:00:20.88,000 --> 0:00:22,000
including your mood and your focus?

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time

5
0:00:29.64,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and protect your brain from different conditions

6
0:00:32.32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
like depression, Alzheimer's disease or dementia.

7
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Would you do it?

8
0:00:37.96,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Yes!

9
0:00:39.2,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity.

10
0:00:43.72,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Simply moving your body,

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
has immediate, long-lasting and protective benefits for your brain.

12
0:00:51.96,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And that can last for the rest of your life.

13
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So what I want to do today is tell you a story

14
0:00:56.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience,

15
0:01:01.2,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as a professor of neuroscience,

16
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to essentially do an experiment on myself

17
0:01:05.8,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in which I discovered the science underlying

18
0:01:08.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
why exercise is the most transformative thing

19
0:01:12.72,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that you can do for your brain today.

20
0:01:15.36,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, as a neuroscientist, I know that our brains,

21
0:01:19.08,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that is the thing in our head right now,

22
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that is the most complex structure known to humankind.

23
0:01:27.28,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But it's one thing to talk about the brain,

24
0:01:29.96,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and it's another to see it.

25
0:01:31.88,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So here is a real preserved human brain.

26
0:01:34.76,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And it's going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today.

27
0:01:38.64,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The first is the prefrontal cortex, right behind your forehead,

28
0:01:42.92,000 --> 0:01:47,000
critical for things like decision-making, focus, attention and your personality.

29
0:01:49.36,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The second key area is located in the temporal lobe, shown right here.

30
0:01:53.64,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You have two temporal lobes in your brain, the right and the left,

31
0:01:56.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure

32
0:01:59.44,000 --> 0:02:,000
critical for your ability

33
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to form and retain new long-term memories for facts and events.

34
0:02:05.64,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And that structure is called the hippocampus.

35
0:02:08.8,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So I've always been fascinated with the hippocampus.

36
0:02:12.64,000 --> 0:02:16,000
How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment,

37
0:02:17.48,000 --> 0:02:19,000
say, your first kiss,

38
0:02:19.72,000 --> 0:02:22,000
or the moment your first child was born,

39
0:02:23.2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
can form a memory that has changed your brain,

40
0:02:26.28,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that lasts an entire lifetime?

41
0:02:28.64,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That's what I want to understand.

42
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells

43
0:02:35.8,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in the hippocampus

44
0:02:37.44,000 --> 0:02:39,000
as subjects were forming new memories.

45
0:02:39.64,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity,

46
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is how neurons communicate with each other,

47
0:02:47.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory, or did not.

48
0:02:52.96,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But a few years ago, I did something very unusual in science.

49
0:02:56.32,000 --> 0:02:58,000
As a full professor of neural science,

50
0:02:58.48,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I decided to completely switch my research program.

51
0:03:02.84,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Because I encountered something that was so amazing,

52
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with the potential to change so many lives

53
0:03:10.24,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that I had to study it.

54
0:03:11.52,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I discovered and I experienced the brain-changing effects of exercise.

55
0:03:18.36,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I did it in a completely inadvertent way.

56
0:03:21.56,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing --

57
0:03:25.4,000 --> 0:03:26,000
data was pouring in,

58
0:03:27.04,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work.

59
0:03:31.6,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And it should have been going great. It was, scientifically.

60
0:03:35.72,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But when I stuck my head out of my lab door,

61
0:03:39.68,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I noticed something.

62
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I had no social life.

63
0:03:43.4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I spent too much time listening to those brain cells

64
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in a dark room, by myself.

65
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:48.92,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I didn't move my body at all.

67
0:03:51.56,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I had gained 25 pounds.

68
0:03:54.32,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And actually, it took me many years to realize it,

69
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I was actually miserable.

70
0:03:58.64,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I shouldn't be miserable.

71
0:04:00.36,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I went on a river-rafting trip -- by myself, because I had no social life.

72
0:04:04.84,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And I came back --

73
0:04:06.12,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
thinking, "Oh, my God, I was the weakest person on that trip."

75
0:04:10.64,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I came back with a mission.

76
0:04:12.2,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I said, "I'm never going to feel like the weakest person

77
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:15,000
on a river-rafting trip again."

78
0:04:16.4,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And that's what made me go to the gym.

79
0:04:18.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I focused my type-A personality

80
0:04:21.92,000 --> 0:04:23,000
on going to all the exercise classes at the gym.

81
0:04:24.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I tried everything.

82
0:04:26.8,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I went to kickbox, dance, yoga, step class,

83
0:04:30.76,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and at first it was really hard.

84
0:04:32.92,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But what I noticed is that after every sweat-inducing workout that I tried,

85
0:04:37.92,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost.

86
0:04:41.84,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And that's what kept me going back to the gym.

87
0:04:44.6,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Well, I started feeling stronger.

88
0:04:47.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I started feeling better, I even lost that 25 pounds.

89
0:04:50.84,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And now, fast-forward a year and a half into this regular exercise program

90
0:04:56.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice.

91
0:05:00.04,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I was sitting at my desk, writing a research grant,

92
0:05:03.04,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and a thought went through my mind

93
0:05:05.12,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that had never gone through my mind before.

94
0:05:07.8,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And that thought was,

95
0:05:09.68,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"Gee, grant-writing is going well today."

96
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And all the scientists --

97
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:15.36,000 --> 0:05:17,000
yeah, all the scientists always laugh when I say that,

99
0:05:17.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because grant-writing never goes well.

100
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It is so hard; you're always pulling your hair out,

101
0:05:22.84,000 --> 0:05:25,000
trying to come up with that million-dollar-winning idea.

102
0:05:26.12,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But I realized that the grant-writing was going well,

103
0:05:29.4,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because I was able to focus and maintain my attention

104
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for longer than I had before.

105
0:05:35.8,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And my long-term memory -- what I was studying in my own lab --

106
0:05:40.8,000 --> 0:05:41,000
seemed to be better in me.

107
0:05:43.56,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And that's when I put it together.

108
0:05:45.64,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life

109
0:05:50.88,000 --> 0:05:51,000
was changing my brain.

110
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it.

111
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So as a curious neuroscientist,

112
0:05:56.8,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew

113
0:06:00.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
about the effects of exercise on the brain.

114
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature

115
0:06:06.8,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself.

116
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Better mood, better energy, better memory, better attention.

117
0:06:15.6,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And the more I learned,

118
0:06:17.8,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the more I realized how powerful exercise was.

119
0:06:21.2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Which eventually led me to the big decision

120
0:06:24.4,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to completely shift my research focus.

121
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And so now, after several years of really focusing on this question,

122
0:06:33.08,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I've come to the following conclusion:

123
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that exercise is the most transformative thing

124
0:06:39.52,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that you can do for your brain today

125
0:06:41.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for the following three reasons.

126
0:06:43.92,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Number one: it has immediate effects on your brain.

127
0:06:47.72,000 --> 0:06:49,000
A single workout that you do

128
0:06:49.76,000 --> 0:06:52,000
will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters

129
0:06:53.4,000 --> 0:06:56,000
like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline.

130
0:06:56.96,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That is going to increase your mood right after that workout,

131
0:07:00.24,000 --> 0:07:01,000
exactly what I was feeling.

132
0:07:01.84,000 --> 0:07:03,000
My lab showed that a single workout

133
0:07:04.32,000 --> 0:07:07,000
can improve your ability to shift and focus attention,

134
0:07:07.92,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours.

135
0:07:11.88,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And finally, studies have shown

136
0:07:13.52,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that a single workout will improve your reaction times

137
0:07:16.92,000 --> 0:07:17,000
which basically means

138
0:07:18.2,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks

139
0:07:21.56,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that falls off the counter,

140
0:07:23.32,000 --> 0:07:24,000
which is very, very important.

141
0:07:25.08,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after.

143
0:07:30.72,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What you have to do is do what I did,

144
0:07:32.56,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function,

145
0:07:36.6,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to get the long-lasting effects.

146
0:07:38.96,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And these effects are long-lasting

147
0:07:41.24,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because exercise actually changes the brain's anatomy,

148
0:07:45.68,000 --> 0:07:47,000
physiology and function.

149
0:07:48.36,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Let's start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus.

150
0:07:52.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The hippocampus --

151
0:07:53.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells,

152
0:07:58.24,000 --> 0:08:02,000
new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume,

153
0:08:02.92,000 --> 0:08:06,000
as well as improve your long-term memory, OK?

154
0:08:07.28,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And that including in you and me.

155
0:08:10.4,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Number two: the most common finding in neuroscience studies,

156
0:08:14.04,000 --> 0:08:16,000
looking at effects of long-term exercise,

157
0:08:16.68,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex.

158
0:08:21.08,000 --> 0:08:23,000
You not only get better focus and attention,

159
0:08:23.56,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well.

160
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And finally, you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise

161
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but those last for a long time.

162
0:08:33.84,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So you get long-lasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters.

163
0:08:39.92,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But really, the most transformative thing that exercise will do

164
0:08:44.52,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is its protective effects on your brain.

165
0:08:47.72,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Here you can think about the brain like a muscle.

166
0:08:50.6,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The more you're working out,

167
0:08:52.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets.

168
0:08:57.64,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Why is that important?

169
0:08:58.96,000 --> 0:09:,000
Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus

170
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases

171
0:09:07.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and normal cognitive decline in aging.

172
0:09:10.96,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So with increased exercise over your lifetime,

173
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
you're not going to cure dementia or Alzheimer's disease,

174
0:09:17.32,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but what you're going to do is you're going to create

175
0:09:19.84,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the strongest, biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex

176
0:09:22.52,000 --> 0:09:26,000
so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect.

177
0:09:27.56,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You can think of exercise, therefore,

178
0:09:30.36,000 --> 0:09:35,000
as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK?

179
0:09:35.8,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And it's even better, because it's free.

180
0:09:39.88,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So this is the point in the talk where everybody says,

181
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"That sounds so interesting, Wendy,

182
0:09:44.96,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but I really will only want to know one thing.

183
0:09:47.52,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And that is, just tell me the minimum amount of exercise

184
0:09:51.44,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I need to get all these changes."

185
0:09:53.32,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:54.36,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And so I'm going to tell you the answer to that question.

187
0:09:57.2,000 --> 0:10:01,000
First, good news: you don't have to become a triathlete to get these effects.

188
0:10:01.52,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise

189
0:10:06.08,000 --> 0:10:09,000
minimum 30 minutes an exercise session,

190
0:10:09.52,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and you want to get aerobic exercise in.

191
0:10:12.2,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That is, get your heart rate up.

192
0:10:14.2,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And the good news is, you don't have to go to the gym

193
0:10:16.72,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to get a very expensive gym membership.

194
0:10:18.76,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk.

195
0:10:22.48,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You see stairs -- take stairs.

196
0:10:24.96,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And power-vacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class

197
0:10:29.08,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that you were going to take at the gym.

198
0:10:31.8,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So I've gone from memory pioneer

199
0:10:35.88,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to exercise explorer.

200
0:10:37.68,000 --> 0:10:4,000
From going into the innermost workings of the brain,

201
0:10:41.52,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function,

202
0:10:45.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and my goal in my lab right now

203
0:10:48.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you --

204
0:10:51.76,000 --> 0:10:52,000
three to four times a week, 30 minutes.

205
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription

206
0:10:58.92,000 --> 0:11:01,000
for you, at your age, at your fitness level,

207
0:11:02.92,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for your genetic background,

208
0:11:04.84,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to maximize the effects of exercise today

209
0:11:08.64,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best

210
0:11:13.96,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for the rest of your life.

211
0:11:15.76,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But it's one thing to talk about exercise, and it's another to do it.

212
0:11:19.84,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I'm going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor,

213
0:11:23.6,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to ask you all to stand up.

214
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

215
0:11:27.08,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We're going to do just one minute of exercise.

216
0:11:29.36,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's call-and-response, just do what I do, say what I say,

217
0:11:32.88,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and make sure you don't punch your neighbor, OK?

218
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Music!

219
0:11:37.28,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Upbeat music)

220
0:11:38.92,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Five, six, seven, eight, it's right, left, right, left.

221
0:11:43.44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And I say, I am strong now.

222
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Let's hear you.

223
0:11:49.4,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Audience: I am strong now.

224
0:11:52.44,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Wendy Suzuki: Ladies, I am Wonder Woman-strong.

225
0:11:56.12,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Let's hear you!

226
0:11:57.36,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong.

227
0:12:00.28,000 --> 0:12:02,000
WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left.

228
0:12:02.92,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I am inspired now. You say it!

229
0:12:06.84,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Audience: I am inspired now.

230
0:12:10.2,000 --> 0:12:13,000
WS: Last move -- pull it down, right and left, right and left.

231
0:12:14.12,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I say, I am on fire now! You say it.

232
0:12:18.92,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Audience: I am on fire now.

233
0:12:22.24,000 --> 0:12:24,000
WS: And done! OK, good job!

234
0:12:24.76,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause)

235
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Thank you.

236
0:12:31.64,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I want to leave you with one last thought.

237
0:12:34.44,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And that is, bringing exercise in your life

238
0:12:37.92,000 --> 0:12:41,000
will not only give you a happier, more protective life today,

239
0:12:42.92,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases.

240
0:12:47.52,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life

241
0:12:52.68,000 --> 0:12:53,000
for the better.

242
0:12:53.92,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Thank you very much.

243
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

244
0:12:58.44,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Thank you.

245
0:12:59.68,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it comes in a male form, too --

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
very glamorous.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
there actually is a little wine in there --

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and of course, always wears a tuxedo.

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but also comes in other forms.

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
A magazine?

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well, it's certainly not this one.

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Sex tips are not glamorous.

17
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,

18
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is not glamorous either.

19
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But there is a glamour of industry.

20
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is Margaret Bourke-White's --

21
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
one of her pictures she did.

22
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Fantastic, glamorous pictures

23
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.

24
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And there's the mythic glamour

25
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
of the garage entrepreneur.

26
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.

27
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We know everyone who starts a business in a garage

28
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
ends up founding Hewlett-Packard.

29
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
There's the glamour of physics.

30
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,

31
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --

32
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
he has other kinds of glamour.

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And there is, of course, this glamour.

34
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --

35
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and not the alien-style glamour,

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but the nice, clean, early '60s version.

37
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So what do we mean by glamour?

38
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means

39
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is you can look in the dictionary.

40
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,

41
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in this case the 1913 dictionary.

42
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,

43
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.

44
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You had "a" glamour.

45
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."

46
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Glamour was a literal magic spell.

47
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,

48
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies

49
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and to some extent, Celtic magic.

50
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,

51
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it started to take on this other kind of deception --

52
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,

53
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.

54
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But still, glamour is an illusion.

55
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Glamour is a magic spell.

56
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And there's something dangerous about glamour

57
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell

58
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
on you, it was not in your self-interest --

59
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it was to get you to act against your interest.

60
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Well of course, in the 20th century,

61
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.

62
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And this is Hedy Lamarr.

63
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,

64
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)

65
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --

66
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.

67
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement

68
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
associated with creating this Hollywood glamour.

69
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.

70
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood

71
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors

72
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.

73
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something

74
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.

75
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --

76
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
they call them false color.

77
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Glamour is a form of falsification,

78
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.

79
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.

80
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And it involves a great deal of technique.

81
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's not -- glamour is not something --

82
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.

83
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.

84
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"

85
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it's not just the case for people.

86
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Glamour doesn't have to be people.

87
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Architectural photography --

88
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,

89
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.

90
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.

91
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It puts you into this special, special world.

92
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is Alex Ross's comic book art,

93
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which appears to be extremely realistic,

94
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.

95
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.

96
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
When you stack people in rows,

97
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --

98
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but not in the world of glamour.

99
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb

100
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in the table of contents of New York magazine,

101
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which was telling us that glamour is back --

102
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
glamour is all about transcending the everyday.

103
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And I think that that's starting to get at what the core

104
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that combines all sorts of glamour is.

105
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.

106
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And I don't know who she is either,

107
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.

108
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's a very glamorous portrait.

109
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Why is it glamorous?

110
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --

111
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but that does not make you glamorous,

112
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that only makes you beautiful.

113
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,

114
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and those are the central qualities of glamour.

115
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.

116
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
She's not looking away from you exactly,

117
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but you have to mentally imagine her world.

118
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world

119
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil

120
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.

121
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.

122
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
That's glamour:

123
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus

124
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and they're both awfully happy and pleasant.

125
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Glamour invites us to live in a different world.

126
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --

127
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that's why, often in these glamour shots,

128
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the person is not looking at the audience,

129
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it's why sunglasses are glamorous --

130
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.

131
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In some sense, there has to be something like us.

132
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.

133
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,

134
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
omniscient -- too far above us.

135
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary

136
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.

137
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,

138
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but it has to have this transcendent quality.

139
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What is it about Superman?

140
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,

141
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.

142
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Glamour is all about transcending this world

143
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and getting to an idealized, perfect place.

144
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And this is one reason that modes of transportation

145
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
tend to be extremely glamorous.

146
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The less experience we have with them,

147
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the more glamorous they are.

148
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,

149
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.

150
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.

151
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The notion is that it's going to transport you,

152
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,

153
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.

154
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The story is about where you're arriving,

155
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
or thinking about where you're arriving.

156
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And this sense of being transported

157
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is one reason that we have glamour styling.

158
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous

159
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
because we associate it with movies of that period, but because,

160
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.

161
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.

162
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.

163
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.

164
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous

165
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because, to me, it captures the whole promise

166
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of the academic contemplative life --

167
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.

168
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,

169
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
city streets -- not so glamorous.

170
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.

171
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.

172
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --

173
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
except, possibly, multiple horizons.

174
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --

175
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you just see the possibilities.

176
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality

177
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione

178
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."

179
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,

180
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
after a few centuries.

181
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.

182
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It makes things look effortless.

183
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --

184
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
she just looks completely natural.

185
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,

186
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.

187
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Of course, they covered that with make-up,

188
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --

189
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.

190
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":

191
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.

192
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Glamour is about editing.

193
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
How do you create the sense of transcendence,

194
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the sense of evoking a perfect world?

195
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --

196
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.

197
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We don't tell you all the grubby details.

198
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.

199
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This is underneath Jeff's desk.

200
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is what the real world of computers,

201
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.

202
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But if you look in a catalog --

203
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --

204
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
it looks like this.

205
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There are no cords.

206
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --

207
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.

208
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,

209
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)

210
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop

211
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,

212
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
you don't get to live in the world without cords.

213
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.

214
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And there she is -- Grace.

215
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.

216
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"

217
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?

218
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.

219
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Here's Hedy Lamarr again.

220
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous

221
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.

222
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Translucence is glamorous --

223
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that's why all these people wear pearls.

224
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --

225
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
not transparent, not opaque.

226
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It invites us into the world

227
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.

228
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,

229
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,

230
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.

231
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It has that sense of going up and away,

232
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and yet you never think about how you would really trip

233
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
if you were -- particularly going down.

234
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.

235
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure

236
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but glamour's really partly about meaning.

237
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
All individuals and all cultures have ideals

238
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that cannot possibly be realized in reality.

239
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
They have contradictions,

240
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --

241
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose

242
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to our lives as cultures and as individuals.

243
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And the way we deal with that is we displace them --

244
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,

245
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
an age of heroes, the world to come.

246
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.

247
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The white picket fence, the perfect house.

248
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.

249
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.

250
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,

251
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the perfect diamond ring.

252
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The perfect getaway in your perfect car.

253
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.

254
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The perfect office --

255
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
again, no cords, as far as I can tell.

256
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.

257
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I mean, there's no paper on the desk.

258
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
We want this golden world.

259
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And some people get rich enough,

260
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,

261
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
they get to acquire their perfect world.

262
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --

263
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.

264
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.

265
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?

266
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?

267
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Is it something important?

268
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.

269
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.

270
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It was criticized for glamorizing violence,

271
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,

272
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things

273
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that are impossible in the real world.

274
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.

275
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.

276
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.

277
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
You know, we're marching toward Utopia.

278
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.

279
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
Because what they're doing is they're saying,

280
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.

281
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But actually, what's even more important

282
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
than remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?

283
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.

284
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.

285
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
This is from "Triumph Of The Will" --

286
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
brilliant editing to cut together things.

287
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
There's a glamour shot.

288
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
National Socialism is all about glamour.

289
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It was a very aesthetic ideology.

290
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,

291
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and ridding it of anything unglamorous.

292
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So glamour can be dangerous.

293
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.

294
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I'm not against glamour.

295
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.

296
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour

297
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and a way to broaden your appreciation of it.

298
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice

299
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and confront the manipulation of it all,

300
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,

301
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
but also enjoy how it happens.

302
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And here's Hedy Lamarr.

303
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.

304
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,

305
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
even though she thought she could look stupid.

306
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this

307
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about

308
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,

309
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
which only took a fraction of a second to happen.

310
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There is a book out in the bookstore --

311
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
it's called "Symphony In Steel,"

312
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.

313
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And that has a fascination.

314
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.

315
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
There's a wonderful book called "Crowns"

316
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.

317
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,

318
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.

319
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.

320
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But I also knew how hard they worked all week.

321
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."

322
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour

323
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
when you realize what went into creating it.

324
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Thank you.

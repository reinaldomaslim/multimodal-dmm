1
0:00:13.101,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, I'm a climate scientist,

2
0:00:16.341,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and if this room is representative of the country we live in,

3
0:00:21.743,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that means about 60 percent of you, so maybe from about there over,

4
0:00:26.258,000 --> 0:00:3,000
don't strongly trust me for information on the causes of climate change.

5
0:00:32.312,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, I promise to tell the truth tonight,

6
0:00:34.399,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but just to humor that demographic,

7
0:00:37.305,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've started this talk with a falsehood.

8
0:00:39.567,000 --> 0:00:41,000
[The Paris Climate Accord is a product of the recognition

9
0:00:42.345,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that climate change is a global problem ...]

10
0:00:44.383,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This statement was not made by President Obama.

11
0:00:46.598,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It was made by President Reagan,

12
0:00:48.185,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and it wasn't about climate change and the Paris Climate Accord.

13
0:00:51.395,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It was actually about the Montreal Protocol

14
0:00:53.638,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and stratospheric ozone depletion.

15
0:00:57.512,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now, I'm sure that many of you aren't familiar with this environmental problem,

16
0:01:01.757,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but you should be,

17
0:01:03.122,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because it's a rare environmental success story.

18
0:01:06.816,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And it's worth revisiting,

19
0:01:08.757,000 --> 0:01:11,000
because sometimes, we need to examine the world we've avoided

20
0:01:12.313,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in order to find guidance for the choices we make today.

21
0:01:16.9,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So let's go back to the 1970s,

22
0:01:19.48,000 --> 0:01:21,000
when some questionable choices were made:

23
0:01:22.314,000 --> 0:01:26,000
first of all -- hoo -- hairstyles. (Laughs)

24
0:01:27.171,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Second of all, objectively terrible quantities of hairspray,

25
0:01:31.319,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and third, CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons,

26
0:01:36.412,000 --> 0:01:4,000
man-made chemicals that were used as propellant in aerosol spray cans.

27
0:01:41.749,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And see, it turns out these CFCs were a problem

28
0:01:44.837,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because they were destroying the ozone layer.

29
0:01:47.706,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Now I'm sure most of you have heard of the ozone layer,

30
0:01:50.326,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but why does it matter?

31
0:01:51.792,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Well, quite simply, the ozone layer is earth's sunscreen,

32
0:01:56.426,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and it's really fragile.

33
0:01:58.955,000 --> 0:01:59,000
If you could take all of the ozone,

34
0:02:00.678,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which is mostly about 10 to 20 miles up above our heads,

35
0:02:03.864,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and compress it down to the surface of the earth,

36
0:02:06.79,000 --> 0:02:09,000
it would form a thin shell only about two pennies thick,

37
0:02:10.263,000 --> 0:02:12,000
about an eighth of an inch.

38
0:02:12.356,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And that thin shell does an amazing amount of work, though.

39
0:02:15.811,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It filters out more than 90 percent of the harmful UV radiation

40
0:02:21.096,000 --> 0:02:22,000
coming from the sun.

41
0:02:23.162,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And while I'm sure many of you enjoy that suntan that you get

42
0:02:28.543,000 --> 0:02:31,000
from the remaining 10 percent, it causes a lot of problems:

43
0:02:32.368,000 --> 0:02:33,000
cataracts,

44
0:02:34.754,000 --> 0:02:35,000
damage to crops,

45
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
damage to immune systems

46
0:02:38.627,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and also skin cancer.

47
0:02:40.952,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's not an exaggeration

48
0:02:42.247,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to say that a threat to the ozone layer is a threat to human safety.

49
0:02:47.54,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And actually, ironically, it was human safety

50
0:02:50.391,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that motivated the invention of CFCs in the first place.

51
0:02:53.691,000 --> 0:02:55,000
You see, in the early days of refrigeration,

52
0:02:55.882,000 --> 0:02:58,000
refrigerators used toxic and flammable chemicals

53
0:02:59.548,000 --> 0:03:,000
like propane and ammonia.

54
0:03:01.905,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For good reason, the refrigeration industry

55
0:03:03.99,000 --> 0:03:04,000
wanted a safe alternative,

56
0:03:05.56,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and they found that in 1928,

57
0:03:07.826,000 --> 0:03:09,000
when a scientist named Thomas Midgley

58
0:03:10.104,000 --> 0:03:13,000
synthesized the first commercially viable CFCs.

59
0:03:14.143,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And in fact, Midgley famously inhaled CFCs and blew out a candle

60
0:03:20.248,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to demonstrate, at a scientific conference,

61
0:03:22.892,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that they were safe and nonflammable.

62
0:03:25.336,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And in fact, as a scientist, I can tell you there is no way

63
0:03:28.122,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you could get away with that kind of antic today.

64
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I mean, wow.

65
0:03:33.084,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But really, at the time,

66
0:03:34.974,000 --> 0:03:37,000
CFCs were a really remarkable invention.

67
0:03:38.949,000 --> 0:03:41,000
They allowed what we now know as modern-day refrigeration

68
0:03:42.196,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and air-conditioning and other things.

69
0:03:44.677,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So it wasn't actually until over 40 years later, in the 1970s,

70
0:03:50.415,000 --> 0:03:54,000
when scientists realized that CFCs would break down high in the atmosphere

71
0:03:55.137,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and damage the ozone layer.

72
0:03:57.467,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And this finding really set off a lot of public concern.

73
0:04:00.141,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It led, ultimately, to the banning of CFC usage in aerosol spray cans

74
0:04:05.313,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the US and a few other countries in 1978.

75
0:04:09.788,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now, the story doesn't end there,

76
0:04:11.407,000 --> 0:04:14,000
because CFCs were used in much more than just spray cans.

77
0:04:15.684,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In 1985, scientists discovered the Antarctic ozone hole,

78
0:04:20.905,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and this was a truly alarming discovery.

79
0:04:23.903,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Scientists did not expect this at all.

80
0:04:28.21,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Before the Antarctic ozone hole,

81
0:04:29.818,000 --> 0:04:32,000
scientists expected maybe a five or 10 percent reduction

82
0:04:33.619,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in ozone over a century.

83
0:04:35.675,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But what they found over the course of less than a decade

84
0:04:40.2,000 --> 0:04:44,000
was that more than a third of the ozone had simply vanished,

85
0:04:44.611,000 --> 0:04:46,000
over an area larger than the size of the US.

86
0:04:48.645,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And although we now know that CFCs are the root cause of this ozone hole,

87
0:04:52.707,000 --> 0:04:54,000
at the time, the science was far from settled.

88
0:04:56.105,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Yet despite this uncertainty,

89
0:04:59.141,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the crisis helped spur nations to act.

90
0:05:02.74,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So that quote that I started this talk with,

91
0:05:06.377,000 --> 0:05:08,000
about the Montreal Protocol, from President Reagan --

92
0:05:09.357,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that was his signing statement when he signed the Montreal Protocol

93
0:05:13.208,000 --> 0:05:16,000
after its unanimous ratification by the US Senate.

94
0:05:17.03,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And this is something that's truly worth celebrating.

95
0:05:19.571,000 --> 0:05:23,000
In fact, yesterday was the 30th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol.

96
0:05:24.477,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

97
0:05:30.761,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Because of the protocol,

98
0:05:32.527,000 --> 0:05:36,000
ozone-depleting substances are now declining in our atmosphere,

99
0:05:36.908,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and we're starting to see the first signs of healing in the ozone layer.

100
0:05:41.118,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And furthermore, because many of those ozone-depleting substances

101
0:05:45.142,000 --> 0:05:47,000
are also very potent greenhouse gases,

102
0:05:47.884,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the Montreal Protocol has actually delayed global warming

103
0:05:50.686,000 --> 0:05:51,000
by more than a decade.

104
0:05:52.628,000 --> 0:05:53,000
That's just wonderful.

105
0:05:54.728,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But I think it's worth asking the question,

106
0:05:59.225,000 --> 0:06:02,000
as we face our current environmental crisis, global warming,

107
0:06:02.851,000 --> 0:06:04,000
what lessons can we learn from Montreal?

108
0:06:05.25,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Are there any? I think there are.

109
0:06:08.765,000 --> 0:06:12,000
First, we don't need absolute certainty to act.

110
0:06:13.742,000 --> 0:06:14,000
When Montreal was signed,

111
0:06:15.478,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we were less certain then of the risks from CFCs

112
0:06:19.543,000 --> 0:06:23,000
than we are now of the risks from greenhouse gas emissions.

113
0:06:25.116,000 --> 0:06:28,000
A common tactic that people who oppose climate action use

114
0:06:28.918,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is to completely ignore risk and focus only on uncertainty.

115
0:06:33.648,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But so what about uncertainty?

116
0:06:35.937,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We make decisions in the face of uncertainty all the time,

117
0:06:39.54,000 --> 0:06:4,000
literally all the time.

118
0:06:41.518,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You know, I'll bet those of you who drove here tonight,

119
0:06:45.982,000 --> 0:06:46,000
you probably wore your seat belt.

120
0:06:48.807,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And so ask yourself,

121
0:06:50.039,000 --> 0:06:52,000
did you wear your seat belt because someone told you

122
0:06:52.652,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with a hundred percent [certainty]

123
0:06:54.583,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that you would get in a car crash on the way here?

124
0:06:57.711,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Probably not.

125
0:06:59.159,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So that's the first lesson.

126
0:07:01.501,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Risk management and decision making always have uncertainty.

127
0:07:05.494,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Ignoring risk and focusing only on uncertainty is a distraction.

128
0:07:10.372,000 --> 0:07:13,000
In other words, inaction is an action.

129
0:07:16.767,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Second, it takes a village to raise a healthy environment.

130
0:07:22.869,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The Montreal Protocol wasn't just put together by industry and governments

131
0:07:26.932,000 --> 0:07:29,000
or environmental advocacy groups and scientists.

132
0:07:30.927,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It was put together by all of them.

133
0:07:32.663,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They all had a seat at the table,

134
0:07:35.09,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and they all played an important role in the solution.

135
0:07:38.039,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I think in this regard,

136
0:07:39.414,000 --> 0:07:41,000
we're actually seeing some encouraging signs today.

137
0:07:41.82,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We see not just environmental groups concerned about climate change

138
0:07:46.434,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but also civic and religious groups,

139
0:07:49.048,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the military and businesses.

140
0:07:52.744,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So wherever you find yourself on that spectrum,

141
0:07:55.591,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we need you at the table,

142
0:07:57.319,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because if we're going to solve global warming,

143
0:07:59.535,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it's going to take actions at all levels,

144
0:08:01.619,000 --> 0:08:03,000
from the individual to the international

145
0:08:04.337,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and everything in between.

146
0:08:08.621,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Third lesson:

147
0:08:10.673,000 --> 0:08:12,000
don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

148
0:08:14.39,000 --> 0:08:19,000
While Montreal has become the brake pedal for stopping ozone depletion,

149
0:08:19.674,000 --> 0:08:22,000
at its beginning, it was more just like a tap on the brakes.

150
0:08:24.524,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It was actually the later amendments to the protocol

151
0:08:27.878,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that really marked the decision to hit the brakes on ozone depletion.

152
0:08:33.061,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So to those who despair

153
0:08:34.467,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that the Paris Climate Accord didn't go far enough

154
0:08:37.824,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or that your limited actions on their own won't solve global warming,

155
0:08:42.804,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I say don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

156
0:08:48.439,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And finally, I think it helps us to contemplate the world we've avoided.

157
0:08:54.742,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Indeed, the world we have avoided by enacting the Montreal Protocol

158
0:09:00.534,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is one of catastrophic changes

159
0:09:02.744,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to our environment and to human well-being.

160
0:09:05.846,000 --> 0:09:11,000
By the 2030s, we'll be avoiding millions of new skin cancer cases per year

161
0:09:12.11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
with a number that would only grow.

162
0:09:15.549,000 --> 0:09:19,000
If I'm lucky, I'll live long enough to see the end of this animation

163
0:09:19.979,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and to see the ozone hole restored to its natural state.

164
0:09:24.573,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So as we write the story for earth's climate future

165
0:09:27.926,000 --> 0:09:28,000
for this century and beyond,

166
0:09:29.434,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we need to ask ourselves, what will our actions be

167
0:09:32.919,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so that someone can stand on this stage

168
0:09:35.285,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in 30 or 50 or a hundred years

169
0:09:39.769,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to celebrate the world that they've avoided.

170
0:09:43.22,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Thank you.

171
0:09:44.395,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Applause)

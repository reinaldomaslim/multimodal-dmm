1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I didn't bring a human brain,

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And bone marrow is actually what we use

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and some other diseases.

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.

12
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
who is a volunteer donor.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of a child with leukemia.

16
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?

17
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,

18
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and another doctor across from me.

19
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you know, not too big.

21
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And the way we do this is we basically

22
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
place this through the soft tissue,

23
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and kind of punch it into the hard bone,

24
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --

25
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,

26
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
each time, with a syringe.

27
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.

28
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.

29
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
About 200 times usually.

30
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,

31
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
let alone Bob,

32
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
whose rear end looks something more like this,

33
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
like Swiss cheese.

34
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.

35
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And there is probably a better way to do this.

36
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,

37
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.

38
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is it.

39
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.

40
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Our standard see-through patient.

41
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times,

42
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.

43
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And we have a flexible, powered catheter

44
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow

45
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.

46
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,

47
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.

48
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.

49
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
No robots required.

50
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,

51
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and do this harvest as an outpatient.

52
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.

53
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And played around with this a little bit.

54
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And our team members developed this technology.

55
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.

56
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,

57
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but we got 10 times the stem cell activity

58
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.

59
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.

60
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.

61
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.

62
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.

63
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells

64
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
than the standard approach done on the same patient.

65
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.

66
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You all know about embryonic stem cells.

67
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.

68
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Adult stem cells are throughout our body,

69
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,

70
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy

71
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
for over 40 years.

72
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use

73
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases

74
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
such as heart disease, vascular disease,

75
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
orthopedics, tissue engineering,

76
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
even in neurology to treat Parkinson's

77
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and diabetes.

78
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,

79
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.

80
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,

81
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which translates to better outcomes.

82
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It may encourage more people to sign up to be

83
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
potential live-saving bone marrow donors.

84
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It may even enable you to bank

85
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,

86
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to use in the future should you need it.

87
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our

88
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
bone marrow transplant survivors,

89
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.

90
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Hopefully this technology will let us

91
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
have more of these survivors in the future.

92
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Thanks.

93
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Applause)

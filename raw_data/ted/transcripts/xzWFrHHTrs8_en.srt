1
0:00:12.515,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want you to travel back in time with me,

2
0:00:17.667,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to the before time, to 2017.

3
0:00:21.167,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I don't know if you can remember it,

4
0:00:22.917,000 --> 0:00:23,000
dinosaurs were roaming the earth.

5
0:00:24.833,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was a security researcher,

6
0:00:26.583,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I had spent about five or six years

7
0:00:29.375,000 --> 0:00:32,000
doing research on the ways in which APTs,

8
0:00:32.458,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which is short for advanced persistent threats,

9
0:00:37.417,000 --> 0:00:4,000
which stands for nation-state actors,

10
0:00:40.708,000 --> 0:00:44,000
spy on journalists and activists

11
0:00:44.75,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and lawyers and scientists

12
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and just generally people who speak truth to power.

13
0:00:50.708,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And I'd been doing this for a while

14
0:00:53.125,000 --> 0:00:57,000
when I discovered that one of my fellow researchers,

15
0:00:57.417,000 --> 0:00:59,000
with whom I had been doing this all this time,

16
0:01:00.167,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was allegedly a serial rapist.

17
0:01:06.542,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So the first thing that I did

18
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
was I read a bunch of articles about this.

19
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And in January of 2018,

20
0:01:15.042,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I read an article with some of his alleged victims.

21
0:01:20.125,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And one of the things that really struck me about this article

22
0:01:24.25,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is how scared they were.

23
0:01:26.083,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They were really frightened,

24
0:01:27.792,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they had, you know, tape over the cameras on their phones

25
0:01:32.958,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and on their laptops,

26
0:01:34.25,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and what they were worried about was that he was a hacker

27
0:01:37.125,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and he was going to hack into their stuff

28
0:01:39.102,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and he was going to ruin their lives.

29
0:01:41.292,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And this had kept them silent for a really long time.

30
0:01:44.5,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So, I was furious.

31
0:01:49.375,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I didn't want anyone to ever feel that way again.

32
0:01:52.917,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So I did what I usually do when I'm angry:

33
0:01:55.833,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I tweeted.

34
0:01:57.125,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:59.333,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the thing that I tweeted

36
0:02:00.792,000 --> 0:02:03,000
was that if you are a woman who has been sexually abused by a hacker

37
0:02:04.792,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and that hacker has threatened to break into your devices,

38
0:02:08.25,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that you could contact me

39
0:02:09.917,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and I would try to make sure

40
0:02:11.833,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that your device got a full, sort of, forensic look over.

41
0:02:16.625,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And then I went to lunch.

42
0:02:19.125,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:21.958,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Ten thousand retweets later,

44
0:02:23.667,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:25.125,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I had accidentally started a project.

46
0:02:30.208,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So every morning, I woke up and my mailbox was full.

47
0:02:34.542,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It was full of the stories of men and women

48
0:02:40.375,000 --> 0:02:44,000
telling me the worst thing that had ever happened to them.

49
0:02:45.25,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I was contacted by women who were being spied on by men,

50
0:02:50.042,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by men who were being spied on by men,

51
0:02:52.292,000 --> 0:02:54,000
by women who were being spied on by women,

52
0:02:54.417,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but the vast majority of the people contacting me

53
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
were women who had been sexually abused by men

54
0:03:00.833,000 --> 0:03:02,000
who were now spying on them.

55
0:03:03.292,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The one particularly interesting case

56
0:03:05.125,000 --> 0:03:07,000
involved a man who came to me,

57
0:03:07.167,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because his boyfriend had outed him as gay

58
0:03:12.292,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to his extremely conservative Korean family.

59
0:03:15.542,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So this is not just men-spying-on-women issue.

60
0:03:22.292,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And I'm here to share

61
0:03:25.458,000 --> 0:03:27,000
what I learned from this experience.

62
0:03:28.833,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What I learned is that data leaks.

63
0:03:32.208,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's like water.

64
0:03:34.167,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It gets in places you don't want it.

65
0:03:35.917,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Human leaks.

66
0:03:37.208,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Your friends give away information about you.

67
0:03:39.375,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Your family gives away information about you.

68
0:03:42.292,000 --> 0:03:43,000
You go to a party,

69
0:03:43.583,000 --> 0:03:46,000
somebody tags you as having been there.

70
0:03:46.708,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And this is one of the ways

71
0:03:48.333,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in which abusers pick up information about you

72
0:03:50.5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that you don't otherwise want them to know.

73
0:03:52.542,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It is not uncommon for abusers to go to friends and family

74
0:03:57.958,000 --> 0:04:,000
and ask for information about their victims

75
0:04:01.125,000 --> 0:04:04,000
under the guise of being concerned about their "mental health."

76
0:04:05.25,000 --> 0:04:08,000
A form of leak that I saw

77
0:04:08.5,000 --> 0:04:11,000
was actually what we call account compromise.

78
0:04:11.958,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So your Gmail account,

79
0:04:14.917,000 --> 0:04:16,000
your Twitter account,

80
0:04:17.583,000 --> 0:04:19,000
your Instagram account,

81
0:04:19.833,000 --> 0:04:21,000
your iCloud,

82
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
your Apple ID,

83
0:04:23.667,000 --> 0:04:24,000
your Netflix, your TikTok --

84
0:04:25.292,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I had to figure out what a TikTok was.

85
0:04:28.417,000 --> 0:04:29,000
If it had a login,

86
0:04:30.333,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I saw it compromised.

87
0:04:33.125,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And the reason for that is because your abuser is not always your abuser.

88
0:04:37.792,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It is really common for people in relationships to share passwords.

89
0:04:42.25,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Furthermore, people who are intimate,

90
0:04:44.875,000 --> 0:04:45,000
who know a lot about each other,

91
0:04:46.458,000 --> 0:04:48,000
can guess each other's security questions.

92
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Or they can look over each other's shoulders

93
0:04:50.583,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to see what code they're using in order to lock their phones.

94
0:04:53.583,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They frequently have physical access to the phone,

95
0:04:56.25,000 --> 0:04:58,000
or they have physical access to the laptop.

96
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And this gives them a lot of opportunity

97
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to do things to people's accounts,

98
0:05:06.333,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which is very dangerous.

99
0:05:08.167,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The good news is that we have advice

100
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:13,000
for people to lock down their accounts.

101
0:05:13.458,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This advice already exists, and it comes down to this:

102
0:05:17.458,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Use strong, unique passwords for all of your accounts.

103
0:05:23.542,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Use more strong, unique passwords

104
0:05:26.792,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as the answers to your security questions,

105
0:05:30.042,000 --> 0:05:33,000
so that somebody who knows the name of your childhood pet

106
0:05:33.917,000 --> 0:05:34,000
can't reset your password.

107
0:05:36.542,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And finally, turn on the highest level of two-factor authentication

108
0:05:41.042,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that you're comfortable using.

109
0:05:43.208,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So that even if an abuser manages to steal your password,

110
0:05:47.25,000 --> 0:05:49,000
because they don't have the second factor,

111
0:05:49.333,000 --> 0:05:51,000
they will not be able to log into your account.

112
0:05:52.083,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The other thing that you should do

113
0:05:54.292,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is you should take a look at the security and privacy tabs

114
0:05:59.708,000 --> 0:06:,000
for most of your accounts.

115
0:06:01.042,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Most accounts have a security or privacy tab

116
0:06:03.292,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that tells you what devices are logging in,

117
0:06:07.417,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and it tells you where they're logging in from.

118
0:06:10.083,000 --> 0:06:11,000
For example, here I am,

119
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:13,000
logging in to Facebook from the La Quinta,

120
0:06:13.708,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where we are having this meeting,

121
0:06:15.304,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and if for example,

122
0:06:17.292,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I took a look at my Facebook logins

123
0:06:19.583,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and I saw somebody logging in from Dubai,

124
0:06:22.208,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I would find that suspicious,

125
0:06:24.208,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because I have not been to Dubai in some time.

126
0:06:28.125,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But sometimes, it really is a RAT.

127
0:06:31.042,000 --> 0:06:34,000
If by RAT you mean remote access tool.

128
0:06:34.167,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And remote access tool

129
0:06:37.25,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is essentially what we mean when we say stalkerware.

130
0:06:41.958,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So one of the reasons why getting full access to your device

131
0:06:45.667,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is really tempting for governments

132
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is the same reason why getting full access to your device

133
0:06:50.917,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is tempting for abusive partners and former partners.

134
0:06:57.042,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We carry tracking devices around in our pockets all day long.

135
0:07:01.167,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We carry devices that contain all of our passwords,

136
0:07:04.833,000 --> 0:07:06,000
all of our communications,

137
0:07:07.208,000 --> 0:07:09,000
including our end-to-end encrypted communications.

138
0:07:09.875,000 --> 0:07:12,000
All of our emails, all of our contacts,

139
0:07:13.125,000 --> 0:07:16,000
all of our selfies are all in one place,

140
0:07:16.75,000 --> 0:07:19,000
often our financial information is also in this place.

141
0:07:20.292,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And so, full access to a person’s phone

142
0:07:23.417,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is the next best thing to full access to a person's mind.

143
0:07:28.375,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And what stalkerware does is it gives you this access.

144
0:07:33.583,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So, you may ask, how does it work?

145
0:07:37.583,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The way stalkerware works

146
0:07:39.208,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is that it's a commercially available program,

147
0:07:42.958,000 --> 0:07:45,000
which an abuser purchases,

148
0:07:46.5,000 --> 0:07:48,000
installs on the device that they want to spy on,

149
0:07:49.5,000 --> 0:07:5,000
usually because they have physical access

150
0:07:51.5,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or they can trick their target into installing it themselves,

151
0:07:56.833,000 --> 0:07:57,000
by saying, you know,

152
0:07:58.125,000 --> 0:08:01,000
"This is a very important program you should install on your device."

153
0:08:01.833,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And then they pay the stalkerware company

154
0:08:06.125,000 --> 0:08:08,000
for access to a portal,

155
0:08:08.917,000 --> 0:08:11,000
which gives them all of the information from that device.

156
0:08:12.208,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And you're usually paying something like 40 bucks a month.

157
0:08:15.583,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So this kind of spying is remarkably cheap.

158
0:08:21.875,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Do these companies know

159
0:08:23.5,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that their tools

160
0:08:28.25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
are being used as tools of abuse?

161
0:08:30.708,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Absolutely.

162
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
If you take a look at the marketing copy for Cocospy,

163
0:08:34.833,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which is one of these products,

164
0:08:36.375,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it says right there on the website

165
0:08:39.542,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that Cocospy allows you to spy on your wife with ease,

166
0:08:43.375,000 --> 0:08:45,000
"You do not have to worry about where she goes,

167
0:08:45.625,000 --> 0:08:47,000
who she talks to or what websites she visits."

168
0:08:48.583,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So that's creepy.

169
0:08:50.583,000 --> 0:08:53,000
HelloSpy, which is another such product,

170
0:08:54.167,000 --> 0:08:58,000
had a marketing page in which they spent most of their copy

171
0:08:58.833,000 --> 0:08:59,000
talking about the prevalence of cheating

172
0:09:00.833,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and how important it is to catch your partner cheating,

173
0:09:03.542,000 --> 0:09:06,000
including this fine picture of a man

174
0:09:06.583,000 --> 0:09:08,000
who has clearly just caught his partner cheating

175
0:09:09.083,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and has beaten her.

176
0:09:10.375,000 --> 0:09:12,000
She has a black eye, there is blood on her face.

177
0:09:12.917,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And I don't think that there is really a lot of question

178
0:09:17.042,000 --> 0:09:21,000
about whose side HelloSpy is on in this particular case.

179
0:09:21.958,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And who they're trying to sell their product to.

180
0:09:26.625,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It turns out that if you have stalkerware on your computer or on your phone,

181
0:09:32.625,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it can be really difficult to know whether or not it's there.

182
0:09:36.667,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And one of the reasons for that

183
0:09:38.25,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is because antivirus companies

184
0:09:40.875,000 --> 0:09:46,000
often don't recognize stalkerware as malicious.

185
0:09:47.5,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They don't recognize it as a Trojan

186
0:09:49.792,000 --> 0:09:52,000
or as any of the other stuff that you would normally find

187
0:09:52.875,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that they would warn you about.

188
0:09:54.417,000 --> 0:09:57,000
These are some results from earlier this year from VirusTotal.

189
0:09:58.25,000 --> 0:10:,000
I think that for one sample that I looked at

190
0:10:00.958,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I had something like a result of seven out of 60

191
0:10:05.667,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of the platforms recognized the stalkerware that I was testing.

192
0:10:09.083,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And here is another one where I managed to get 10,

193
0:10:12.583,000 --> 0:10:13,000
10 out of 61.

194
0:10:14.25,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So this is still some very bad results.

195
0:10:19.5,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I have managed to convince a couple of antivirus companies

196
0:10:23.375,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to start marking stalkerware as malicious.

197
0:10:26.542,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So that all you have to do

198
0:10:27.833,000 --> 0:10:29,000
if you're worried about having this stuff on your computer

199
0:10:30.625,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is you download the program,

200
0:10:33.708,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you run a scan and it tells you

201
0:10:36.125,000 --> 0:10:39,000
"Hey, there's some potentially unwanted program on your device."

202
0:10:39.792,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It gives you the option of removing it,

203
0:10:42.125,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but it does not remove it automatically.

204
0:10:44.083,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And one of the reasons for that

205
0:10:45.625,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is because of the way that abuse works.

206
0:10:47.542,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Frequently, victims of abuse aren't sure

207
0:10:50.792,000 --> 0:10:52,000
whether or not they want to tip off their abuser

208
0:10:53.292,000 --> 0:10:54,000
by cutting off their access.

209
0:10:55.083,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Or they're worried that their abuser is going to escalate to violence

210
0:11:01.208,000 --> 0:11:03,000
or perhaps even greater violence

211
0:11:03.542,000 --> 0:11:05,000
than they've already been engaging in.

212
0:11:07.917,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Kaspersky was one of the very first companies

213
0:11:10.167,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that said that they were going to start taking this seriously.

214
0:11:13.458,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And in November of this year,

215
0:11:16.583,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they issued a report in which they said

216
0:11:18.667,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that since they started tracking stalkerware among their users

217
0:11:23.042,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that they had seen an increase of 35 percent.

218
0:11:29.708,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Likewise, Lookout came out with a statement

219
0:11:32.917,000 --> 0:11:35,000
saying that they were going to take this much more seriously.

220
0:11:36.083,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And finally, a company called Malwarebytes also put out such a statement

221
0:11:40.792,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and said that they had found 2,500 programs

222
0:11:45.333,000 --> 0:11:46,000
in the time that they had been looking,

223
0:11:47.25,000 --> 0:11:49,000
which could be classified as stalkerware.

224
0:11:50.875,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Finally, in November I helped to launch a coalition

225
0:11:56.708,000 --> 0:11:59,000
called the Coalition Against Stalkerware,

226
0:11:59.792,000 --> 0:12:03,000
made up of academics,

227
0:12:04.208,000 --> 0:12:07,000
people who are doing this sort of thing on the ground --

228
0:12:07.333,000 --> 0:12:13,000
the practitioners of helping people to escape from intimate partner violence --

229
0:12:13.667,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and antivirus companies.

230
0:12:16.083,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And our goal is both to educate people about these programs,

231
0:12:21.75,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but also to convince the antivirus companies

232
0:12:25.25,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to change the norm

233
0:12:26.958,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in how they act around this very scary software,

234
0:12:32.292,000 --> 0:12:34,000
so that soon, if I get up in front of you

235
0:12:35.042,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and I talk to you about this next year,

236
0:12:37.333,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I could tell you that the problem has been solved,

237
0:12:40.167,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and all you have to do is download any antivirus

238
0:12:42.917,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and it is considered normal for it to detect stalkerware.

239
0:12:47.083,000 --> 0:12:48,000
That is my hope.

240
0:12:48.917,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thank you very much.

241
0:12:50.25,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Applause)

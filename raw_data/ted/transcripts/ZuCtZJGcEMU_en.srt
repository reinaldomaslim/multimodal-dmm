1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I guess the story actually has to start

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
maybe back in the the 1960s,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
when I was seven or eight years old,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with my mask and flippers on.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because that's all there was to look at.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And by the time I turned 16,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I pursued a career in marine science,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in exploration and diving,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for 30 days total.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
operated by the Japanese government.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And Sylvia Earle and I

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
were on an expedition in this submarine

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
20 years ago in Japan.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to an area that I thought

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But when I got there, I found

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
lots of plastic garbage and other debris.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And it was really a turning point in my life,

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
where I started to realize

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I needed to put it into a context.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I needed to head towards conservation goals.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So I began to work

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with National Geographic Society and others

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and led expeditions to Antarctica.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Ten years ago was a seminal trip,

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
where we explored that big iceberg, B-15,

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And we developed techniques

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to dive inside and under the iceberg,

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
such as heating pads on our kidneys

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
with a battery that we dragged around,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it would get a little boost of warmth

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
before going back into our bodies.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But after three trips to Antarctica,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And that same year, 10 years ago,

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I headed north to the Phoenix Islands.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You may have seen this in other forms,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but the top line is the amount of protected area

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
on land, globally,

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and it's about 12 percent.

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
around the 1960s and '70s,

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And that's probably because

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that's when everybody got aware of the environment

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and Earth Day

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But the ocean-protected area

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is basically flat line

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up.

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of the protected area in the ocean.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
if we could see what happens in the ocean

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
like we can see what happens on land.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and we can't see what's going on.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And therefore we're way behind on protection.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But scuba diving, submersibles

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and all the work that we're setting about to do here

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
will help rectify that.

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So where are the Phoenix Islands?

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They were the world's largest marine-protected area

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
up until last week

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when the Chagos Archipelago was declared.

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it's five days from Fiji,

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's out in the middle of the Pacific,

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
right around the Equator.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They've never been dived."

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I said, "Yeah.

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But tell me where they are and the country that owns them."

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
So that's when I first learned of the Islands

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and had no idea what I was getting into.

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But I was in for the adventure.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's a very deep-water part of our planet.

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The average depths are about 12,000 ft.

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which are specifically part of the protected area.

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Seamounts are important for biodiversity.

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's an interesting fact.

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space,

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
very deep three-dimensional space

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
with herds of tuna, whales,

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
all kinds of deep sea marine life

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
like we've seen here before.

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That's the vessel that we took up there

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for these studies, early on,

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They're very low to the water,

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and they're all uninhabited, except one island

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
has about 35 caretakers on it.

117
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And they've been uninhabited for most of time

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because even in the ancient days,

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
these islands were too far away

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for those ancient Polynesian mariners

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that were traversing the Pacific so widely.

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But we got up there,

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to get to a place that had never been dived

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive?

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Let's try there,"

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and then falling into the water.

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Both my personal and my professional life changed.

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Suddenly, I saw a world

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that I had never seen before in the ocean --

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
schools of fish that were so dense

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
coral reefs that were continuous

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and solid and colorful,

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
large fish everywhere,

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
manta rays.

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning --

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You can see the fish are balled up

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and then there's a little cloudy area there

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction --

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
events that the ocean is supposed to do,

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but struggles to do in many places now

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
because of human activity.

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
are very important for tuna fisheries,

149
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location.

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives,

152
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
up to 150 sharks at once,

153
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
which is an indication

154
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of a very, very healthy, very strong, system.

155
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So I thought the scenes

156
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of never-ending wilderness

157
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
would go on forever,

158
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but they did finally come to an end.

159
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well --

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
very important bird nesting site,

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And we finished our trip.

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And that's the area again.

164
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands --

165
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that pop out of the water.

166
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.

167
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.

168
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands?

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Where do these exist?

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in three island groups.

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands.

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands,

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which is the subject that I'm talking about.

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands.

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's the largest atoll nation in the world.

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And they have

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
about 110,000 people

180
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
spread out over 33 islands.

181
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and that's between one and two percent

183
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of all the ocean water on the planet.

184
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And when I was first going up there,

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,

186
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and people would ask me,

187
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And it reminded me of that old joke

189
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?"

191
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And he says, "cause that's where all the money is."

192
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?

193
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Because that's where all the ocean is."

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They basically are one nation

195
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that controls most of the equatorial waters

196
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of the Central Pacific Ocean.

197
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They're also a country

198
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that is in dire danger.

199
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Sea levels are rising,

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,

201
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
will be under water within 50 to 100 years

202
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
due to climate change

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion

204
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the melting of freshwater into the ocean.

205
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The Islands rise only one to two meters

206
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
above the surface.

207
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Some of the islands have already gone under water.

208
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And these nations are faced with a real problem.

209
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We as a world are faced with a problem.

210
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
who no longer have a home on the planet?

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The president of the Maldives

213
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
conducted a mock cabinet meeting

214
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
underwater recently

215
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to highlight the dire straits of these countries.

216
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So it's something we need to focus on.

217
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
But back to the Phoenix Islands,

218
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which is the subject of this Talk.

219
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
After I got back, I said,

220
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
okay, this is amazing, what we found.

221
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati,

222
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
who are over in Tarawa,

223
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the westernmost group.

224
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So I started contacting them --

225
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because they had actually given me a permit to do this --

226
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found."

227
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And for some reason they didn't want me to come,

228
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,

229
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but finally they said, "Okay, you can come.

230
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But if you come, you have to buy lunch

231
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
for everybody who comes to the seminar."

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.

233
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Just get whatever anybody wants."

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,

235
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and we presented for two hours

236
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.

237
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.

238
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.

239
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me

240
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and he said, "Greg, do you realize

241
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that you are the first scientist

242
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
who has ever come back

243
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and told us what they did?"

244
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
He said, "We often issue these permits

245
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to do research in our waters,

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but usually we get a note two or three years later,

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
or a reprint.

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.

249
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.

250
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And are you free for dinner?"

251
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And I was free for dinner,

252
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.

253
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And over the course of dinner,

254
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue --

255
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it's a very poor country --

256
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but it gains what revenue is has

257
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
by selling access to foreign nations

258
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to take fish out of its waters,

259
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because Kiribati does not have the capacity

260
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to take the fish itself.

261
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And the deal that they strike

262
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is the extracting country

263
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
gives Kiribati five percent

264
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of the landed value.

265
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So if the United States

266
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
removes a million dollars'

267
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
worth of lobsters from a reef,

268
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars.

269
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.

270
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So I asked the Minister over dinner,

271
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I said, "Would you consider a situation

272
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
where you would still get paid --

273
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is --

274
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but you leave fish and the sharks

275
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and the shrimp in the water?"

276
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
He stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that

277
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to deal with our overfishing problem,

278
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license."

279
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
He coined the term "reverse fishing license."

280
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'"

281
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So we walked away from this dinner

282
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
really not knowing where to go at that point.

283
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I went back to the States and started looking around

284
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to see if I could find examples

285
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
where reverse fishing licenses

286
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
had been issued,

287
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and it turned out there were none.

288
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
There were no oceanic deals

289
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
where countries were compensated for not fishing.

290
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It had occurred on land,

291
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in rainforests of South America and Africa,

292
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
where landowners had been paid

293
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
not to cut the trees down.

294
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals.

295
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So I went to Conservation International

296
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and brought them in as a partner

297
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and went through the process

298
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
of valuing the fishery resource,

299
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,

300
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
what the range of the fishes were,

301
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
brought in a whole bunch of other partners --

302
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the government of Australia,

303
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the government of New Zealand, the World Bank.

304
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
The Oak Foundation and National Geographic

305
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
have been big funders of this as well.

306
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And we basically founded the park

307
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
on the idea of an endowment

308
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees

309
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to this very poor country

310
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to keep the area intact.

311
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Halfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati,

312
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
President Anote Tong.

313
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
He's a really important leader,

314
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
a real visionary, forward-thinking man,

315
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and he told me two things when I approached him.

316
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
He said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.

317
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
One is, remember I'm a politician,

318
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
so you've got to go out and work with my ministers

319
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.

320
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Secondly, I'd like you to create principles

321
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that will transcend my own presidency.

322
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I don't want to do something like this

323
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office."

324
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So we had very strong leadership, very good vision

325
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.

326
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Many, many steps were taken to pull this off.

327
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And it was primarily because Kiribati realized

328
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that this was in their own self-interest to do this.

329
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They realized that this was a common cause

330
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that they had found

331
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
with the conservation community.

332
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Then in 2002,

333
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
when this was all going full-swing,

334
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.

335
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Here's this resource that we're looking to save,

336
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and it turns out it's the hottest heating event

337
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that we can find on record.

338
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes,

339
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and the hot spot formed and stalled

340
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.

341
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months

342
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and it basically killed

343
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
60 percent of the coral.

344
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,

345
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.

346
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,

347
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.

348
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Well, the good news is it's recovered

349
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and recovering fast,

350
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
faster than any reef we've seen.

351
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago

352
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
when we returned to the Phoenix Islands

353
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and discovered that, because it is a protected area

354
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and has healthy fish populations

355
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that keep the algae grazed down

356
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and keep the rest of the reef healthy,

357
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
the coral is booming, is just booming back.

358
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It's almost like if a person

359
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
has multiple diseases,

360
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
it's hard to get well, you might die,

361
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.

362
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And that's the story with climate-change heating.

363
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's the only threat,

364
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the only influence that the reef had to deal with.

365
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,

366
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and the reef is on a full-bore recovery.

367
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago

368
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner

369
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and said, "Well, I think that the conservation community

370
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
might embrace this idea, Minister."

371
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
He paused and put his hands together and said,

372
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
"Yes, Greg,

373
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but the devil will be in the details," he said.

374
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And it certainly was.

375
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The last 10 years have been detail after detail

376
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
ranging from creating legislation

377
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
to multiple research expeditions

378
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to communication plans,

379
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
as I said, teams of lawyers,

380
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
MOUs,

381
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.

382
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.

383
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities

384
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
at its current state while we raise the endowment.

385
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.

386
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So it's a fully functional

387
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
up-and-running entity

388
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.

389
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license

390
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and pays the country for this.

391
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So it's a very solid, very well thought-out,

392
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
very well grounded system,

393
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and it was a bottom-up system,

394
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and that was very important with this work,

395
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
from the bottom up to secure this.

396
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So the conditions for success here are listed.

397
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
You can read them yourselves.

398
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
But I would say the most important one in my mind

399
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
was working within the market forces

400
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
of the situation.

401
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And that insured that we could move this forward

402
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati

403
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
as well as the self-interest of the world.

404
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And I'll leave you with one final slide,

405
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that is: how do we scale this up?

406
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
How do we realize Sylvia's dream?

407
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Where eventually do we take this?

408
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Here's the Pacific

409
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
with large MPAs

410
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and large conservation zones on it.

411
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And as you can see,

412
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we have a patchwork across this ocean.

413
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I've just described to you the one story

414
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
behind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,

415
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
but every other green patch on that

416
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
has its own story.

417
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And what we need to do now

418
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
is look at the whole Pacific Ocean

419
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
in its entirety

420
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and make a network of MPAs

421
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
across the Pacific

422
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
so that we have our world's largest ocean

423
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
protected and self-sustaining

424
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
over time.

425
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

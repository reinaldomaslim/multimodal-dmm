1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Welcome to Thailand.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the country was very, very poor

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We decided to do something about it,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but we didn't begin with a welfare program

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or a poverty reduction program.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But we began with a family-planning program,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
following a very successful

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
maternal child health activity,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
sets of activities.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So basically, no one would accept family planning

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
if their children didn't survive.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and then follow up with family planning.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now let me take you back

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
as to why we needed to do it.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In my country, that was the case in 1974.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Seven children per family --

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
There was just no future.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We needed to reduce the population growth rate.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So we said, "Let's do it."

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and we had very, very few doctors.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We didn't take no as an answer;

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we took no as a question.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and did a fantastic job

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
at explaining how to use the pill.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That was wonderful,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but it covered only 20 percent of the country.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What do we do for the other 80 percent --

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
No, we decided to do a bit more.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Actually, below that yellow sign --

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I wish they hadn't wiped that,

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because there was "Coca-Cola" there.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And no difference,

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
the people they chose were the people we chose.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They were well-known in the community,

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
they knew that customers were always right,

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So they could supply pills and condoms

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
throughout the country, in every village of the country.

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So there we are. We went to the people

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
who were seen as the cause of the problem

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to be the solution.

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Wherever there were people --

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and you can see boats with the women, selling things --

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
here's the floating market

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
selling bananas and crabs

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and also contraceptives --

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
wherever you find people,

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And then we decided, why not get to religion

61
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because in the Philippines,

62
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the Catholic Church was pretty strong,

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and Thai people were Buddhist.

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
holding a bowl of holy water

67
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for the monk to sprinkle holy water

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
on pills and condoms

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
for the sanctity of the family.

70
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And this picture was sent throughout the country.

71
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's been blessed."

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That was their perception.

75
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And then we went to teachers.

76
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
You need everybody to be involved

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in trying to provide whatever it is

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that make humanity a better place.

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So we went to the teachers.

80
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,

82
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I for IUD, V for vasectomy.

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.

85
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.

86
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Very good, mother. Move ahead.

87
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.

88
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."

89
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Again, education, class entertainment.

91
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And the kids were doing it in school too.

92
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We had relay races with condoms,

93
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we had children's condom-blowing championship.

94
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And before long,

95
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the condom was know as the girl's best friend.

96
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --

97
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so the condom is the girl's best friend.

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975,

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the women who organized it said,

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"We only want to lend

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to women who practice family planning.

102
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.

103
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And that was run by them.

105
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And after 35/36 years,

106
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
it's still going on.

107
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's a part of the Village Development Bank;

108
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.

109
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And we didn't need a big organization to run it --

110
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it was run by the villagers themselves.

111
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,

112
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it's always women, women, women, women.

113
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And then we thought we'd help America,

114
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because America's been helping everyone,

115
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
whether they want help or not.

116
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

117
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And this is on the Fourth of July.

118
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men,

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but in particular, American men to the front of the queue,

120
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
right up to the Ambassador's residence

121
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
during his vin d'honneur.

122
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --

123
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
very appropriate room.

124
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And since it was near lunch time,

126
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.

127
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Of course, it must be American cola.

128
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.

129
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."

130
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.

131
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm

133
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
who worked for the USAID.

134
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy

135
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.

136
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.

137
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."

138
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And what happened?

140
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In all this thing,

141
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
from seven children to 1.5 children,

142
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.

143
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --

144
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it was exactly the same thing.

145
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,

146
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but we're good friends.

147
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And so that's the case of everyone joining in.

148
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.

149
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
But it's everybody's job

150
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
who can change attitude and behavior.

151
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand,

152
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we had to stop doing a lot of good things

153
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to fight AIDS.

154
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.

155
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So our work wasn't affected.

156
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."

157
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So I went to the military

158
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.

159
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They have more than the government,

160
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and they've got more guns than the government.

161
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So I asked them, could they help us

162
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in our fight against HIV.

163
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And after I gave them statistics,

164
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."

165
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And that's when we went onto the airwaves.

166
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.

167
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"

168
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.

169
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So I said, "Okay."

170
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee

171
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and increased the budget fifty-fold.

172
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --

173
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
everyone -- and we said the public, institutions,

174
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
religious institutions, schools --

175
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
everyone was involved.

176
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And here, every media person

177
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
had to be trained for HIV.

178
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And we gave every station half a minute extra

179
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for advertising to earn more money.

180
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So they were happy with that.

181
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then AIDS education in all schools,

182
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
starting from university.

183
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.

184
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,

185
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and they were terrific.

186
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV

187
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
were known as Mother Theresa.

188
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And then we went down one more step.

189
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --

190
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
going to every household in the village,

191
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
every household in the whole of Thailand,

192
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
giving AIDS information and a condom

193
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to every household,

194
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
given by these young kids.

195
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,

196
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and this was a lifesaver.

197
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."

198
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So you have the companies also realizing

199
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.

200
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So they all trained.

201
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And then we have this Captain Condom,

202
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
with his Harvard MBA,

203
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
going to schools and night spots.

204
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.

205
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In every country, every program, you need a symbol,

206
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.

207
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

208
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets --

209
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
everywhere, everywhere.

210
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In taxis, you get condoms.

211
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And also, in traffic,

212
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.

213
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

214
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?

215
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;

216
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I see them standing around right now, everywhere.

217
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Imagine if they had condoms,

218
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
giving out to all sorts of people.

219
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And then, new change,

220
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we had hair bands, clothing

221
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and the condom for your mobile phone

222
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
during the rainy season.

223
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

224
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And these were the condoms that we introduced.

225
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
One says, "Weapon of mass protection."

226
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We found --

227
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,

228
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.

229
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And then it says here, with the American flag,

230
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"Don't leave home without it."

231
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But I have some to give out afterward.

232
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,

233
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
so be very careful.

234
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

235
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And so you can see

236
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that condoms can do so many things.

237
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Look at this --

238
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.

239
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Stop global warming; use condoms.

240
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you --

241
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the weapon of mass protection.

242
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And let the next Olympics save some lives.

243
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Why just run around?

244
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

245
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And then finally,

246
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,

247
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."

248
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

249
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor

250
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to make life better for the people.

251
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,

252
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because alcohol impairs judgment.

253
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And then what happened?

254
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
After all this time, everybody joined in.

255
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
According to the U.N.,

256
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
new cases of HIV

257
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
declined by 90 percent,

258
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and according to the World Bank,

259
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
7.7 million lives were saved.

260
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.

261
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.

262
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.

263
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
There was political commitment, some financial commitment,

264
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and everybody joined in the fight.

265
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.

266
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
We all need to help.

267
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And then we decided to help people out of poverty,

268
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --

269
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
this time, not with government alone,

270
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but in cooperation with the business community.

271
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Because poor people are business people

272
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
who lack business skills and access to credit.

273
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Those are the things to be provided by the business community.

274
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,

275
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
little business people.

276
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.

277
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So, that was done.

278
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The money goes from the company into the village

279
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
via tree-planting.

280
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's not a free gift.

281
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,

282
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
which we call the Village Development Bank.

283
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Everybody joins in,

284
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and they feel they own the bank,

285
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because they have brought the money in.

286
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.

287
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And we believe if you want to help the poor,

288
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
those who are living in poverty,

289
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
access to credit must be a human right.

290
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Access to credit must be a human right.

291
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.

292
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.

293
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA,"

294
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
teaching people how to do business

295
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.

296
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
These are some of the businesses:

297
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
mushrooms, crabs, vegetables,

298
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
trees, fruits,

299
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;

300
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
this is a village sponsored by Nike.

301
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.

302
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Make these better, because we can afford them."

303
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And then we have silk, Thai silk.

304
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,

305
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.

306
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So anyone sitting in and watching TV,

307
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
get in touch with me.

308
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --

309
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
"Coffee and Condoms."

310
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.

311
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
That's the difference.

312
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks

313
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that you can also get condoms?

314
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.

315
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And then now, finally in education,

316
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we want to change the school as being underutilized

317
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.

318
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.

319
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And it's a center, a focal point

320
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
for economic and social development.

321
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Re-do the school,

322
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
make it serve the community needs.

323
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And here is a bamboo building --

324
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
all of them are bamboo.

325
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.

326
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud

327
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to see a bamboo geodesic dome.

328
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And we use vegetables around the school ground,

329
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
so they raise their own vegetables.

330
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And then, finally, I firmly believe,

331
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
if we want the MDGs to work --

332
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the Millennium Development Goals --

333
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we need to add family planning to it.

334
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --

335
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
everyone needs family planning service --

336
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it's underutilized.

337
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.

338
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And we also ask the next Olympics

339
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to be involved in saving lives.

340
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And then, finally, that is our network.

341
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And these are our Thai tulips.

342
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

343
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Thank you very much indeed.

344
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

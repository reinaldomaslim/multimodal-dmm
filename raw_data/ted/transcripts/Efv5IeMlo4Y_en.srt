1
0:00:13.429,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to tell you a love story.

2
0:00:16.19,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But it doesn't have a happy ending.

3
0:00:19.333,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Once upon a time, I was a stubborn five-year-old

4
0:00:23.053,000 --> 0:00:26,000
who decided to become a marine biologist.

5
0:00:26.527,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Thirty-four years, 400 scuba dives and one PhD later,

6
0:00:31.014,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'm still completely enamored with the ocean.

7
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I spent a decade working with fishing communities

8
0:00:37.411,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in the Caribbean,

9
0:00:38.617,000 --> 0:00:4,000
counting fish, interviewing fishermen,

10
0:00:41.036,000 --> 0:00:44,000
redesigning fishing gear and developing policy.

11
0:00:44.957,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I've been helping to figure out what sustainable management can look like

12
0:00:49.036,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for places where food security, jobs and cultures

13
0:00:52.704,000 --> 0:00:53,000
all depend on the sea.

14
0:00:55.538,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In the midst of all this, I fell in love.

15
0:00:59.628,000 --> 0:01:,000
With a fish.

16
0:01:01.675,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reefs,

17
0:01:05.311,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but the ones I just can't get out of my head

18
0:01:08.564,000 --> 0:01:09,000
are parrotfish.

19
0:01:10.093,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Parrotfish live on coral reefs all over the world,

20
0:01:12.665,000 --> 0:01:13,000
there are 100 species,

21
0:01:14.458,000 --> 0:01:15,000
they can grow well over a meter long

22
0:01:16.288,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and weigh over 20 kilograms,

23
0:01:17.935,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but that's the boring stuff.

24
0:01:20.101,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish.

25
0:01:24.815,000 --> 0:01:26,000
First, they have a mouth like a parrot's beak,

26
0:01:27.339,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which is strong enough to bite coral,

27
0:01:29.141,000 --> 0:01:31,000
although mostly they're after algae.

28
0:01:31.696,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They are the lawn mowers of the reef.

29
0:01:33.911,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This is key, because many reefs are overgrown with algae

30
0:01:37.724,000 --> 0:01:4,000
due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer

31
0:01:41.033,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that runs off of land.

32
0:01:42.842,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And there just aren't enough herbivores like parrotfish

33
0:01:45.526,000 --> 0:01:46,000
left out on the reefs

34
0:01:46.724,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to mow it all down.

35
0:01:48.932,000 --> 0:01:5,000
OK, second amazing thing.

36
0:01:51.314,000 --> 0:01:56,000
After all that eating, they poop fine white sand.

37
0:01:56.83,000 --> 0:01:59,000
A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms

38
0:02:00.663,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of this pulverized coral each year.

39
0:02:03.371,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Sometimes, when scuba diving,

40
0:02:04.98,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I would look up from my clipboard

41
0:02:06.919,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and just see contrails of parrotfish poop raining down.

42
0:02:11.76,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So next time you're lounging on a tropical white-sand beach,

43
0:02:16.226,000 --> 0:02:18,000
maybe thank of parrotfish.

44
0:02:18.567,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:19.742,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Third, they have so much style.

46
0:02:22.71,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Mottled and striped, teal, magenta,

47
0:02:25.018,000 --> 0:02:27,000
yellow, orange, polka-dotted,

48
0:02:27.183,000 --> 0:02:3,000
parrotfish are a big part of what makes coral reefs so colorful.

49
0:02:31.212,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Plus, in true diva style,

50
0:02:33.589,000 --> 0:02:36,000
they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life.

51
0:02:37.473,000 --> 0:02:38,000
A juvenile outfit,

52
0:02:38.655,000 --> 0:02:39,000
an intermediate getup,

53
0:02:39.973,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and a terminal look.

54
0:02:41.711,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Fourth, with this last wardrobe change comes a sex change from female to male,

55
0:02:47.082,000 --> 0:02:49,000
termed sequential hermaphroditism.

56
0:02:50.252,000 --> 0:02:53,000
These large males then gather harems of females to spawn.

57
0:02:54.7,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not nature's status quo.

58
0:02:58.415,000 --> 0:03:,000
And parrotfish exemplify some of the beauty

59
0:03:01.24,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of diverse reproductive strategies.

60
0:03:04.088,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Fifth, and the most incredible,

61
0:03:07.382,000 --> 0:03:1,000
sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night,

62
0:03:11.334,000 --> 0:03:14,000
they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head

63
0:03:15.117,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that envelops their entire body.

64
0:03:18.752,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This masks their scent from predators

65
0:03:20.974,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and protects them from parasites,

66
0:03:22.586,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so they can sleep soundly.

67
0:03:23.904,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I mean, how cool is this?

68
0:03:25.937,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:27.95,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish

70
0:03:31.745,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in all their flamboyant,

71
0:03:33.458,000 --> 0:03:36,000
algae-eating, sand-pooping, sex-changing glory.

72
0:03:36.713,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:37.832,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But with this love comes heartache.

74
0:03:42.832,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now that groupers and snappers are woefully overfished,

75
0:03:46.499,000 --> 0:03:48,000
fishermen are targeting parrotfish.

76
0:03:48.936,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Spearfishing took out the large species,

77
0:03:51.372,000 --> 0:03:55,000
midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare,

78
0:03:55.674,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and nets and traps are scooping up the smaller species.

79
0:03:58.998,000 --> 0:04:01,000
As both a marine biologist and a single person,

80
0:04:02.701,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I can tell you,

81
0:04:03.963,000 --> 0:04:05,000
there aren't that many fish in the sea.

82
0:04:06.437,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:07.558,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And then, there's my love for their home,

84
0:04:10.748,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the coral reef,

85
0:04:11.947,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which was once as vibrant as Caribbean cultures,

86
0:04:15.417,000 --> 0:04:17,000
as colorful as the architecture,

87
0:04:17.472,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and as bustling as carnival.

88
0:04:19.671,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Because of climate change,

89
0:04:21.393,000 --> 0:04:23,000
on top of overfishing and pollution,

90
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
coral reefs may be gone within 30 years.

91
0:04:28.903,000 --> 0:04:3,000
An entire ecosystem erased.

92
0:04:32.188,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is devastating,

93
0:04:33.37,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because hundreds of millions of people around the world

94
0:04:37.718,000 --> 0:04:4,000
depend on reefs for their nutrition and income.

95
0:04:41.584,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Let that sink in.

96
0:04:44.998,000 --> 0:04:45,000
A little bit of good news

97
0:04:46.839,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is that places like Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire are protecting these VIPs --

98
0:04:52.465,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Very Important Parrotfish.

99
0:04:54.879,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Also, more and more places are establishing protected areas

100
0:04:59.036,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that protect the entire ecosystem.

101
0:05:02.044,000 --> 0:05:05,000
These are critical efforts, but it's not enough.

102
0:05:06.163,000 --> 0:05:07,000
As I stand here today,

103
0:05:08.06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
only 2.2 percent of the ocean is protected.

104
0:05:11.956,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Meanwhile, 90 percent of the large fish,

105
0:05:14.741,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reefs,

106
0:05:17.829,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is already gone.

107
0:05:20.323,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction.

108
0:05:22.927,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And we, humans, are causing it.

109
0:05:27.292,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We also have the solutions.

110
0:05:30.061,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Reverse climate change and overfishing,

111
0:05:33.061,000 --> 0:05:34,000
protect half the ocean

112
0:05:34.577,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and stop pollution running from land.

113
0:05:36.573,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But these are massive undertakings

114
0:05:38.855,000 --> 0:05:4,000
requiring systemic changes,

115
0:05:40.99,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and we're really taking our sweet time getting around to it.

116
0:05:44.784,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Each of us can contribute, though.

117
0:05:47.498,000 --> 0:05:49,000
With our votes, our voices, our food choices,

118
0:05:50.236,000 --> 0:05:51,000
our skills and our dollars.

119
0:05:52.173,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We must overhaul both corporate practices

120
0:05:55.173,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and government policies.

121
0:05:56.601,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We must transform culture.

122
0:06:00.046,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Building community around solutions

123
0:06:02.832,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is the most important thing.

124
0:06:06.149,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I am never going to give up

125
0:06:08.753,000 --> 0:06:11,000
working to protect and restore this magnificent planet.

126
0:06:13.22,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Every bit of habitat we preserve,

127
0:06:16.411,000 --> 0:06:19,000
every tenth of a degree of warming we prevent,

128
0:06:19.633,000 --> 0:06:2,000
really does matter.

129
0:06:21.82,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Thankfully, I'm not motivated by hope,

130
0:06:24.558,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but rather a desire to be useful.

131
0:06:27.558,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Because I don't know how to give an honest talk

132
0:06:31.714,000 --> 0:06:34,000
about my beloved parrotfish and coral reefs

133
0:06:35.111,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that has a happy ending.

134
0:06:37.04,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Thank you.

135
0:06:38.215,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

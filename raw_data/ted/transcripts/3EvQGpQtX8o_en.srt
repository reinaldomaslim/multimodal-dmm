1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is a world-changing invention.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
of lives, worldwide.

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But smoke alarms don't prevent fires.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with 350,000 home fires.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What if we could prevent electrical fires

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
before they start?

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So how does electricity ignite residential fires?

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Well it turns out that the main causes

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
Our invention had to address all of these issues.

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So what about circuit breakers?

16
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.

17
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is 130-year-old technology,

18
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and this is a problem, because over 80 percent

19
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of all home electrical fires

20
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.

21
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Hmmm ...

22
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So we considered all of this. And we realized

23
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that electrical appliances

24
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
must be able to communicate directly

25
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with the power receptacle itself.

26
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Any electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever --

27
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
must be able to tell the power outlet,

28
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Hey, power outlet,

29
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire."

30
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder,

32
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a data tag, in the appliance plug.

33
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle

34
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so they could communicate.

35
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, every home electrical system

36
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
becomes an intelligent network.

37
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The appliance's safe operating parameters

38
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
are embedded into its plug.

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
If too much current is flowing,

40
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the intelligent receptacle turns itself off,

41
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and prevents another fire from starting.

42
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We call this technology EFCI,

43
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter.

44
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA,

45
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
roughly 2,500 children

46
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries

47
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy.

48
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries

49
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because the power is always off,

50
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple.

51
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, besides saving lives,

52
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power

53
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is in its energy savings.

54
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This invention will reduce global energy consumption

55
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by allowing remote control and automation

56
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
of every outlet in every home and business.

57
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill

58
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
by automatically cycling heavy loads

59
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
like air conditioners and heaters.

60
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms

61
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
from a central location, or even a cell phone.

62
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There are 10 billion electrical outlets

63
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in North America alone.

64
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The potential energy savings is very, very significant.

65
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So far we've applied for 414 patent claims.

66
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Of those, 186 have been granted:

67
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
228 are in process.

68
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago

69
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we received our first international recognition,

70
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the 2009 CES Innovation Award.

71
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So, to conclude,

72
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives,

73
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
prevent tens of thousands of injuries,

74
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage

75
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
every single year,

76
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
while significantly reducing global energy consumption.

77
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In the spirit of this year's TED Conference,

78
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention.

79
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity

80
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.

81
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Thank you.

82
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So it's 1995,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm in college,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and a friend and I go on a road trip

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
from Providence, Rhode Island

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to Portland, Oregon.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And you know, we're young and unemployed,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
so we do the whole thing on back roads

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
through state parks

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and national forests --

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
basically the longest route we can possibly take.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I turn to my friend

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I ask her a question

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that's been bothering me

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for 2,000 miles.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
My friend looks at me totally blankly.

18
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There's actually a gentleman in the front row

19
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.

20
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I'm like, "You know,

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
all the signs we keep seeing

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
with the Chinese character on them."

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
She just stares at me for a few moments,

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and then she cracks up,

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because she figures out what I'm talking about.

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And what I'm talking about is this.

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.

30
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I've spent the last five years of my life

32
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
thinking about situations

33
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
exactly like this --

34
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
why we sometimes misunderstand

35
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the signs around us,

36
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and how we behave when that happens,

37
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and what all of this can tell us about human nature.

38
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In other words, as you heard Chris say,

39
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I've spent the last five years

40
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
thinking about being wrong.

41
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This might strike you as a strange career move,

42
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but it actually has one great advantage:

43
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
no job competition.

44
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In fact, most of us do everything we can

46
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to avoid thinking about being wrong,

47
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility

48
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that we ourselves are wrong.

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We get it in the abstract.

50
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.

51
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But when it comes down to me, right now,

53
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to all the beliefs I hold,

54
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
here in the present tense,

55
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility

56
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
goes out the window --

57
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.

58
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.

59
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We go to meetings in the present tense;

60
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we go on family vacations in the present tense;

61
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.

62
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,

63
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
trapped in this little bubble

64
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of feeling very right about everything.

65
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I think this is a problem.

66
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,

67
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in our personal and professional lives,

68
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.

69
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So what I want to do today

70
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck

71
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
inside this feeling of being right.

72
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And second, why it's such a problem.

73
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And finally, I want to convince you

74
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that it is possible

75
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to step outside of that feeling

76
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and that if you can do so,

77
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it is the single greatest

78
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.

79
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So why do we get stuck

80
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in this feeling of being right?

81
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.

82
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So let me ask you guys something --

83
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:

84
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
How does it feel -- emotionally --

85
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
how does it feel to be wrong?

86
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Dreadful. Thumbs down.

87
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.

88
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --

89
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
thank you, these are great answers,

90
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but they're answers to a different question.

91
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You guys are answering the question:

92
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
How does it feel to realize you're wrong?

93
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?

95
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,

96
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
it can actually be quite funny,

97
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
like my stupid Chinese character mistake.

98
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But just being wrong

99
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
doesn't feel like anything.

100
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I'll give you an analogy.

101
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon

102
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
where there's this pathetic coyote

103
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?

104
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon,

105
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner

106
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and the roadrunner runs off a cliff,

107
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.

108
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.

109
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And what's funny --

110
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
at least if you're six years old --

111
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is that the coyote's totally fine too.

112
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
He just keeps running --

113
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
right up until the moment that he looks down

114
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and realizes that he's in mid-air.

115
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's when he falls.

116
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
When we're wrong about something --

117
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
not when we realize it, but before that --

118
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we're like that coyote

119
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.

120
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You know, we're already wrong,

121
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
we're already in trouble,

122
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but we feel like we're on solid ground.

123
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.

124
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It does feel like something to be wrong;

125
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it feels like being right.

126
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So this is one reason, a structural reason,

128
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.

129
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I call this error blindness.

130
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Most of the time,

131
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we don't have any kind of internal cue

132
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to let us know that we're wrong about something,

133
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
until it's too late.

134
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --

135
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and this one is cultural.

136
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Think back for a moment to elementary school.

137
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You're sitting there in class,

138
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and your teacher is handing back quiz papers,

139
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and one of them looks like this.

140
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This is not mine, by the way.

141
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So there you are in grade school,

143
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and you know exactly what to think

144
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
about the kid who got this paper.

145
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,

146
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the one who never does his homework.

147
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So by the time you are nine years old,

148
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you've already learned, first of all,

149
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that people who get stuff wrong

150
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
are lazy, irresponsible dimwits --

151
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and second of all,

152
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that the way to succeed in life

153
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is to never make any mistakes.

154
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We learn these really bad lessons really well.

155
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And a lot of us --

156
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --

157
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
deal with them by just becoming

158
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
perfect little A students,

159
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
perfectionists, over-achievers.

160
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Right,

161
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?

162
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.

164
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Okay, so fine.

165
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Except that then we freak out

166
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.

167
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Because according to this,

168
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
getting something wrong

169
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
means there's something wrong with us.

170
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So we just insist that we're right,

171
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
because it makes us feel smart and responsible

172
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and virtuous and safe.

173
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So let me tell you a story.

174
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
A couple of years ago,

175
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.

176
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Beth Israel's in Boston.

177
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard --

178
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
one of the best hospitals in the country.

179
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.

180
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --

181
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.

182
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Everything seems to have gone fine.

183
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,

184
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"

185
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages

186
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
because the surgeon has performed a major operation

187
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
on her left leg instead of her right one.

188
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel

189
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
spoke about this incident,

190
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
he said something very interesting.

191
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He said, "For whatever reason,

192
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the surgeon simply felt

193
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that he was on the correct side of the patient."

194
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The point of this story

196
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is that trusting too much in the feeling

197
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of being on the correct side of anything

198
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
can be very dangerous.

199
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This internal sense of rightness

200
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that we all experience so often

201
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is not a reliable guide

202
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to what is actually going on in the external world.

203
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And when we act like it is,

204
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,

205
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
well that's when we end up doing things

206
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

207
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
or torpedoing the global economy.

208
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So this is a huge practical problem.

209
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But it's also a huge social problem.

210
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.

211
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It means that you think that your beliefs

212
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
just perfectly reflect reality.

213
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And when you feel that way,

214
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you've got a problem to solve,

215
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which is, how are you going to explain

216
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
all of those people who disagree with you?

217
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,

218
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.

219
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us

220
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is we just assume they're ignorant.

221
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They don't have access to the same information that we do,

222
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and when we generously share that information with them,

223
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.

224
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
When that doesn't work,

225
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do

226
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and they still disagree with us,

227
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
then we move on to a second assumption,

228
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
which is that they're idiots.

229
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle,

231
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.

232
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And when that doesn't work,

233
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
when it turns out that people who disagree with us

234
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
have all the same facts we do

235
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and are actually pretty smart,

236
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
then we move on to a third assumption:

237
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they know the truth,

238
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and they are deliberately distorting it

239
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
for their own malevolent purposes.

240
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So this is a catastrophe.

241
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
This attachment to our own rightness

242
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
keeps us from preventing mistakes

243
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
when we absolutely need to

244
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and causes us to treat each other terribly.

245
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But to me, what's most baffling

246
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and most tragic about this

247
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is that it misses the whole point of being human.

248
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It's like we want to imagine

249
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows

250
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and we just gaze out of them

251
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and describe the world as it unfolds.

252
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window

253
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and see the exact same thing.

254
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
That is not true,

255
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.

256
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The miracle of your mind

257
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
isn't that you can see the world as it is.

258
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.

259
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We can remember the past,

260
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and we can think about the future,

261
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and we can imagine what it's like

262
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to be some other person in some other place.

263
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And we all do this a little differently,

264
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which is why we can all look up at the same night sky

265
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and see this

266
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and also this

267
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and also this.

268
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.

269
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing

270
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
about "I think therefore I am,"

271
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
this guy, St. Augustine, sat down

272
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" --

273
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
"I err therefore I am."

274
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Augustine understood

275
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that our capacity to screw up,

276
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it's not some kind of embarrassing defect

277
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
in the human system,

278
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
something we can eradicate or overcome.

279
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
It's totally fundamental to who we are.

280
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Because, unlike God,

281
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
we don't really know what's going on out there.

282
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And unlike all of the other animals,

283
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.

284
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
To me, this obsession

285
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is the source and root

286
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
of all of our productivity and creativity.

287
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Last year, for various reasons,

288
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I found myself listening to a lot of episodes

289
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
of the Public Radio show This American Life.

290
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And so I'm listening and I'm listening,

291
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and at some point, I start feeling

292
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
like all the stories are about being wrong.

293
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And my first thought was,

294
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
"I've lost it.

295
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.

296
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I just imagined it everywhere,"

297
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
which has happened.

298
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But a couple of months later,

299
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.

300
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I mentioned this to him,

301
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and he was like, "No actually, that's true.

302
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
In fact," he says,

303
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
"as a staff, we joke

304
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that every single episode of our show

305
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
has the same crypto-theme.

306
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And the crypto-theme is:

307
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
'I thought this one thing was going to happen

308
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and something else happened instead.'

309
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.

310
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We need these moments

311
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
of surprise and reversal and wrongness

312
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to make these stories work."

313
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And for the rest of us, audience members,

314
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
as listeners, as readers,

315
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
we eat this stuff up.

316
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We love things like plot twists

317
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and red herrings and surprise endings.

318
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
When it comes to our stories,

319
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
we love being wrong.

320
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
But, you know, our stories are like this

321
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
because our lives are like this.

322
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We think this one thing is going to happen

323
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and something else happens instead.

324
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,

325
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,

326
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.

327
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And something else happened instead.

328
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And Hosni Mubarak

329
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,

330
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
until he got too old or too sick

331
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.

332
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And something else happened instead.

333
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And maybe you thought

334
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart

335
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.

336
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And something else happened instead.

337
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And I have to tell you

338
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book

339
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
about a subject everybody hates

340
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
for an audience that would never materialize.

341
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And something else happened instead.

342
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Laughter)

343
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I mean, this is life.

344
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
For good and for ill,

345
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
we generate these incredible stories

346
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
about the world around us,

347
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and then the world turns around and astonishes us.

348
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
No offense, but this entire conference

349
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
is an unbelievable monument

350
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to our capacity to get stuff wrong.

351
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We just spent an entire week

352
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
talking about innovations and advancements

353
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and improvements,

354
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but you know why we need all of those innovations

355
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and advancements and improvements?

356
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Because half the stuff

357
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --

358
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
TED 1998 --

359
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
eh.

360
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Laughter)

361
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Didn't really work out that way, did it?

362
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Laughter)

363
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Where's my jet pack, Chris?

364
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Laughter)

365
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
(Applause)

366
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
So here we are again.

367
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And that's how it goes.

368
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We come up with another idea.

369
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We tell another story.

370
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We hold another conference.

371
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The theme of this one,

372
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
as you guys have now heard seven million times,

373
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
is the rediscovery of wonder.

374
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And to me,

375
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
if you really want to rediscover wonder,

376
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
you need to step outside

377
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
of that tiny, terrified space of rightness

378
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and look around at each other

379
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and look out at the vastness

380
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and complexity and mystery

381
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
of the universe

382
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and be able to say,

383
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
"Wow, I don't know.

384
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Maybe I'm wrong."

385
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Thank you.

386
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Applause)

387
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Thank you guys.

388
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Applause)

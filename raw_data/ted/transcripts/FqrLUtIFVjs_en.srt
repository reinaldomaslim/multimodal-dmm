2
0:00:12.832,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Cybercrime is out of control.

3
0:00:18.006,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's everywhere.

4
0:00:19.395,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We hear about it every single day.

5
0:00:24.591,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This year,

6
0:00:25.829,000 --> 0:00:3,000
over two billion records lost or stolen.

7
0:00:31.87,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And last year, 100 million of us, mostly Americans,

8
0:00:37.529,000 --> 0:00:42,000
lost our health insurance data to thieves -- myself included.

9
0:00:44.123,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What's particularly concerning about this is that in most cases,

10
0:00:49.595,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it was months before anyone even reported that these records were stolen.

11
0:00:56.984,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So if you watch the evening news,

12
0:01:00.051,000 --> 0:01:05,000
you would think that most of this is espionage or nation-state activity.

13
0:01:05.813,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And, well, some of it is.

14
0:01:08.514,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Espionage, you see, is an accepted international practice.

15
0:01:13.613,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But in this case,

16
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it is only a small portion of the problem that we're dealing with.

17
0:01:21.459,000 --> 0:01:24,000
How often do we hear about a breach

18
0:01:24.818,000 --> 0:01:28,000
followed by, "... it was the result of a sophisticated nation-state attack?"

19
0:01:30.481,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Well, often that is companies not being willing to own up

20
0:01:35.366,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to their own lackluster security practices.

21
0:01:38.885,000 --> 0:01:4,000
There is also a widely held belief

22
0:01:42.175,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that by blaming an attack on a nation-state,

23
0:01:46.05,000 --> 0:01:48,000
you are putting regulators at bay --

24
0:01:48.755,000 --> 0:01:5,000
at least for a period of time.

25
0:01:51.657,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So where is all of this coming from?

26
0:01:56.817,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The United Nations estimates that 80 percent of it

27
0:02:02.334,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is from highly organized and ultrasophisticated criminal gangs.

28
0:02:09.074,000 --> 0:02:1,000
To date,

29
0:02:10.817,000 --> 0:02:16,000
this represents one of the largest illegal economies in the world,

30
0:02:17.441,000 --> 0:02:2,000
topping out at, now get this,

31
0:02:20.585,000 --> 0:02:24,000
445 billion dollars.

32
0:02:25.359,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Let me put that in perspective for all of you:

33
0:02:28.295,000 --> 0:02:34,000
445 billion dollars is larger than the GDP

34
0:02:34.423,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of 160 nations,

35
0:02:37.113,000 --> 0:02:41,000
including Ireland, Finland, Denmark and Portugal,

36
0:02:41.682,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to name a few.

37
0:02:44.113,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So how does this work?

38
0:02:46.141,000 --> 0:02:47,000
How do these criminals operate?

39
0:02:48.521,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Well, let me tell you a little story.

40
0:02:52.351,000 --> 0:02:53,000
About a year ago,

41
0:02:53.569,000 --> 0:02:56,000
our security researchers were tracking

42
0:02:56.903,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.

43
0:03:03.745,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer

44
0:03:05.99,000 --> 0:03:08,000
via you clicking on a link in a phishing email

45
0:03:09.014,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that you probably shouldn't have.

46
0:03:10.99,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It would then sit and wait.

47
0:03:13.575,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It would wait until you logged into your bank account.

48
0:03:17.119,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And when you did, the bad guys would reach in,

49
0:03:20.486,000 --> 0:03:21,000
steal your credentials,

50
0:03:22.163,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and then use that to steal your money.

51
0:03:24.843,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This sounds terrible,

52
0:03:26.787,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but the reality is, in the security industry,

53
0:03:29.604,000 --> 0:03:32,000
this form of attack is somewhat commonplace.

54
0:03:35.822,000 --> 0:03:41,000
However, the Dyre Wolf had two distinctly different personalities --

55
0:03:42.479,000 --> 0:03:44,000
one for these small transactions,

56
0:03:44.844,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but it took on an entirely different persona

57
0:03:47.908,000 --> 0:03:5,000
if you were in the business of moving large-scale wire transfers.

58
0:03:51.747,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Here's what would happen.

59
0:03:53.47,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You start the process of issuing a wire transfer,

60
0:03:56.294,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and up in your browser would pop a screen from your bank,

61
0:03:59.326,000 --> 0:04:01,000
indicating that there's a problem with your account,

62
0:04:01.947,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and that you need to call the bank immediately,

63
0:04:05.162,000 --> 0:04:07,000
along with the number to the bank's fraud department.

64
0:04:08.655,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So you pick up the phone and you call.

65
0:04:10.849,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And after going through the normal voice prompts,

66
0:04:13.884,000 --> 0:04:15,000
you're met with an English-speaking operator.

67
0:04:16.025,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank. How can I help you?"

68
0:04:19.853,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And you go through the process like you do every time you call your bank,

69
0:04:23.53,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of giving them your name and your account number,

70
0:04:26.345,000 --> 0:04:29,000
going through the security checks to verify you are who you said you are.

71
0:04:31.629,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Most of us may not know this,

72
0:04:33.141,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but in many large-scale wire transfers,

73
0:04:35.394,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it requires two people to sign off on the wire transfer,

74
0:04:38.529,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so the operator then asks you to get the second person on the line,

75
0:04:41.752,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and goes through the same set of verifications and checks.

76
0:04:45.78,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Sounds normal, right?

77
0:04:47.729,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Only one problem:

78
0:04:49.195,000 --> 0:04:5,000
you're not talking to the bank.

79
0:04:51.044,000 --> 0:04:52,000
You're talking to the criminals.

80
0:04:52.654,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They had built an English-speaking help desk,

81
0:04:54.876,000 --> 0:04:56,000
fake overlays to the banking website.

82
0:04:56.965,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And this was so flawlessly executed

83
0:05:00.089,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that they were moving between a half a million

84
0:05:02.256,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and a million and a half dollars per attempt

85
0:05:05.367,000 --> 0:05:06,000
into their criminal coffers.

86
0:05:07.96,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These criminal organizations operate

87
0:05:10.599,000 --> 0:05:13,000
like highly regimented, legitimate businesses.

88
0:05:14.165,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Their employees work Monday through Friday.

89
0:05:17.129,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They take the weekends off.

90
0:05:18.689,000 --> 0:05:19,000
How do we know this?

91
0:05:20.096,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We know this because our security researchers see

92
0:05:23.253,000 --> 0:05:26,000
repeated spikes of malware on a Friday afternoon.

93
0:05:27.074,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The bad guys, after a long weekend with the wife and kids,

94
0:05:30.313,000 --> 0:05:32,000
come back in to see how well things went.

95
0:05:35.521,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The Dark Web is where they spend their time.

96
0:05:39.115,000 --> 0:05:44,000
That is a term used to describe the anonymous underbelly of the internet,

97
0:05:44.928,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where thieves can operate with anonymity

98
0:05:47.877,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and without detection.

99
0:05:50.029,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Here they peddle their attack software

100
0:05:53.08,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and share information on new attack techniques.

101
0:05:57.391,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You can buy everything there,

102
0:05:59.265,000 --> 0:06:02,000
from a base-level attack to a much more advanced version.

103
0:06:03.662,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In fact, in many cases, you even see

104
0:06:05.978,000 --> 0:06:08,000
gold, silver and bronze levels of service.

105
0:06:09.723,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You can check references.

106
0:06:11.797,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You can even buy attacks

107
0:06:14.381,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that come with a money-back guarantee --

108
0:06:17.733,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

109
0:06:18.802,000 --> 0:06:19,000
if you're not successful.

110
0:06:21.751,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now, these environments, these marketplaces --

111
0:06:24.866,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they look like an Amazon or an eBay.

112
0:06:28.237,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You see products, prices, ratings and reviews.

113
0:06:32.217,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Of course, if you're going to buy an attack,

114
0:06:34.495,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you're going to buy from a reputable criminal with good ratings, right?

115
0:06:37.968,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:38.996,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This isn't any different

117
0:06:40.221,000 --> 0:06:45,000
than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor before going to a new restaurant.

118
0:06:46.323,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So, here is an example.

119
0:06:48.44,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is an actual screenshot of a vendor selling malware.

120
0:06:53.885,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Notice they're a vendor level four,

121
0:06:55.724,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they have a trust level of six.

122
0:06:57.589,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They've had 400 positive reviews in the last year,

123
0:06:59.948,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and only two negative reviews in the last month.

124
0:07:02.892,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We even see things like licensing terms.

125
0:07:06.582,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Here's an example of a site you can go to

126
0:07:08.61,000 --> 0:07:09,000
if you want to change your identity.

127
0:07:10.391,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They will sell you a fake ID,

128
0:07:12.272,000 --> 0:07:13,000
fake passports.

129
0:07:14.423,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But note the legally binding terms for purchasing your fake ID.

130
0:07:20.338,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Give me a break.

131
0:07:21.883,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What are they going to do -- sue you if you violate them?

132
0:07:24.765,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:27.278,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This occurred a couple of months ago.

134
0:07:29.725,000 --> 0:07:32,000
One of our security researchers was looking

135
0:07:33.364,000 --> 0:07:37,000
at a new Android malware application that we had discovered.

136
0:07:38.386,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It was called Bilal Bot.

137
0:07:41.334,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In a blog post,

138
0:07:43.284,000 --> 0:07:49,000
she positioned Bilal Bot as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative

139
0:07:50.69,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to the much more advanced GM Bot

140
0:07:54.052,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that was commonplace in the criminal underground.

141
0:07:58.478,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This review did not sit well with the authors of Bilal Bot.

142
0:08:03.057,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So they wrote her this very email,

143
0:08:06.848,000 --> 0:08:08,000
pleading their case and making the argument

144
0:08:09.629,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that they felt she had evaluated an older version.

145
0:08:16.018,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They asked her to please update her blog with more accurate information

146
0:08:20.751,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and even offered to do an interview

147
0:08:24.187,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to describe to her in detail

148
0:08:26.432,000 --> 0:08:3,000
how their attack software was now far better than the competition.

149
0:08:32.185,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So look,

150
0:08:33.534,000 --> 0:08:36,000
you don't have to like what they do,

151
0:08:37.422,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but you do have to respect the entrepreneurial nature

152
0:08:42.365,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of their endeavors.

153
0:08:43.596,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:46.296,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So how are we going to stop this?

155
0:08:51.534,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's not like we're going to be able to identify who's responsible --

156
0:08:57.122,000 --> 0:08:59,000
remember, they operate with anonymity

157
0:09:00.108,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and outside the reach of the law.

158
0:09:03.037,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We're certainly not going to be able to prosecute the offenders.

159
0:09:06.976,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I would propose that we need a completely new approach.

160
0:09:13.583,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And that approach needs to be centered on the idea

161
0:09:17.513,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that we need to change the economics for the bad guys.

162
0:09:22.065,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And to give you a perspective on how this can work,

163
0:09:25.19,000 --> 0:09:29,000
let's think of the response we see to a healthcare pandemic:

164
0:09:30.202,000 --> 0:09:33,000
SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.

165
0:09:33.856,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What is the top priority?

166
0:09:35.801,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It's knowing who is infected and how the disease is spreading.

167
0:09:43.835,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now, governments, private institutions, hospitals, physicians --

168
0:09:50.881,000 --> 0:09:53,000
everyone responds openly and quickly.

169
0:09:55.154,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This is a collective and altruistic effort

170
0:09:59.149,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to stop the spread in its tracks

171
0:10:03.073,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and to inform anyone not infected

172
0:10:05.974,000 --> 0:10:07,000
how to protect or inoculate themselves.

173
0:10:10.72,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Unfortunately, this is not at all what we see in response to a cyber attack.

174
0:10:17.67,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack

175
0:10:22.145,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to themselves.

176
0:10:24.902,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Why?

177
0:10:26.082,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Because they're worried about competitive advantage,

178
0:10:29.863,000 --> 0:10:3,000
litigation

179
0:10:31.458,000 --> 0:10:32,000
or regulation.

180
0:10:33.647,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We need to effectively democratize threat intelligence data.

181
0:10:39.795,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We need to get all of these organizations to open up and share

182
0:10:45.295,000 --> 0:10:48,000
what is in their private arsenal of information.

183
0:10:50.83,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The bad guys are moving fast;

184
0:10:53.648,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we've got to move faster.

185
0:10:56.57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And the best way to do that is to open up

186
0:11:00.316,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and share data on what's happening.

187
0:11:03.124,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Let's think about this in the construct of security professionals.

188
0:11:07.984,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Remember, they're programmed right into their DNA to keep secrets.

189
0:11:12.984,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We've got to turn that thinking on its head.

190
0:11:16.032,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We've got to get governments, private institutions

191
0:11:19.337,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and security companies

192
0:11:20.804,000 --> 0:11:22,000
willing to share information at speed.

193
0:11:23.559,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And here's why:

194
0:11:25.259,000 --> 0:11:26,000
because if you share the information,

195
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it's equivalent to inoculation.

196
0:11:30.483,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And if you're not sharing,

197
0:11:32.054,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you're actually part of the problem,

198
0:11:34.179,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because you're increasing the odds that other people could be impacted

199
0:11:39.971,000 --> 0:11:41,000
by the same attack techniques.

200
0:11:43.806,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But there's an even bigger benefit.

201
0:11:47.018,000 --> 0:11:51,000
By destroying criminals' devices closer to real time,

202
0:11:51.788,000 --> 0:11:52,000
we break their plans.

203
0:11:55.282,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We inform the people they aim to hurt

204
0:11:58.546,000 --> 0:12:,000
far sooner than they had ever anticipated.

205
0:12:02.34,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We ruin their reputations,

206
0:12:04.565,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we crush their ratings and reviews.

207
0:12:08.125,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We make cybercrime not pay.

208
0:12:12.751,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We change the economics for the bad guys.

209
0:12:18.135,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But to do this, a first mover was required --

210
0:12:22.131,000 --> 0:12:26,000
someone to change the thinking in the security industry overall.

211
0:12:27.887,000 --> 0:12:28,000
About a year ago,

212
0:12:29.181,000 --> 0:12:31,000
my colleagues and I had a radical idea.

213
0:12:32.444,000 --> 0:12:36,000
What if IBM were to take our data --

214
0:12:37.807,000 --> 0:12:4,000
we had one of the largest threat intelligence databases in the world --

215
0:12:41.819,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and open it up?

216
0:12:43.577,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It had information not just on what had happened in the past,

217
0:12:47.062,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but what was happening in near-real time.

218
0:12:49.561,000 --> 0:12:52,000
What if we were to publish it all openly on the internet?

219
0:12:54.283,000 --> 0:12:56,000
As you can imagine, this got quite a reaction.

220
0:12:56.801,000 --> 0:12:57,000
First came the lawyers:

221
0:12:58.189,000 --> 0:13:,000
What are the legal implications of doing that?

222
0:13:01.205,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Then came the business:

223
0:13:02.564,000 --> 0:13:04,000
What are the business implications of doing that?

224
0:13:05.442,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And this was also met with a good dose

225
0:13:07.639,000 --> 0:13:1,000
of a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy.

226
0:13:11.748,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But there was one conversation that kept floating to the surface

227
0:13:15.558,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in every dialogue that we would have:

228
0:13:18.22,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the realization that if we didn't do this,

229
0:13:21.791,000 --> 0:13:23,000
then we were part of the problem.

230
0:13:25.334,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So we did something unheard of in the security industry.

231
0:13:28.865,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We started publishing.

232
0:13:30.562,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Over 700 terabytes of actionable threat intelligence data,

233
0:13:34.996,000 --> 0:13:37,000
including information on real-time attacks

234
0:13:38.025,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that can be used to stop cybercrime in its tracks.

235
0:13:41.633,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And to date,

236
0:13:43.027,000 --> 0:13:47,000
over 4,000 organizations are leveraging this data,

237
0:13:47.095,000 --> 0:13:48,000
including half of the Fortune 100.

238
0:13:50.419,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations

239
0:13:54.46,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to join us in the fight,

240
0:13:56.445,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and do the same thing

241
0:13:58.02,000 --> 0:14:,000
and share their information

242
0:14:00.132,000 --> 0:14:02,000
on when and how they're being attacked as well.

243
0:14:03.372,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We all have the opportunity to stop it,

244
0:14:06.414,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and we already all know how.

245
0:14:09.192,000 --> 0:14:13,000
All we have to do is look to the response that we see

246
0:14:13.586,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in the world of health care,

247
0:14:15.116,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and how they respond to a pandemic.

248
0:14:17.443,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Simply put,

249
0:14:18.846,000 --> 0:14:2,000
we need to be open and collaborative.

250
0:14:21.696,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Thank you.

251
0:14:22.871,000 --> 0:14:25,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to do things again, not just represent things.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at the groundbreaking of the largest project

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I, and my firm, have ever been involved in.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I thought it represented the importance of the architect.

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I stayed thrilled until I got home,

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
threw the helmet onto my bed,

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
fell down onto my bed and realized inside

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
there was an inscription.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, I think that this is a great metaphor

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for the state of architecture and architects today.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We are for decorative purposes only.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, who do we have to blame?

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and has gotten much more litigious.

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And we architects are cowards.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So, as we have faced liability,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we have stepped back and back,

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is:

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
power.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, eventually we have found ourselves

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in a totally marginalized position, way over here.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, what did we do? We're cowards,

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but we're smart cowards.

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here,

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in this autonomous language

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we're going to seed control of processes."

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We actually created an artificial schism

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
between creation and execution,

39
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and as if you could actually execute

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
without knowing how to create.

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now, something else happened.

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And that's when we began to sell the world

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that architecture was created by individuals

45
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
creating genius sketches.

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for years and years and years is not only something

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to be derided,

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but we would merely write it off as

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
merely execution.

51
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and nine months of gestation,

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor

55
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is merely execution.

56
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
creation and execution.

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And we need to start authoring processes again

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
instead of authoring objects.

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and start reinjecting agency,

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
social engineering, back into architecture.

63
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,

64
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
like managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
understanding procurement processes,

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
understanding the time value of money and cost estimation.

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process,

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
into three very pedantic statements.

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The first is: Take core positions with your client.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.

71
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The second position is: Actually take positions.

72
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Take joint positions with your client.

73
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is the moment in which you as the architect

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and your client can begin to inject

75
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
vision and agency.

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But it has to be done together.

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And then only after this is done

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward

79
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
architectural manifestations

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that manifest those positions.

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And both owner and architect alike

82
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
are empowered to critique those manifestations

83
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
based on the positions that you've taken.

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this.

85
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.

86
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You do not know what the end result is.

87
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But I promise you, with enough brain power

88
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and enough passion and enough commitment,

89
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
you will arrive at conclusions

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that will transcend convention,

91
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and will simply be something

92
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that you could not have initially

93
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or individually conceived of.

94
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Alright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series

95
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of simple dumb sketches.

96
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
This is the modus operandi that we have today.

97
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We roll 120-foot Spartan,

98
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
i.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.

99
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?

100
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Well, how about instead of doing that,

101
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we roll up to the gates something they want.

102
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor,

103
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because of course we all know that inside

104
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.

105
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse

106
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the vessel by which

107
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
you get through the gate,

108
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
get through the constraints of a project.

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
At which point, you and your client

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
have the ability to start considering what

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you're going to put inside that vessel,

112
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the agency, the vision.

113
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And if you do that, you do that responsibly,

114
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I believe that instead of delivering Spartans,

115
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you can deliver maidens.

116
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this.

117
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
If we are so good at our craft

118
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
shouldn't we be able to conceive

119
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of an architectural manifestation

120
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that slides seamlessly through

121
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the project's and the client's constraints?

122
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project

123
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that's very dear to many people in this room--

124
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.

125
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And that's a project that is just about to open next week,

126
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the new home for the Dallas Theater Center,

127
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.

128
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, I'm going to present it on the same terms:

129
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
issue, position and architectural manifestation.

130
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Now, the first issue that we faced

131
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
was that the Dallas Theater Center

132
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect

133
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of some place outside of the triumvirate

134
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of New York, Chicago and Seattle.

135
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.

136
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But it also had to do with something rather unusual,

137
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.

138
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Why was this horrible little building

139
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
so important to their renown and their innovation?

140
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.

141
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
When you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.

142
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This building, when an artistic director

143
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
wanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people

144
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,

145
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.

146
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Well, that's exciting.

147
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And you can start to get the best artistic directors,

148
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
scenic designers and actors from around the country

149
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to come to perform here

150
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because you can do things you can't do elsewhere.

151
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So, the first position we took was,

152
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
"Hey, we as architects had better not show up

153
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and do a pristine building

154
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this

155
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
old dilapidated shed provided the company."

156
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The second issue is a nuance of the first.

157
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And that's that the company and the building was multiform.

158
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That meant that they were able to perform,

159
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as long as they had labor

160
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
they were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,

161
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
arena, traverse, you name it.

162
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
All they needed was labor.

163
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Well, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions

164
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
around the world.

165
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It started to become hard to raise operational costs,

166
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
operational budgets.

167
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So, they stopped having inexpensive labor.

168
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And eventually they had to freeze their organization

169
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
into something called a bastardized thruscenium.

170
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided,

171
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the ability to move between stage configurations,

172
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
had better be able to be done

173
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
without relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.

174
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The architectural manifestation

175
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
was frankly just dumb.

176
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house

177
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and redefine them as above house and below house.

178
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
At first blush you think, "Hey it's crazy,

179
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
what could you possibly gain?"

180
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We created what we like to call superfly.

181
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

182
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, superfly, the concept is

183
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,

184
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and you smear them across flytower and auditorium.

185
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Suddenly the artistic director

186
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
can move between different stage

187
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and audience configurations.

188
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And because that flytower has the ability to pick up

189
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
all the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment

190
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
can be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw

191
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
paint and replace,

192
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
with a minimum of cost.

193
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move

194
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that was unexpected.

195
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium

196
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in a most unusual way.

197
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And that provided the artistic director suddenly

198
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the ability to define suspension of disbelief.

199
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So, the building affords artistic directors the freedom

200
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to conceive of almost any kind of activity

201
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
underneath this floating object.

202
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief

203
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
such that in the last act of Macbeth,

204
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
if he or she wants you to associate

205
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,

206
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
he or she can do so.

207
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Now, in order to do this we and the clients

208
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
had to do something fairly remarkable.

209
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In fact it really was the clients who had to do it.

210
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They had to make a decision, based on the positions we took

211
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture

212
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and one-third infrastructure,

213
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to actually the inverse,

214
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.

215
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That's a lot for a client to commit to

216
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
before you actually see the fruition of the concept.

217
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But based on the positions,

218
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
they took the educated leap of faith to do so.

219
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And effectively we created what we like to call

220
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
a theater machine.

221
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Now, that theater machine has ability

222
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to move between a whole series of configurations

223
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
at the push of a button and a few stagehands

224
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in a short amount of time.

225
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But it also has the potential

226
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.

227
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Meaning: The artistic director

228
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.

229
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters

230
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is they hate us architects,

231
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
because they say the first thing they have to do,

232
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the first five minutes of any show,

233
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is they have to get our architecture

234
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
out of the mind of their patron.

235
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well now there are potentials of this building

236
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to allow the artistic director

237
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to actually move into the building

238
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
without using our architecture.

239
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.

240
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
You're going down into our lobby,

241
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,

242
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.

243
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But there is also the potential

244
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to allow people to move directly from the outside,

245
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,

246
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
into the interior of the auditorium.

247
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And here is the fruition of that in actuality.

248
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
These are the two large pivoting doors

249
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that allow people to move directly from the outside, in

250
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
or from the inside, out,

251
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
performers or audience alike.

252
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly

253
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.

254
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But imagine the freedoms

255
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
if you could take this further, that in fact you could consider

256
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
a Wagnerian entry,

257
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
a first act in thrust,

258
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
an intermission in Greek, a second act in arena,

259
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.

260
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now that, I would say, is architecture performing.

261
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It is taking the hand of the architect

262
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to actually remove the hand of the architect

263
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in favor of the hand of the artistic director.

264
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I'll go through the three basic configurations.

265
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This is the flat floor configuration.

266
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
You notice that there is no proscenium,

267
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,

268
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the floor in the auditorium is flat.

269
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The first configuration is easy to understand.

270
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The balconies come down, you see that the orchestra

271
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,

272
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and the seats come in.

273
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The third configuration is a little harder to understand.

274
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way

275
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in order to bring a thrust into the space.

276
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction,

277
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and change their rake, to allow that to happen.

278
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I'll do it again so you can see it.

279
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.

280
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And there it is in the thrust configuration.

281
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
In order to do that,

282
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
again, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.

283
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And they told us one important thing:

284
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
"You shall not beta-test."

285
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Meaning, nothing that we do

286
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
can we be the first ones to do it.

287
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But they were willing for us to apply technologies

288
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.

289
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And the solution in terms of the balconies

290
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.

291
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now, if you were to take a scoreboard

292
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and drop it on dirt and whiskey,

293
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that would be bad.

294
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena

295
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,

296
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that would also be bad.

297
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms

298
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and allowed the theater and our client

299
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to actually do this with confidence

300
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
that they would be able to change over their configurations at will.

301
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The second technology that we applied

302
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
was actually using things that you know from

303
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the stage side of an opera house.

304
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
In this case what we're doing is we're taking

305
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,

306
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor,

307
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define

308
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
rakes and viewing angles

309
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
of people in the orchestra seating, at will.

310
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage

311
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to thrust configuration.

312
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world

313
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.

314
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as

315
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.

316
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And ultimately, up in the flytower,

317
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.

318
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
As I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible

319
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
yet affordable configuration.

320
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
But we got this other benefit, and that was

321
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage

322
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Dallas on the outside.

323
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Here you see the building in its current state

324
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.

325
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds

326
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that are integrated into the windows themselves,

327
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
again with failsafe mechanisms

328
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,

329
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
if you chose, the operations of the theater

330
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
going on behind, rehearsals and so forth.

331
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
But you also have the ability

332
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to allow the audience to see Dallas,

333
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.

334
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Now, if I'll take you through --

335
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
this is an early concept sketch --

336
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.

337
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Effectively you would have something like this.

338
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:

339
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
"Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.

340
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas

341
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
or vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.

342
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
You'd be able to open portions in order to

343
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
change the procession,

344
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
allow people to come in and out for an intermission,

345
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.

346
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
As I said, all the balconies can move,

347
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
but they can also be disappeared completely.

348
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
The proscenium can fly.

349
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.

350
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea

351
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,

352
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is something that is represented by this.

353
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,

354
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
but at least suggests the ideas.

355
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This building has the ability, in short order,

356
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to go back to a flat floor organization

357
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
such that they can rent it out.

358
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Now, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,

359
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
please consider doing your Christmas party here.

360
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Laughter)

361
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
That allows the company to raise operational budgets

362
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
without having to compete with other venues

363
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
with much larger auditoriums.

364
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
That's an enormous benefit.

365
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So, the theater company has the ability

366
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to do totally hermetic,

367
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
light-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,

368
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
great intimacy Shakespeare,

369
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
but can also do Beckett

370
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.

371
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Here it is in a flat floor configuration.

372
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
The theater has been going through its kind of paces.

373
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Here it is in an end stage configuration.

374
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.

375
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked,

376
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them.

377
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
It was very unusual.

378
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Here it is in a thrust configuration.

379
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And last but not least,

380
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
you see this already has the ability to create events

381
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
in order to generate operational budgets

382
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to overcome the building in fact performing

383
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.

384
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I'm going to show you a brief time lapse.

385
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
As I said, this can be done with only two people,

386
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and with a minimum amount of time.

387
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
This is the first time that actually the changeover was done

388
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and so there is literally thousands of people because

389
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.

390
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.

391
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And think of it being done with just a few people.

392
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Again, just a couple people are required.

393
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
(Laughter)

394
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I promise.

395
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Et voila.

396
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Applause)

397
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
So, just in conclusion, a few shots.

398
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
This is the AT&T Performing Arts Center's

399
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Dee and Charles Wyly Theater.

400
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
There it is at night.

401
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And last but not least the entire AT&T Performing Arts Center.

402
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right

403
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.

404
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And to remind you that here is an example in which

405
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
architecture actually did something.

406
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
But we got to that conclusion

407
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
without understanding where we were going,

408
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
what we knew were a series of issues that the company

409
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and the client was confronted with.

410
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And we took positions with them, and it was through those positions

411
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
that we began to take architectural manifestations

412
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,

413
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
really none of us could ever

414
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
have conceived of initially or individually.

415
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Thank you.

416
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
(Applause)

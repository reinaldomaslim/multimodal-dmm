1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule

2
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:23,000
from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.

3
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history

4
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of compassion and the golden rule.

5
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,

6
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy

7
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
as your average compassion talk.

8
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I want to warn you about that.

9
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.

10
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.

11
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I think it's great that

12
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the leaders of the religions of the world

13
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:57,000
are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles

14
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
that are integral to their faiths.

15
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
At the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit.

16
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I think nature gave them a helping hand here.

17
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
are, in a certain sense, built into human nature.

19
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But I'm also going to argue

20
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,

21
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you realize that just affirming compassion,

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.

23
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There's a lot of work to be done after that.

24
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:36,000
OK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion.

25
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
In the beginning, there was compassion,

26
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and I mean not just when human beings first showed up,

27
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but actually even before that.

28
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,

29
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
even before there were homo sapiens,

30
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
feelings like compassion and love and sympathy

31
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:57,000
had earned their way into the gene pool,

32
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.

33
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It happened through a principle known as kin selection.

34
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And the basic idea of kin selection is that,

35
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
if an animal feels compassion for a close relative,

36
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative,

37
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:22,000
then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes

38
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
underlying the compassion itself.

39
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually

40
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a gene's way of helping itself. OK.

41
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.

42
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier.

43
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This doesn't bother me so much,

44
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion

45
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is kind of self-serving at the genetic level.

46
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection

47
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is just that it means that this kind of compassion

48
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is naturally deployed only within the family.

49
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.

50
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The bad news is that this kin selected compassion

51
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is naturally confined to the family.

52
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,

53
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
a second kind of evolutionary logic.

54
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Biologists call that "reciprocal altruism." OK.

55
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And there, the basic idea is that

56
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:27,000
compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.

57
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion

58
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
as you may have heard in the past,

59
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion

60
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is ultimately self-serving too.

61
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.

62
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.

63
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.

64
0:03:55,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,

65
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
you feel really bad.

66
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But if you read in the newspaper

67
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,

68
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
you can probably live with that.

69
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's just human nature.

70
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So, it's another good news/bad news story.

71
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family

72
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
by this kind of evolutionary logic.

73
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.

74
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So, there's still work to be done.

75
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,

76
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
which I think is kind of good news,

77
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which is that the way that this is played out in the human species,

78
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.

79
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,

80
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but you can go to a hunter gatherer society

81
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,

82
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
no exposure to ethical philosophy,

83
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and you'll find, if you spend time with these people,

84
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,

85
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and that bad deeds should be punished.

86
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.

87
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,

88
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you treat other people well.

89
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And it's good to treat other people well.

90
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.

91
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,

92
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;

93
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we still aren't to universal love,

94
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,

95
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:35,000
it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.

96
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,

97
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?

98
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.

99
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, we have a rationale for that.

100
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.

101
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.

102
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
We have the capacity to carve out exceptions,

103
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
put people in a special category.

104
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison,

105
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you have this impartial judiciary

106
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:13,000
determining who gets excluded from the golden rule --

107
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions

108
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,

109
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is we use a much rougher and readier formula.

110
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival --

111
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family --

112
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.

113
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We all do that,

114
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and you see it all over the world.

115
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
You see it in the Middle East:

116
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.

117
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,

118
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
"Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things

119
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that put them in a special category."

120
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them,

121
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but they impose one on Gaza, and they say,

122
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves."

123
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble.

124
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And it's natural to do that.

125
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us

126
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.

127
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's not going to save the world.

128
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.

129
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Are you on the edges of your seats here?

130
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Good, because before I tell you about that good news,

131
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.

132
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news

133
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that may save the world.

134
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.

135
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's just a quick introduction to game theory.

136
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This won't hurt. Okay.

137
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.

138
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:56,000
If you ask what kind of a situation

139
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is conducive to people becoming friends and allies,

140
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.

141
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And if you ask what kind of situation

142
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is conducive to people defining people as enemies,

143
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it's a zero-sum situation.

144
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So, what do those terms mean?

145
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,

146
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
where there's a winner and a loser.

147
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So, their fortunes add up to zero.

148
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,

149
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
or good for them, bad for you.

150
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Either way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.

151
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, if you're playing doubles,

152
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
then the person on your side of the net

153
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,

154
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win --

155
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.

156
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
That's a non-zero-sum game.

157
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.

158
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:

159
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,

160
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.

161
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You both feel you've won.

162
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.

163
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.

164
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.

165
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,

166
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,

167
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels

168
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation

169
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
with some of their friends or allies.

170
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The deployment of the golden rule

171
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.

172
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness

173
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:39,000
are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule

174
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to kind of work their magic.

175
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
With zero-sum channels you would expect something else.

176
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.

177
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And now I can admit that it might not too,

178
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:56,000
now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.

179
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But it may. And the good news is that history

180
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,

181
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
these webs that can be these channels for compassion.

182
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
You can go back all the way to the stone age:

183
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:2,000
technological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing,

184
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
a lot of transportation and communication technologies --

185
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
has just inexorably made it so that more people

186
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
can be in more non-zero-sum relationships

187
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
with more and more people at greater and greater distances.

188
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
That's the story of civilization.

189
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village

190
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.

191
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.

192
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You've probably heard the term "interdependence"

193
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:53,000
applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.

194
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,

195
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.

196
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And you see this all the time in the modern world.

197
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
You saw it with the recent economic crash,

198
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
where bad things happen in the economy --

199
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
bad for everybody, for much of the world.

200
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world.

201
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence

202
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that this non-zero-sum kind of connection

203
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
can expand the moral compass.

204
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I mean, if you look at the American attitudes

205
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:28,000
toward Japanese during World War II --

206
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
look at the depictions of Japanese

207
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in the American media as just about subhuman,

208
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,

209
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
really without giving it much of a thought --

210
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and you compare that to the attitude now,

211
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.

212
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Any form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship

213
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people.

214
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So, I think that's good.

215
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics.

216
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Environmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat.

217
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of.

218
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:06,000
For example, probably a lot of American Christians

219
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship

220
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
with Muslims halfway around the world,

221
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier

222
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,

223
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists

224
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to threaten American security.

225
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.

226
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.

227
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,

228
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:41,000
why has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?

229
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.

230
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Certainly, a couple of things are that,

231
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
first of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world.

232
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And also, sometimes people don't recognize

233
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.

234
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In both of these areas,

235
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I think politicians can play a role.

236
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
This isn't only about religion.

237
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships,

238
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on,

239
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
in this regard.

240
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,

241
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
when people around the world are looking at them,

242
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
are looking at their nation

243
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and picking up their cues

244
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation --

245
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
like, say, America, or any other nation --

246
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
human psychology is such that they use cues like:

247
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Do we feel we're being respected?

248
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,

249
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,

250
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
mutually profitable relationship with people.

251
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.

252
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.

253
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,

254
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
politicians, religious leaders, and us,

255
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:08,000
it would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" --

256
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes

257
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of people in very different circumstances.

258
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
This is not the same as compassion,

259
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.

260
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story,

261
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:28,000
which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.

262
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:33,000
That's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.

263
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Once we define somebody as an enemy,

264
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:4,000
we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.

265
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American:

266
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:48,000
somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV.

267
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Well, the average American is going to resist

268
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:55,000
the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head

269
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person.

270
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And if you tell them, "Well, they think America disrespects them

271
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.

272
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much

273
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that you kind of hated them briefly"?

274
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.

275
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And, similarly, the person in Iran:

276
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,

277
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
they'll have trouble with that.

278
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination

279
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to a place it doesn't naturally go.

280
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I think it's worth the trouble because,

281
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
again, it just helps us to understand.

282
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags,

283
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:37,000
it helps to understand what makes them do it.

284
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And I think it's good moral exercise.

285
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I would say here is where religious leaders come in,

286
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:5,000
because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people,

287
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain

288
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:57,000
to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think.

289
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.

290
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It's their great calling right now,

291
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations,

292
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:11,000
appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.

293
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:17,000
I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective,

294
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:21,000
as far as compassion and the golden rule go,

295
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:27,000
by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule

296
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:32,000
are in some sense built into human nature.

297
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:37,000
It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed.

298
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And it's going to take real work to change that.

299
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:46,000
But, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.

300
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What is going on

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in this baby's mind?

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
most people, including psychologists,

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
would have said that this baby was irrational,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
illogical, egocentric --

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that he couldn't take the perspective of another person

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or understand cause and effect.

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In the last 20 years,

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
developmental science has completely overturned that picture.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So in some ways,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we think that this baby's thinking

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Let me give you just one example of this.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
One thing that this baby could be thinking about,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that could be going on in his mind,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is trying to figure out

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
what's going on in the mind of that other baby.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And maybe the hardest thing of all

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is to figure out that what other people think and feel

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Anyone who's followed politics can testify

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to how hard that is for some people to get.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We wanted to know

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
if babies and young children

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
could understand this really profound thing about other people.

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now the question is: How could we ask them?

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Babies, after all, can't talk,

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and if you ask a three year-old

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to tell you what he thinks,

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
about ponies and birthdays and things like that.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So how do we actually ask them the question?

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I --

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
was actually to give the babies two bowls of food:

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
one bowl of raw broccoli

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But then what Betty did

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So half the time, she acted

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli --

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
just like a baby and any other sane person.

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But half the time,

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers,

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So she'd act as if what she wanted

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And then she would simply put her hand out and say,

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"Can you give me some?"

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So the question is: What would the baby give her,

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
what they liked or what she liked?

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
just barely walking and talking,

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
On the other hand,

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
if she acted as if she liked the broccoli,

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
like they couldn't figure this out.

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But then after they stared for a long time,

73
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
they would just give her the crackers,

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
what they thought everybody must like.

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So there are two really remarkable things about this.

76
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
have already discovered

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
this really profound fact about human nature,

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that we don't always want the same thing.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to help other people get what they wanted.

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Even more remarkably though,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
this deep, profound fact about human nature

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in the three months from when they were 15 months old.

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So children both know more and learn more

88
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
than we ever would have thought.

89
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that's actually demonstrated it.

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
The question you might ask though is:

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Why do children learn so much?

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And how is it possible for them to learn so much

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in such a short time?

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
they seem pretty useless.

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because we have to put so much time and energy

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
into just keeping them alive.

100
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But if we turn to evolution

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
for an answer to this puzzle

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of why we spend so much time

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
taking care of useless babies,

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it turns out that there's actually an answer.

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If we look across many, many different species of animals,

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
not just us primates,

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but also including other mammals, birds,

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
even marsupials

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
like kangaroos and wombats,

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it turns out that there's a relationship

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
between how long a childhood a species has

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and how big their brains are compared to their bodies

113
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and how smart and flexible they are.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.

115
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
On one side

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
is a New Caledonian crow.

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are incredibly smart birds.

119
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And this is a bird on the cover of science

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
who's learned how to use a tool to get food.

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
On the other hand,

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we have our friend the domestic chicken.

124
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys

125
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
are basically as dumb as dumps.

126
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain,

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and they're not much good at doing anything else.

128
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Well it turns out that the babies,

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
They depend on their moms

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to drop worms in their little open mouths

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
for as long as two years,

133
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which is a really long time in the life of a bird.

134
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Whereas the chickens are actually mature

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
within a couple of months.

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So childhood is the reason

137
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
why the crows end up on the cover of Science

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and the chickens end up in the soup pot.

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There's something about that long childhood

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that seems to be connected

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to knowledge and learning.

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well some animals, like the chicken,

144
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
seem to be beautifully suited

145
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to doing just one thing very well.

146
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So they seem to be beautifully suited

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to pecking grain in one environment.

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Other creatures, like the crows,

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
aren't very good at doing anything in particular,

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but they're extremely good

151
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
at learning about laws of different environments.

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And of course, we human beings

153
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
by far than any other animal.

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We're smarter, we're more flexible,

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we can learn more,

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we survive in more different environments,

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.

160
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And our babies and children are dependent on us

161
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
for much longer than the babies of any other species.

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
My son is 23.

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And at least until they're 23,

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we're still popping those worms

166
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
into those little open mouths.

167
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
All right, why would we see this correlation?

168
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but it has one big disadvantage.

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And that one big disadvantage

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is that, until you actually do all that learning,

173
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you're going to be helpless.

174
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you

175
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and be saying to yourself,

176
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"

177
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You want to know all that

178
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
before the mastodons actually show up.

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem

180
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is with a kind of division of labor.

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.

182
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.

183
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And then as adults,

184
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children

185
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So one way of thinking about it

187
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is that babies and young children

188
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
are like the research and development division of the human species.

189
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So they're the protected blue sky guys

190
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,

191
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and we're production and marketing.

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We have to take all those ideas

193
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that we learned when we were children

194
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and actually put them to use.

195
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Another way of thinking about it

196
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is instead of thinking of babies and children

197
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
as being like defective grownups,

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
we should think about them

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
as being a different developmental stage of the same species --

200
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
kind of like caterpillars and butterflies --

201
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies

202
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who are flitting around the garden and exploring,

203
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and we're the caterpillars

204
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.

205
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn --

206
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,

207
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that's what they're for --

208
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we might expect

209
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And in fact, the baby's brain

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
seems to be the most powerful learning computer

212
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
on the planet.

213
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.

214
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And there's been a revolution

215
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in our understanding of machine learning recently.

216
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy,

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the Reverend Thomas Bayes,

218
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.

219
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And essentially what Bayes did

220
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
was to provide a mathematical way

221
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
using probability theory

222
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to characterize, describe,

223
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the way that scientists find out about the world.

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So what scientists do

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
They go out and test it against the evidence.

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.

228
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Then they test that new hypothesis

229
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and so on and so forth.

230
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.

231
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And that mathematics is at the core

232
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of the best machine learning programs that we have now.

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And some 10 years ago,

234
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So if you want to know what's going on

236
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
underneath those beautiful brown eyes,

237
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I think it actually looks something like this.

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.

239
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations

240
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
with conditional probabilities that they're revising

241
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to figure out how the world works.

242
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.

243
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,

244
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
they look extremely stupid.

245
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
How could it be that children are doing statistics?

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So to test this we used a machine that we have

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
called the Blicket Detector.

248
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is a box that lights up and plays music

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
when you put some things on it and not others.

250
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And using this very simple machine,

251
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
my lab and others have done dozens of studies

252
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
showing just how good babies are

253
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
at learning about the world.

254
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Let me mention just one

255
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.

256
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
If I showed you this detector,

257
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
you would be likely to think to begin with

258
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that the way to make the detector go

259
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
would be to put a block on top of the detector.

260
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But actually, this detector

261
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
works in a bit of a strange way.

262
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector,

263
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,

264
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the detector will actually activate two out of three times.

265
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,

266
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it will only activate two out of six times.

267
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So the unlikely hypothesis

268
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
actually has stronger evidence.

269
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It looks as if the waving

270
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.

271
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,

272
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and we just asked them to make it go.

273
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence

274
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to wave the object on top of the detector.

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.

276
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.

277
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
They're just learning how to count.

278
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But unconsciously,

279
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
they're doing these quite complicated calculations

280
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that will give them a conditional probability measure.

281
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And the other interesting thing

282
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is that they're using that evidence

283
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,

284
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that seems very unlikely to begin with.

285
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,

286
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
we've show that four year-olds are actually better

287
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
at finding out an unlikely hypothesis

288
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.

289
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So in these circumstances,

290
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the children are using statistics to find out about the world,

291
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but after all, scientists also do experiments,

292
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.

293
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"

294
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
or else "playing."

295
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently

296
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that have shown this playing around

297
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is really a kind of experimental research program.

298
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.

299
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.

300
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And what she did was show children

301
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,

302
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and then she showed them an anomaly.

303
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And what you'll see

304
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses

305
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in the space of two minutes.

306
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Video) Boy: How about this?

307
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Same as the other side.

308
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

310
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.

311
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.

312
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Boy: What's making this light up.

313
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

314
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I don't know.

315
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.

316
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Laughter)

317
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,

318
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and this needs to be like this.

319
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.

320
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Boy: That's why.

321
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Oh.

322
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Laughter)

323
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
AG: Now this is his next idea.

324
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
He told the experimenter to do this,

325
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to try putting it out onto the other location.

326
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Not working either.

327
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,

328
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
not here.

329
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Oh, the bottom of this box

330
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
has electricity in here,

331
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but this doesn't have electricity.

332
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.

333
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Boy: It's lighting up.

334
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So when you put four.

335
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So you put four on this one to make it light up

336
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and two on this one to make it light up.

337
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.

338
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Now that is a particularly --

339
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,

340
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.

341
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,

342
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
what they really do is do a series of experiments.

343
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.

344
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?

345
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies

346
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?

347
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,

348
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
a lot of them have said

349
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that babies and young children were barely conscious

350
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
if they were conscious at all.

351
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And I think just the opposite is true.

352
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.

353
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.

354
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And adults' attention and consciousness

355
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
look kind of like a spotlight.

356
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So what happens for adults

357
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
is we decide that something's relevant or important,

358
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
we should pay attention to it.

359
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to

360
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
becomes extremely bright and vivid,

361
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and everything else sort of goes dark.

362
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.

363
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So what happens when we pay attention

364
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,

365
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
sends a signal

366
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,

367
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
more plastic, better at learning,

368
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and shuts down activity

369
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
in all the rest of our brains.

370
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.

371
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
If we look at babies and young children,

372
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
we see something very different.

373
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I think babies and young children

374
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness

375
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
than a spotlight of consciousness.

376
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So babies and young children are very bad

377
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
at narrowing down to just one thing.

378
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But they're very good at taking in lots of information

379
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
from lots of different sources at once.

380
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And if you actually look in their brains,

381
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters

382
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,

383
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.

384
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So when we say that babies and young children

385
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
are bad at paying attention,

386
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.

387
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
So they're bad at getting rid

388
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
of all the interesting things that could tell them something

389
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and just looking at the thing that's important.

390
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,

391
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that we might expect

392
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
from those butterflies who are designed to learn.

393
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Well if we want to think about a way

394
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,

395
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I think the best thing is think about cases

396
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before --

397
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
when we fall in love with someone new,

398
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
or when we're in a new city for the first time.

399
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,

400
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
it expands,

401
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
so that those three days in Paris

402
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
seem to be more full of consciousness and experience

403
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
than all the months of being

404
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.

405
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And by the way, that coffee,

406
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,

407
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
actually mimics the effect

408
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
of those baby neurotransmitters.

409
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
So what's it like to be a baby?

410
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It's like being in love

411
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
in Paris for the first time

412
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
after you've had three double-espressos.

413
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Laughter)

414
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
That's a fantastic way to be,

415
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.

416
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Laughter)

417
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Now it's good to be a grownup.

418
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.

419
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
It's good to be a grownup.

420
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.

421
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort

422
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
into making babies think like adults do.

423
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies,

424
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
to have open-mindedness, open learning,

425
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
imagination, creativity, innovation,

426
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
maybe at least some of the time

427
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
we should be getting the adults

428
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
to start thinking more like children.

429
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
(Applause)

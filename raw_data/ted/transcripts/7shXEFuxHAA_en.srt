1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Music)

6
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Applause)

7
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Okay, so first of all,

8
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,

9
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Applause)

10
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Burniss Travis on the bass,

11
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

12
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano.

13
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Applause)

14
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So the bandstand, as we call it,

15
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
this is an incredible space.

16
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It is really a sacred space.

17
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And one of the things that is really sacred about it

18
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is that you have no opportunity to think about the future,

19
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or the past.

20
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You really are alive right here in this moment.

21
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
There are so many decisions being made

22
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
when you walk on the bandstand.

23
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We had no idea what key we were going to play in.

24
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In the middle, we sort of made our way

25
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
into a song called "Titi Boom."

26
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.

27
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Everyone's listening. We're responding.

28
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You have no time for projected ideas.

29
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So the idea of a mistake:

30
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
From the perspective of a jazz musician,

31
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.

32
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand --

33
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.

34
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The only mistake lies

35
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in that I'm not able to perceive

36
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
what it is that someone else did.

37
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Every "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.

38
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So it's hard to even describe

39
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
what a funny note would be.

40
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,

41
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that sounded like this ...

42
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Music)

43
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.

44
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Music)

45
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
See, these are all right inside of the color palette.

46
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
If you played an E.

47
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
See, these all lie right inside

48
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of this general emotional palette that we were painting.

49
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
If you played an F# though,

50
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Dissonance)

51
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
to most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake.

52
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.

53
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And we're going to play on this palette.

54
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.

55
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And we won't react to it.

56
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He'll introduce it for a second

57
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.

58
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We'll see what happens when we play with this palette.

59
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Music)

60
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.

61
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The only way that I would say it was a mistake

62
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is in that we didn't react to it.

63
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It was an opportunity that was missed.

64
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.

65
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.

66
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We'll all accept his ideas,

67
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or not.

68
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Music)

69
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So you see, he played this note.

70
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I ended up creating a melody out of it.

71
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The texture changed in the drums this time.

72
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intense

73
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in response to how I responded to it.

74
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So there is no mistake.

75
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The only mistake is if I'm not aware,

76
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
if each individual musician is not aware

77
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and accepting enough of his fellow band member

78
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity.

79
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.

80
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's a very purifying experience.

81
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.

82
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.

83
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance?

84
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Well we're jazz musicians,

85
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance.

86
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

87
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.

88
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the other dynamic of it

89
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is that we don't micromanage in jazz.

90
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
You have some people who do.

91
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But what that does

92
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is it actually limits the artistic possibilities.

93
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
If I come up and I dictate to the band

94
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,

95
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and I just jump right in ...

96
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
ready, just play some time.

97
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
One, two, one, two, three, four.

98
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Music)

99
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.

100
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I'm telling them, "You come with me over this way."

101
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
If I really want the music to go there,

102
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the best way for me to do it is to listen.

103
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This is a science of listening.

104
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It has far more to do with what I can perceive

105
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
than what it is that I can do.

106
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,

107
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
the first step for me is

108
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to be patient, to listen to what's going on

109
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and pull from something that's going on around me.

110
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
When you do that, you engage and inspire the other musicians

111
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and they give you more, and gradually it builds.

112
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.

113
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Music)

114
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.

115
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.

116
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.

117
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It's about being here in the moment,

118
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
accepting one another

119
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and allowing creativity to flow.

120
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Thank you.

121
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Applause)

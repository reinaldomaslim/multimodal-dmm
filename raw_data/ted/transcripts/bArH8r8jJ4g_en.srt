1
0:00:12.914,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I suspect that

2
0:00:14.323,000 --> 0:00:15,000
every aid worker in Africa

3
0:00:16.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
comes to a time in her career

4
0:00:17.673,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when she wants to take all the money for her project —

5
0:00:20.989,000 --> 0:00:23,000
maybe it's a school or a training program —

6
0:00:24.091,000 --> 0:00:25,000
pack it in a suitcase,

7
0:00:25.98,000 --> 0:00:28,000
get on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country,

8
0:00:29.964,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and start throwing that money out the window.

9
0:00:33.148,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Because to a veteran aid worker,

10
0:00:35.464,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the idea of putting cold, hard cash

11
0:00:38.171,000 --> 0:00:41,000
into the hands of the poorest people on Earth

12
0:00:41.21,000 --> 0:00:42,000
doesn't sound crazy,

13
0:00:42.865,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it sounds really satisfying.

14
0:00:46.941,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I had that moment right about the 10-year mark,

15
0:00:49.843,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and luckily, that's also when I learned

16
0:00:52.31,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that this idea actually exists,

17
0:00:55.974,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it might be just what the aid system needs.

18
0:00:59.817,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Economists call it an unconditional cash transfer,

19
0:01:02.52,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it's exactly that: It's cash given

20
0:01:04.68,000 --> 0:01:06,000
with no strings attached.

21
0:01:06.952,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Governments in developing countries

22
0:01:08.516,000 --> 0:01:09,000
have been doing this for decades,

23
0:01:10.192,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it's only now, with more evidence

24
0:01:12.724,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and new technology that it's possible

25
0:01:15.915,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to make this a model for delivering aid.

26
0:01:20.234,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's a pretty simple idea, right?

27
0:01:23.148,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Well, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff

28
0:01:27.254,000 --> 0:01:29,000
for the poor?

29
0:01:29.392,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Honestly, I believed that I could do more good

30
0:01:32.935,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with money for the poor

31
0:01:34.881,000 --> 0:01:36,000
than the poor could do for themselves.

32
0:01:37.491,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I held two assumptions:

33
0:01:38.524,000 --> 0:01:4,000
One, that poor people are poor in part

34
0:01:41.113,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because they're uneducated and

35
0:01:43.115,000 --> 0:01:45,000
don't make good choices;

36
0:01:45.275,000 --> 0:01:47,000
two is that we then need people like me

37
0:01:47.986,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to figure out what they need and get it to them.

38
0:01:51.724,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It turns out, the evidence says otherwise.

39
0:01:55.946,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In recent years, researchers have been studying

40
0:01:58.795,000 --> 0:02:01,000
what happens when we give poor people cash.

41
0:02:02.2,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Dozens of studies show across the board

42
0:02:04.871,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that people use cash transfers

43
0:02:07.627,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to improve their own lives.

44
0:02:09.795,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food

45
0:02:12.643,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and give birth to healthier babies.

46
0:02:14.877,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Sri Lankan men invest in their businesses.

47
0:02:17.971,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Researchers who studied our work in Kenya

48
0:02:20.669,000 --> 0:02:22,000
found that people invested in a range of assets,

49
0:02:23.586,000 --> 0:02:27,000
from livestock to equipment to home improvements,

50
0:02:27.936,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and they saw increases in income

51
0:02:30.058,000 --> 0:02:32,000
from business and farming

52
0:02:32.441,000 --> 0:02:35,000
one year after the cash was sent.

53
0:02:36.131,000 --> 0:02:38,000
None of these studies found that people

54
0:02:38.695,000 --> 0:02:4,000
spend more on drinking or smoking

55
0:02:41.104,000 --> 0:02:43,000
or that people work less.

56
0:02:43.609,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In fact, they work more.

57
0:02:47.717,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now, these are all material needs.

58
0:02:50.98,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In Vietnam, elderly recipients used

59
0:02:54.151,000 --> 0:02:58,000
their cash transfers to pay for coffins.

60
0:02:58.662,000 --> 0:03:02,000
As someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong,

61
0:03:02.673,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs

62
0:03:07.4,000 --> 0:03:09,000
deeply humbling.

63
0:03:09.667,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I don't know if I would have chosen to give food

64
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or equipment or coffins,

65
0:03:15.491,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which begs the question:

66
0:03:17.781,000 --> 0:03:19,000
How good are we at allocating resources

67
0:03:20.777,000 --> 0:03:21,000
on behalf of the poor?

68
0:03:22.622,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Are we worth the cost?

69
0:03:25.517,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Again, we can look at empirical evidence

70
0:03:27.46,000 --> 0:03:29,000
on what happens when we give people stuff

71
0:03:30.25,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of our choosing.

72
0:03:32.926,000 --> 0:03:34,000
One very telling study looked at a program in India

73
0:03:35.795,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that gives livestock to the so-called ultra-poor,

74
0:03:39.102,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and they found that 30 percent of recipients

75
0:03:43.023,000 --> 0:03:47,000
had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given

76
0:03:47.176,000 --> 0:03:5,000
for cash.

77
0:03:50.529,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The real irony is,

78
0:03:52.087,000 --> 0:03:54,000
for every 100 dollars worth of assets

79
0:03:54.668,000 --> 0:03:56,000
this program gave someone,

80
0:03:56.82,000 --> 0:04:,000
they spent another 99 dollars to do it.

81
0:04:01.506,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What if, instead, we use technology to put cash,

82
0:04:05.152,000 --> 0:04:09,000
whether from aid agencies or from any one of us

83
0:04:09.739,000 --> 0:04:12,000
directly into a poor person's hands.

84
0:04:13.509,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Today, three in four Kenyans use mobile money,

85
0:04:16.379,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which is basically a bank account that can run

86
0:04:19.202,000 --> 0:04:2,000
on any cell phone.

87
0:04:20.7,000 --> 0:04:23,000
A sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee

88
0:04:24.166,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and with the click of a button

89
0:04:26.204,000 --> 0:04:28,000
send money directly to a recipient's account

90
0:04:29.155,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with no intermediaries.

91
0:04:31.885,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Like the technologies that are disrupting industries

92
0:04:34.748,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in our own lives,

93
0:04:36.547,000 --> 0:04:38,000
payments technology in poor countries

94
0:04:39.11,000 --> 0:04:42,000
could disrupt aid.

95
0:04:42.217,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's spreading so quickly that it's possible

96
0:04:44.529,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to imagine reaching billions

97
0:04:47.061,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of the world's poor this way.

98
0:04:49.86,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly.

99
0:04:52.481,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We're the first organization

100
0:04:54.146,000 --> 0:04:57,000
dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor.

101
0:04:57.319,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We've sent cash to 35,000 people across rural Kenya

102
0:05:01.987,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and Uganda

103
0:05:03.154,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in one-time payments of 1,000 dollars

104
0:05:06.332,000 --> 0:05:08,000
per family.

105
0:05:08.917,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So far, we've looked for the poorest people

106
0:05:11.177,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in the poorest villages, and in this part of the world,

107
0:05:14.48,000 --> 0:05:15,000
they're the ones living in homes

108
0:05:15.924,000 --> 0:05:16,000
made of mud and thatch,

109
0:05:17.102,000 --> 0:05:19,000
not cement and iron.

110
0:05:19.562,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So let's say that's your family.

111
0:05:21.784,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We show up at your door with an Android phone.

112
0:05:24.236,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We'll get your name, take your photo

113
0:05:26.563,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and a photo of your hut

114
0:05:27.979,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and grab the GPS coordinates.

115
0:05:30.454,000 --> 0:05:32,000
That night, we send all the data to the cloud,

116
0:05:32.554,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and each piece gets checked

117
0:05:34.834,000 --> 0:05:35,000
by an independent team

118
0:05:36.712,000 --> 0:05:39,000
using, for one example, satellite images.

119
0:05:40.103,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Then, we'll come back,

120
0:05:42.099,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we'll sell you a basic cell phone

121
0:05:44.49,000 --> 0:05:46,000
if you don't have one already,

122
0:05:46.757,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and a few weeks later,

123
0:05:49.078,000 --> 0:05:51,000
we send money to it.

124
0:05:51.369,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Something that five years ago

125
0:05:52.93,000 --> 0:05:53,000
would have seemed impossible

126
0:05:54.458,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we can now do efficiently

127
0:05:57.343,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and free of corruption.

128
0:05:59.481,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The more cash we give to the poor,

129
0:06:01.797,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and the more evidence we have that it works,

130
0:06:05.453,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the more we have to reconsider

131
0:06:07.861,000 --> 0:06:09,000
everything else we give.

132
0:06:10.35,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Today, the logic behind aid is too often,

133
0:06:13.938,000 --> 0:06:16,000
well, we do at least some good.

134
0:06:17.05,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When we're complacent

135
0:06:18.466,000 --> 0:06:2,000
with that as our bar,

136
0:06:20.836,000 --> 0:06:22,000
when we tell ourselves that giving aid

137
0:06:23.428,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is better than no aid at all,

138
0:06:26.342,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we tend to invest inefficiently,

139
0:06:28.614,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in our own ideas that strike us as innovative,

140
0:06:32.596,000 --> 0:06:34,000
on writing reports,

141
0:06:34.75,000 --> 0:06:37,000
on plane tickets and SUVs.

142
0:06:38.596,000 --> 0:06:4,000
What if the logic was,

143
0:06:40.92,000 --> 0:06:45,000
will we do better than cash given directly?

144
0:06:46.191,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Organizations would have to prove

145
0:06:47.701,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that they're doing more good for the poor

146
0:06:49.93,000 --> 0:06:51,000
than the poor can do for themselves.

147
0:06:52.686,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Of course, giving cash won't create public goods

148
0:06:55.634,000 --> 0:07:,000
like eradicating disease or building strong institutions,

149
0:07:00.952,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but it could set a higher bar

150
0:07:03.178,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for how we help individual families

151
0:07:06.14,000 --> 0:07:09,000
improve their lives.

152
0:07:09.166,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I believe in aid.

153
0:07:10.729,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I believe most aid is better than just

154
0:07:13.828,000 --> 0:07:14,000
throwing money out of a plane.

155
0:07:15.74,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I am also absolutely certain

156
0:07:18.288,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that a lot of aid today

157
0:07:20.521,000 --> 0:07:23,000
isn't better than giving directly to the poor.

158
0:07:24.046,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I hope that one day, it will be.

159
0:07:27.922,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Thank you.

160
0:07:29.978,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Applause)

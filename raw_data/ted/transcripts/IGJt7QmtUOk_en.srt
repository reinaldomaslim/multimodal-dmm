1
0:00:13.341,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Take a minute

2
0:00:14.516,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and think of yourself as the leader of a country.

3
0:00:18.571,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And let's say one of your biggest priorities

4
0:00:21.349,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is to provide your citizens with high-quality healthcare.

5
0:00:26.047,000 --> 0:00:27,000
How would you go about it?

6
0:00:27.952,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Build more hospitals?

7
0:00:29.833,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Open more medical colleges?

8
0:00:31.928,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Invest in clinical innovation?

9
0:00:35.17,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But what if your country's health system was fundamentally broken?

10
0:00:39.393,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Whether it's doctor absenteeism,

11
0:00:41.703,000 --> 0:00:44,000
drug stock-outs or poor quality of care.

12
0:00:45.45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Where would you start then?

13
0:00:48.387,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I'm a management consultant,

14
0:00:50.212,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and for the last three years,

15
0:00:52.07,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I've been working on a project

16
0:00:54.069,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to improve the public heath system of Rajasthan,

17
0:00:57.593,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a state in India.

18
0:01:00.287,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And during the course of the project,

19
0:01:02.596,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we actually discovered something profound.

20
0:01:06.525,000 --> 0:01:1,000
More doctors, better facilities, clinical innovation --

21
0:01:11.514,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they are all important.

22
0:01:13.839,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But nothing changes without one key ingredient.

23
0:01:18.339,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Motivation.

24
0:01:21.157,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But motivation is a tricky thing.

25
0:01:23.474,000 --> 0:01:29,000
If you've led a team, raised a child or tried to change a personal habit,

26
0:01:29.831,000 --> 0:01:32,000
you know that motivation doesn't just appear.

27
0:01:33.665,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Something has to change to make you care.

28
0:01:37.859,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And if there's one thing that all of us humans care about,

29
0:01:42.623,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it's an inherent desire to shine in front of society.

30
0:01:47.992,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So that's exactly what we did.

31
0:01:50.739,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We decided to focus on the citizen:

32
0:01:54.223,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the people who the system was supposed to serve in the first place.

33
0:01:59.76,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And today, I'd like to tell you

34
0:02:02.617,000 --> 0:02:07,000
how Rajasthan has transformed its public health system dramatically

35
0:02:07.744,000 --> 0:02:1,000
by using the citizen to trigger motivation.

36
0:02:12.865,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now, Rajasthan is one of India's largest states,

37
0:02:17.117,000 --> 0:02:19,000
with a population of nearly 80 million.

38
0:02:20.927,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That's larger than the United Kingdom.

39
0:02:24.863,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But the similarities probably end there.

40
0:02:28.434,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In 2016, when my team was called in

41
0:02:31.713,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to start working with the public health system of Rajasthan,

42
0:02:35.784,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we found it in a state of crisis.

43
0:02:39.292,000 --> 0:02:42,000
For example, the neonatal mortality rate --

44
0:02:42.924,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that's the number of newborns who die before their first month birthday --

45
0:02:48.178,000 --> 0:02:51,000
was 10 times higher than that of the UK.

46
0:02:53.069,000 --> 0:02:54,000
No wonder then that citizens were saying,

47
0:02:55.053,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Hey, I don't want to go to a public health facility."

48
0:02:58.879,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In India, if you wanted to see a doctor in a public health facility,

49
0:03:03.819,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you would go to a "PHC," or "primary health center."

50
0:03:08.573,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And at least 40 patients are expected to go to a PHC every day.

51
0:03:14.673,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But in Rajasthan, only one out of four PHCs

52
0:03:18.784,000 --> 0:03:2,000
was seeing this minimum number of patients.

53
0:03:21.474,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In other words, people had lost faith in the system.

54
0:03:27.352,000 --> 0:03:29,000
When we delved deeper,

55
0:03:29.543,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we realized that lack of accountability is at the core of it.

56
0:03:35.51,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Picture this.

57
0:03:37.153,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Sudha, a daily-wage earner,

58
0:03:39.828,000 --> 0:03:41,000
realizes that her one-year-old daughter

59
0:03:42.748,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is suffering from uncontrollable dysentery.

60
0:03:46.337,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So she decides to take the day off.

61
0:03:48.591,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's a loss of about 350 rupees or five dollars.

62
0:03:53.377,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And she picks up her daughter in her arms

63
0:03:56.204,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and walks for five kilometers to the government PHC.

64
0:04:00.649,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But the doctor isn't there.

65
0:04:03.903,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So she takes the next day off, again,

66
0:04:06.823,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and comes back to the PHC.

67
0:04:09.244,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This time, the doctor is there,

68
0:04:11.336,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but the pharmacist tells her

69
0:04:13.086,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that the free drugs that she's entitled to have run out,

70
0:04:16.458,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because they forgot to reorder them on time.

71
0:04:19.871,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So now, she rushes to the private medical center,

72
0:04:22.569,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and as she's rushing there,

73
0:04:23.934,000 --> 0:04:27,000
looking at her daughter's condition worsening with every passing hour,

74
0:04:28.125,000 --> 0:04:3,000
she can't help but wonder

75
0:04:30.149,000 --> 0:04:32,000
if she should have gone to the private medical center

76
0:04:32.687,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in the first place

77
0:04:33.887,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and payed the 350 rupees for the consultation and drugs.

78
0:04:40.654,000 --> 0:04:46,000
No one is held accountable for this incredible failure of the system.

79
0:04:48.273,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Costing time, money and heartache to Sudha.

80
0:04:55.945,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And this is something that just had to be fixed.

81
0:04:59.319,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now, as all good consultants,

82
0:05:02.342,000 --> 0:05:05,000
we decided that data-driven reviews

83
0:05:05.787,000 --> 0:05:08,000
had to be the answer to improve accountability.

84
0:05:09.509,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So we created these fancy performance dashboards

85
0:05:13.421,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to help make the review meetings of the health department

86
0:05:16.342,000 --> 0:05:18,000
much more effective.

87
0:05:19.255,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But nothing changed.

88
0:05:21.604,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Discussion after discussion,

89
0:05:23.657,000 --> 0:05:25,000
meeting after meeting,

90
0:05:26.101,000 --> 0:05:28,000
nothing changed.

91
0:05:29.244,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And that's when it struck me.

92
0:05:31.355,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You see, public systems

93
0:05:33.363,000 --> 0:05:36,000
have always been governed through internal mechanisms,

94
0:05:36.913,000 --> 0:05:38,000
like review meetings.

95
0:05:39.683,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And over time,

96
0:05:41.143,000 --> 0:05:44,000
their accountability to the citizen has been diluted.

97
0:05:45.564,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So why not bring the citizen back into the equation,

98
0:05:49.115,000 --> 0:05:52,000
perhaps by using the citizen promises?

99
0:05:52.559,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Couldn't that trigger motivation?

100
0:05:56.464,000 --> 0:06:,000
We started with what I like to call the coffee shop strategy.

101
0:06:01.454,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You've probably seen one of these signs in a coffee shop,

102
0:06:05.073,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which says,

103
0:06:06.343,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"If you don't get your receipt, the coffee is free."

104
0:06:11.235,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, the cashier has no option

105
0:06:14.497,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but to give you a receipt each time.

106
0:06:18.719,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So we took this strategy and applied it to Rajasthan.

107
0:06:23.901,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We worked with the government

108
0:06:25.734,000 --> 0:06:3,000
on a program to revive 300 PHCs across the state,

109
0:06:31.178,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and we got them to paint very clear citizen promises along the wall.

110
0:06:37.718,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"We assure you that you will have a doctor each time."

111
0:06:42.297,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"We assure you that you will get your free drugs each time."

112
0:06:46.299,000 --> 0:06:47,000
"We assure you

113
0:06:47.553,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that you will get your free diagnostics each time."

114
0:06:51.211,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And finally, we worked with elected representatives

115
0:06:54.633,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to launch these revived PHCs,

116
0:06:57.853,000 --> 0:07:,000
who shared the citizen promises with the community

117
0:07:01.21,000 --> 0:07:02,000
with a lot of fanfare.

118
0:07:04.21,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, the promise was out there in the open.

119
0:07:08.89,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Failure would be embarrassing.

120
0:07:12.073,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The system had to start delivering.

121
0:07:16.207,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And deliver it did.

122
0:07:18.95,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Doctor availability went up,

123
0:07:21.212,000 --> 0:07:22,000
medicines came on hand,

124
0:07:23.098,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and as a result,

125
0:07:24.609,000 --> 0:07:28,000
patient visits went up by 20 percent in less than a year.

126
0:07:30.252,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The public health system was getting back into business.

127
0:07:36.02,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But there was still a long distance to go.

128
0:07:38.949,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Change isn't that easy.

129
0:07:41.544,000 --> 0:07:44,000
An exasperated doctor once told me,

130
0:07:44.641,000 --> 0:07:47,000
"I really want to transform the maternal health in my community,

131
0:07:48.602,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but I just don't have enough nurses."

132
0:07:51.426,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now, resources like nurses

133
0:07:53.869,000 --> 0:07:56,000
are actually controlled by administrative officers

134
0:07:57.385,000 --> 0:07:58,000
who the doctors report to.

135
0:07:59.734,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And while the doctors were now motivated,

136
0:08:02.187,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the administrative officers simply weren't motivated enough

137
0:08:06.076,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to help the doctors.

138
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is where the head of the public health department,

139
0:08:12.251,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Ms. Veenu Gupta, came up with a brilliant idea.

140
0:08:16.188,000 --> 0:08:19,000
A monthly ranking of all districts.

141
0:08:20.304,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And this ranking would assess the performance of every district

142
0:08:24.318,000 --> 0:08:25,000
on each major disease

143
0:08:26.204,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and each major procedure.

144
0:08:29.125,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But here's the best part.

145
0:08:30.868,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We made the ranking go public.

146
0:08:33.654,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We put the ranking on the website,

147
0:08:35.742,000 --> 0:08:37,000
we put the ranking on social media,

148
0:08:38.106,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and before you knew it, the media got involved,

149
0:08:41.03,000 --> 0:08:44,000
with newspaper articles on which districts were doing well

150
0:08:44.649,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and which ones weren't.

151
0:08:47.402,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And we didn't just want the rankings

152
0:08:49.943,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to impact the best- and the worst-performing districts.

153
0:08:52.934,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We wanted the rankings to motivate every district.

154
0:08:57.72,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So we took inspiration from soccer leagues,

155
0:09:00.625,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and created a three-tiered ranking system,

156
0:09:04.268,000 --> 0:09:06,000
whereby every quarter,

157
0:09:06.827,000 --> 0:09:08,000
if a district's performance were to decline,

158
0:09:09.756,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you could get relegated to the lower tier.

159
0:09:12.938,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But if the district's performance were to improve,

160
0:09:15.823,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you could get promoted to the premiere league.

161
0:09:19.538,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The rankings were a big success.

162
0:09:22.077,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It generated tremendous excitement,

163
0:09:24.482,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and districts began vying with each other to be known as exemplars.

164
0:09:30.292,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's actually very simple, if you think about it.

165
0:09:33.329,000 --> 0:09:37,000
If the performance data is only being reviewed by your manager

166
0:09:38.242,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in internal settings,

167
0:09:40.322,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it simply isn't motivating enough.

168
0:09:43.379,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But if that data is out there,

169
0:09:46.085,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in the open, for the community to see,

170
0:09:49.53,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that's a very different picture.

171
0:09:52.847,000 --> 0:09:54,000
That just unlocks a competitive spirit

172
0:09:55.601,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which is inherent in each and every one of us.

173
0:09:59.727,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So now, when you put these two together,

174
0:10:02.576,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the coffee shop strategy and public competition,

175
0:10:06.648,000 --> 0:10:08,000
you now had a public health system

176
0:10:09.351,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which was significantly more motivated to improve citizen health.

177
0:10:15.565,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And now that you had a more motivated health system,

178
0:10:19.114,000 --> 0:10:22,000
it was actually a system that was now much more ready for support.

179
0:10:23.228,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Because now, there is a pull for the support,

180
0:10:25.807,000 --> 0:10:28,000
whether it's resources, data or skill building.

181
0:10:30.667,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Let me share an example.

182
0:10:32.921,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I was once at a district meeting in the district of Ajmer.

183
0:10:37.347,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is one of the districts that had been rising rapidly

184
0:10:40.507,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in the rankings.

185
0:10:42.346,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And there were a group of passionate doctors

186
0:10:44.49,000 --> 0:10:48,000
who were discussing ideas on how to better support their teams.

187
0:10:49.485,000 --> 0:10:52,000
One of the doctors had up-skilled health workers

188
0:10:52.945,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to tackle the problem of nurse shortages.

189
0:10:56.3,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Another doctor was using WhatsApp in creative ways

190
0:10:59.942,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to share information and ideas with his frontline workers.

191
0:11:04.101,000 --> 0:11:05,000
For example,

192
0:11:05.331,000 --> 0:11:08,000
where are the children who are missing from immunization?

193
0:11:09.173,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And how do you convince the mothers

194
0:11:11.086,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to actually bring their children for immunization?

195
0:11:14.514,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And because their teams were now significantly motivated,

196
0:11:18.379,000 --> 0:11:2,000
they were simply lapping up the support,

197
0:11:20.911,000 --> 0:11:23,000
because they wanted to perform better and better.

198
0:11:26.204,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Broken systems certainly need more resources and tools.

199
0:11:32.879,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But they won't drive much impact

200
0:11:35.442,000 --> 0:11:38,000
if you don't first address the motivation challenge.

201
0:11:39.768,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Once the motivation tide begins to shift,

202
0:11:43.228,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that's when you get the real returns off resources and tools.

203
0:11:50.274,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But I still haven't answered a key question.

204
0:11:53.328,000 --> 0:11:56,000
What happened to the performance of Rajasthan's public health system?

205
0:11:58.535,000 --> 0:12:01,000
In 2016, when our work began,

206
0:12:01.998,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the government of India and the World Bank

207
0:12:05.109,000 --> 0:12:07,000
came out with a public health index.

208
0:12:08.371,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Rajasthan was ranked 20th out of 21 large states.

209
0:12:14.353,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But in 2018,

210
0:12:16.075,000 --> 0:12:18,000
when the next ranking came out,

211
0:12:18.241,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Rajasthan showed one of the highest improvements

212
0:12:21.069,000 --> 0:12:23,000
among all large states in India,

213
0:12:23.49,000 --> 0:12:25,000
leapfrogging four positions.

214
0:12:26.204,000 --> 0:12:29,000
For example, it showed one of the highest reductions

215
0:12:29.682,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in neonatal mortality,

216
0:12:31.966,000 --> 0:12:35,000
with 3,000 additional newborn lives being saved every year.

217
0:12:37.751,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Typically, public health transformations take a long time, even decades.

218
0:12:44.052,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But this approach had delivered results

219
0:12:46.871,000 --> 0:12:47,000
in two years.

220
0:12:50.387,000 --> 0:12:51,000
But here's the best part.

221
0:12:52.164,000 --> 0:12:56,000
There is actually nothing Rajasthan-specific about what we learned.

222
0:12:57.198,000 --> 0:13:02,000
In fact, this approach of using the citizen to trigger motivation

223
0:13:02.508,000 --> 0:13:05,000
is not even limited to public health systems.

224
0:13:06.969,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I sincerely believe that if there is any public system,

225
0:13:11.802,000 --> 0:13:12,000
in any country,

226
0:13:13.421,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that is in inertia,

227
0:13:15.332,000 --> 0:13:17,000
then we need to bring back the motivation.

228
0:13:18.601,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And a great way to trigger the motivation

229
0:13:21.768,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is to increase transparency to the citizen.

230
0:13:26.379,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We can do this with education

231
0:13:28.315,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and sanitation and even political representation.

232
0:13:32.863,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Government schools can compete publicly on the basis of student enrollment.

233
0:13:38.144,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Cities and towns, on the basis of cleanliness.

234
0:13:41.24,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And politicians on the basis of a scorecard

235
0:13:43.93,000 --> 0:13:46,000
of how exactly they're improving citizen lives.

236
0:13:49.117,000 --> 0:13:52,000
There are many broken systems out there in the world.

237
0:13:53.236,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We need to bring back their motivation.

238
0:13:56.841,000 --> 0:13:58,000
The citizen is waiting.

239
0:13:59.397,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We must act today.

240
0:14:02.095,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Thank you very much.

241
0:14:03.468,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:13.64,000 --> 0:00:17,000
"To do two things at once is to do neither."

3
0:00:17.88,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's a great smackdown of multitasking, isn't it,

4
0:00:20.68,000 --> 0:00:23,000
often attributed to the Roman writer Publilius Syrus,

5
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
although you know how these things are, he probably never said it.

6
0:00:28.64,000 --> 0:00:31,000
What I'm interested in, though, is -- is it true?

7
0:00:31.96,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I mean, it's obviously true for emailing at the dinner table

8
0:00:35.68,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or texting while driving or possibly for live tweeting at TED Talk, as well.

9
0:00:41.08,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But I'd like to argue that for an important kind of activity,

10
0:00:45.8,000 --> 0:00:47,000
doing two things at once -- or three or even four --

11
0:00:48.64,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is exactly what we should be aiming for.

12
0:00:51.8,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Look no further than Albert Einstein.

13
0:00:54.56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In 1905, he published four remarkable scientific papers.

14
0:00:58.76,000 --> 0:00:59,000
One of them was on Brownian motion,

15
0:01:00.72,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it provided empirical evidence that atoms exist,

16
0:01:04.08,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and it laid out the basic mathematics behind most of financial economics.

17
0:01:08.32,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Another one was on the theory of special relativity.

18
0:01:11.2,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Another one was on the photoelectric effect,

19
0:01:13.92,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that's why solar panels work, it's a nice one.

20
0:01:17.28,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Gave him the Nobel prize for that one.

21
0:01:19.52,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the fourth introduced an equation you might have heard of:

22
0:01:22.68,000 --> 0:01:24,000
E equals mc squared.

23
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So, tell me again how you shouldn't do several things at once.

24
0:01:28.6,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, obviously, working simultaneously

25
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
on Brownian motion, special relativity and the photoelectric effect --

26
0:01:35.92,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it's not exactly the same kind of multitasking

27
0:01:38.48,000 --> 0:01:4,000
as Snapchatting while you're watching "Westworld."

28
0:01:41.12,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Very different.

29
0:01:42.6,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And Einstein, yeah, well, Einstein's -- he's Einstein,

30
0:01:46.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
he's one of a kind, he's unique.

31
0:01:48.68,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But the pattern of behavior that Einstein was demonstrating,

32
0:01:51.92,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that's not unique at all.

33
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's very common among highly creative people,

34
0:01:57.84,000 --> 0:01:59,000
both artists and scientists,

35
0:02:00.52,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I'd like to give it a name:

36
0:02:02.24,000 --> 0:02:04,000
slow-motion multitasking.

37
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Slow-motion multitasking feels like a counterintuitive idea.

38
0:02:10.56,000 --> 0:02:11,000
What I'm describing here

39
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is having multiple projects on the go at the same time,

40
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and you move backwards and forwards between topics as the mood takes you,

41
0:02:20.4,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or as the situation demands.

42
0:02:22.4,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But the reason it seems counterintuitive

43
0:02:24.8,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is because we're used to lapsing into multitasking out of desperation.

44
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We're in a hurry, we want to do everything at once.

45
0:02:32.72,000 --> 0:02:36,000
If we were willing to slow multitasking down,

46
0:02:36.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we might find that it works quite brilliantly.

47
0:02:41.72,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Sixty years ago, a young psychologist by the name of Bernice Eiduson

48
0:02:46.44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
began a long research project

49
0:02:48.44,000 --> 0:02:51,000
into the personalities and the working habits

50
0:02:51.56,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of 40 leading scientists.

51
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Einstein was already dead,

52
0:02:55.96,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but four of her subjects won Nobel prizes,

53
0:02:58.92,000 --> 0:03:,000
including Linus Pauling and Richard Feynman.

54
0:03:02.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The research went on for decades,

55
0:03:04.2,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in fact, it continued even after professor Eiduson herself had died.

56
0:03:08.48,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And one of the questions that it answered

57
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:17,000
was, "How is it that some scientists are able to go on producing important work

58
0:03:17.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
right through their lives?"

59
0:03:19.68,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What is it about these people?

60
0:03:21.36,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Is it their personality, is it their skill set,

61
0:03:25.28,000 --> 0:03:27,000
their daily routines, what?

62
0:03:28.4,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Well, a pattern that emerged was clear, and I think to some people surprising.

63
0:03:34.52,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The top scientists kept changing the subject.

64
0:03:39.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
They would shift topics repeatedly

65
0:03:42.12,000 --> 0:03:46,000
during their first 100 published research papers.

66
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Do you want to guess how often?

67
0:03:48.36,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Three times?

68
0:03:50.12,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Five times?

69
0:03:52.28,000 --> 0:03:56,000
No. On average, the most enduringly creative scientists

70
0:03:56.44,000 --> 0:04:02,000
switched topics 43 times in their first 100 research papers.

71
0:04:03.84,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Seems that the secret to creativity is multitasking

72
0:04:08.64,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in slow motion.

73
0:04:11.4,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Eiduson's research suggests we need to reclaim multitasking

74
0:04:15.2,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and remind ourselves how powerful it can be.

75
0:04:18.32,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And she's not the only person to have found this.

76
0:04:20.68,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Different researchers,

77
0:04:21.92,000 --> 0:04:24,000
using different methods to study different highly creative people

78
0:04:25.52,000 --> 0:04:28,000
have found that very often they have multiple projects in progress

79
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
at the same time,

80
0:04:30.399,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and they're also far more likely than most of us to have serious hobbies.

81
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Slow-motion multitasking among creative people is ubiquitous.

82
0:04:40.48,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So, why?

83
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I think there are three reasons.

84
0:04:44.76,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the first is the simplest.

85
0:04:47.32,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Creativity often comes when you take an idea from its original context

86
0:04:51.6,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you move it somewhere else.

87
0:04:53.12,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's easier to think outside the box

88
0:04:54.88,000 --> 0:04:57,000
if you spend your time clambering from one box into another.

89
0:04:58.84,000 --> 0:05:03,000
For an example of this, consider the original eureka moment.

90
0:05:04.52,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Archimedes -- he's wrestling with a difficult problem.

91
0:05:08.2,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And he realizes, in a flash,

92
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:13,000
he can solve it, using the displacement of water.

93
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And if you believe the story,

94
0:05:16.12,000 --> 0:05:19,000
this idea comes to him as he's taking a bath,

95
0:05:19.64,000 --> 0:05:24,000
lowering himself in, and he's watching the water level rise and fall.

96
0:05:24.84,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And if solving a problem while having a bath isn't multitasking,

97
0:05:29.48,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I don't know what is.

98
0:05:32.2,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The second reason that multitasking can work

99
0:05:34.64,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is that learning to do one thing well

100
0:05:38.04,000 --> 0:05:4,000
can often help you do something else.

101
0:05:40.6,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Any athlete can tell you about the benefits of cross-training.

102
0:05:43.6,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's possible to cross-train your mind, too.

103
0:05:47.4,000 --> 0:05:52,000
A few years ago, researchers took 18 randomly chosen medical students

104
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and they enrolled them in a course at the Philadelphia Museum of Art,

105
0:05:57.68,000 --> 0:06:01,000
where they learned to criticize and analyze works of visual art.

106
0:06:02.48,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And at the end of the course,

107
0:06:04.36,000 --> 0:06:06,000
these students were compared with a control group

108
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of their fellow medical students.

109
0:06:08.6,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And the ones who had taken the art course

110
0:06:11.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
had become substantially better at performing tasks

111
0:06:15.2,000 --> 0:06:19,000
such as diagnosing diseases of the eye by analyzing photographs.

112
0:06:20.08,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They'd become better eye doctors.

113
0:06:22.8,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So if we want to become better at what we do,

114
0:06:25.84,000 --> 0:06:27,000
maybe we should spend some time doing something else,

115
0:06:28.4,000 --> 0:06:31,000
even if the two fields appear to be as completely distinct

116
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
as ophthalmology and the history of art.

117
0:06:36.36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And if you'd like an example of this,

118
0:06:39.2,000 --> 0:06:42,000
should we go for a less intimidating example than Einstein? OK.

119
0:06:42.56,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Michael Crichton, creator of "Jurassic Park" and "E.R."

120
0:06:46.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So in the 1970s, he originally trained as a doctor,

121
0:06:50.32,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but then he wrote novels

122
0:06:52.88,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and he directed the original "Westworld" movie.

123
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But also, and this is less well-known,

124
0:06:58.32,000 --> 0:06:59,000
he also wrote nonfiction books,

125
0:07:00.08,000 --> 0:07:03,000
about art, about medicine, about computer programming.

126
0:07:04.48,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So in 1995, he enjoyed the fruits of all this variety

127
0:07:09.56,000 --> 0:07:13,000
by penning the world's most commercially successful book.

128
0:07:14.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And the world's most commercially successful TV series.

129
0:07:19.68,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And the world's most commercially successful movie.

130
0:07:24.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In 1996, he did it all over again.

131
0:07:29.24,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There's a third reason

132
0:07:30.92,000 --> 0:07:34,000
why slow-motion multitasking can help us solve problems.

133
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It can provide assistance when we're stuck.

134
0:07:38.96,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This can't happen in an instant.

135
0:07:41.2,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So, imagine that feeling of working on a crossword puzzle

136
0:07:44.6,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and you can't figure out the answer,

137
0:07:46.4,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and the reason you can't is because the wrong answer is stuck in your head.

138
0:07:50.6,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's very easy -- just go and do something else.

139
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You know, switch topics, switch context,

140
0:07:56.04,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you'll forget the wrong answer

141
0:07:57.52,000 --> 0:08:,000
and that gives the right answer space to pop into the front of your mind.

142
0:08:02.08,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But on the slower timescale that interests me,

143
0:08:05.88,000 --> 0:08:07,000
being stuck is a much more serious thing.

144
0:08:08.92,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You get turned down for funding.

145
0:08:11.76,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Your cell cultures won't grow, your rockets keep crashing.

146
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Nobody wants to publish you fantasy novel about a school for wizards.

147
0:08:21.04,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Or maybe you just can't find the solution to the problem that you're working on.

148
0:08:25.56,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And being stuck like that means stasis, stress,

149
0:08:30.32,000 --> 0:08:31,000
possibly even depression.

150
0:08:33.28,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But if you have another exciting, challenging project to work on,

151
0:08:38.48,000 --> 0:08:42,000
being stuck on one is just an opportunity to do something else.

152
0:08:42.64,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We could all get stuck sometimes, even Albert Einstein.

153
0:08:46.64,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Ten years after the original, miraculous year that I described,

154
0:08:51.039,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Einstein was putting together the pieces of his theory of general relativity,

155
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
his greatest achievement.

156
0:08:58.68,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And he was exhausted.

157
0:09:01.08,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And so he turned to an easier problem.

158
0:09:03.88,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He proposed the stimulated emission of radiation.

159
0:09:07.48,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Which, as you may know, is the S in laser.

160
0:09:12.32,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So he's laying down the theoretical foundation for the laser beam,

161
0:09:16.84,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and then, while he's doing that,

162
0:09:18.72,000 --> 0:09:21,000
he moves back to general relativity, and he's refreshed.

163
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He sees what the theory implies --

164
0:09:25.32,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that the universe isn't static.

165
0:09:28.68,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's expanding.

166
0:09:30.32,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's an idea so staggering,

167
0:09:32.44,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Einstein can't bring himself to believe it for years.

168
0:09:37.68,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Look, if you get stuck

169
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and you get the ball rolling on laser beams,

170
0:09:45.52,000 --> 0:09:46,000
you're in pretty good shape.

171
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So, that's the case for slow-motion multitasking.

173
0:09:52.52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And I'm not promising that it's going to turn you into Einstein.

174
0:09:55.56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I'm not even promising it's going to turn you into Michael Crichton.

175
0:09:58.8,000 --> 0:10:,000
But it is a powerful way to organize our creative lives.

176
0:10:03.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But there's a problem.

177
0:10:06.36,000 --> 0:10:11,000
How do we stop all of these projects becoming completely overwhelming?

178
0:10:12.52,000 --> 0:10:15,000
How do we keep all these ideas straight in our minds?

179
0:10:16.92,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Well, here's a simple solution, a practical solution

180
0:10:20.92,000 --> 0:10:23,000
from the great American choreographer, Twyla Tharp.

181
0:10:24.44,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Over the last few decades,

182
0:10:26.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
she's blurred boundaries, mixed genres, won prizes,

183
0:10:30.76,000 --> 0:10:34,000
danced to the music of everybody, from Philip Glass to Billy Joel.

184
0:10:35.56,000 --> 0:10:36,000
She's written three books.

185
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I mean, she's a slow-motion multitasker, of course she is.

186
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:45,000
She says, "You have to be all things.

187
0:10:45.84,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Why exclude?

188
0:10:47.48,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You have to be everything."

189
0:10:51.24,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And Tharp's method

190
0:10:53.64,000 --> 0:10:57,000
for preventing all of these different projects from becoming overwhelming

191
0:10:58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is a simple one.

192
0:10:59.32,000 --> 0:11:01,000
She gives each project a big cardboard box,

193
0:11:01.88,000 --> 0:11:03,000
writes the name of the project on the side of the box.

194
0:11:04.6,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And into it, she tosses DVDs and books, magazine cuttings,

195
0:11:09.04,000 --> 0:11:1,000
theater programs, physical objects,

196
0:11:11.04,000 --> 0:11:15,000
really anything that's provided a source of creative inspiration.

197
0:11:16.04,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And she writes,

198
0:11:17.8,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"The box means I never have to worry about forgetting.

199
0:11:22.88,000 --> 0:11:24,000
One of the biggest fears for a creative person

200
0:11:25.84,000 --> 0:11:27,000
is that some brilliant idea will get lost

201
0:11:28.32,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because you didn't write it down and put it in a safe place.

202
0:11:32.92,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I don't worry about that.

203
0:11:34.72,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Because I know where to find it.

204
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's all in the box."

205
0:11:41.48,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You can manage many ideas like this,

206
0:11:43.64,000 --> 0:11:47,000
either in physical boxes or in their digital equivalents.

207
0:11:48.32,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So, I would like to urge you

208
0:11:50.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to embrace the art of slow-motion multitasking.

209
0:11:54.72,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Not because you're in a hurry,

210
0:11:56.8,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but because you're in no hurry at all.

211
0:12:01.36,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And I want to give you one final example,

212
0:12:04.08,000 --> 0:12:06,000
my favorite example.

213
0:12:06.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Charles Darwin.

214
0:12:08.2,000 --> 0:12:12,000
A man whose slow-burning multitasking is so staggering,

215
0:12:12.92,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I need a diagram to explain it all to you.

216
0:12:16.12,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We know what Darwin was doing at different times,

217
0:12:18.48,000 --> 0:12:21,000
because the creativity researchers Howard Gruber and Sara Davis

218
0:12:22.2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
have analyzed his diaries and his notebooks.

219
0:12:25.12,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So, when he left school, age of 18,

220
0:12:27.72,000 --> 0:12:29,000
he was initially interested in two fields,

221
0:12:30.36,000 --> 0:12:33,000
zoology and geology.

222
0:12:33.64,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Pretty soon, he signed up to be the onboard naturalist on the "Beagle."

223
0:12:38.12,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is the ship that eventually took five years

224
0:12:40.96,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to sail all the way around the southern oceans of the Earth,

225
0:12:44.48,000 --> 0:12:46,000
stopping at the Galápagos, passing through the Indian ocean.

226
0:12:47.32,000 --> 0:12:49,000
While he was on the "Beagle," he began researching coral reefs.

227
0:12:50.32,000 --> 0:12:53,000
This is a great synergy between his two interests

228
0:12:53.6,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in zoology and geology,

229
0:12:55.12,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and it starts to get him thinking about slow processes.

230
0:13:00.72,000 --> 0:13:02,000
But when he gets back from the voyage,

231
0:13:03.52,000 --> 0:13:07,000
his interests start to expand even further: psychology, botany;

232
0:13:08.2,000 --> 0:13:09,000
for the rest of his life,

233
0:13:09.56,000 --> 0:13:12,000
he's moving backwards and forwards between these different fields.

234
0:13:13.2,000 --> 0:13:15,000
He never quite abandons any of them.

235
0:13:16.08,000 --> 0:13:19,000
In 1837, he begins work on two very interesting projects.

236
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
One of them: earthworms.

237
0:13:22.84,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The other, a little notebook which he titles

238
0:13:26.44,000 --> 0:13:28,000
"The transmutation of species."

239
0:13:29.36,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Then, Darwin starts studying my field, economics.

240
0:13:35.32,000 --> 0:13:39,000
He reads a book by the economist Thomas Malthus.

241
0:13:40.2,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And he has his eureka moment.

242
0:13:42.44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
In a flash, he realizes how species could emerge and evolve slowly,

243
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
through this process of the survival of the fittest.

244
0:13:51.08,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It all comes to him, he writes it all down,

245
0:13:53.4,000 --> 0:13:56,000
every single important element of the theory of evolution,

246
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
in that notebook.

247
0:13:58.92,000 --> 0:14:01,000
But then, a new project.

248
0:14:02.76,000 --> 0:14:03,000
His son William is born.

249
0:14:05.2,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Well, there's a natural experiment right there,

250
0:14:07.92,000 --> 0:14:09,000
you get to observe the development of a human infant.

251
0:14:10.52,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So immediately, Darwin starts making notes.

252
0:14:13.24,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Now, of course, he's still working on the theory of evolution

253
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and the development of the human infant.

254
0:14:19.04,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But during all of this,

255
0:14:20.48,000 --> 0:14:24,000
he realizes he doesn't really know enough about taxonomy.

256
0:14:24.68,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So he starts studying that.

257
0:14:26.44,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And in the end, he spends eight years becoming the world's leading expert

258
0:14:32.92,000 --> 0:14:33,000
on barnacles.

259
0:14:35.32,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Then, "Natural Selection."

260
0:14:37.44,000 --> 0:14:42,000
A book that he's to continue working on for his entire life, he never finishes it.

261
0:14:42.6,000 --> 0:14:44,000
"Origin of Species" is finally published

262
0:14:45.48,000 --> 0:14:48,000
20 years after Darwin set out all the basic elements.

263
0:14:49.48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Then, the "Descent of Man," controversial book.

264
0:14:52.4,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And then, the book about the development of the human infant.

265
0:14:56.28,000 --> 0:15:,000
The one that was inspired when he could see his son, William,

266
0:15:00.44,000 --> 0:15:03,000
crawling on the sitting room floor in front of him.

267
0:15:03.64,000 --> 0:15:07,000
When the book was published, William was 37 years old.

268
0:15:08.64,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And all this time,

269
0:15:10.88,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Darwin's working on earthworms.

270
0:15:13.88,000 --> 0:15:18,000
He fills his billiard room with earthworms in pots, with glass covers.

271
0:15:19.88,000 --> 0:15:21,000
He shines lights on them, to see if they'll respond.

272
0:15:22.6,000 --> 0:15:24,000
He holds a hot poker next to them, to see if they move away.

273
0:15:25.48,000 --> 0:15:26,000
He chews tobacco and --

274
0:15:27.32,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Blows)

275
0:15:28.56,000 --> 0:15:31,000
He blows on the earthworms to see if they have a sense of smell.

276
0:15:31.6,000 --> 0:15:34,000
He even plays the bassoon at the earthworms.

277
0:15:36.2,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I like to think of this great man

278
0:15:38.92,000 --> 0:15:4,000
when he's tired, he's stressed,

279
0:15:41.4,000 --> 0:15:45,000
he's anxious about the reception of his book "The Descent of Man."

280
0:15:45.44,000 --> 0:15:49,000
You or I might log into Facebook or turn on the television.

281
0:15:50.44,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Darwin would go into the billiard room to relax

282
0:15:54.28,000 --> 0:15:57,000
by studying the earthworms intensely.

283
0:15:58.96,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And that's why it's appropriate that one of his last great works

284
0:16:02.88,000 --> 0:16:07,000
is the "Formation of Vegetable Mould Through The Action of Worms."

285
0:16:07.92,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Laughter)

286
0:16:09.28,000 --> 0:16:14,000
He worked upon that book for 44 years.

287
0:16:16.08,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We don't live in the 19th century anymore.

288
0:16:18.8,000 --> 0:16:2,000
I don't think any of us could sit

289
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
on our creative or scientific projects for 44 years.

290
0:16:26.28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But we do have something to learn from the great slow-motion multitaskers.

291
0:16:30.64,000 --> 0:16:35,000
From Einstein and Darwin to Michael Crichton and Twyla Tharp.

292
0:16:37.04,000 --> 0:16:4,000
The modern world seems to present us with a choice.

293
0:16:40.88,000 --> 0:16:44,000
If we're not going to fast-twitch from browser window to browser window,

294
0:16:44.92,000 --> 0:16:45,000
we have to live like a hermit,

295
0:16:46.56,000 --> 0:16:49,000
focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else.

296
0:16:50.68,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I think that's a false dilemma.

297
0:16:53.08,000 --> 0:16:55,000
We can make multitasking work for us,

298
0:16:55.76,000 --> 0:16:57,000
unleashing our natural creativity.

299
0:16:59.44,000 --> 0:17:,000
We just need to slow it down.

300
0:17:02.2,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So ...

301
0:17:04.88,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Make a list of your projects.

302
0:17:07.4,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Put down your phone.

303
0:17:09.64,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Pick up a couple of cardboard boxes.

304
0:17:12.88,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And get to work.

305
0:17:15.24,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Thank you very much.

306
0:17:16.64,000 --> 0:17:19,000
(Applause)

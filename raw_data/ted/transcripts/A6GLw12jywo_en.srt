1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
A public, Dewey long ago observed,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is constituted through discussion and debate.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question,

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,

5
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to debate and discussion.

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion

8
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of one of the critical issues of our time,

9
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital

10
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
for the project of state building.

11
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
To put the assumptions very clearly:

12
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,

13
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and so has democracy.

14
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
If we looked in the world of 1945

15
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,

16
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
they were the rare exception, not the norm.

17
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The question now, however,

18
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is both about which form of capitalism

19
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and which type of democratic participation.

20
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But we must acknowledge

21
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that this moment has brought about

22
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a rare consensus of assumptions.

23
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And that provides the ground

24
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
for a type of action,

25
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because consensus of each moment

26
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
allows us to act.

27
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And it is necessary, no matter how fragile

28
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or how provisional our consensus,

29
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to be able to move forward.

30
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But the majority of the world

31
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
neither benefits from capitalism

32
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
nor from democratic systems.

33
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Most of the globe

34
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
experiences the state as repressive,

35
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as an organization that is concerned

36
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
about denial of rights,

37
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
about denial of justice,

38
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
rather than provision of it.

39
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And in terms of experience of capitalism,

40
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
there are two aspects

41
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that the rest of the globe experiences.

42
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
First, extractive industry.

43
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds,

44
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
timber,

45
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that is cut right from under the poorest.

46
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Second is technical assistance.

47
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And technical assistance might shock you,

48
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but it's the worst form

49
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of -- today -- of the ugly face

50
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the developed world to the developing countries.

51
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Tens of billions of dollars

52
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
are supposedly spent on building capacity

53
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,

54
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
who are incapable

55
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of thinking creatively,

56
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or organically.

57
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Next assumption --

58
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and of course the events of July 7,

59
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 --

60
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
have reminded us

61
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we do not live in three different worlds.

62
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We live in one world.

63
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But that's easily said.

64
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But we are not dealing with the implications

65
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of the one world that we are living in.

66
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And that is that if we want to have one world,

67
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
this one world cannot be based

68
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
on huge pockets of exclusion,

69
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and then inclusion for some.

70
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We must now finally come

71
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to think about the premises

72
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of a truly global world,

73
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in relationship to the regime of rights

74
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and responsibilities and accountabilities

75
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that are truly global in scope.

76
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Otherwise we will be missing

77
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
this open moment in history,

78
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
where we have a consensus

79
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
on both the form of politics

80
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and the form of economics.

81
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
What is one of these organizations to pick?

82
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We have three critical terms:

83
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
economy,

84
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
civil society

85
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and the state.

86
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I will not deal with those first two, except to say

87
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that uncritical transfer of assumptions,

88
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
from one context to another,

89
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
can only make for disaster.

90
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Economics

91
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
taught in most of the elite universities

92
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
are practically useless in my context.

93
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
My country is dominated

94
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
by drug economy and a mafia.

95
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Textbook economics does not work in my context,

96
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I have very few recommendations from anybody

97
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
as to how to put together a legal economy.

98
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The poverty of our knowledge

99
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
must become the first basis

100
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of moving forward,

101
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and not imposition of the framework

102
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that works on the basis of mathematical modeling,

103
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
for which I have enormous respect.

104
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.

105
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Second,

106
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
instead of debating endlessly

107
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
about what is the structure of the state,

108
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
why don't we simplify

109
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and say, what are a series of functions

110
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that the state in the 21st century must perform?

111
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;

112
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we hope to share that much widely with --

113
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and third is that we could actually construct an index

114
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to measure comparatively

115
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
how well these functions that we would agree on

116
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
are being performed in different places.

117
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So what are these functions?

118
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We propose 10.

119
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,

120
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
administrative control, management of public finances,

121
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,

122
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
provision of infrastructure,

123
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state

124
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
through regulation, creation of the market,

125
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
international agreements, including public borrowing,

126
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and then, most importantly, rule of law.

127
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I won't elaborate.

128
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity.

129
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This is a feasible goal,

130
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
basically because, contrary to widespread assumption,

131
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I would argue that we know how to do this.

132
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Who would have imagined that Germany

133
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
would be either united or democratic today,

134
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?

135
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany

136
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and engaged in planning.

137
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And there are lots of other examples.

138
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group --

139
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we have to rethink the notion of capital.

140
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The least important form of capital, in this project,

141
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is financial capital -- money.

142
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.

143
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's just cash.

144
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Because it lacks the institutional,

145
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
organizational, managerial forms

146
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to turn it into capital.

147
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And what is required

148
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is a combination of physical capital,

149
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
institutional capital, human capital --

150
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and security, of course, is critical,

151
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but so is information.

152
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, the issue that should concern us here --

153
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and that's the challenge

154
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that I would like to pose to this group --

155
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is again, it takes 16 years

156
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in your countries

157
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to produce somebody with a B.S. degree.

158
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It takes 20 years

159
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to produce somebody with a Ph.D.

160
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The first challenge is to rethink,

161
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
fundamentally,

162
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the issue of the time.

163
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Do we need to repeat

164
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the modalities that we have inherited?

165
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.

166
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What is it that we need to do fundamentally

167
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to re-engage in a project,

168
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that capital formation is rapid?

169
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The absolute majority of the world's population

170
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
are below 20,

171
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and they are growing larger and faster.

172
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They need different ways

173
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of being approached,

174
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
different ways of being enfranchised,

175
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
different ways of being skilled.

176
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And that's the first thing.

177
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Second is, you're problem solvers,

178
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but you're not engaging your global responsibility.

179
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You've stayed away

180
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
from the problems of corruption.

181
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You only want clean environments in which to function.

182
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But if you don't think through the problems of corruption,

183
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who will?

184
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You stay away from design for development.

185
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You're great designers,

186
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but your designs are selfish.

187
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's for your own immediate use.

188
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The world in which I operate

189
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
operates with designs

190
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
regarding roads, or dams,

191
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or provision of electricity

192
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that have not been revisited in 60 years.

193
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is not right. It requires thinking.

194
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But, particularly, what we need

195
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
more than anything else from this group

196
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is your imagination

197
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to be brought to bear on problems

198
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the way a meme is supposed to work.

199
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed --

200
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Thomas Kuhn's work --

201
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
it's in the intersection of ideas

202
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that new developments --

203
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
true breakthroughs -- occur.

204
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And I hope that this group

205
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:,000
would be able to deal with the issue of state and development

206
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor,

207
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
through this means.

208
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Thank you.

209
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

210
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently,

211
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you were the finance minister of Afghanistan,

212
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
a country right at the middle

213
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
of much of the world's agenda.

214
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Is the country gonna make it?

215
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Will democracy flourish? What scares you most?

216
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is -- is you,

217
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
lack of your engagement.

218
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:43,000
You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.

220
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
No. But seriously,

221
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the issue of Afghanistan

222
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
first has to be seen as,

223
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.

224
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Today the world of globalization

225
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is on speed.

226
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Time has been compressed.

227
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And space does not exist for most people.

228
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But in my world --

229
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years,

230
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
space had expanded.

231
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.

232
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I rode -- traveled --

233
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
travel between two cities that used to take three hours

234
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
now took 12.

235
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So the first is when the scale is that,

236
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we need to recognize

237
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that just the simple things that are infrastructure --

238
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it takes six years to deliver infrastructure.

239
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
In our world.

240
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Any meaningful sort of thing.

241
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But the modality of attention,

242
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.

243
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Second is,

244
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when a country has been subjected

245
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power --

246
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we had the Red Army

247
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
for 10 continuous years,

248
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
110,000 strong,

249
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
literally terrorizing.

250
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
The sky:

251
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
every Afghan

252
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
sees the sky as a source of fear.

253
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We were bombed

254
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:12,000
practically out of existence.

255
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism --

256
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
from all sides.

257
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance,

258
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Egyptian intelligence service

259
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to train thousands of people

260
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in resistance and urban terrorism.

261
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
How to turn a bicycle

262
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
into an instrument of terror.

263
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.

264
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And the Russians, equally.

265
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So, when violence erupts

266
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in a country like Afghanistan,

267
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it's because of that legacy.

268
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But we have to understand

269
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that we've been incredibly lucky.

270
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here,

271
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
standing in front of you, speaking.

272
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:,000
When I joined as finance minister,

273
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I thought that the chances of my living more than three years

274
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
would not be more than five percent.

275
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Those were the risks. They were worth it.

276
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I think we can make it,

277
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and the reason we can make it

278
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is because of the people.

279
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:2,000
You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic.

280
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
91 percent of the men in Afghanistan,

281
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
86 percent of the women,

282
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
listen to at least three radio stations a day.

283
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
In terms of their discourse,

284
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world,

285
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I think that I would dare say,

286
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
they're much more sophisticated

287
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
than rural Americans with college degrees

288
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and the bulk of Europeans --

289
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
because the world matters to them.

290
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And what is their predominant concern?

291
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Abandonment.

292
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Afghans have become deeply internationalist.

293
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You know, when I went back in December of 2001,

294
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government

295
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because I'd lived as a nationalist.

296
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here --

297
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
separate.

298
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.

299
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.

300
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And everybody was telling me it was a different world.

301
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You know, they engage.

302
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
They see engagement, global engagement,

303
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.

304
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is --

305
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Clare Lockhart is here,

306
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:34,000
so I'll recite a discussion she had

307
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:37,000
with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.

308
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And that woman said she didn't care

309
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
whether she had food on her table.

310
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future,

311
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
where her children could really have a different life.

312
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:5,000
That gives me hope.

313
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
CA: How is Afghanistan

314
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
going to provide alternative income

315
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to the many people

316
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
who are making their living off the drugs trade?

317
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
AG: Certainly. Well, the first is,

318
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
instead of sending a billion dollars

319
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:06,000
on drug eradication

320
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and paying it to a couple of security companies,

321
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
they should give this hundred billion dollars

322
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to 50

323
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
of the most critically innovative companies in the world

324
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to ask them to create one million jobs.

325
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
The key to the drug eradication is jobs.

326
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Look, there's a very little known fact:

327
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars

328
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
don't produce drugs.

329
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Second, textile.

330
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Trade is the key, not aid.

331
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
The U.S. and Europe

332
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:42,000
should give us a zero percent tariff.

333
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The textile industry is incredibly mobile.

334
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment,

335
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
we could probably attract

336
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
four to six billion dollars

337
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
quite easily in the textile sector,

338
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
if there was zero tariffs --

339
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
would create the type of job.

340
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Cotton does not compete with opium;

341
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
a t-shirt does.

342
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And we need to understand, it's the value chain.

343
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired

344
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
of hearing about microcredit.

345
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
It is important,

346
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want

347
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
is global access.

348
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars

349
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that are only for foreigners --

350
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and the same bloody shirt

351
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
embroidered time and again.

352
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
What we want is a partnership

353
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
with the Italian design firms.

354
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!

355
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy?

356
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
With the Put Out system?

357
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:51,000
So I think economically,

358
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
the critical issue really is to now think through.

359
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.

360
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
You know, the aid system is broken.

361
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
The aid system does not have the knowledge,

362
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
the vision, the ability.

363
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.

364
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Yeah, to be exact, you know,

365
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I managed to persuade the world that

366
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:13,000
they had to give my country 27.5 billion.

367
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:15,000
They didn't want to give us the money.

368
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:17,000
CA: And it still didn't work?

369
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:19,000
AG: No. It's not that it didn't work.

370
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:21,000
It's that a dollar of private investment,

371
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:23,000
in my judgment,

372
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:26,000
is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid,

373
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
in terms of the dynamic that it generates.

374
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents;

375
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:34,000
it could be 20 cents;

376
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:36,000
or it could be four dollars.

377
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:38,000
It depends on what form it comes,

378
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:41,000
what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.

379
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:44,000
You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit

380
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:46,000
entrepreneurs of the developed countries,

381
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:5,000
not to generate growth in the poor countries.

382
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And this is, again, one of those assumptions --

383
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:56,000
the way car seats are an assumption

384
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:59,000
that we've inherited in governments, and doors.

385
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:01,000
You would think that the US government

386
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:04,000
would not think that American firms needed subsidizing

387
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:07,000
to function in developing countries, provide advice,

388
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:09,000
but they do.

389
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:11,000
There's an entire weight of history

390
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:13,000
vis-a-vis aid

391
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:15,000
that now needs to be reexamined.

392
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:18,000
If the goal is to build states

393
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:21,000
that can credibly take care of themselves --

394
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and I'm putting that proposition equally;

395
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:27,000
you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts --

396
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:3,000
aid must end

397
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:33,000
in each country in a definable period.

398
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And every year there must be progress

399
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
on mobilization of domestic revenue

400
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and generation of the economy.

401
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Unless that kind of compact is entered into,

402
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:47,000
you will not be able to sustain the consensus.

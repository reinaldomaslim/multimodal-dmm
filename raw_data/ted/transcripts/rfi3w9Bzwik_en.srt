1
0:00:13.142,000 --> 0:00:18,000
NASA's always on the lookout for possible asteroid collision hazards,

2
0:00:18.62,000 --> 0:00:22,000
so the Pan-STARRS telescope is scanning the sky every night.

3
0:00:23.231,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Each morning, candidate objects are examined by Pan-STARRS staff

4
0:00:27.375,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and usually discovered to be no big deal.

5
0:00:30.626,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But on October 19, 2017,

6
0:00:33.389,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Pan-STARRS spotted an object moving rapidly between the stars,

7
0:00:38.065,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and this time the usual follow-up measurements of position and speed

8
0:00:42.407,000 --> 0:00:44,000
showed something completely different.

9
0:00:45.246,000 --> 0:00:47,000
By October 22nd, we had enough data

10
0:00:47.775,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to realize that this object wasn't from our solar system.

11
0:00:51.969,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Holy cow.

12
0:00:53.334,000 --> 0:00:54,000
That's when I got the phone call,

13
0:00:55.105,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the phone call that all solar system astronomers are waiting for.

14
0:00:59.135,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Let me tell you how exciting this was.

15
0:01:01.27,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:02.301,000 --> 0:01:05,000
NASA's been expecting to see an interstellar comet

17
0:01:05.446,000 --> 0:01:08,000
pass through the solar system since the 1970s,

18
0:01:08.81,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but until now, we'd never seen anything.

19
0:01:11.692,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Our own solar system is huge,

20
0:01:14.342,000 --> 0:01:17,000
so even getting a package from the nearest star system

21
0:01:17.675,000 --> 0:01:19,000
4.4 light years away

22
0:01:19.802,000 --> 0:01:21,000
would take over 50,000 years.

23
0:01:22.408,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So this is a really big deal.

24
0:01:24.945,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The interstellar visitor entered our solar system

25
0:01:27.471,000 --> 0:01:28,000
from above the plane of the planets,

26
0:01:29.345,000 --> 0:01:31,000
coming from the direction of the constellation Lyra,

27
0:01:32.202,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it passed closest to the Sun on September 9th,

28
0:01:35.662,000 --> 0:01:37,000
passing inside the orbit of Mercury.

29
0:01:38.709,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now this isn't a particularly close approach or unusual distance.

30
0:01:42.762,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's just much easier to see objects close by.

31
0:01:47.124,000 --> 0:01:48,000
On October 14th,

32
0:01:48.824,000 --> 0:01:52,000
before we discovered it, it made its closest approach to the Earth,

33
0:01:52.95,000 --> 0:01:54,000
within about 15 million miles.

34
0:01:55.664,000 --> 0:01:57,000
This is really close by astronomical standards.

35
0:01:59.341,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now rather than call this by its unwieldy catalog name,

36
0:02:03.841,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we briefly called it "Rama,"

37
0:02:06.508,000 --> 0:02:09,000
after the cylindrical spacecraft that passed through the solar system

38
0:02:10.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in Arthur C. Clarke's classic science fiction story in 1973.

39
0:02:15.865,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But this wasn't quite right either,

40
0:02:17.966,000 --> 0:02:2,000
so in honor of it being discovered by a telescope in Hawaii,

41
0:02:21.223,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we consulted two experts on Hawaiian culture --

42
0:02:24.644,000 --> 0:02:26,000
a Hawaiian navigator and a linguist --

43
0:02:27.121,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to propose a name.

44
0:02:28.887,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And they suggested "'Oumuamua,"

45
0:02:31.895,000 --> 0:02:36,000
which means scout or messenger from the distant past reaching out to us.

46
0:02:37.972,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now this discovery was important for many reasons,

47
0:02:41.362,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but to me the most significant is for what 'Oumuamua can tell us

48
0:02:45.222,000 --> 0:02:47,000
about the past of our solar system.

49
0:02:48.369,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The process of the birth of a new solar system and the growth of planets

50
0:02:52.434,000 --> 0:02:55,000
can be a violent and messy business.

51
0:02:55.54,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Leftover icy and rocky debris gets ejected from the new solar system

52
0:02:59.787,000 --> 0:03:02,000
as the giant planets migrate through the dusty disk

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
out of which they're formed.

54
0:03:06.175,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now have you ever felt an emotional chill,

55
0:03:10.179,000 --> 0:03:14,000
something that's so exciting that a shiver runs up and down your spine?

56
0:03:16.115,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Or something that's very emotionally moving?

57
0:03:19.678,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well this was it for me.

58
0:03:21.449,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This was my wow moment.

59
0:03:23.298,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We actually had a piece of material from another solar system

60
0:03:27.21,000 --> 0:03:3,000
coming close enough for us to observe.

61
0:03:31.793,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So what would you like to know about 'Oumuamua,

62
0:03:34.675,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the very first visitor from another star system?

63
0:03:38.454,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Well, I could think of a million things,

64
0:03:41.266,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but there's what you want and what you can have,

65
0:03:44.87,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and 'Oumuamua was moving away and fading very rapidly.

66
0:03:49.228,000 --> 0:03:51,000
In the span of about a week,

67
0:03:51.453,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it had dropped in brightness by a factor of [10].

68
0:03:54.852,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So this is about all the time we were going to have

69
0:03:57.292,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to study it easily.

70
0:03:59.69,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So we had to distill the process of getting telescope time --

71
0:04:04.636,000 --> 0:04:07,000
normally a very competitive, peer-reviewed proposal process

72
0:04:08.2,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that can take up to months --

73
0:04:10.072,000 --> 0:04:12,000
down to less than a few days.

74
0:04:12.795,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So began a "polite" competition for resources.

75
0:04:17.408,000 --> 0:04:19,000
OK, let me not mince words. It was a fierce battle.

76
0:04:20.226,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We dropped everything,

77
0:04:22.018,000 --> 0:04:23,000
working around the clock,

78
0:04:23.488,000 --> 0:04:26,000
trying to craft perfectly crafted proposal words

79
0:04:27.393,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to send to the observatory directors.

80
0:04:30.527,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Well, good news. We got the time.

81
0:04:34.178,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, from a perfectly selfish point of view,

82
0:04:37.765,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the first thing we might like to know is how massive 'Oumuamua is.

83
0:04:42.155,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Because after all, it passed very close to the Earth,

84
0:04:45.019,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and we didn't know about it until afterwards.

85
0:04:48.757,000 --> 0:04:52,000
How bad would this have been had it not missed the Earth?

86
0:04:53.95,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Well, the impact energy

87
0:04:55.776,000 --> 0:04:58,000
depends on the square of the velocity times its mass,

88
0:04:59.409,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the mass depends on how big it is and what it's made of.

89
0:05:03.647,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So how big is 'Oumuamua, and what's its shape?

90
0:05:07.765,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, we can get this from its brightness.

91
0:05:10.109,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, if you don't believe me, think of comparing the brightness

92
0:05:13.1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
of a firefly in your backyard

93
0:05:14.506,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to the navigation lights on a distant airplane.

94
0:05:18.95,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You know the airplane is much brighter --

95
0:05:20.946,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it just appears faint because it's so far away.

96
0:05:24.775,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We're also going to need to know

97
0:05:26.633,000 --> 0:05:29,000
how reflective the surface of 'Oumuamua is,

98
0:05:29.807,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and we don't have any clue,

99
0:05:31.941,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but it's reasonable to assume it's very similar to small asteroids

100
0:05:35.825,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and comets in our solar system,

101
0:05:37.831,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or in technical terms,

102
0:05:39.205,000 --> 0:05:43,000
something between the reflectivity of charcoal and wet sand.

103
0:05:44.381,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Nowadays, most of the big telescopes are used in what's called a service mode,

104
0:05:50.12,000 --> 0:05:53,000
meaning we have to carefully develop all the instructions

105
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and send them to the telescope operator,

106
0:05:56.573,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and then anxiously wait for the data to come back,

107
0:05:59.526,000 --> 0:06:01,000
praying to the weather gods.

108
0:06:01.773,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now I bet most of you don't have careers

109
0:06:04.098,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that critically depend on whether or not it's cloudy last night.

110
0:06:08.933,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Well, we weren't going to get any second chances here.

111
0:06:12.124,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Because the weather was great, 'Oumuamua decided not to be.

112
0:06:16.256,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Its brightness wasn't constant.

113
0:06:18.732,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now here we see 'Oumuamua racing between the stars.

114
0:06:21.971,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's centered in the middle.

115
0:06:23.574,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The stars are trailed out because the telescope is following its motion.

116
0:06:28.145,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It started faint and then it got brighter, fainter, brighter, and fainter again,

117
0:06:33.621,000 --> 0:06:37,000
as sunlight is reflected off of four sides of an oblong object.

118
0:06:39.302,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The extreme brightness change

119
0:06:41.756,000 --> 0:06:45,000
led us to an unbelievable conclusion about its shape.

120
0:06:46.085,000 --> 0:06:47,000
As shown in this artist's impression,

121
0:06:48.102,000 --> 0:06:51,000
'Oumuamua is apparently very long and narrow,

122
0:06:51.657,000 --> 0:06:54,000
with an axis ratio of about 10 to one.

123
0:06:55.479,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Assuming it's dark, this means it's about half a mile long.

124
0:06:59.987,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Nothing else in our solar system looks like this.

125
0:07:03.559,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We only have a handful of objects that even have an axis ratio

126
0:07:07.021,000 --> 0:07:08,000
bigger than five to one.

127
0:07:09.286,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So we don't know how this forms,

128
0:07:11.289,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but it may be part of its birth process in its home solar system.

129
0:07:17.549,000 --> 0:07:22,000
'Oumuamua was varying in brightness every 7.34 hours,

130
0:07:23.042,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or so we thought.

131
0:07:24.812,000 --> 0:07:26,000
As more data started to come in from other teams,

132
0:07:27.178,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they were reporting different numbers.

133
0:07:29.66,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Why is it the more we learn about something,

134
0:07:31.606,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the harder it gets to interpret?

135
0:07:34.596,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Well, it turns out that 'Oumuamua is not rotating in a simple way.

136
0:07:38.009,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's wobbling like a top.

137
0:07:40.092,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So while it is rotating around its short axis,

138
0:07:43.202,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it's also rolling around the long axis

139
0:07:46.076,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and nodding up and down.

140
0:07:48.887,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This very energetic, excited motion

141
0:07:51.737,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is almost certainly the result of it being violently tossed

142
0:07:55.221,000 --> 0:07:56,000
out of its home solar system.

143
0:07:58.363,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now how we interpret the shape from its brightness

144
0:08:01.178,000 --> 0:08:03,000
depends very critically on how it's spinning,

145
0:08:04.074,000 --> 0:08:06,000
so now we have to rethink what it may look like,

146
0:08:07.068,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and as shown in this beautiful painting by space artist Bill Hartmann,

147
0:08:10.537,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we think that 'Oumuamua may be more of a flattened oval.

148
0:08:15.822,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So let's get back to the energetics.

149
0:08:17.808,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What is it made of?

150
0:08:19.743,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Well, ideally we would love to have a piece of 'Oumuamua

151
0:08:22.991,000 --> 0:08:25,000
into the laboratory, so we could study it in detail.

152
0:08:26.213,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But since even private industry can't manage to launch

153
0:08:29.904,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a spacecraft within a week

154
0:08:31.69,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to something like this,

155
0:08:33.381,000 --> 0:08:36,000
astronomers have to rely on remote observations.

156
0:08:36.566,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So astronomers will look at how the light interacts with the surface.

157
0:08:40.535,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Some colors may get absorbed, giving it a chemical fingerprint,

158
0:08:44.725,000 --> 0:08:46,000
whereas other colors may not.

159
0:08:46.996,000 --> 0:08:5,000
On the other hand, some substances may just reflect more blue

160
0:08:51.273,000 --> 0:08:52,000
or red light efficiently.

161
0:08:53.659,000 --> 0:08:56,000
In the case of 'Oumuamua, it reflected more red light,

162
0:08:57.406,000 --> 0:09:02,000
making it look very much like the organic rich surface of the comet recently visited

163
0:09:02.453,000 --> 0:09:03,000
by the Rosetta spacecraft.

164
0:09:04.887,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But not everything that looks reddish has the same composition.

165
0:09:09.642,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In fact, minerals that have tiny little bits of iron in the surface

166
0:09:13.142,000 --> 0:09:14,000
can also look red,

167
0:09:15.103,000 --> 0:09:17,000
as does the dark side of Saturn's moon Iapetus,

168
0:09:17.977,000 --> 0:09:19,000
shown in these images from the Cassini spacecraft.

169
0:09:21.432,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Nickel-iron meteorites, in other words, metal,

170
0:09:23.647,000 --> 0:09:24,000
can also look red.

171
0:09:26.032,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So while we don't know what's on the surface,

172
0:09:28.726,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we know even less about what's on the inside.

173
0:09:32.435,000 --> 0:09:35,000
However, we do know that it must at least be strong enough

174
0:09:35.547,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to not fly apart as it rotates,

175
0:09:37.943,000 --> 0:09:4,000
so it probably has a density similar to that of rocky asteroids;

176
0:09:41.927,000 --> 0:09:43,000
perhaps even denser, like metal.

177
0:09:45.305,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Well, at the very least, I want to show you

178
0:09:47.4,000 --> 0:09:49,000
one of the beautiful color images that we got

179
0:09:49.566,000 --> 0:09:51,000
from one of the ground-based telescopes.

180
0:09:52.145,000 --> 0:09:54,000
All right, I admit, it's not all that spectacular.

181
0:09:55.168,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:56.204,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We just don't have the resolution.

183
0:09:59.187,000 --> 0:10:,000
Even Hubble Space Telescope

184
0:10:01.14,000 --> 0:10:03,000
doesn't present a much better view.

185
0:10:04.22,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But the importance of the Hubble data was not because of the images,

186
0:10:07.657,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but because it extended our observations out

187
0:10:10.173,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to two and a half months from the discovery,

188
0:10:12.88,000 --> 0:10:14,000
meaning we get more positions along the orbit,

189
0:10:15.608,000 --> 0:10:19,000
which will hopefully let us figure out where 'Oumuamua came from.

190
0:10:21.667,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So what exactly is 'Oumuamua?

191
0:10:25.15,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We firmly believe it's likely to be a leftover archaeological remnant

192
0:10:30.697,000 --> 0:10:33,000
from the process of the birth of another planetary system,

193
0:10:34.309,000 --> 0:10:35,000
some celestial driftwood.

194
0:10:36.593,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Some scientists think that maybe 'Oumuamua formed

195
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:43,000
very close to a star that was much denser than our own,

196
0:10:43.619,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and the star's tidal forces shredded planetary material

197
0:10:47.056,000 --> 0:10:48,000
early in the solar system's history.

198
0:10:49.565,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Still others suggest that maybe this is something that formed

199
0:10:53.55,000 --> 0:10:55,000
during the death throes of a star,

200
0:10:55.74,000 --> 0:10:57,000
perhaps during a supernova explosion,

201
0:10:58.556,000 --> 0:11:,000
as planetary material got shredded.

202
0:11:02.345,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Whatever it is, we believe it's a natural object,

203
0:11:05.877,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but we can't actually prove that it's not something artificial.

204
0:11:10.71,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The color, the strange shape, the tumbling motion

205
0:11:14.091,000 --> 0:11:16,000
could all have other explanations.

206
0:11:16.825,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now while we don't believe this is alien technology,

207
0:11:20.469,000 --> 0:11:24,000
why not do the obvious experiment and search for a radio signal?

208
0:11:25.64,000 --> 0:11:27,000
That's exactly what the Breakthrough Listen project did,

209
0:11:28.604,000 --> 0:11:31,000
but so far, 'Oumuamua has remained completely quiet.

210
0:11:33.091,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Now could we send a spacecraft to 'Oumuamua

211
0:11:35.894,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and answer this question once and for all?

212
0:11:38.262,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Yes, we do actually have the technology,

213
0:11:40.537,000 --> 0:11:42,000
but it would be a long and expensive voyage,

214
0:11:42.95,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and we would get there so far from the Sun

215
0:11:45.252,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that the final approach trajectory would be very difficult.

216
0:11:49.79,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So I think 'Oumuamua probably has many more things to teach us,

217
0:11:54.885,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and in fact there might be more surprises in store

218
0:11:57.322,000 --> 0:12:01,000
as scientists such as myself continue to work with the data.

219
0:12:02.138,000 --> 0:12:05,000
More importantly, I think this visitor from afar

220
0:12:05.693,000 --> 0:12:09,000
has really brought home the point that our solar system isn't isolated.

221
0:12:10.852,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We're part of a much larger environment,

222
0:12:13.29,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and in fact, we may even be surrounded by interstellar visitors

223
0:12:18.178,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and not even know it.

224
0:12:20.235,000 --> 0:12:22,000
This unexpected gift

225
0:12:22.371,000 --> 0:12:26,000
has perhaps raised more questions than its provided answers,

226
0:12:26.982,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but we were the first to say hello to a visitor from another solar system.

227
0:12:32.712,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Thank you.

228
0:12:33.918,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

229
0:12:42.946,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Jedidah Isler: Thanks, Karen.

230
0:12:44.425,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I of course enjoyed that talk very much. Thank you.

231
0:12:46.831,000 --> 0:12:49,000
As I recall, we found it pretty late in its journey towards us.

232
0:12:50.408,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Will future technologies like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope

233
0:12:54.044,000 --> 0:12:55,000
help us detect these things sooner?

234
0:12:56.353,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Karen Meech: Yeah. We're hoping that we'll start to see a lot of these things,

235
0:13:00.122,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and ideally, you'd love to find one as it's approaching the Sun,

236
0:13:03.965,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because you want to have time to do all the science,

237
0:13:07.005,000 --> 0:13:08,000
or even more ideal,

238
0:13:08.226,000 --> 0:13:1,000
you'd get a spacecraft ready to go,

239
0:13:10.315,000 --> 0:13:13,000
parked somewhere in the L4 or L5 position,

240
0:13:13.489,000 --> 0:13:14,000
somewhere near Earth,

241
0:13:14.847,000 --> 0:13:16,000
so that when something comes by, you can chase it.

242
0:13:17.862,000 --> 0:13:19,000
JI: Awesome, thanks so much. Let's thank Karen again.

243
0:13:20.435,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Applause)

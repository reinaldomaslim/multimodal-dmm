2
0:00:15.486,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I want to talk to you about two things tonight.

3
0:00:19.308,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Number one:

4
0:00:21.592,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Teaching surgery and doing surgery

5
0:00:24.908,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is really hard.

6
0:00:27.041,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And second,

7
0:00:28.625,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that language is one of the most profound things

8
0:00:31.124,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that separate us all over the world.

9
0:00:34.442,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And in my little corner of the world,

10
0:00:36.359,000 --> 0:00:37,000
these two things are actually related,

11
0:00:38.309,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and I want to tell you how tonight.

12
0:00:40.241,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now, nobody wants an operation.

13
0:00:44.247,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Who here has had surgery?

14
0:00:48.186,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Did you want it?

15
0:00:49.509,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.

16
0:00:51.067,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Nobody wants an operation.

17
0:00:53.159,000 --> 0:00:56,000
In particular, nobody wants an operation

18
0:00:56.221,000 --> 0:01:01,000
with tools like these through large incisions

19
0:01:01.709,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that cause a lot of pain,

20
0:01:03.684,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school,

21
0:01:07.216,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that leave a big scar.

22
0:01:09.467,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But if you have to have an operation,

23
0:01:12.369,000 --> 0:01:14,000
what you really want is a minimally invasive operation.

24
0:01:14.9,000 --> 0:01:16,000
That's what I want to talk to you about tonight --

25
0:01:16.932,000 --> 0:01:18,000
how doing and teaching this type of surgery

26
0:01:19.666,000 --> 0:01:2,000
led us on a search

27
0:01:21.133,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for a better universal translator.

28
0:01:23.667,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Now, this type of surgery is hard,

29
0:01:26.01,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and it starts by putting people to sleep,

30
0:01:29.534,000 --> 0:01:31,000
putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen,

31
0:01:31.651,000 --> 0:01:32,000
blowing them up like a balloon,

32
0:01:33.467,000 --> 0:01:38,000
sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen --

33
0:01:38.656,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it's dangerous stuff --

34
0:01:42.203,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen.

35
0:01:46.846,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So let's see what it looks like.

36
0:01:48.813,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So this is gallbladder surgery.

37
0:01:50.579,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We perform a million of these a year

38
0:01:52.611,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in the United States alone.

39
0:01:54.829,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is the real thing. There's no blood.

40
0:01:56.879,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And you can see how focused the surgeons are,

41
0:02:00.013,000 --> 0:02:02,000
how much concentration it takes.

42
0:02:02.528,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You can see it in their faces.

43
0:02:04.212,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's hard to teach, and it's not all that easy to learn.

44
0:02:10.719,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We do about five million of these in the United States

45
0:02:12.697,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and maybe 20 million of these worldwide.

46
0:02:17.984,000 --> 0:02:19,000
All right, you've all heard the term:

47
0:02:20.817,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"He's a born surgeon."

48
0:02:22.615,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Let me tell you, surgeons are not born.

49
0:02:26.015,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Surgeons are not made either.

50
0:02:29.752,000 --> 0:02:32,000
There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons.

51
0:02:33.092,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Surgeons are trained one step at a time.

52
0:02:37.547,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It starts with a foundation, basic skills.

53
0:02:41.399,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room

54
0:02:46.164,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where they learn to be an assistant.

55
0:02:47.932,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training.

56
0:02:50.066,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And when they do all of that for about five years,

57
0:02:52.998,000 --> 0:02:55,000
they get the coveted board certification.

58
0:02:56.364,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If you need surgery, you want to be operated on

59
0:02:58.998,000 --> 0:03:,000
by a board-certified surgeon.

60
0:03:01.482,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You get your board certificate,

61
0:03:03.466,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and you can go out into practice.

62
0:03:05.809,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery.

63
0:03:10.076,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now that foundation is so important

64
0:03:14.108,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that a number of us

65
0:03:16.009,000 --> 0:03:19,000
from the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES,

66
0:03:19.576,000 --> 0:03:21,000
started in the late 1990s a training program

67
0:03:22.442,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery

68
0:03:26.793,000 --> 0:03:3,000
would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills

69
0:03:31.375,000 --> 0:03:33,000
necessary to go on and do procedures.

70
0:03:34.06,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now the science behind this is so potent

71
0:03:38.159,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that it became required by the American Board of Surgery

72
0:03:41.943,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in order for a young surgeon to become board certified.

73
0:03:45.493,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's not a lecture, it's not a course,

74
0:03:49.278,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it's all of that plus a high-stakes assessment.

75
0:03:52.676,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's hard.

76
0:03:54.91,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now just this past year,

77
0:03:58.044,000 --> 0:04:01,000
one of our partners, the American College of Surgeons,

78
0:04:01.11,000 --> 0:04:02,000
teamed up with us to make an announcement

79
0:04:02.972,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that all surgeons should be FLS (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery)-certified

80
0:04:06.442,000 --> 0:04:09,000
before they do minimally invasive surgery.

81
0:04:09.526,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada?

82
0:04:12.97,000 --> 0:04:13,000
No, we just said all surgeons.

83
0:04:14.943,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So to lift this education and training worldwide

84
0:04:19.642,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is a very large task,

85
0:04:20.892,000 --> 0:04:23,000
something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world.

86
0:04:24.834,000 --> 0:04:28,000
SAGES does surgery all over the world, teaching and educating surgeons.

87
0:04:29.526,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.

88
0:04:33.565,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We can't travel everywhere.

89
0:04:35.798,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We need to make the world a smaller place.

90
0:04:38.616,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And I think that we can develop some tools to do so.

91
0:04:41.299,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And one of the tools I like personally is using video.

92
0:04:45.282,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So I was inspired by a friend.

93
0:04:47.732,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto.

94
0:04:49.981,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And he proved

95
0:04:52.586,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that you could actually teach people to do surgery

96
0:04:56.832,000 --> 0:04:58,000
using video conferencing.

97
0:04:59.532,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa

98
0:05:03.765,000 --> 0:05:05,000
these basic fundamental skills

99
0:05:06.315,000 --> 0:05:08,000
necessary to do minimally invasive surgery.

100
0:05:09.032,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Very inspiring.

101
0:05:10.632,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But for this examination, which is really hard,

102
0:05:14.398,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we have a problem.

103
0:05:17.215,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Even people who say they speak English,

104
0:05:19.815,000 --> 0:05:21,000
only 14 percent pass.

105
0:05:22.332,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Because for them it's not a surgery test,

106
0:05:24.348,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it's an English test.

107
0:05:28.223,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Let me bring it to you locally.

108
0:05:29.832,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I work at the Cambridge Hospital.

109
0:05:31.499,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.

110
0:05:34.782,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages,

111
0:05:40.098,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital.

112
0:05:45.282,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It's a big labor-intensive effort.

113
0:05:47.057,000 --> 0:05:51,000
If you think about the worldwide burden

114
0:05:51.123,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of trying to talk to your patients --

115
0:05:52.982,000 --> 0:05:54,000
not just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients --

116
0:05:55.617,000 --> 0:05:58,000
there aren't enough translators in the world.

117
0:05:58.765,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.

118
0:06:04.731,000 --> 0:06:07,000
At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors

119
0:06:07.898,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to people who just got here last week.

120
0:06:10.332,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And you have no idea how hard it is

121
0:06:12.617,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.

122
0:06:15.549,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And there isn't always a translator available.

123
0:06:18.449,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So we need tools.

124
0:06:22.812,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We need a universal translator.

125
0:06:26.49,000 --> 0:06:3,000
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk

126
0:06:30.899,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.

127
0:06:36.416,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's really about setting up a dialogue.

128
0:06:38.965,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We have a lot to learn.

129
0:06:40.816,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Here in the United States we spend more money per person

130
0:06:45.316,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.

131
0:06:49.166,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Maybe we have something to learn as well.

132
0:06:52.549,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world.

133
0:06:57.032,000 --> 0:07:,000
This past year I've been in Latin America, I've been in China,

134
0:07:00.416,000 --> 0:07:03,000
talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery.

135
0:07:04.149,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And everywhere I go the barrier is:

136
0:07:07.681,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"We want this, but we need it in our language."

137
0:07:12.315,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So here's what we think we want to do:

138
0:07:15.232,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Imagine giving a lecture

139
0:07:17.649,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.

140
0:07:22.645,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe

141
0:07:28.333,000 --> 0:07:32,000
seamlessly, accurately

142
0:07:33.053,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and in a cost-effective fashion using technology.

143
0:07:37.334,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And it has to be bi-directional.

144
0:07:38.962,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They have to be able to teach us something as well.

145
0:07:41.749,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's a big task.

146
0:07:43.149,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there.

147
0:07:46.215,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Your webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation,

148
0:07:50.166,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery.

149
0:07:55.366,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon?

150
0:07:57.832,000 --> 0:08:01,000
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.

151
0:08:01.931,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I need to have a health care lexicon.

152
0:08:04.416,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And in that I need a surgery lexicon.

153
0:08:08.017,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's a tall order. We have to work at it.

154
0:08:12.272,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So let me show you what we're doing.

155
0:08:14.065,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This is research -- can't buy it.

156
0:08:16.366,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center

157
0:08:20.849,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator.

158
0:08:25.782,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It starts with a framework system

159
0:08:27.916,000 --> 0:08:29,000
where when the surgeon delivers the lecture

160
0:08:30.648,000 --> 0:08:33,000
using a framework of captioning technology,

161
0:08:33.815,000 --> 0:08:37,000
we then add another technology to do video conferencing.

162
0:08:38.231,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology.

163
0:08:41.716,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And now we've got the words,

164
0:08:44.366,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and we can apply the special sauce: the translation.

165
0:08:48.917,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic.

166
0:08:53.297,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We work with a fourth technology.

167
0:08:55.581,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs.

168
0:08:59.565,000 --> 0:09:03,000
More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place.

169
0:09:04.066,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And I'd like to show you our prototype

170
0:09:06.715,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other

171
0:09:11.548,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to become something useful.

172
0:09:15.215,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Narrator: Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery.

173
0:09:19.011,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Module five: manual skills practice.

174
0:09:22.624,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Students may display captions in their native language.

175
0:09:29.907,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Steven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America,

176
0:09:31.656,000 --> 0:09:32,000
you click the "I want it in Spanish" button

177
0:09:33.541,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and out it comes in real time in Spanish.

178
0:09:37.173,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time,

179
0:09:40.007,000 --> 0:09:43,000
by using technology in a constructive fashion,

180
0:09:43.34,000 --> 0:09:46,000
you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian --

181
0:09:46.606,000 --> 0:09:51,000
on and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators.

182
0:09:52.072,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But that's the lectures.

183
0:09:54.272,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning,

184
0:09:57.123,000 --> 0:10:,000
it's knowledge and skills.

185
0:10:00.14,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The difference in an operation

186
0:10:02.423,000 --> 0:10:06,000
between doing something successfully and not

187
0:10:07.023,000 --> 0:10:1,000
may be moving your hand this much.

188
0:10:10.49,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So we're going to take it one step further;

189
0:10:12.79,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we've brought my friend Allan back.

190
0:10:14.923,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Allan Okrainec: Today we're going to practice suturing.

191
0:10:20.024,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This is how you hold the needle.

192
0:10:22.022,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Grab the needle at the tip.

193
0:10:27.519,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's important to be accurate.

194
0:10:29.977,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Aim for the black dots.

195
0:10:33.81,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Orient your loop this way.

196
0:10:37.259,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now go ahead and cut.

197
0:10:41.844,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week.

198
0:10:45.732,000 --> 0:10:47,000
SS: So that's what we're working on

199
0:10:48.598,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in our quest for the universal translator.

200
0:10:51.581,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We want it to be bi-directional.

201
0:10:53.665,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We have a need to learn as well as to teach.

202
0:10:57.866,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I can think of a million uses for a tool like this.

203
0:11:01.882,000 --> 0:11:03,000
As we think about intersecting technologies --

204
0:11:04.632,000 --> 0:11:06,000
everybody has a cell phone with a camera --

205
0:11:07.032,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we could use this everywhere,

206
0:11:09.248,000 --> 0:11:11,000
whether it be health care, patient care,

207
0:11:11.331,000 --> 0:11:15,000
engineering, law, conferencing, translating videos.

208
0:11:15.816,000 --> 0:11:17,000
This is a ubiquitous tool.

209
0:11:18.216,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In order to break down our barriers,

210
0:11:20.415,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we have to learn to talk to people,

211
0:11:22.182,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to demand that people work on translation.

212
0:11:26.182,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We need it for our everyday life,

213
0:11:28.532,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in order to make the world a smaller place.

214
0:11:31.366,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Thank you very much.

215
0:11:33.066,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I would like to tell you all

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that you are all actually cyborgs,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but not the cyborgs that you think.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or use one of your cell phone devices.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So what's a good definition for cyborg?

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Well, traditional definition is "an organism

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to which exogenous components have been added

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
for the purpose of adapting to new environments."

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
People aren't supposed to be there.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
so they can go to the Alps one day

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and then become a fish in the sea the next.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Somebody goes to another country,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
how curious their culture is."

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and we think it's very exotic.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Well, what's happening

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is that we've suddenly found a new species.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and look at these fascinating cultures,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and look at these curious rituals

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that everybody's doing around this technology.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They're clicking on things and staring at screens."

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now there's a reason why I study this,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
versus traditional anthropology.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And the reason is that tool use,

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
everything has been a physical modification of self.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It has helped us to extend our physical selves,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
go faster, hit things harder,

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and there's been a limit on that.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but an extension of the mental self,

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and because of that, we're able to travel faster,

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
communicate differently.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And the other thing that happens

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and then we can take anything out.

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that you're carrying around all the time.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And if you actually lose that information,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that you suddenly feel like something's missing,

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and people are interacting with your second self

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
when you're not there.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And so you have to be careful

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
about leaving your front lawn open,

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which is basically your Facebook wall,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because it's very much the equivalent.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You have to present yourself in digital life

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in a similar way that you would in your analog life.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
you have to learn to do that for your digital self.

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And the problem is that a lot of people now,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
especially adolescents,

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
have to go through two adolescences.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and then they go through their second self's adolescence,

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and that's even more awkward

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because there's an actual history

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
of what they've gone through online.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And anybody coming in new to technology

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is an adolescent online right now,

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and so it's very awkward,

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and it's very difficult for them to do those things.

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And I said, "Great."

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I thought I was very clever.

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He took a piece of paper,

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
drew A and B on one side and the other

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and folded them together so where A and B touched.

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space,

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it takes an awful lot of energy,

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and that's just how you do it."

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I said, "I want to do that."

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And he said, "Well, okay."

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was thinking at night,

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to make things accelerate faster.

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I want to make a time machine."

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I was always sending messages to my future self

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
using tape recorders.

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But then what I realized when I went to college

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is that technology doesn't just get adopted

106
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because it works.

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It gets adopted because people use it

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and it's made for humans.

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I started studying anthropology.

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,

111
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They weren't physically transporting themselves;

113
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they were mentally transporting themselves.

114
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They would click on a button,

115
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and they would be connected as A to B immediately.

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So over time, time and space

118
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
have compressed because of this.

119
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You can stand on one side of the world,

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
whisper something and be heard on the other.

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
One of the other ideas that comes around

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.

123
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.

124
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And because of that, you start to dig around

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
for your external memories -- where did you leave them?

126
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So now we're all these paleontologists

127
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that are digging for things that we've lost

128
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And that incites a sort of panic architecture --

130
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"Oh no, where's this thing?"

131
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,

132
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and we can't keep up.

133
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And so what happens is,

134
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
when we bring all that into the social space,

135
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we end up checking our phones all the time.

136
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy.

137
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's not that we're always connected to everybody,

138
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.

139
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,

140
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the room would be very crowded.

141
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general --

142
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.

144
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
One I'm really worried about

145
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and that they aren't slowing down and stopping,

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
being around all those people in the room all the time

148
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that are trying to compete for their attention

149
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
on the simultaneous time interfaces,

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
paleontology and panic architecture.

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They're not just sitting there.

152
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And really, when you have no external input,

153
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that is a time when there is a creation of self,

154
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
when you can do long-term planning,

155
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
when you can try and figure out who you really are.

156
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And then, once you do that, you can figure out

157
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
how to present your second self in a legitimate way,

158
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --

159
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.

160
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so this is very important.

161
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I'm really worried that, especially kids today,

162
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they're not going to be dealing with this down-time,

163
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,

164
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and that everything comes to them,

165
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.

166
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.

167
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It has its own external prosthetic devices,

168
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and these devices are helping us all

169
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to communicate and interact with each other.

170
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But when you actually visualize it,

171
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
all the connections that we're doing right now --

172
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
this is an image of the mapping of the Internet --

173
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
it doesn't look technological.

174
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
It actually looks very organic.

175
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity

176
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that we've connected in this way.

177
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And it's not that machines are taking over.

178
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's that they're helping us to be more human,

179
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
helping us to connect with each other.

180
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The most successful technology gets out of the way

181
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and helps us live our lives.

182
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And really,

183
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it ends up being more human than technology,

184
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because we're co-creating each other all the time.

185
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And so this is the important point that I like to study:

186
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --

187
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it's just done in a different way.

188
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We're just increasing our humanness

189
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.

190
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.

191
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Thank you.

192
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Applause)

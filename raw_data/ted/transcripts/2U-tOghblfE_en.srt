1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
For me, this story begins about 15 years ago,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in the South Side of Chicago.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I was observing what happened to people and their families

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
over the course of their terminal illness.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which is a very old idea in the social sciences,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
going back 150 years,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
known as "dying of a broken heart."

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for instance, in the first year.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I had gone to take care of one particular patient,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
a woman who was dying of dementia.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And in this case, unlike this couple,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
she was being cared for

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
by her daughter.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And the daughter's husband,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
he also was sick

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
from his wife's exhaustion.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I was driving home one day,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I get a phone call from the husband's friend,

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
calling me because he was depressed

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
about what was happening to his friend.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So here I get this call from this random guy

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that's having an experience

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that's being influenced by people

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
at some social distance.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And so I suddenly realized two very simple things:

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
First, the widowhood effect

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
was not restricted to husbands and wives.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I started to see the world

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in a whole new way,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
like pairs of people connected to each other.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And then I realized that these individuals

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And then, in fact, these people

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
were embedded in other sorts of relationships:

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
marriage and spousal

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and friendship and other sorts of ties.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And that, in fact, these connections were vast

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and that we were all embedded in this

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
broad set of connections with each other.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I started to see the world in a completely new way

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I became obsessed with this.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I became obsessed with how it might be

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that we're embedded in these social networks,

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and how they affect our lives.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and they're so elaborate and so complex

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and so ubiquitous, in fact,

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that one has to ask what purpose they serve.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Why are we embedded in social networks?

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And how do they effect us?

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So my first topic with respect to this,

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
was not death, but obesity.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It had become trendy

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to speak about the "obesity epidemic."

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and could it spread from person to person

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
like the four people I discussed earlier.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So this is a slide of some of our initial results.

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Every dot is a person. We make the dot size

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
proportional to people's body size;

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so bigger dots are bigger people.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In addition, if your body size,

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 --

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
if you're clinically obese --

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we also colored the dots yellow.

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that there are clusters of obese and

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
non-obese people in the image.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But the visual complexity is still very high.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
In addition, some questions are immediately raised:

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
How much clustering is there?

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And, most importantly,

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what causes the clusters?

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This here shows, on the Y-axis,

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the increase in the probability that a person is obese

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
given that a social contact of theirs is obese

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
On the far left, you see the purple line.

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It says that, if your friends are obese,

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And the next bar over, the [red] line,

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
says if your friend's friends are obese,

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then the next line over says

98
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that there's no longer a relationship

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
between that person's body size and your own body size.

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Well, what might be causing this clustering?

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There are at least three possibilities:

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
One possibility is that, as I gain weight,

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it causes you to gain weight.

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Another possibility, very obvious, is homophily,

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or, birds of a feather flock together;

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
here, I form my tie to you

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because you and I share a similar body size.

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding,

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And here, the idea is not that my weight gain

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is causing your weight gain,

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
nor that I preferentially form a tie with you

117
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because you and I share the same body size,

118
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but rather that we share a common exposure

119
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to something, like a health club

120
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that makes us both lose weight at the same time.

121
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
When we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
including for induction.

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And we found that if your friend becomes obese,

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in the same given time period.

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There can be many mechanisms for this effect:

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
One possibility is that your friends say to you something like --

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you --

129
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
which is a terrible combination. (Laughter)

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But you adopt that combination,

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and then you start gaining weight like them.

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Another more subtle possibility

134
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of what an acceptable body size is.

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Here, what's spreading from person to person

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is not a behavior, but rather a norm:

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
An idea is spreading.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, headline writers

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
had a field day with our studies.

141
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I think the headline in The New York Times was,

142
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"Are you packing it on?

143
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Blame your fat friends." (Laughter)

144
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers

145
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
had a different take: They said,

146
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."

147
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and a kind of self-serving,

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work

152
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
should or could justify prejudice

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
against people of one or another body size at all.

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Our next questions was:

155
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Could we actually visualize this spread?

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Was weight gain in one person actually spreading

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to weight gain in another person?

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And this was complicated because

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,

160
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the architecture of the ties, was changing across time.

161
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic --

163
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
if we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him --

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
it's a multicentric epidemic.

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Lots of people are doing things at the same time.

166
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation

167
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
that took me and James five years of our lives to do.

168
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So, again, every dot is a person.

169
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Every tie between them is a relationship.

170
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We're going to put this into motion now,

171
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The dot sizes are going to grow,

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you're going to see a sea of yellow take over.

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You're going to see people be born and die --

175
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
dots will appear and disappear --

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
ties will form and break, marriages and divorces,

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
friendings and defriendings.

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
just in this 30-year period

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that includes the obesity epidemic.

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And, by the end, you're going to see clusters

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of obese and non-obese individuals

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
within the network.

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, when looked at this,

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it changed the way I see things,

186
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because this thing, this network

187
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that's changing across time,

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
it has a memory, it moves,

189
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
things flow within it,

190
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
it has a kind of consistency --

191
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
people can die, but it doesn't die;

192
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it still persists --

193
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and it has a kind of resilience

194
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that allows it to persist across time.

195
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And so, I came to see these kinds of social networks

196
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
as living things,

197
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope

198
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to study and analyze and understand.

199
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And we used a variety of techniques to do this.

200
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.

201
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We looked at smoking and drinking behavior,

202
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and voting behavior,

203
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and divorce -- which can spread --

204
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and altruism.

205
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And, eventually, we became interested in emotions.

206
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, when we have emotions,

207
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we show them.

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Why do we show our emotions?

209
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But we don't just experience them, we show them.

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And not only do we show them, but others can read them.

213
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And, not only can they read them, but they copy them.

214
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
There's emotional contagion

215
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that takes place in human populations.

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And so this function of emotions

217
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,

218
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they're a kind of primitive form of communication.

219
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we need to think about them in this way.

221
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,

222
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in simple, sort of, brief periods of time.

223
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So, for example,

224
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I was giving this talk recently in New York City,

225
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and I said, "You know when you're on the subway

226
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the other person across the subway car

227
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
smiles at you,

228
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and you just instinctively smile back?"

229
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)

230
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And I said, "Everywhere else in the world,

231
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that's normal human behavior."

232
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And so there's a very instinctive way

233
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.

235
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger,

236
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as in riots.

237
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The question that we wanted to ask was:

238
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Could emotion spread,

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in a more sustained way than riots, across time

240
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and involve large numbers of people,

241
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?

242
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot

243
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that animates us all the time.

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Maybe there are emotional stampedes

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that ripple through social networks.

246
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
not just an individual existence.

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.

249
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Again, a social network,

250
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but now we color the people yellow if they're happy

251
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and blue if they're sad and green in between.

252
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And if you look at this image, you can right away see

253
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
clusters of happy and unhappy people,

254
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
again, spreading to three degrees of separation.

255
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And you might form the intuition

256
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that the unhappy people

257
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
occupy a different structural location within the network.

258
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
There's a middle and an edge to this network,

259
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the unhappy people seem to be

260
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
located at the edges.

261
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So to invoke another metaphor,

262
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
if you imagine social networks as a kind of

263
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
vast fabric of humanity --

264
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --

265
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
this fabric is actually like

266
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
an old-fashioned American quilt,

267
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.

268
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And whether you become happy or not

269
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch.

270
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

271
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So, this work with emotions,

272
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
which are so fundamental,

273
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
then got us to thinking about: Maybe

274
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the fundamental causes of human social networks

275
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
are somehow encoded in our genes.

276
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Because human social networks, whenever they are mapped,

277
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
always kind of look like this:

278
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the picture of the network.

279
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But they never look like this.

280
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Why do they not look like this?

281
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Why don't we form human social networks

282
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that look like a regular lattice?

283
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks,

284
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
their ubiquity and their apparent purpose

285
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
beg questions about whether we evolved to have

286
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
human social networks in the first place,

287
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and whether we evolved to form networks

288
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
with a particular structure.

289
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though,

290
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we need to dissect network structure a little bit first --

291
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and notice that every person in this network

292
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
has exactly the same structural location as every other person.

293
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But that's not the case with real networks.

294
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So, for example, here is a real network of college students

295
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
at an elite northeastern university.

296
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
And now I'm highlighting a few dots.

297
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
If you look here at the dots,

298
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
compare node B in the upper left

299
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to node D in the far right;

300
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
B has four friends coming out from him

301
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and D has six friends coming out from him.

302
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.

303
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
That's very obvious, we all know that.

304
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But certain other aspects

305
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
of social network structure are not so obvious.

306
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.

307
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Now, those people both have four friends,

308
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but A's friends all know each other,

309
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and B's friends do not.

310
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So the friend of a friend of A's

311
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is, back again, a friend of A's,

312
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,

313
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but is farther away in the network.

314
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This is known as transitivity in networks.

315
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And, finally, compare nodes C and D:

316
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
C and D both have six friends.

317
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
If you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"

318
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
they would say, "I've got six friends.

319
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
That's my social experience."

320
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,

321
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
can see that they occupy very different social worlds.

322
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:

323
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Who would you rather be

324
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
if a deadly germ was spreading through the network?

325
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Would you rather be C or D?

326
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.

327
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And now who would you rather be

328
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you --

329
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
was spreading through the network? (Laughter)

330
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now, you would rather be C.

331
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So different structural locations

332
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
have different implications for your life.

333
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,

334
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
what we found is that 46 percent of the variation

335
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in how many friends you have

336
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is explained by your genes.

337
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy

338
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and some are born gregarious. That's obvious.

339
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But we also found some non-obvious things.

340
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
For instance, 47 percent in the variation

341
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
in whether your friends know each other

342
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is attributable to your genes.

343
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Whether your friends know each other

344
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
has not just to do with their genes, but with yours.

345
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And we think the reason for this is that some people

346
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are --

347
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.

348
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And so some people knit together the networks around them,

349
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
creating a kind of dense web of ties

350
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in which they're comfortably embedded.

351
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And finally, we even found that

352
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
30 percent of the variation

353
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network

354
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
can also be attributed to their genes.

355
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge

356
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
is also partially heritable.

357
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Now, what is the point of this?

358
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
How does this help us understand?

359
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
How does this help us

360
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?

361
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.

362
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
They are a kind of social capital.

363
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
New properties emerge

364
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because of our embeddedness in social networks,

365
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and these properties inhere

366
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in the structure of the networks,

367
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
not just in the individuals within them.

368
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So think about these two common objects.

369
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
They're both made of carbon,

370
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it

371
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left --

372
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and you get graphite, which is soft and dark.

373
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
But if you take the same carbon atoms

374
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and interconnect them a different way,

375
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you get diamond, which is clear and hard.

376
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness

377
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
do not reside in the carbon atoms;

378
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,

379
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
or at least arise because of the

380
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
interconnections between the carbon atoms.

381
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So, similarly, the pattern of connections among people

382
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
confers upon the groups of people

383
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
different properties.

384
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It is the ties between people

385
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.

386
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And so it is not just what's happening to these people --

387
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,

388
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us;

389
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
it's also the actual architecture

390
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
of the ties around us.

391
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Our experience of the world

392
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
depends on the actual structure

393
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
of the networks in which we're residing

394
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow

395
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
through the network.

396
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case

397
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
is that human beings assemble themselves

398
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and form a kind of superorganism.

399
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals

400
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
which show or evince behaviors or phenomena

401
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that are not reducible to the study of individuals

402
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and that must be understood by reference to,

403
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and by studying, the collective.

404
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Like, for example, a hive of bees

405
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that's finding a new nesting site,

406
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
or a flock of birds that's evading a predator,

407
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom

408
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and navigate and find a tiny speck

409
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
of an island in the middle of the Pacific,

410
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
or a pack of wolves that's able

411
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
to bring down larger prey.

412
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Superorganisms have properties

413
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.

414
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I think understanding social networks

415
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and how they form and operate

416
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
can help us understand not just health and emotions

417
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
but all kinds of other phenomena --

418
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
like crime, and warfare,

419
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
and economic phenomena like bank runs

420
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and market crashes

421
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and the adoption of innovation

422
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and the spread of product adoption.

423
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Now, look at this.

424
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I think we form social networks

425
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
because the benefits of a connected life

426
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
outweigh the costs.

427
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
If I was always violent towards you

428
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
or gave you misinformation

429
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,

430
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
you would cut the ties to me,

431
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and the network would disintegrate.

432
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
So the spread of good and valuable things

433
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
is required to sustain and nourish social networks.

434
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Similarly, social networks are required

435
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
for the spread of good and valuable things,

436
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
like love and kindness

437
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and happiness and altruism

438
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and ideas.

439
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I think, in fact, that if we realized

440
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
how valuable social networks are,

441
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them,

442
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
because I think social networks

443
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
are fundamentally related to goodness.

444
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And what I think the world needs now

445
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
is more connections.

446
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Thank you.

447
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
(Applause)

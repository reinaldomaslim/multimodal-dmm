1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
remember me asking a few questions

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which still preoccupy me.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
One of them was: Why is it necessary to spend

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
six billion pounds

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
speeding up the Eurostar train

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
when, for about 10 percent of that money,

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
you could have top supermodels, male and female,

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for the entire duration of the journey?

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You'd still have five billion left in change,

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well,

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a very interesting observation,

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that actually those strange little signs

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that actually flash "35" at you,

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
occasionally accompanying a little smiley face

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
or a frown,

19
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit --

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
those are actually more effective

21
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
at preventing road accidents than speed cameras,

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
which come with the actual threat

23
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of real punishment.

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work,

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I think, in many areas of human problem solving,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
particularly those which involve human psychology,

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
which is: The tendency

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of the organization or the institution

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is to deploy as much force as possible,

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as much compulsion as possible,

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
whereas actually, the tendency of the person

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is to be almost influenced

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in absolute reverse proportion

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to the amount of force being applied.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title --

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'll come to this a little later --

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and perhaps the addition of a new word

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
into the English language.

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Because it does seem to me that large organizations

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
including government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
have actually become

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
completely disconnected

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
with what actually matters to people.

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Let me give you one example of this.

46
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
heralded at the time as the largest

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
single deal of all time.

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It may still be, for all I know.

50
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other,

51
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are probably customers of one or both

52
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of those organizations that merged.

53
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Just interested, did anybody notice anything different

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
as a result of this at all?

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So unless you happened to be a shareholder

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of one or the other organizations

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,

58
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
By contrast, years of marketing have taught me

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that if you actually want people to remember you

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and to appreciate what you do,

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the most potent things are actually very, very small.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
it's the cruet salt and pepper set.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
What's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
has exactly the same mischievous thought,

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which is, "I reckon I can heist these."

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
However, you pick them up and underneath,

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
actually engraved in the metal, are the words,

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class."

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, years after

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
you remember the strategic question

76
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus,

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you remember those words and that experience.

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Similarly, this is from a hotel in Stockholm, the Lydmar.

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Has anybody stayed there?

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Nothing unusual about that at all,

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's frankly more memorable

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
at a cost of 500,000 dollars,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the entire course of your life.

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, these are trivial marketing examples, I accept.

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
probably one of the leading experts in,

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
effectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
actually spoke.

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And she came across a similar example

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of something that fascinated me

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
as being something which, in a business context or a government context,

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
would simply be so trivial a solution

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
as to seem embarrassing.

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
by, not only making it a social event --

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I think good use of behavioral economics in that,

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
if you turn up with several other mothers

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to have your child inoculated,

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But secondly, to incentivize that inoculation

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's a tiny, tiny thing.

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If you're a senior person at UNESCO

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and someone says, "So what are you doing

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to eradicate world poverty?"

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
you're not really confident standing up there

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
saying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you?

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Our own sense of self-aggrandizement

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
feels that big important problems

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
need to have big important, and most of all, expensive

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
solutions attached to them.

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is in human behavioral and behavioral change

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work,

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that actually what changes our behavior

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and what changes our attitude to things

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is not actually proportionate to the degree

130
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
of expense entailed,

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or the degree of force that's applied.

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But everything about institutions

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
makes them uncomfortable

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
with that disproportionality.

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So what happens in an institution

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is the very person who has the power to solve the problem

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
also has a very, very large budget.

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And once you have a very, very large budget,

139
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
What is completely lacking is a class of people

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
who have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's those people I'd quite like to create

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in the world going forward.

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now, here's another thing that happens,

146
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome,"

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
which is that big, expensive things

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
get big, highly-intelligent attention,

149
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,

150
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
until you get down to the small detail, the usability,

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
which is the signage,

152
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
which is catastrophic.

153
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
You come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow

154
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you.

155
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So you walk for another hundred yards,

156
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
expecting perhaps another sign,

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains."

158
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
No, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and says "Heathrow Express."

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane."

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A yellow sign? That's exactly what they'll be expecting.

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Actually, what happens in the world increasingly --

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
now, all credit to the British Airport Authority.

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I spoke about this before,

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?"

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
One of them also being,

168
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
although logically it's quite a good idea

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to have a lift with no up and down button in it,

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
if it only serves two floors,

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it's actually bloody terrifying, okay?

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Because when the door closes

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and there's nothing for you to do,

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So these questions ... what is happening in the world

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is the big stuff, actually,

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is done magnificently well.

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,

180
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is done spectacularly badly.

181
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock

182
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in terms of solving these small solutions.

183
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Because the people who can actually solve them

184
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
actually are too powerful and too preoccupied

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
with something they think of as "strategy" to actually solve them.

186
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.

187
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
What can we do and encourage more online banking?"

189
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I said, "It's really, really easy."

190
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I said, "When people login to their online bank

191
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at.

192
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance."

193
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I've got friends who actually

194
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
never use their own bank cash machines

195
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because there's the risk that it might display

196
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
their balance on the screen.

197
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news?

198
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Okay, you simply wouldn't.

199
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.'

200
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
If you make that an option rather than the default,

201
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking,

202
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and they do it three times as often."

203
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Let's face it, most of us -- how many of you

204
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?

205
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now, interesting that no single person does that,

207
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.

208
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But what's interesting about that suggestion

209
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
was that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds;

210
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure;

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it would actually cost about 50 quid.

212
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And yet, it never happens.

213
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Because there's a fundamental disconnect, as I said,

214
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that actually, the people with the power

215
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
want to do big expensive things.

216
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And there's to some extent a big strategy myth

217
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that's prevalent in business now.

218
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And if you think about it, it's very, very important

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that the strategy myth is maintained.

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Because, if the board of directors convince everybody

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that the success of any organization

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,

223
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
it makes the disparity in salaries

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
slightly more justifiable

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
might actually lie somewhere else,

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in small pieces of tactical activity.

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But what is happening is that effectively --

229
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this;

230
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
lots of things haven't helped this --

231
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.

232
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It wants the world to be the kind of place where

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the input and the change are proportionate.

234
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It's a kind of mechanistic world

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that we'd all love to live in

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
where, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,

237
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
everything is numerically expressible,

238
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and the amount you spend on something is proportionate

239
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to the scale of your success.

240
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
That's the world people actually want.

241
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.

242
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology

243
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in that in many cases,

244
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
very, very small changes

245
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
can have disproportionately huge effects,

246
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.

248
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But it's very, very uncomfortable for us

249
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world.

250
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But what I'm saying is we could just make things

251
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a little bit better for ourselves

252
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.

253
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
That is actually strategy, and I'm not denying that strategy has a role.

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money

255
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and you accomplish quite a lot.

256
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And I'd be wrong to dis that completely.

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Laughter)

259
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I thought it was very indecent of Accenture

260
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to ditch Tiger Woods in such

261
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
a sort of hurried and hasty way.

262
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.

263
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,

264
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

265
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
no longer tied to a single monopoly provider,

266
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in many cases, sourcing things locally,

267
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time

268
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
led for better load-balancing.

269
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I'm not sure.

270
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing.

271
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
That's called trivia.

272
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But there's a fourth thing.

273
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.

274
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We don't know what to call it.

275
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And actually we don't spend nearly enough money

276
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
looking for those things,

277
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
looking for those tiny things that may or may not work,

278
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but which, if they do work,

279
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
can have a success absolutely out of proportion

280
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to their expense, their efforts

281
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and the disruption they cause.

282
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So the first thing I'd like

283
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film --

284
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.

285
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And the second thing, I think,

286
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.

287
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."

288
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Every corporation should have one,

289
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.

290
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The people who actually have no money,

291
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
who have no extravagant budget,

292
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but who realize that actually

293
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you might achieve greater success in uptake

294
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
of a government program

295
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,

296
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect

297
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
simply by redesigning the form

298
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and writing it in comprehensible English.

299
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail

300
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and business actually had Chief Detail Officers,

301
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
then that fourth quadrant,

302
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
which is so woefully neglected at the moment,

303
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
might finally get the attention it deserves.

304
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Thank you very much.

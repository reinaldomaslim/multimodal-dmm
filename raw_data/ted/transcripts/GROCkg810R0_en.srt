2
0:00:12.316,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What I want you all to do right now

3
0:00:14.838,000 --> 0:00:18,000
is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.

4
0:00:19.029,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal

5
0:00:21.877,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.

6
0:00:26.205,000 --> 0:00:29,000
If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems,

7
0:00:29.267,000 --> 0:00:32,000
they simply will not work.

8
0:00:32.339,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That's the first thing.

9
0:00:34.029,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities

10
0:00:38.706,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of this mammal, if we study this mammal,

11
0:00:42.86,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we're going to get great insight into our diseases

12
0:00:46.422,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of the senses, such as blindness and deafness.

13
0:00:50.958,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal

14
0:00:55.728,000 --> 0:01:,000
is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth

15
0:01:00.922,000 --> 0:01:04,000
lies deep within its DNA.

16
0:01:04.977,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So are you all thinking?

17
0:01:07.285,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So,

18
0:01:09.779,000 --> 0:01:12,000
magnificent creature, isn't it?

19
0:01:12.881,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Who here thought of a bat?

20
0:01:16.233,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Ah, I can see half the audience agrees with me,

21
0:01:18.864,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.

22
0:01:22.087,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years

23
0:01:26.345,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.

24
0:01:30.744,000 --> 0:01:33,000
One fifth of all living mammals is a bat,

25
0:01:34.506,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and they have very unique attributes.

26
0:01:36.918,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet

27
0:01:39.946,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for about 64 million years.

28
0:01:43.929,000 --> 0:01:46,000
One of the most unique things that bats do

29
0:01:47.394,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as a mammal is that they fly.

30
0:01:50.195,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now flight is an inherently difficult thing.

31
0:01:53.53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times:

32
0:01:57.473,000 --> 0:02:,000
once in the bats, once in the birds,

33
0:02:00.833,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and once in the pterodactyls.

34
0:02:02.928,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.

35
0:02:06.774,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.

36
0:02:10.704,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But one other extremely unique thing about bats

37
0:02:15.09,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is that they are able to use sound

38
0:02:17.139,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to perceive their environment. They use echolocation.

39
0:02:21.935,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now, what I mean by echolocation --

40
0:02:24.599,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth

41
0:02:28.104,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or through their nose. This sound wave comes out

42
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment,

43
0:02:36.087,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and the bats then hear these echoes

44
0:02:38.947,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and they turn this information into an acoustic image.

45
0:02:42.465,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And this enables them to orient in complete darkness.

46
0:02:47.093,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.

47
0:02:50.518,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized

48
0:02:53.713,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly

49
0:02:57.654,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.

50
0:03:00.629,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show

51
0:03:03.653,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.

52
0:03:06.892,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.

53
0:03:10.86,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Indeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel

54
0:03:14.158,000 --> 0:03:17,000
once said, "To truly experience an alien life form

55
0:03:17.663,000 --> 0:03:2,000
on this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room

56
0:03:21.403,000 --> 0:03:25,000
with a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."

57
0:03:25.528,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And if you look at the actual physical characteristics

58
0:03:28.599,000 --> 0:03:3,000
on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat,

59
0:03:31.556,000 --> 0:03:33,000
you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated

60
0:03:34.35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to be able to make sound and perceive it.

61
0:03:37.689,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Very big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.

62
0:03:42.253,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize

63
0:03:46.142,000 --> 0:03:49,000
sound is very important for its survival.

64
0:03:49.416,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Most bats look like the previous one.

65
0:03:53.785,000 --> 0:03:57,000
However, there are a group that do not use echolocation.

66
0:03:57.824,000 --> 0:03:59,000
They do not perceive their environment using sound,

67
0:04:00.823,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and these are the flying foxes.

68
0:04:02.569,000 --> 0:04:05,000
If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia,

69
0:04:05.839,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney,

70
0:04:09.064,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and if you just look at their face, you can see

71
0:04:12.249,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.

72
0:04:15.787,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So among and within bats is a huge variation

73
0:04:19.309,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in their ability to use sensory perception.

74
0:04:22.2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now this is going to be important for what I'm going

75
0:04:24.253,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to tell you later during the talk.

76
0:04:26.016,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you,

77
0:04:31.095,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick

78
0:04:33.964,000 --> 0:04:36,000
looking at very large images of bats,

79
0:04:37.168,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that's probably not that surprising,

80
0:04:40.057,000 --> 0:04:42,000
because here in Western culture,

81
0:04:42.384,000 --> 0:04:43,000
bats have been demonized.

82
0:04:44.141,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Really, of course the famous book "Dracula,"

83
0:04:46.805,000 --> 0:04:49,000
written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker,

84
0:04:49.888,000 --> 0:04:51,000
probably is mainly responsible for this.

85
0:04:51.945,000 --> 0:04:54,000
However, I also think it's got to do with the fact

86
0:04:55.025,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that bats come out at night, and we don't

87
0:04:57.308,000 --> 0:04:59,000
really understand them. We're a little frightened by things

88
0:04:59.96,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that can perceive the world slightly differently than us.

89
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.

90
0:05:06.319,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They are the perpetrators in horror movies,

91
0:05:09.184,000 --> 0:05:1,000
such as this famous "Nightwing."

92
0:05:10.991,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Also, if you think about it, demons

93
0:05:13.752,000 --> 0:05:16,000
always have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically --

94
0:05:17.467,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or angels have bird wings.

95
0:05:20.336,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Now, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight

96
0:05:25.445,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture,

97
0:05:30.144,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that they perceive bats as

98
0:05:33.073,000 --> 0:05:36,000
creatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk

99
0:05:36.657,000 --> 0:05:4,000
into a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.

100
0:05:41.001,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This is considered the Five Blessings.

101
0:05:43.183,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word

102
0:05:45.845,000 --> 0:05:48,000
for "happiness," and they believe that bats

103
0:05:48.936,000 --> 0:05:52,000
bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.

104
0:05:53.297,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity

105
0:05:56.657,000 --> 0:05:58,000
surrounded by five bats.

106
0:05:58.755,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you

107
0:06:02.438,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and to show you that at least three of these blessings

108
0:06:06.024,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats

109
0:06:09.393,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.

110
0:06:13.656,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?

111
0:06:18.707,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems

112
0:06:22.217,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to function correctly. And why is this?

113
0:06:25.889,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.

114
0:06:30.003,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds

115
0:06:32.995,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating

116
0:06:37.103,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry

117
0:06:40.756,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in Mexico. So indeed, we need them

118
0:06:43.717,000 --> 0:06:45,000
for our ecosystems to function properly.

119
0:06:46.109,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Without them, it's going to be a problem.

120
0:06:48.844,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But most bats are voracious insect predators.

121
0:06:54.366,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony

122
0:06:57.242,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of big brown bats, that they will feed

123
0:06:59.393,000 --> 0:07:02,000
on over a million insects a year,

124
0:07:02.963,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and in the United States of America, right now

125
0:07:05.906,000 --> 0:07:08,000
bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.

126
0:07:09.247,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out

127
0:07:12.487,000 --> 0:07:15,000
populations of bats, and scientists have estimated

128
0:07:16.247,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now

129
0:07:21.204,000 --> 0:07:24,000
remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.

130
0:07:24.918,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.

131
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now

132
0:07:31.169,000 --> 0:07:32,000
bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.

133
0:07:32.893,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They're going to -- They are very threatened

134
0:07:35.191,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in the United States of America alone.

135
0:07:38.736,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now how can this help us?

136
0:07:40.277,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats

137
0:07:43.942,000 --> 0:07:45,000
from the equation, we're going to have to then use

138
0:07:46.336,000 --> 0:07:48,000
insecticides to remove all those pest insects

139
0:07:49.277,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that feed on our agricultural crops.

140
0:07:52.352,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated

141
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars,

142
0:07:58.942,000 --> 0:08:02,000
if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.

143
0:08:03.465,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They maintain the health of our ecosystems,

144
0:08:05.921,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and also they save us money.

145
0:08:08.41,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important

146
0:08:11.297,000 --> 0:08:13,000
for our ecosystems.

147
0:08:13.953,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And what about the second? What about health?

148
0:08:17.953,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Inside every cell in your body lies your genome.

149
0:08:22.615,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Your genome is made up of your DNA,

150
0:08:25.265,000 --> 0:08:28,000
your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function

151
0:08:28.457,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and interact and be as you are.

152
0:08:31.377,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies,

153
0:08:35.839,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome

154
0:08:39.962,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.

155
0:08:44.091,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now when we've been doing this, we've realized

156
0:08:46.631,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that there's variations within our genome.

157
0:08:50.448,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So I want you to look at the person beside you.

158
0:08:53.642,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize

159
0:08:55.721,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.

160
0:09:00.365,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And one of the grand challenges right now

161
0:09:02.63,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in modern molecular medicine is to work out

162
0:09:05.226,000 --> 0:09:09,000
whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases,

163
0:09:10.068,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or does this variation just make you different?

164
0:09:12.979,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Again, what does it mean here? What does this variation

165
0:09:15.385,000 --> 0:09:18,000
actually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this

166
0:09:19.204,000 --> 0:09:22,000
new molecular data and personalized genomic information

167
0:09:23.098,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that is coming online that we will be able to have

168
0:09:25.499,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate

169
0:09:28.571,000 --> 0:09:31,000
between the two. So how do we do this?

170
0:09:31.787,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.

171
0:09:35.115,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So through natural selection, over time,

172
0:09:39.96,000 --> 0:09:44,000
mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein

173
0:09:45.077,000 --> 0:09:47,000
will not be tolerated over time.

174
0:09:47.698,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.

175
0:09:51.892,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And so therefore, if you look at the same region

176
0:09:54.153,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of a genome in many mammals that have been

177
0:09:57.304,000 --> 0:10:,000
evolutionarily distant from each other

178
0:10:00.808,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better

179
0:10:04.271,000 --> 0:10:07,000
understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is,

180
0:10:08.033,000 --> 0:10:11,000
i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function,

181
0:10:11.912,000 --> 0:10:13,000
for its survival, it will be the same

182
0:10:14.232,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.

183
0:10:18.983,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So therefore, if we were to do this,

184
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
what we'd need to do is sequence that region

185
0:10:23.729,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same

186
0:10:26.844,000 --> 0:10:3,000
or if it's different. So if it is the same,

187
0:10:30.851,000 --> 0:10:33,000
this indicates that that site is important for a function,

188
0:10:33.96,000 --> 0:10:36,000
so a disease mutation should fall within that site.

189
0:10:37.823,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at

190
0:10:41.56,000 --> 0:10:44,000
have a yellow-type genome at that site,

191
0:10:44.824,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it probably suggests that purple is bad.

192
0:10:47.486,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals

193
0:10:50.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that are doing things slightly differently.

194
0:10:53.632,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So say, for example, the region of the genome

195
0:10:55.71,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.

196
0:10:59.239,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well,

197
0:11:02.913,000 --> 0:11:05,000
such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well

198
0:11:06.747,000 --> 0:11:08,000
have the purple type, we know that this is probably

199
0:11:09.519,000 --> 0:11:12,000
what's causing this disease.

200
0:11:12.894,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different

201
0:11:17.087,000 --> 0:11:2,000
types of diseases of the senses.

202
0:11:20.435,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?

203
0:11:23.243,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and

204
0:11:28.189,000 --> 0:11:31,000
45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem,

205
0:11:31.78,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases,

206
0:11:35.995,000 --> 0:11:37,000
so we want to try and better understand

207
0:11:38.166,000 --> 0:11:41,000
which mutations in the gene cause the disease.

208
0:11:41.771,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000

209
0:11:45.679,000 --> 0:11:48,000
newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80,

210
0:11:49.195,000 --> 0:11:52,000
over half of us will also have a hearing problem.

211
0:11:52.253,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Again, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.

212
0:11:56.53,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So what we've been doing in my lab

213
0:11:59.177,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats,

214
0:12:02.291,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and we have looked at genes that cause blindness

215
0:12:04.839,000 --> 0:12:05,000
when there's a defect in them,

216
0:12:06.188,000 --> 0:12:08,000
genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them,

217
0:12:08.731,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.

218
0:12:13.721,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So bats are also important for our health,

219
0:12:16.602,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.

220
0:12:21.492,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So this is where we are right now,

221
0:12:23.911,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but what about the future?

222
0:12:25.811,000 --> 0:12:26,000
What about longevity?

223
0:12:27.467,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This is where we're going to go, and as I said before,

224
0:12:31.208,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth

225
0:12:34.287,000 --> 0:12:35,000
lies within the bat genome.

226
0:12:35.996,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So why should we be interested in aging at all?

227
0:12:40.112,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s

228
0:12:42.6,000 --> 0:12:45,000
of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered

229
0:12:46.416,000 --> 0:12:49,000
one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood,

230
0:12:50.051,000 --> 0:12:52,000
aspects of all of biology, and really,

231
0:12:53.013,000 --> 0:12:57,000
since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.

232
0:12:57.389,000 --> 0:13:,000
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.

233
0:13:00.434,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be

234
0:13:04.063,000 --> 0:13:07,000
a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65,

235
0:13:07.878,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.

236
0:13:11.615,000 --> 0:13:13,000
As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration

237
0:13:14.456,000 --> 0:13:18,000
causes problems for our society, so we have to address it.

238
0:13:19.218,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie

239
0:13:23.732,000 --> 0:13:25,000
within the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard

240
0:13:26.413,000 --> 0:13:29,000
a guess over how long this bat could live for?

241
0:13:30.371,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years?

242
0:13:33.396,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Nobody? One? How about 10 years?

243
0:13:37.292,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Some? How about 30?

244
0:13:41.144,000 --> 0:13:44,000
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.

245
0:13:45.019,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.

246
0:13:48.67,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It lived for up to 42 years,

247
0:13:50.858,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and this bat's still alive in the wild today.

248
0:13:53.193,000 --> 0:13:55,000
But what would be so amazing about this?

249
0:13:55.775,000 --> 0:14:,000
Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship

250
0:14:00.857,000 --> 0:14:02,000
between body size, metabolic rate,

251
0:14:03.357,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and how long you can live for, and you can predict

252
0:14:05.493,000 --> 0:14:08,000
how long a mammal can live for given its body size.

253
0:14:08.72,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young.

254
0:14:12.415,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Think of a mouse. But bats are very different.

255
0:14:15.154,000 --> 0:14:17,000
As you can see here on this graph, in blue,

256
0:14:17.97,000 --> 0:14:19,000
these are all other mammals, but bats

257
0:14:20.536,000 --> 0:14:22,000
can live up to nine times longer than expected

258
0:14:22.704,000 --> 0:14:25,000
despite having a really, really high metabolic rate,

259
0:14:25.846,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and the question is, how can they do that?

260
0:14:28.481,000 --> 0:14:31,000
There are 19 species of mammal that live longer

261
0:14:32.022,000 --> 0:14:34,000
than expected, given their body size, than man,

262
0:14:34.798,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and 18 of those are bats.

263
0:14:37.646,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So therefore, they must have something within their DNA

264
0:14:42.582,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses,

265
0:14:45.427,000 --> 0:14:48,000
particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy

266
0:14:49.333,000 --> 0:14:5,000
than a mammal of the same size,

267
0:14:50.873,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.

268
0:14:54.485,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So right now, in my lab, we're combining

269
0:14:57.83,000 --> 0:15:,000
state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching

270
0:15:01.741,000 --> 0:15:03,000
the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date,

271
0:15:04.55,000 --> 0:15:07,000
modern molecular technology to understand better

272
0:15:08.021,000 --> 0:15:12,000
what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.

273
0:15:12.549,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.

274
0:15:15.709,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Aging is a big problem for humanity,

275
0:15:19.308,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover

276
0:15:22.244,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals

277
0:15:25.116,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out

278
0:15:28.325,000 --> 0:15:31,000
what they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy,

279
0:15:31.557,000 --> 0:15:33,000
we can enable us to do the same thing.

280
0:15:34.116,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.

281
0:15:39.392,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Just imagine what that would be like.

282
0:15:43.283,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them

283
0:15:46.168,000 --> 0:15:51,000
as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.

284
0:15:51.222,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit

285
0:15:55.068,000 --> 0:15:57,000
if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem,

286
0:15:57.62,000 --> 0:15:59,000
they allow us to understand how our genome functions,

287
0:16:00.526,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.

288
0:16:03.755,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up

289
0:16:06.37,000 --> 0:16:09,000
in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal,

290
0:16:09.869,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I want you to smile. Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We are here today

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
because [the] United Nations

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
have defined goals

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for the progress of countries.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
They're called Millennium Development Goals.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And the reason I really like these goals

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is that there are eight of them.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And by specifying eight different goals,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the United Nations has said

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that there are so many things needed

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to change in a country

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in order to get the good life for people.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Look here -- you have to end poverty,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
education, gender,

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
child and maternal health,

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
control infections, protect the environment

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and get the good global links between nations

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in every aspect

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
from aid to trade.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
There's a second reason I like these development goals,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and that is because each and every one is measured.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Take child mortality;

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the aim here is to reduce child mortality

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
by two-thirds,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
from 1990 to 2015.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
That's a four percent reduction per year --

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and this, with measuring.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
That's what makes the difference

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
between political talking like this

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and really going for the important thing,

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a better life for people.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And what I'm so happy about with this

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is that we have already documented

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that there are many countries

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in Asia, in the Middle East,

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in Latin America and East Europe

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that [are] reducing with this rate.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and Turkey with seven percent per year.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So there's good news.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And there's not even statistics on Africa

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to know what is happening."

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I'll prove them wrong on both points.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
where you can take deaths in children

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
below five years of age for all countries --

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
it's done by U.N. specialists.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I will take Kenya as an example.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Here you see the data.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Don't panic -- don't panic now, I'll help you through this.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It looks nasty, like in college

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
when you didn't like statistics.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But first thing, when you see dots like this,

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
you have to ask yourself:

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
from where do the data come?

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
What is the origin of the data?

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Is it so that in Kenya,

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
there are doctors and other specialists

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
who write the death certificate at the death of the child

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and it's sent to the statistical office?

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
No -- low-income countries like Kenya

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
still don't have that level of organization.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It exists, but it's not complete

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because so many deaths occur in the home

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
with the family,

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and it's not registered.

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What we rely on is not an incomplete system.

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We have interviews, we have surveys.

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And this is highly professional

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
female interviewers

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
who sit down for one hour with a woman

74
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and ask her about [her] birth history.

75
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
How many children did you have?

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Are they alive?

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If they died, at what age and what year?

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And then this is done in a representative sample

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of thousands of women in the country

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and put together in what used to be called

81
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a demographic health survey report.

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But these surveys are costly,

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But they have good quality.

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So this is a limitation.

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And all these colored lines here are results;

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
each color is one survey.

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and I give you one average point for each survey.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This was 1977, 1988,

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
1992, '97

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and 2002.

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And when the experts in the U.N.

94
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
have got these surveys in place in their database,

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
then they use advanced mathematical formulas

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
See here -- it's the best fit they can get of this point.

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But watch out --

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
they continue the line

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
beyond the last point

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
out into nothing.

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And they estimated that in 2008,

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Kenya had per child mortality of 128.

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I was sad,

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because we could see

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
this reversal in Kenya

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with an increased child mortality in the 90s.

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It was so tragic.

109
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
from Demographic Health Surveys,

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and it showed good news from Kenya.

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I was so happy.

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This was the estimate of the new survey.

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Then it just took another three months

115
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for [the] U.N. to get it into their server,

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and on Friday we got the new trend line --

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it was down here.

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Isn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah?

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I saw the death rate fall

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
from 128 to 84 just that morning.

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So we celebrated.

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But now, when you have this trend line,

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
how do we measure progress?

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I'm going into some details here,

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because [the] U.N. do it like this.

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.

128
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress."

129
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's unfair.

130
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.

131
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I would say, at least do this --

132
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
10 years is enough to follow the trend.

133
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.

134
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They have 2.4 percent.

135
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,

136
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I may have joined these two points.

137
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So what I'm telling you

138
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is that we know the child mortality.

139
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We have a decent trend.

140
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's coming into some tricky things then

141
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
when we are measuring MDGs.

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And the reason here for Africa is especially important,

143
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because '90s was a bad decade,

144
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
not only in Kenya, but across Africa.

145
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The HIV epidemic peaked.

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We got, later, the mosquito netting.

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And there was socio-economic problems,

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
which are now being solved at a much better scale.

150
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So look at the average here --

151
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.

152
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And [the] U.N. says

153
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it's a reduction with 1.8 percent.

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now this sounds a little theoretical,

155
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but it's not so theoretical.

156
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You know, these economists,

157
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.

159
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We in public health, we hate child death,

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
so we want less and less and less of child deaths.

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So we calculate the percent reduction per year,

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but it's sort of the same percentage.

163
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
If your economy grows with four percent,

164
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you ought to reduce child mortality four percent;

165
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
if it's used well and people are really involved

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
An economist would never do that.

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I have just divided it into two periods.

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In the 90s, only 1.2 percent,

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
only 1.2 percent.

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Whereas now, second gear --

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it's like Africa had first gear,

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
now they go into second gear.

175
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But even this

176
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is not a fair representation of Africa,

177
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because it's an average,

178
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it's an average speed of reduction in Africa.

179
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.

180
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Still here,

181
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
child death per 1,000 on that axis.

182
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Here we have [the] year.

183
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.

184
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I start 50 years ago

185
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
when Africa celebrated independence in most countries.

186
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I give you Congo, which was high,

187
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Ghana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower.

188
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.

189
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You can see, with independence, literacy improved

190
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,

191
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
hygiene was improved, and things got better.

192
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But then, in the '80s, watch out here.

193
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Congo got into civil war,

194
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and they leveled off here.

195
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Ghana got very ahead, fast.

196
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,

197
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but then Kenya and Ghana go down together --

198
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
still a standstill in Congo.

199
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
That's where we are today.

200
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You can see it doesn't make sense

201
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to make an average of this zero improvement

202
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and this very fast improvement.

203
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Time has come

204
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.

205
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Their countries are so different,

206
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and they merit to be recognized in the same way,

207
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
as we don't talk about Europe as one place.

208
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different --

209
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
everyone knows that.

210
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.

211
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So let me show the wider picture.

212
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
My country, Sweden:

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
1800, we were up there.

214
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What a strange personality disorder we must have,

215
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.

216
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.

217
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know,

218
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that we counted all the child deaths,

219
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
even if we didn't do anything about it.

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And then, you see, these were famine years.

221
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
These were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden.

222
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
My ancestors moved to the United States.

223
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And eventually, soon they started to get better and better here.

224
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And here we got better education, and we got health service,

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and child mortality came down.

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.

227
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But look, the rate of lowering

228
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in Sweden

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
was not fast.

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Sweden achieved a low child mortality

231
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because we started early.

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We had primary school actually

233
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
started in 1842.

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And then you get that wonderful effect

235
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
when we got female literacy

236
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
one generation later.

237
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress

238
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
are long-term investments.

239
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's not about just five years --

240
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
it's long-term investments.

241
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,

242
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
3.1 percent when I calculated.

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is.

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
But you don't talk about it so much.

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Let me show you Thailand,

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
see what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s --

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
how they went down here

249
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.

250
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I'll give you another story -- Egypt,

251
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the most hidden, glorious success in public health.

252
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Egypt was up here in 1960,

253
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
higher than Congo.

254
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The Nile Delta was a misery for children

255
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with diarrheal disease

256
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and malaria and a lot of problems.

257
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,

258
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they increased education

259
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and they got primary health care.

260
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And down they went, you know.

261
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.

262
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And isn't it a success story.

263
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality

264
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is fully possible.

265
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And the good thing is

266
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that Ghana today is going with the same rate

267
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
as Egypt did at its fastest.

268
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Kenya is now speeding up.

269
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Here we have a problem.

270
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.

271
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now, let me now bring you to a wider picture,

272
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
a wider picture of child mortality.

273
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I'm going to show you the relationship

274
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
between child mortality on this axis here --

275
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
this axis here is child mortality --

276
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and here I have the family size.

277
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The relationship between child mortality and family size.

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
One, two, three, four children per woman:

279
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
six, seven, eight children per woman.

280
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This is, once again, 1960 --

281
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
50 years ago.

282
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Each bubble is a country --

283
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the color, you can see, a continent.

284
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.

285
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And the size of the bubble is the population.

286
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And these are

287
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the so-called "developing" countries.

288
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They had high, or very high, child mortality

289
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and family size, six to eight.

290
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And the ones over there,

291
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
they were so-called Western countries.

292
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
They had low child mortality

293
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and small families.

294
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
What has happened?

295
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes

296
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the relation between fall in child mortality

297
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and decrease in family size.

298
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I just want not to have any room for doubt --

299
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you have to see that for yourself.

300
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This is what happened. Now I start the world.

301
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Here we come down with the eradication of

302
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
smallpox, better education,

303
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
health service.

304
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here.

305
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And here Brazil is in the Western Box.

306
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box,

307
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and we get a lot a new neighbors.

308
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Welcome to a decent life.

309
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Come on. We want everyone down there.

310
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This is the vision we have, isn't it.

311
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And look now, the first African countries here are coming in.

312
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
There we are today.

313
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
There is no such thing

314
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
as a "Western world" and "developing world."

315
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is the report from [the] U.N.,

316
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
which came out on Friday.

317
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" --

318
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
except this page.

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This page is very bad;

320
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
it's a categorization of countries.

321
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here --

322
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.

323
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Huh?

324
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?

325
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
They have here Singapore.

326
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.

327
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They bypassed Sweden five years ago,

328
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and they are labeled a developing country.

329
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
They have here Qatar.

330
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera.

331
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
How the heck could they be [a] developing country?

332
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
This is crap.

333
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Applause)

334
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The rest here is good -- the rest is good.

335
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We have to have a modern concept,

336
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
which fits to the data.

337
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And we have to realize

338
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that we are all going to into this, down to here.

339
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
What is the importance now with the relations here.

340
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Look -- even if we look in Africa --

341
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
these are the African countries.

342
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality

343
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and decreasing family size,

344
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
even within Africa.

345
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's very clear that this is what happens.

346
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And a very important piece of research came out on Friday

347
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle

348
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
showing that almost 50 percent

349
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
of the fall in child mortality

350
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
can be attributed to female education.

351
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
That is, when we get girls in school,

352
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,

353
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
which is a secular trend which is very strong.

354
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
That's why we must have that long-term perspective,

355
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but we must measure the impact

356
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
over 10-year periods.

357
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It's fully possible

358
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to get child mortality down in all of these countries

359
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and to get them down in the corner

360
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
where we all would like to live together.

361
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And of course, lowering child mortality

362
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is a matter of utmost importance

363
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
from humanitarian aspects.

364
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It's a decent life for children,

365
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
we are talking about.

366
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But it is also a strategic investment

367
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in the future of all mankind,

368
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
because it's about the environment.

369
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We will not be able to manage the environment

370
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and avoid the terrible climate crisis

371
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
if we don't stabilize the world population.

372
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Let's be clear about that.

373
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And the way to do that,

374
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning

375
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and behind that drive female education.

376
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And that is fully possible. Let's do it.

377
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Thank you very much.

378
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Applause)

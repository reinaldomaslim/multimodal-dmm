Translator: Jenny Zurawell

2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's a great honor to be here.

3
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's a great honor to be here talking about cities,

4
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
talking about the future of cities.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's great to be here as a mayor.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I really do believe that mayors have the political position

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to really change people's lives.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That's the place to be.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Rio's a beautiful city,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a vibrant place, special place.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Actually, you're looking at a guy

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
who has the best job in the world.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I really wanted to share with you

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a very special moment of my life

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the history of the city of Rio.

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Video) Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen,

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the envelope containing the result.

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Jacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that the games of the 31st Olympiad

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Cheering)

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
EP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but it was not easy to get there.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Actually it was a very hard challenge.

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We had to beat the European monarchy.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This is Juan Carlos, king of Spain.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We had to beat the most powerful man in the world

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
defending his own city.

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So it was not easy at all.

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that I think fits perfectly to the situation

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
of Rio winning the Olympic bid.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We really showed that, yes, we can.

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And really, this is the reason I came here tonight.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I came here tonight to tell you

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that things can be done,

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that you don't have always to be rich or powerful

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to get things on the way,

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that cities are a great challenge.

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It's a difficult task to deal with cities.

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But with some original ways

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of getting things done,

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
with some basic commandments,

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
you can really get cities

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to be a great, great place to live.

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I want you all to imagine Rio.

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You probably think about a city full of energy,

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a vibrant city full of green.

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And nobody showed that better

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
than Carlos Saldanha in last year's "Rio."

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Music)

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Video) Bird: This is incredible.

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Music)

56
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
EP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that,

57
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but it's not like that everywhere.

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We're like every big city in the world.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We've got lots of people,

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
pollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.

61
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
These pictures I'm showing here,

62
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
they are some pictures from Madureira.

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I want to use an example of Rio

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that we're doing in Madureira, in this region,

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to see what we should think as our first commandment.

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So every time you see a concrete jungle like that,

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
what you've got to do is find open spaces.

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
If you don't have open spaces,

70
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
you've got to go there and open spaces.

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So go inside these open spaces

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and make it that people can get inside

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and use those spaces.

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is going to be the third largest park in Rio

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
by June this year.

76
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's going to be a place where people can meet,

77
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
where you can put nature.

78
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The temperature's going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So the first commandment

80
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I want to leave you tonight

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is, a city of the future

82
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
has to be environmentally friendly.

83
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Every time you think of a city,

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
you've got to think green.

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You've got to think green and green.

86
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.

87
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Let's think that cities are made of people,

88
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
lots of people together.

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
cities are packed with people.

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So how do you move these people around?

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
When you have 3.5 billion people living in cities --

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
by 2050, it's going to be 6 billion people.

93
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So every time you think about moving these people around,

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you think about high-capacity transportation.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But there is a problem.

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
High-capacity transportation means

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
spending lots and lots of money.

98
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So what I'm going to show here

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is something that was already presented in TED

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
by the former mayor of Curitiba

101
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
who created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner.

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio.

103
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.

104
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows.

105
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You transform it inside as a train car.

106
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You use separate lanes, dedicated lanes.

107
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The contractors, they don't like that.

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You don't have to dig deep down underground.

109
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You can build nice stations.

110
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio.

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Again, you don't have to dig deep down underground

112
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to make a station like that.

113
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This station has the same comfort, the same features

114
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
as a subway station.

115
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So spending much less money and doing it much faster,

117
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you can really change the way people move.

118
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
This is a map of Rio.

119
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
All the lines, the colored lines you see there,

120
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it's our high-capacity transportation network.

121
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In this present time today,

122
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we only carry 18 percent of our population

123
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in high-capacity transportation.

124
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
With the BRTs we're doing,

125
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
again, the cheapest and fastest way,

126
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we're going to move to 63 percent of the population

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
being carried by high-capacity transportation.

128
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So remember what I said:

129
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You don't always have to be rich or powerful

130
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to get things done.

131
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You can find original ways to get things done.

132
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight

133
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is, a city of the future

134
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
has to deal with mobility and integration

135
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of its people.

136
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Moving to the third commandment.

137
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And this is the most controversial one.

138
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It has to do with the favelas, the slums --

139
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
whatever you call it, there are different names all over the world.

140
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But the point we want to make here tonight

141
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is, favelas are not always a problem.

142
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I mean, favelas can sometimes

143
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
really be a solution,

144
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
if you deal with them,

145
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
if you put public policy inside the favelas.

146
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Let me just show a map of Rio again.

147
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants --

148
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
More than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas.

149
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
All these red parts are favelas.

150
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So you see, they are spread all over the city.

151
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is a typical view of a favela in Rio.

152
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
You see the contrast between the rich and poor.

153
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.

154
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The first one is,

155
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
you can change from what I call a [vicious] circle

156
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to a virtual circle.

157
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But what you've got to do to get that

158
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is you've got to go inside the favelas,

159
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
bring in the basic services --

160
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
mainly education and health -- with high quality.

161
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I'm going to give a fast example here.

162
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This was an old building in a favela in Rio --

163
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
[unclear favela name] --

164
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that we just transformed into a primary school,

165
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with high quality.

166
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This is primary assistance in health

167
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that we built inside a favela,

168
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
again, with high quality.

169
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We call it a family clinic.

170
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So the first point is bring basic services

171
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
inside the favelas

172
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with high quality.

173
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The second point I want to make about the favelas

174
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is, you've got to open spaces in the favela.

175
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Bring infrastructure

176
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.

177
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Rio has the aim, by 2020,

178
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to have all its favelas completely urbanized.

179
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Another example, this was completely packed with houses,

180
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and then we built this, what we call, a knowledge square.

181
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This is a place with high technology

182
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place

183
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
can go inside and have access to all technology.

184
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We even built a theater there -- 3D movie.

185
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And this is the kind of change you can get for that.

186
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize,

187
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
which is this great laugh

188
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
from a kid that lives in the favela.

189
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight

190
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is, a city of the future

191
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
has to be socially integrated.

192
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You cannot deal with a city

193
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
if it's not socially integrated.

194
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But moving to our fourth commandment,

195
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I really wouldn't be here tonight.

196
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Between November and May, Rio's completely packed.

197
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We just had last week Carnivale.

198
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It was great. It was lots of fun.

199
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We have New Year's Eve.

200
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
There's like two million people on Copacabana Beach.

201
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We have problems.

202
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.

203
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You can imagine how people get happy with me

204
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
watching these kinds of scenes.

205
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We have problems with the tropical rains.

206
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Almost every year

207
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we have these landslides, which are terrible.

208
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But the reason I could come here

209
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is because of that.

210
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
This was something we did with IBM

211
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that's a little bit more than a year old.

212
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It's what we call the Operations Center of Rio.

213
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology,

214
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
from here, from Long Beach,

215
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so I got here last night and I know everything.

216
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We're going to speak now to the Operations Center.

217
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This is Osorio,

218
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
he's our secretary of urban affairs.

219
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So Osorio, good to be there with you.

220
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I've already told the people

221
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that we have tropical rain this time of year.

222
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So how's the weather in Rio now?

223
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Osorio: The weather is fine. We have fair weather today.

224
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Let me get you our weather satellite radar.

225
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You see just a little bit of moisture around the city.

226
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather,

227
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
today and in the next few days.

228
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
EP: Okay, how's the traffic?

229
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.

230
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
People get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight?

231
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Osario: Well traffic tonight is fine.

232
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Let me get you one of our 8,000 buses.

233
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
A live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.

234
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
You see, the streets are clear.

235
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Now it's 11:00 pm in Rio.

236
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Nothing of concern in terms of traffic.

237
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I'll get to you now the incidents of the day.

238
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We had heavy traffic early in the morning

239
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and in the rush hour in the afternoon,

240
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but nothing of big concern.

241
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We are below average

242
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in terms of traffic incidents in the city.

243
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
EP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services.

244
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
These are the cars.

245
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Osorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.

246
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.

247
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is live transmission.

248
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We have GPS's in all of our trucks.

249
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And you can see them working

250
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in all parts of the city.

251
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Waste collection on time.

252
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Public services working well.

253
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
EP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much.

254
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It was great to have you here.

255
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.

256
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Applause)

257
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Okay, so no files, this place, no paperwork,

258
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
no distance, 24/7 working.

259
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight

260
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is, a city of the future

261
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
has to use technology to be present.

262
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city.

263
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But everything that I said here tonight, or the commandments,

264
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
are means, are ways,

265
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
for us to govern cities --

266
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
invest in infrastructure, invest in the green,

267
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
open parks, open spaces,

268
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
integrate socially, use technology.

269
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But at the end of the day, when we talk about cities,

270
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
we talk about a gathering of people.

271
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And we cannot see that as a problem.

272
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That is fantastic.

273
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
If there's 3.5 billion now,

274
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
it's going to be six billion then it's going to be 10 billion.

275
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
That is great, that means we're going to have

276
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
10 billion minds working together,

277
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
10 billion talents together.

278
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So a city of the future,

279
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I really do believe

280
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that it's a city that cares about its citizens,

281
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
integrates socially its citizens.

282
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out

283
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
of this great party, which are cities.

284
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Thank you very much.

285
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

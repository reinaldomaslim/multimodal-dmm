1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"Oh beloved dentist:

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
your voice so soft and muffled ...

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Lower the mask, dear dentist,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
lower the mask."

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Okay, in this presentation,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
through a fairly serious workout.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You're going to see a lot of imagery,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
so I need you to kind of split your brains in half

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and let the images flow over one side

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and listen to me on the other.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So I am one of those people

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
with a transformative personal story.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Six years ago,

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
after 20 years in graphic design and typography,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I changed the way I was working

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and the way most graphic designers work

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to pursue a more personal approach to my work,

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with only the humble attempt

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to simply make a living doing something that I loved.

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But something weird happened.

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I became bizarrely

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
popular.

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
My current work

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
seems to resonate with people

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in a way that has so taken me by surprise

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that I still frequently wonder

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
what in the hell is going on.

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I'm slowly coming to understand

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that the appeal of what I do

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
may be connected to why I do it.

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
These days, I call myself a graphic artist.

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So where my work as a graphic designer

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
was to follow strategy,

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
my work now

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
follows my heart

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and my interests

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
with the guidance of my ego

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, this is heresy

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in the design world.

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The ego is not supposed

47
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to be involved in graphic design.

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But I find that for myself,

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
without exception,

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the more I deal with the work

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
as something of my own,

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
as something that is personal,

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the more successful it is

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
as something that's compelling,

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
interesting and sustaining.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of design thinking.

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Where others might look at measurable results,

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
like "Does it bring joy?"

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"Is there a sense of wonder?"

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and "Does it invoke curiosity?"

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is a scientific diagram, by the way.

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I don't have time to explain it,

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but it has to do with DNA and RNA.

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.

67
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The things that interest me when I'm working

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
are visual structure,

69
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
surprise

70
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and anything that requires figuring things out.

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So for this reason, I'm particularly drawn

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to systems and patterns.

73
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.

74
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This is a piece that I did for

75
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.

76
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They have a magazine that they call G2.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And this is for their puzzle special

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in 2007.

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And puzzling it is.

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I started by creating a series of tiling units.

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And these tiling units, I designed

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
specifically so that they would contain

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
parts of letterforms within their shapes

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
so that I could then

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
join those pieces together

86
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to create letters and then words

87
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
within the abstract patterning.

88
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But then as well, I was able to

89
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
just flip them, rotate them

90
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and combine them in different ways

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to create either regular patterns

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
or abstract patterns.

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So here's the word puzzle again.

94
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And here it is with the abstract surrounding.

95
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.

96
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But all I have to do is

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
fill certain areas of those letterforms

98
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I can bring those words out of

99
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the background pattern.

100
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But maybe that's a little too obvious.

101
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So then I can add some color in with the background

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and add a bit more color in with the words themselves,

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and this way, working with the art director,

104
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I'm able to bring it to just the right point

105
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that it's puzzling for the audience --

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they can figure out that there's something they have to read --

107
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but it's not impossible for them to read.

108
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I'm also interested in working with

109
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
unusual materials

110
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and common materials in unusual ways.

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So this requires figuring out how to

112
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
get the most out of something's innate properties

113
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and also how to bend it to my will.

114
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So ultimately,

115
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
my goal is to create something unexpected.

116
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
To this end, I have worked in sugar

117
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
for Stefan Sagmeister,

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
three-time TED speaker.

119
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And this project began essentially

120
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
on my kitchen table.

121
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I've been eating cereal for breakfast

122
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
all of my life.

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And for that same amount of time,

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I've been spilling sugar on the table

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.

126
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And eventually I used this technique

127
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to create a piece of artwork.

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then I used it again to create

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
six pieces for Stefan's book,

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And these were created

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
without sketches, just freehand,

133
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
by putting the sugar down on a white surface

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and then manipulating it to get

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the words and designs out of it.

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Recently, I've also made some

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
rather highbrow baroque borders

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
out of lowbrow pasta.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,

140
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and the chapter is on honor.

141
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So it's a little bit unexpected,

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but, in a way, it refers

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to the macaroni art

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that children make for their parents

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or they make in school and give to their parents,

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which is in itself a form of honor.

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.

148
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.

149
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm very interested in wonder,

151
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in design as an impetus to inquiring.

152
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
To say I wonder is to say

153
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I question, I ask.

154
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And to experience wonder is to experience awe.

155
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So I'm currently working on a book,

156
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which plays with both senses of the word,

157
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as I explore some of my own ideas

158
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and inquiries

159
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in a visual display of rather

160
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
peacock-like grandeur.

161
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The world is full of wonder.

162
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But the world of graphic design,

163
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
for the most part, is not.

164
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So I'm using my own writings

165
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as a kind of testing ground for a book that has

166
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
an interdependency between word and image

167
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
as a kind of seductive force.

168
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I think that one of the things

169
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that religions got right

170
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
was the use of visual wonder

171
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to deliver a message.

172
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I think this true marriage of art and information

173
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is woefully underused in adult literature,

174
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and I'm mystified as to

175
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
why visual wealth is not more commonly used

176
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to enhance intellectual wealth.

177
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
When we look at works like this,

178
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we tend to associate them with children's literature.

179
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
There's an implication that ornamental graphics

180
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
detract from the seriousness of the content.

181
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But I really hope to have the opportunity

182
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to change that perception.

183
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This book is taking rather a long time,

184
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but I'm nearly done.

185
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea

186
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to put an intermission

187
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in my talk.

188
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up.

189
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I do these valentines.

191
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I've been sending out valentines

192
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
on a fairly large scale since 2005.

193
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
These are my valentines

194
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
from 2005 and 2006.

195
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I started by

196
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
doing just a single image like this

197
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and sending them out to each person.

198
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But in 2007,

199
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I got the cockamamie idea

200
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to hand-draw each valentine

201
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
for everyone on my mailing list.

202
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.

203
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And I drew each person

204
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
their own unique valentine

205
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and put their name on it

206
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.

207
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Believe it or not, I devised this

208
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
as a timesaving method.

209
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I was very busy in the beginning of that year,

210
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and I didn't know when I was going to find time

211
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to design and print a single valentine.

212
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal

213
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
as I was traveling.

214
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It didn't exactly work out that way.

215
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
There's a longer story to this,

216
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but I did get them all done in time,

217
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and they were extremely well received.

218
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I got an almost 100 percent response rate.

219
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

220
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And those who didn't respond

221
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
will never receive anything from me ever again.

222
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughter)

223
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Last year,

224
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.

225
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I had this idea that I wanted people

226
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to receive a kind of

227
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
mysterious love letter,

228
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
like a found fragment in their mailbox.

229
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I wanted it to be something

230
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that was not addressed to them

231
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or signed by me,

232
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
something that caused them to wonder

233
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
what on Earth this thing was.

234
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And I specifically wrote

235
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
four pages that don't connect.

236
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
There were four different versions of this.

237
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And I wrote them

238
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
so that they begin in the middle of a sentence,

239
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
end in the middle of a sentence.

240
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And they're on the one hand, universal,

241
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
so I avoid specific names or places,

242
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but on the other hand, they're personal.

243
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So I wanted people to really get the sense that

244
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they had received something that could have been

245
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
a love letter to them.

246
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And I'm just going to read one of them to you.

247
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
"You've never really been sure of this,

248
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but I can assure you that this quirk

249
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
you're so self-conscious of

250
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is intensely endearing.

251
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Just please accept that this piece of you

252
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
escapes with your smile,

253
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and those of us who notice

254
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are happy to catch it in passing.

255
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,

256
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but without the scratches and bird shit."

257
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Laughter)

258
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"That is to say,

259
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
your thoughts and words flit and dart,

260
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
disconcertedly elusive at times,

261
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but when caught and examined --

262
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
ahh, such a wonder,

263
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
such a delightful reward.

264
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
There's no passing time with you,

265
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
only collecting --

266
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation

267
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and at the same time release.

268
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Impossible? I don't think so.

269
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I know this makes you embarrassed.

270
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I'm certain I can see you blushing.

271
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But I just have to tell you because

272
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
sometimes I hear your self-doubt,

273
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and it's so crushing to think

274
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that you may not know how truly wonderful you are,

275
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
how inspiring and delightful

276
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and really, truly the most completely ..."

277
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

278
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

279
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So Valentine's Day

280
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
is coming up in a couple of days,

281
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and these are currently arriving

282
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in mailboxes all around the world.

283
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This year, I got, what I really have to say

284
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is a rather brilliant idea,

285
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to laser cut

286
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
my valentines

287
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
out of used Christmas cards.

288
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So I solicited friends

289
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to send me their used Christmas cards,

290
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and I made 500 of these.

291
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Each one of them is completely different.

292
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I'm just really, really thrilled with them.

293
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I don't have that much else to say,

294
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but they turned out really well.

295
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I do spend a lot of time on my work.

296
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently

297
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is what is worth while.

298
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
What is it that's worth spending my time on

299
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and my life on in this way?

300
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Working in the commercial world,

301
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.

302
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.

303
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
But ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.

304
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
What makes something worthwhile for me

305
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is the people I work for or with,

306
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the conditions I work under

307
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and the audience that I'm able to reach.

308
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So I might ask: "Who is it for?"

309
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
"What does it say?"

310
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and "What does it do?"

311
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult

312
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
for someone like me to come up on stage

313
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
at this conference

314
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
with these unbelievably brilliant minds,

315
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
who are thinking these

316
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
really big-picture,

317
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
world-changing, life-changing

318
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
ideas and technologies.

319
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And it's very, very common

320
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
for designers and people in the visual arts

321
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to feel that we're

322
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
not contributing enough,

323
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
or worse, that all we're doing is

324
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
contributing to landfill.

325
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Here I am; I'm showing you

326
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
some pretty visuals

327
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and talking about aesthetics.

328
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But I've come to believe that

329
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
truly imaginative visual work

330
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is extremely important in society.

331
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Just in the way that I'm inspired

332
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
by books

333
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and magazines of all kinds,

334
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
conversations I have, movies,

335
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
so I also think,

336
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
when I put visual work out there into the mass media,

337
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
work that is interesting, unusual,

338
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
intriguing,

339
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
work that maybe opens up that sense

340
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
of inquiry in the mind,

341
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.

342
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And you just never know who

343
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is going to take something from that

344
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and turn it into something else,

345
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
because inspiration

346
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
is cross-pollinating.

347
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So a piece of mine

348
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
may inspire a playwright

349
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
or a novelist or a scientist,

350
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and that in turn may be the seed

351
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that inspires a doctor

352
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
or a philanthropist

353
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
or a babysitter.

354
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And this isn't something that you can quantify

355
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
or track or measure,

356
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and we tend to undervalue things in society

357
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that we can't measure.

358
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
But I really believe

359
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that a fully operating, rich society

360
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
needs these seeds coming from all directions

361
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and all disciplines

362
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in order to keep the gears of inspiration

363
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and imagination

364
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
flowing and cycling and growing.

365
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So that's why I do what I do,

366
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and why I spend so much time and effort on it,

367
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and why I work in the commercial, public sphere,

368
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
as opposed to the isolated, private sphere

369
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of fine art:

370
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
because I want as many people as possible

371
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,

372
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and be able to take something from it.

373
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile

374
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to spend my valuable

375
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and limited time on this Earth

376
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
in this way.

377
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.

378
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000

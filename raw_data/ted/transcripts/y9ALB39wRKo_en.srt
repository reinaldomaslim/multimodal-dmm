2
0:00:13.25,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This will not be a speech

3
0:00:14.516,000 --> 0:00:17,000
like any one I have ever given.

4
0:00:17.807,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I will talk to you today about

5
0:00:21.297,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the failure of leadership in global politics

6
0:00:26.187,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and in our globalizing economy.

7
0:00:29.185,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions.

8
0:00:36.138,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But I will in the end urge you

9
0:00:38.672,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to rethink, actually take risks, and get involved

10
0:00:44.115,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in what I see as a global evolution

11
0:00:47.52,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of democracy.

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Failure of leadership.

13
0:00:52.585,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What is the failure of leadership today?

14
0:00:55.346,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And why is our democracy not working?

15
0:00:58.813,000 --> 0:01:,000
Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact

16
0:01:01.444,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that we have taken you out of the process.

17
0:01:05.997,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So let me, from my personal experiences,

18
0:01:08.513,000 --> 0:01:12,000
give you an insight, so that you can step back

19
0:01:12.742,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope

20
0:01:16.414,000 --> 0:01:18,000
with the challenges of today and why politics

21
0:01:18.489,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is going down a blind alley.

22
0:01:22.133,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Let's start from the beginning.

23
0:01:24.63,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Let's start from democracy.

24
0:01:28.426,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,

25
0:01:30.451,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it was a revelation, a discovery,

26
0:01:33.64,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that we had the potential, together,

27
0:01:38.157,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to be masters of our own fate,

28
0:01:41.878,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,

29
0:01:44.75,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and then to design a better life.

30
0:01:48.083,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And democracy was the political innovation

31
0:01:53.269,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which protected this freedom,

32
0:01:55.771,000 --> 0:02:,000
because we were liberated from fear

33
0:02:01.086,000 --> 0:02:02,000
so that our minds in fact,

34
0:02:02.739,000 --> 0:02:04,000
whether they be despots or dogmas,

35
0:02:05.461,000 --> 0:02:09,000
could be the protagonists.

36
0:02:09.864,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us

37
0:02:12.853,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to limit the power, whether it was of tyrants

38
0:02:16.241,000 --> 0:02:18,000
or of high priests,

39
0:02:18.988,000 --> 0:02:22,000
their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth.

40
0:02:23.826,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Well, I first began to understand this

41
0:02:25.436,000 --> 0:02:27,000
when I was 14 years old.

42
0:02:27.558,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I used to, to try to avoid homework,

43
0:02:29.668,000 --> 0:02:34,000
sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents

44
0:02:34.844,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and their friends debate heatedly.

45
0:02:36.544,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You see, then Greece was

46
0:02:38.922,000 --> 0:02:42,000
under control of a very powerful establishment

47
0:02:43.159,000 --> 0:02:44,000
which was strangling the country,

48
0:02:44.906,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and my father was heading a promising movement

49
0:02:47.599,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece

50
0:02:50.419,000 --> 0:02:52,000
where freedom reigned and where, maybe,

51
0:02:52.862,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country.

52
0:02:56.573,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I used to join him in many of the campaigns,

53
0:02:58.869,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and you can see me here next to him.

54
0:03:00.808,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I'm the younger one there, to the side.

55
0:03:03.276,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You may not recognize me because

56
0:03:06.384,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I used to part my hair differently there.

57
0:03:08.612,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:10.489,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So in 1967, elections were coming,

59
0:03:14.636,000 --> 0:03:15,000
things were going well in the campaign,

60
0:03:16.48,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the house was electric.

61
0:03:18.491,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We really could sense that there was going to be

62
0:03:20.779,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a major progressive change in Greece.

63
0:03:24.776,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house.

64
0:03:29.728,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Soldiers storm the door.

65
0:03:32.106,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They find me up on the top terrace.

66
0:03:36.276,000 --> 0:03:37,000
A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun,

67
0:03:38.231,000 --> 0:03:39,000
puts it to my head, and says,

68
0:03:40.19,000 --> 0:03:44,000
"Tell me where your father is or I will kill you."

69
0:03:44.542,000 --> 0:03:48,000
My father, hiding nearby, reveals himself,

70
0:03:48.724,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and was summarily taken to prison.

71
0:03:52.889,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well, we survived, but democracy did not.

72
0:03:56.625,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Seven brutal years of dictatorship

73
0:03:59.137,000 --> 0:04:02,000
which we spent in exile.

74
0:04:02.929,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, today, our democracies are again

75
0:04:05.153,000 --> 0:04:07,000
facing a moment of truth.

76
0:04:07.432,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Let me tell you a story.

77
0:04:09.259,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Sunday evening,

78
0:04:11.543,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Brussels, April 2010.

79
0:04:14.662,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.

80
0:04:18.215,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I had just been elected prime minister,

81
0:04:21.698,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth

82
0:04:25.291,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that our deficit was not 6 percent,

83
0:04:28.712,000 --> 0:04:31,000
as had been officially reported only a few days earlier

84
0:04:32.258,000 --> 0:04:34,000
before the elections by the previous government,

85
0:04:35.227,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but actually 15.6 percent.

86
0:04:40.115,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But the deficit was only the symptom

87
0:04:42.547,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of much deeper problems that Greece was facing,

88
0:04:44.863,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,

89
0:04:48.794,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to tackle these problems,

90
0:04:50.039,000 --> 0:04:52,000
whether it was lack of transparency

91
0:04:52.773,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and accountability in governance,

92
0:04:55.074,000 --> 0:04:57,000
or whether it was a clientelistic state

93
0:04:57.74,000 --> 0:05:01,000
offering favors to the powerful -- tax avoidance

94
0:05:02.293,000 --> 0:05:06,000
abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,

95
0:05:07.02,000 --> 0:05:1,000
politics and media captured by special interests.

96
0:05:10.452,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But despite our electoral mandate,

97
0:05:13.452,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the markets mistrusted us.

98
0:05:16.667,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing,

99
0:05:19.433,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we were facing possible default.

100
0:05:22.34,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So I went to Brussels on a mission

101
0:05:25.62,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to make the case for a united European response,

102
0:05:29.634,000 --> 0:05:32,000
one that would calm the markets and give us the time

103
0:05:32.934,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to make the necessary reforms.

104
0:05:35.94,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But time we didn't get.

105
0:05:38.844,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels.

106
0:05:41.98,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Negotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,

107
0:05:44.871,000 --> 0:05:46,000
progress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,

108
0:05:47.748,000 --> 0:05:48,000
a prime minister shouts out,

109
0:05:49.32,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"We have to finish in 10 minutes."

110
0:05:51.84,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I said, "Why? These are important decisions.

111
0:05:54.473,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Let's deliberate a little bit longer."

112
0:05:56.628,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Another prime minister comes in and says,

113
0:05:59.711,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"No, we have to have an agreement now,

114
0:06:03.043,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because in 10 minutes,

115
0:06:05.395,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the markets are opening up in Japan,

116
0:06:08.96,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and there will be havoc in the global economy."

117
0:06:13.409,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.

118
0:06:16.822,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This time it was not the military,

119
0:06:19.098,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.

120
0:06:25.586,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,

121
0:06:29.769,000 --> 0:06:33,000
painful to me, painful to my countrymen,

122
0:06:33.996,000 --> 0:06:36,000
imposing cuts, austerity,

123
0:06:37.018,000 --> 0:06:4,000
often on those not to blame for the crisis.

124
0:06:40.244,000 --> 0:06:43,000
With these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy

125
0:06:43.371,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and the eurozone avoided a collapse.

126
0:06:46.523,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Greece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,

127
0:06:49.171,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and some people blame me for pulling the trigger.

128
0:06:52.289,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But I think today that most would agree

129
0:06:55.336,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that Greece was only a symptom

130
0:06:57.702,000 --> 0:07:,000
of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,

131
0:07:01.379,000 --> 0:07:05,000
vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,

132
0:07:05.571,000 --> 0:07:07,000
vulnerabilities of our democracies.

133
0:07:08.217,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,

134
0:07:12.554,000 --> 0:07:15,000
or, more accurately, too big to control.

135
0:07:15.923,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Our democracies are weakened in the global economy

136
0:07:18.252,000 --> 0:07:21,000
with players that can evade laws, evade taxes,

137
0:07:21.723,000 --> 0:07:24,000
evade environmental or labor standards.

138
0:07:25.044,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Our democracies are undermined

139
0:07:27.926,000 --> 0:07:29,000
by the growing inequality

140
0:07:30.084,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and the growing concentration of power and wealth,

141
0:07:33.864,000 --> 0:07:36,000
lobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets

142
0:07:37.518,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,

143
0:07:42.357,000 --> 0:07:44,000
have constrained our democracies,

144
0:07:45.077,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and they have constrained our capacity

145
0:07:47.965,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,

146
0:07:51.963,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in finding solutions.

147
0:07:54.478,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Greece, you see, was only a preview

148
0:07:56.933,000 --> 0:07:58,000
of what is in store for us all.

149
0:07:59.31,000 --> 0:08:,000
I, overly optimistically, had hoped

150
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,

151
0:08:04.791,000 --> 0:08:08,000
for the world, to make radical democratic transformations

152
0:08:09.266,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in our institutions.

153
0:08:11.143,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Instead, I had a very humbling experience.

154
0:08:15.04,000 --> 0:08:19,000
In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again

155
0:08:19.521,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to find common solutions,

156
0:08:21.43,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I realized that not one, not one of us,

157
0:08:25.103,000 --> 0:08:28,000
had ever dealt with a similar crisis.

158
0:08:28.574,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.

159
0:08:32.57,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We were led by our fears.

160
0:08:36.038,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And our fears led to a blind faith

161
0:08:40.591,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in the orthodoxy of austerity.

162
0:08:43.756,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Instead of reaching out to the common

163
0:08:47.559,000 --> 0:08:5,000
or the collective wisdom in our societies,

164
0:08:50.939,000 --> 0:08:53,000
investing in it to find more creative solutions,

165
0:08:54.251,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we reverted to political posturing.

166
0:08:56.811,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And then we were surprised when every

167
0:08:58.417,000 --> 0:09:01,000
ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis,

168
0:09:01.715,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and of course that made it very easy

169
0:09:04.644,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to look for a whipping boy

170
0:09:06.491,000 --> 0:09:07,000
for our collective European failure,

171
0:09:08.289,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and of course that was Greece.

172
0:09:11.643,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Those profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,

173
0:09:16.815,000 --> 0:09:19,000
they are the problem. Punish them!

174
0:09:19.88,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype

175
0:09:23.09,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself.

176
0:09:27.823,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.

177
0:09:31.135,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This could be the pattern

178
0:09:34.087,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that leaders follow again and again

179
0:09:36.593,000 --> 0:09:39,000
when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,

180
0:09:40.255,000 --> 0:09:43,000
whether it's climate change, whether it's migration,

181
0:09:43.975,000 --> 0:09:46,000
whether it's the financial system.

182
0:09:47.039,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That is, abandoning our collective power

183
0:09:49.625,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to imagine our potential,

184
0:09:51.504,000 --> 0:09:55,000
falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,

185
0:09:55.683,000 --> 0:09:57,000
taking our citizens out of the process

186
0:09:57.943,000 --> 0:10:01,000
rather than building the process around our citizens.

187
0:10:02.115,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And doing so will only test the faith

188
0:10:04.587,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of our citizens, of our peoples, even more

189
0:10:06.995,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in the democratic process.

190
0:10:09.557,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's no wonder that many political leaders,

191
0:10:11.255,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and I don't exclude myself,

192
0:10:13.773,000 --> 0:10:16,000
have lost the trust of our people.

193
0:10:16.851,000 --> 0:10:19,000
When riot police have to protect parliaments,

194
0:10:20.414,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a scene which is increasingly common around the world,

195
0:10:24.611,000 --> 0:10:28,000
then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies.

196
0:10:29.361,000 --> 0:10:32,000
That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people

197
0:10:33.266,000 --> 0:10:37,000
own and decide on the terms of the rescue package.

198
0:10:37.502,000 --> 0:10:38,000
My European counterparts, some of them, at least,

199
0:10:39.405,000 --> 0:10:4,000
said, "You can't do this.

200
0:10:41.39,000 --> 0:10:45,000
There will be havoc in the markets again."

201
0:10:45.938,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I said, "We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets,

202
0:10:50.194,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people."

203
0:10:55.782,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect.

204
0:10:58.55,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,

205
0:11:03.67,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but we remain challenged.

206
0:11:06.243,000 --> 0:11:09,000
If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,

207
0:11:09.702,000 --> 0:11:13,000
well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,

208
0:11:13.846,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination

209
0:11:16.816,000 --> 0:11:18,000
if not a lack of compassion.

210
0:11:19.282,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So far, we've thrown economics at the problem,

211
0:11:21.823,000 --> 0:11:23,000
actually mostly austerity,

212
0:11:24.134,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and certainly we could have designed alternatives,

213
0:11:27.364,000 --> 0:11:3,000
a different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,

214
0:11:30.686,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would

215
0:11:34.138,000 --> 0:11:37,000
support countries in need from market pressures,

216
0:11:37.262,000 --> 0:11:39,000
these would have been much more viable alternatives.

217
0:11:40.134,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much

218
0:11:42.8,000 --> 0:11:45,000
one of economics as it is one of democracy.

219
0:11:46.759,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So let's try something else.

220
0:11:48.347,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Let's see how we can bring people back to the process.

221
0:11:51.243,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Let's throw democracy at the problem.

222
0:11:54.346,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Again, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,

223
0:11:57.331,000 --> 0:12:,000
believed in the wisdom of the crowd

224
0:12:00.375,000 --> 0:12:02,000
at their best moments. In people we trust.

225
0:12:03.266,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Democracy could not work without the citizens

226
0:12:06.609,000 --> 0:12:1,000
deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities

227
0:12:10.982,000 --> 0:12:11,000
for public affairs.

228
0:12:12.916,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries

229
0:12:15.65,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to decide on critical matters of the day.

230
0:12:19.877,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Science, theater, research, philosophy,

231
0:12:22.954,000 --> 0:12:24,000
games of the mind and the body,

232
0:12:25.037,000 --> 0:12:26,000
they were daily exercises.

233
0:12:26.765,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Actually they were an education for participation,

234
0:12:30.917,000 --> 0:12:33,000
for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens.

235
0:12:34.457,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.

236
0:12:38.993,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,

237
0:12:42.237,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that term originated there.

238
0:12:44.508,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"Idiot" comes from the root "idio," oneself.

239
0:12:49.301,000 --> 0:12:52,000
A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,

240
0:12:52.544,000 --> 0:12:56,000
someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs.

241
0:12:57.259,000 --> 0:13:,000
And participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,

242
0:13:00.991,000 --> 0:13:06,000
both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.

243
0:13:07.368,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You see, markets and politics then were one, unified,

244
0:13:11.424,000 --> 0:13:14,000
accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.

245
0:13:14.63,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They serve the demos, democracy.

246
0:13:19.593,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Above government, above markets

247
0:13:22.217,000 --> 0:13:24,000
was the direct rule of the people.

248
0:13:24.746,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Today we have globalized the markets

249
0:13:27.73,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but we have not globalized our democratic institutions.

250
0:13:32.193,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So our politicians are limited to local politics,

251
0:13:36.626,000 --> 0:13:39,000
while our citizens, even though they see a great potential,

252
0:13:40.386,000 --> 0:13:44,000
are prey to forces beyond their control.

253
0:13:44.866,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora?

254
0:13:47.697,000 --> 0:13:49,000
How do we democratize globalization?

255
0:13:49.937,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms

256
0:13:52.506,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of the United Nations or the G20.

257
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I'm talking about, how do we secure the space,

258
0:13:57.641,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the demos, the platform of values,

259
0:14:00.142,000 --> 0:14:05,000
so that we can tap into all of your potential?

260
0:14:05.702,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.

261
0:14:09.577,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Europe, despite its recent failures,

262
0:14:11.977,000 --> 0:14:15,000
is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment.

263
0:14:16.545,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So let's see if it can't be an experiment

264
0:14:19.792,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in global democracy, a new kind of democracy.

265
0:14:23.972,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Let's see if we can't design a European agora,

266
0:14:27.082,000 --> 0:14:29,000
not simply for products and services,

267
0:14:29.614,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but for our citizens, where they can work together,

268
0:14:32.857,000 --> 0:14:33,000
deliberate, learn from each other,

269
0:14:34.62,000 --> 0:14:37,000
exchange between art and cultures,

270
0:14:37.836,000 --> 0:14:4,000
where they can come up with creative solutions.

271
0:14:41.535,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Let's imagine that European citizens

272
0:14:44.705,000 --> 0:14:46,000
actually have the power to vote directly

273
0:14:46.999,000 --> 0:14:49,000
for a European president,

274
0:14:49.999,000 --> 0:14:52,000
or citizen juries chosen by lottery

275
0:14:53.483,000 --> 0:14:57,000
which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,

276
0:14:57.709,000 --> 0:15:,000
a European-wide referendum where our citizens,

277
0:15:00.877,000 --> 0:15:04,000
as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.

278
0:15:05.279,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And here's an idea:

279
0:15:07.759,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Why not have the first truly European citizens

280
0:15:10.683,000 --> 0:15:12,000
by giving our immigrants,

281
0:15:12.703,000 --> 0:15:16,000
not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,

282
0:15:16.815,000 --> 0:15:19,000
but a European citizenship?

283
0:15:20.438,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And make sure we actually empower

284
0:15:23.325,000 --> 0:15:25,000
the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship

285
0:15:26.104,000 --> 0:15:29,000
where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.

286
0:15:29.573,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Where our common identity is democracy,

287
0:15:34.054,000 --> 0:15:38,000
where our education is through participation,

288
0:15:39.018,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and where participation builds trust

289
0:15:42.491,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.

290
0:15:46.462,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Europe of and by the people,

291
0:15:48.124,000 --> 0:15:52,000
a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening

292
0:15:52.222,000 --> 0:15:55,000
democracy beyond borders.

293
0:15:55.238,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Now, some might accuse me of being naive,

294
0:15:59.076,000 --> 0:16:03,000
putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people.

295
0:16:03.947,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Well, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist.

296
0:16:08.716,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Believe me, I have been,

297
0:16:11.272,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I am, part of today's political system,

298
0:16:14.932,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and I know things must change.

299
0:16:19.569,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We must revive politics as the power to imagine,

300
0:16:23.857,000 --> 0:16:28,000
reimagine, and redesign for a better world.

301
0:16:29.08,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But I also know that this disruptive force of change

302
0:16:31.894,000 --> 0:16:34,000
won't be driven by the politics of today.

303
0:16:34.958,000 --> 0:16:36,000
The revival of democratic politics

304
0:16:37.254,000 --> 0:16:41,000
will come from you, and I mean all of you.

305
0:16:41.674,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas,

306
0:16:45.66,000 --> 0:16:46,000
whether it's here in this room

307
0:16:46.709,000 --> 0:16:48,000
or just outside this room

308
0:16:48.922,000 --> 0:16:51,000
or online or locally, where everybody lives,

309
0:16:52.756,000 --> 0:16:55,000
everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality,

310
0:16:56.076,000 --> 0:16:58,000
everybody who stands up to those who preach

311
0:16:58.796,000 --> 0:17:,000
racism rather than empathy,

312
0:17:01.06,000 --> 0:17:03,000
dogma rather than critical thinking,

313
0:17:03.876,000 --> 0:17:05,000
technocracy rather than democracy,

314
0:17:06.192,000 --> 0:17:08,000
everyone who stands up to the unchecked power,

315
0:17:09.167,000 --> 0:17:11,000
whether it's authoritarian leaders,

316
0:17:11.288,000 --> 0:17:14,000
plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens,

317
0:17:14.724,000 --> 0:17:17,000
or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few.

318
0:17:18.644,000 --> 0:17:23,000
It is in their interest that all of us are idiots.

319
0:17:24.077,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Let's not be.

320
0:17:25.563,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

321
0:17:26.803,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

322
0:17:38.713,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Bruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership

323
0:17:40.626,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that is kind of unprepared

324
0:17:42.811,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets,

325
0:17:45.593,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me,

326
0:17:47.953,000 --> 0:17:49,000
as a citizen, is terrifying.

327
0:17:50.456,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Help us understand how you felt after the decision.

328
0:17:54.755,000 --> 0:17:55,000
It was not a good decision, clearly,

329
0:17:56.323,000 --> 0:17:58,000
but how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister,

330
0:17:58.907,000 --> 0:18:,000
but as George?

331
0:18:01.096,000 --> 0:18:03,000
George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints

332
0:18:03.638,000 --> 0:18:06,000
which didn't allow me or others to make

333
0:18:07.564,000 --> 0:18:08,000
the types of decisions we would have wanted,

334
0:18:09.004,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time

335
0:18:11.769,000 --> 0:18:12,000
to make the reforms which would have dealt

336
0:18:13.476,000 --> 0:18:15,000
with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit

337
0:18:15.969,000 --> 0:18:16,000
which was the symptom of the problem.

338
0:18:17.684,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all,

339
0:18:19.883,000 --> 0:18:22,000
hurt the younger generation, and not only,

340
0:18:23.387,000 --> 0:18:24,000
many of them are demonstrating outside,

341
0:18:25.324,000 --> 0:18:26,000
but I think this is one of our problems.

342
0:18:26.948,000 --> 0:18:31,000
When we face these crises, we have kept the potential,

343
0:18:32.18,000 --> 0:18:35,000
the huge potential of our society out of this process,

344
0:18:35.315,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and we are closing in on ourselves in politics,

345
0:18:38.139,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and I think we need to change that, to really find

346
0:18:40.885,000 --> 0:18:44,000
new participatory ways using the great capabilities

347
0:18:45.058,000 --> 0:18:48,000
that now exist even in technology but not only in technology,

348
0:18:48.208,000 --> 0:18:51,000
the minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions

349
0:18:51.349,000 --> 0:18:52,000
which are much better, but we have to be open.

350
0:18:53.156,000 --> 0:18:54,000
BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward

351
0:18:54.816,000 --> 0:18:57,000
is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse

352
0:18:58.427,000 --> 0:18:59,000
right now in most European countries.

353
0:19:00.15,000 --> 0:19:03,000
It's rather the other way -- more closed borders

354
0:19:03.877,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out

355
0:19:06.307,000 --> 0:19:09,000
of some of the different parts of the European construction.

356
0:19:10.012,000 --> 0:19:11,000
How do you reconcile that?

357
0:19:11.951,000 --> 0:19:13,000
GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened

358
0:19:14.38,000 --> 0:19:16,000
during this crisis is that we started a blame game.

359
0:19:16.612,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And the fundamental idea of Europe is that

360
0:19:20.17,000 --> 0:19:22,000
we can cooperate beyond borders,

361
0:19:22.276,000 --> 0:19:24,000
go beyond our conflicts and work together.

362
0:19:24.577,000 --> 0:19:29,000
And the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,

363
0:19:30.546,000 --> 0:19:33,000
we have less the potential to convince our citizens

364
0:19:33.726,000 --> 0:19:34,000
that we should work together,

365
0:19:35.437,000 --> 0:19:37,000
while now is the time when we really need

366
0:19:37.51,000 --> 0:19:38,000
to bring our powers together.

367
0:19:39.278,000 --> 0:19:41,000
Now, more Europe for me is not simply

368
0:19:42.232,000 --> 0:19:43,000
giving more power to Brussels.

369
0:19:43.687,000 --> 0:19:46,000
It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,

370
0:19:47.56,000 --> 0:19:5,000
that is, really making Europe a project of the people.

371
0:19:51.408,000 --> 0:19:53,000
So that, I think, would be a way to answer

372
0:19:53.976,000 --> 0:19:55,000
some of the fears that we have in our society.

373
0:19:56.849,000 --> 0:19:57,000
BG: George, thank you for coming to TED.

374
0:19:58.372,000 --> 0:20:01,000
GP: Thank you very much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)

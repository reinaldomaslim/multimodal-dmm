1
0:00:13.07,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"All I wanted was a much-deserved promotion,

2
0:00:16.752,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and he told me to 'Get up on the desk

3
0:00:18.585,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and spread 'em.'"

4
0:00:21.904,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"All the men in my office wrote down on a piece of paper

5
0:00:24.675,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the sexual favors that I could do for them.

6
0:00:27.583,000 --> 0:00:29,000
All I had asked for was an office with a window."

7
0:00:32.19,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"I asked for his advice about how I could get a bill out of committee;

8
0:00:36.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
he asked me if I brought my kneepads."

9
0:00:41.753,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Those are just a few of the horrific stories

10
0:00:44.015,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that I heard from women over the last year,

11
0:00:46.547,000 --> 0:00:49,000
as I've been investigating workplace sexual harassment.

12
0:00:50.236,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And what I found out

13
0:00:52.409,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is that it's an epidemic across the world.

14
0:00:56.307,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's a horrifying reality for millions of women,

15
0:00:59.646,000 --> 0:01:01,000
when all they want to do every day

16
0:01:01.784,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is go to work.

17
0:01:04.998,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Sexual harassment doesn't discriminate.

18
0:01:07.886,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You can wear a skirt,

19
0:01:09.799,000 --> 0:01:1,000
hospital scrubs,

20
0:01:11.395,000 --> 0:01:12,000
army fatigues.

21
0:01:13.456,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You can be young or old,

22
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:16,000
married or single,

23
0:01:16.239,000 --> 0:01:17,000
black or white.

24
0:01:17.453,000 --> 0:01:2,000
You can be a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent.

25
0:01:22.577,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I heard from so many women:

26
0:01:26.047,000 --> 0:01:27,000
police officers,

27
0:01:27.427,000 --> 0:01:28,000
members of our military,

28
0:01:28.958,000 --> 0:01:29,000
financial assistants,

29
0:01:30.439,000 --> 0:01:33,000
actors, engineers, lawyers,

30
0:01:33.676,000 --> 0:01:36,000
bankers, accountants, teachers ...

31
0:01:37.485,000 --> 0:01:38,000
journalists.

32
0:01:41.521,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Sexual harassment, it turns out,

33
0:01:43.746,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is not about sex.

34
0:01:46.609,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's about power,

35
0:01:48.969,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and about what somebody does to you

36
0:01:51.564,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to try and take away your power.

37
0:01:54.862,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I'm here today

38
0:01:57.285,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to encourage you to know that you can take that power back.

39
0:02:03.21,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Applause)

40
0:02:07.675,000 --> 0:02:09,000
On July 6, 2016,

41
0:02:11.004,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I jumped off a cliff all by myself.

42
0:02:14.685,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It was the scariest moment of my life;

43
0:02:16.969,000 --> 0:02:18,000
an excruciating choice to make.

44
0:02:21.015,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I fell into an abyss all alone,

45
0:02:24.688,000 --> 0:02:26,000
not knowing what would be below.

46
0:02:28.373,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But then, something miraculous started to happen.

47
0:02:31.822,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Thousands of women started reaching out to me

48
0:02:34.046,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame.

49
0:02:38.132,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They told me that I became their voice --

50
0:02:40.411,000 --> 0:02:41,000
they were voiceless.

51
0:02:44.293,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And suddenly, I realized that even in the 21st century,

52
0:02:47.607,000 --> 0:02:49,000
every woman still has a story.

53
0:02:52.796,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Like Joyce,

54
0:02:55.125,000 --> 0:02:56,000
a flight attendant supervisor

55
0:02:56.671,000 --> 0:02:57,000
whose boss, in meetings every day,

56
0:02:58.602,000 --> 0:03:01,000
would tell her about the porn that he'd watched the night before

57
0:03:01.763,000 --> 0:03:02,000
while drawing penises on his notepad.

58
0:03:03.664,000 --> 0:03:04,000
She went to complain.

59
0:03:04.864,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She was called "crazy" and fired.

60
0:03:07.219,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Like Joanne, Wall Street banker.

61
0:03:09.659,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Her male colleagues would call her that vile c-word every day.

62
0:03:13.258,000 --> 0:03:14,000
She complained --

63
0:03:14.443,000 --> 0:03:15,000
labeled a troublemaker,

64
0:03:15.808,000 --> 0:03:17,000
never to do another Wall Street deal again.

65
0:03:19.438,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Like Elizabeth, an army officer.

66
0:03:22.831,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Her male subordinates would wave one-dollar bills in her face,

67
0:03:26.335,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and say, "Dance for me!"

68
0:03:28.456,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And when she went to complain to a major,

69
0:03:30.439,000 --> 0:03:32,000
he said, "What? Only one dollar?

70
0:03:33.007,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You're worth at least five or ten!"

71
0:03:38.392,000 --> 0:03:39,000
After reading,

72
0:03:39.989,000 --> 0:03:4,000
replying to all

73
0:03:42.277,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and crying over all of these emails,

74
0:03:46.802,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I realized I had so much work to do.

75
0:03:52.385,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Here are the startling facts:

76
0:03:54.077,000 --> 0:03:56,000
one in three women -- that we know of --

77
0:03:56.926,000 --> 0:03:58,000
have been sexually harassed in the workplace.

78
0:04:00.636,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Seventy-one percent of those incidences never get reported.

79
0:04:06.874,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Why?

80
0:04:08.738,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because when women come forward,

81
0:04:10.459,000 --> 0:04:12,000
they're still called liars and troublemakers

82
0:04:12.614,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and demeaned and trashed

83
0:04:14.594,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and demoted and blacklisted

84
0:04:16.395,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and fired.

85
0:04:17.79,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Reporting sexual harassment can be, in many cases, career-ending.

86
0:04:23.136,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Of all the women that reached out to me,

87
0:04:26.001,000 --> 0:04:3,000
almost none are still today working in their chosen profession,

88
0:04:30.898,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and that is outrageous.

89
0:04:36.036,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I, too, was silent in the beginning.

90
0:04:40.256,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It happened to me at the end of my year as Miss America,

91
0:04:44.391,000 --> 0:04:46,000
when I was meeting with a very high-ranking TV executive

92
0:04:47.077,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in New York City.

93
0:04:48.265,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I thought he was helping me throughout the day,

94
0:04:50.517,000 --> 0:04:51,000
making a lot of phone calls.

95
0:04:51.876,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We went to dinner,

96
0:04:53.062,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and in the back seat of a car, he suddenly lunged on top of me

97
0:04:56.009,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and stuck his tongue down my throat.

98
0:04:59.928,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I didn't realize that to "get into the business" -- silly me --

99
0:05:05.608,000 --> 0:05:07,000
he also intended to get into my pants.

100
0:05:10.685,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And just a week later,

101
0:05:11.954,000 --> 0:05:15,000
when I was in Los Angeles meeting with a high-ranking publicist,

102
0:05:16.556,000 --> 0:05:17,000
it happened again.

103
0:05:18.099,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Again, in a car.

104
0:05:19.439,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And he took my neck in his hand,

105
0:05:22.434,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and he shoved my head so hard into his crotch,

106
0:05:25.52,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I couldn't breathe.

107
0:05:33.137,000 --> 0:05:38,000
These are the events that suck the life out of all of your self-confidence.

108
0:05:41.709,000 --> 0:05:45,000
These are the events that, until recently,

109
0:05:45.89,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I didn't even call assault.

110
0:05:51.455,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And this is why we have so much work to do.

111
0:05:59.431,000 --> 0:06:,000
After my year as Miss America,

112
0:06:01.424,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I continued to meet a lot of well-known people,

113
0:06:04.899,000 --> 0:06:05,000
including Donald Trump.

114
0:06:08.05,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When this picture was taken in 1988,

115
0:06:10.372,000 --> 0:06:12,000
nobody could have ever predicted where we'd be today.

116
0:06:12.96,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:15.239,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Me, fighting to end sexual harassment in the workplace;

118
0:06:19.357,000 --> 0:06:21,000
he, president of the United States

119
0:06:21.817,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in spite of it.

120
0:06:26.266,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And shortly thereafter, I got my first gig in television news

121
0:06:29.321,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in Richmond, Virginia.

122
0:06:30.498,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Check out that confident smile with the bright pink jacket.

123
0:06:33.303,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Not so much the hair.

124
0:06:34.554,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:36.458,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I was working so hard to prove that blondes have a lot of brains.

126
0:06:43.027,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But ironically, one of the first stories I covered

127
0:06:45.684,000 --> 0:06:47,000
was the Anita Hill hearings in Washington, DC.

128
0:06:48.663,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And shortly thereafter,

129
0:06:50.251,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I, too, was sexually harassed in the workplace.

130
0:06:54.043,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I was covering a story in rural Virginia,

131
0:06:56.512,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and when we got back into the car,

132
0:06:58.206,000 --> 0:06:59,000
my cameraman started saying to me,

133
0:07:00.109,000 --> 0:07:02,000
wondering how much I had enjoyed when he touched my breasts

134
0:07:03.004,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when he put the microphone on me.

135
0:07:04.601,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And it went downhill from there.

136
0:07:06.947,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I was bracing myself against the passenger door --

137
0:07:09.315,000 --> 0:07:1,000
this was before cellphones.

138
0:07:10.872,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I was petrified.

139
0:07:12.142,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I actually envisioned myself rolling outside of that door

140
0:07:16.228,000 --> 0:07:19,000
as the car was going 50 miles per hour like I'd seen in the movies,

141
0:07:19.481,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and wondering how much it would hurt.

142
0:07:25.88,000 --> 0:07:27,000
When the story about Harvey Weinstein came to light --

143
0:07:28.886,000 --> 0:07:31,000
one the most well-known movie moguls in all of Hollywood --

144
0:07:32.329,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the allegations were horrific.

145
0:07:34.882,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But so many women came forward,

146
0:07:36.873,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and it made me realize what I had done meant something.

147
0:07:41.381,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Applause)

148
0:07:48.245,000 --> 0:07:5,000
He had such a lame excuse.

149
0:07:50.813,000 --> 0:07:52,000
He said he was a product of the '60s and '70s,

150
0:07:53.218,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and that that was the culture then.

151
0:07:54.998,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Yeah, that was the culture then,

152
0:07:56.901,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and unfortunately, it still is.

153
0:07:59.822,000 --> 0:08:,000
Why?

154
0:08:01.779,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Because of all the myths

155
0:08:03.174,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that are still associated with sexual harassment.

156
0:08:07.004,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"Women should just take another job and find another career."

157
0:08:10.263,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Yeah, right.

158
0:08:11.441,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Tell that to the single mom working two jobs,

159
0:08:13.632,000 --> 0:08:14,000
trying to make ends meet,

160
0:08:15.075,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who's also being sexually harassed.

161
0:08:18.082,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Women --

162
0:08:19.651,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they bring it on themselves."

163
0:08:22.005,000 --> 0:08:23,000
By the clothes that we wear

164
0:08:23.595,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the makeup that we put on.

165
0:08:25.876,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Yeah, I guess those hoodies that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley

166
0:08:29.455,000 --> 0:08:3,000
are just so provocative.

167
0:08:32.639,000 --> 0:08:33,000
"Women make it up."

168
0:08:34.619,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Yeah, because it's so fun and rewarding

169
0:08:37.573,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to be demeaned and taken down.

170
0:08:40.182,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I would know.

171
0:08:43.324,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"Women bring these claims because they want to be famous and rich."

172
0:08:48.456,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Our own president said that.

173
0:08:52.465,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I bet Taylor Swift,

174
0:08:54.31,000 --> 0:08:57,000
one of the most well-known and richest singers in the world,

175
0:08:58.66,000 --> 0:08:59,000
didn't need more money or fame

176
0:09:00.352,000 --> 0:09:02,000
when she came forward with her groping case

177
0:09:02.581,000 --> 0:09:03,000
for one dollar.

178
0:09:04.688,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And I'm so glad she did.

179
0:09:09.018,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Breaking news:

180
0:09:10.75,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the untold story about women and sexual harassment in the workplace:

181
0:09:16.667,000 --> 0:09:18,000
women just want a safe, welcoming

182
0:09:19.522,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and harass-free environment.

183
0:09:22.056,000 --> 0:09:23,000
That's it.

184
0:09:24.18,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

185
0:09:30.405,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So how do we go about getting our power back?

186
0:09:33.5,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I have three solutions.

187
0:09:35.667,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Number one:

188
0:09:37.219,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we need to turn bystanders and enablers into allies.

189
0:09:41.88,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Ninety-eight percent of United States corporations right now

190
0:09:44.942,000 --> 0:09:46,000
have sexual harassment training policies.

191
0:09:47.089,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Seventy percent have prevention programs.

192
0:09:50.9,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But still, overwhelmingly,

193
0:09:53.103,000 --> 0:09:56,000
bystanders and witnesses don't come forward.

194
0:09:57.225,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In 2016,

195
0:09:58.401,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the Harvard Business Review called it the "bystander effect."

196
0:10:03.76,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And yet -- remember 9/11.

197
0:10:07.227,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Millions of times we've heard,

198
0:10:09.804,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"If you see something,

199
0:10:11.232,000 --> 0:10:12,000
say something."

200
0:10:13.845,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Imagine how impactful that would be if we carried that through

201
0:10:17.715,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to bystanders in the workplace regarding sexual harassment --

202
0:10:21.933,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to recognize and interrupt these incidences;

203
0:10:26.397,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to confront the perpetrators to their face;

204
0:10:30.7,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to help and protect the victims.

205
0:10:34.279,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This is my shout-out to men:

206
0:10:36.715,000 --> 0:10:38,000
we need you in this fight.

207
0:10:39.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And to women, too --

208
0:10:41.209,000 --> 0:10:43,000
enablers to allies.

209
0:10:44.499,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Number two:

210
0:10:45.879,000 --> 0:10:46,000
change the laws.

211
0:10:49.029,000 --> 0:10:5,000
How many of you out there know

212
0:10:50.491,000 --> 0:10:52,000
whether or not you have a forced arbitration clause

213
0:10:52.934,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in your employment contract?

214
0:10:56.095,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Not a lot of hands.

215
0:10:57.269,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And if you don't know, you should,

216
0:10:59.021,000 --> 0:11:,000
and here's why.

217
0:11:01.096,000 --> 0:11:02,000
TIME Magazine calls it,

218
0:11:02.376,000 --> 0:11:03,000
right there on the screen,

219
0:11:04.039,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"The teeny tiny little print in contracts

220
0:11:07.418,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that keeps sexual harassment claims unheard."

221
0:11:11.646,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here's what it is.

222
0:11:13.039,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Forced arbitration takes away your Seventh Amendment right

223
0:11:15.857,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to an open jury process.

224
0:11:17.85,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's secret.

225
0:11:20.105,000 --> 0:11:22,000
You don't get the same witnesses or depositions.

226
0:11:22.424,000 --> 0:11:24,000
In many cases, the company picks the arbitrator for you.

227
0:11:25.855,000 --> 0:11:27,000
There are no appeals,

228
0:11:28.355,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and only 20 percent of the time does the employee win.

229
0:11:31.927,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But again, it's secret,

230
0:11:33.583,000 --> 0:11:35,000
so nobody ever knows what happened to you.

231
0:11:37.732,000 --> 0:11:39,000
This is why I've been working so diligently

232
0:11:39.772,000 --> 0:11:4,000
on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC

233
0:11:41.428,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to change the laws.

234
0:11:42.604,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And here's what I tell the Senators:

235
0:11:44.444,000 --> 0:11:45,000
sexual harassment is apolitical.

236
0:11:46.464,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Before somebody harasses you,

237
0:11:48.067,000 --> 0:11:51,000
they don't ask you if you're a Republican or Democrat first.

238
0:11:51.825,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They just do it.

239
0:11:53.143,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And this is why we should all care.

240
0:11:56.385,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Number three:

241
0:11:57.94,000 --> 0:11:58,000
be fierce.

242
0:11:59.666,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It starts when we stand tall,

243
0:12:02.293,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we build that self-confidence.

244
0:12:04.279,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And we stand up and we speak up,

245
0:12:06.101,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and we tell the world what happened to us.

246
0:12:09.932,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I know it's scary,

247
0:12:11.957,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but let's do it for our kids.

248
0:12:14.102,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Let's stop this for the next generations.

249
0:12:18.777,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I know that I did it for my children.

250
0:12:22.835,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They were paramount in my decision-making

251
0:12:25.069,000 --> 0:12:27,000
about whether or not I would come forward.

252
0:12:27.623,000 --> 0:12:28,000
My beautiful children,

253
0:12:28.941,000 --> 0:12:29,000
my 12-year-old son, Christian,

254
0:12:30.728,000 --> 0:12:32,000
my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia.

255
0:12:32.918,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And boy, did I underestimate them.

256
0:12:36.164,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The first day of school last year

257
0:12:37.764,000 --> 0:12:39,000
happened to be the day my resolution was announced,

258
0:12:40.201,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and I was so anxious about what they would face.

259
0:12:42.486,000 --> 0:12:44,000
My daughter came home from school and she said,

260
0:12:44.723,000 --> 0:12:47,000
"Mommy, so many people asked me what happened to you over the summer."

261
0:12:48.125,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Then she looked at me in the eyes

262
0:12:49.77,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and she said, "And mommy,

263
0:12:51.291,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I was so proud

264
0:12:53.794,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to say that you were my mom."

265
0:12:58.749,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And two weeks later,

266
0:13:00.033,000 --> 0:13:03,000
when she finally found the courage to stand up to two kids

267
0:13:04.011,000 --> 0:13:06,000
who had been making her life miserable,

268
0:13:06.083,000 --> 0:13:07,000
she came home to me and she said,

269
0:13:07.722,000 --> 0:13:1,000
"Mommy, I found the courage to do it

270
0:13:11.917,000 --> 0:13:13,000
because I saw you do it."

271
0:13:16.51,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Applause)

272
0:13:24.487,000 --> 0:13:27,000
You see, giving the gift of courage is contagious.

273
0:13:30.394,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And I hope that my journey has inspired you,

274
0:13:33.757,000 --> 0:13:35,000
because right now, it's the tipping point.

275
0:13:36.922,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We are watching history happen.

276
0:13:39.258,000 --> 0:13:41,000
More and more women are coming forward and saying,

277
0:13:41.686,000 --> 0:13:42,000
"Enough is enough."

278
0:13:46.036,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Applause)

279
0:13:51.412,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Here's my one last plea to companies.

280
0:13:54.558,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Let's hire back all those women whose careers were lost

281
0:13:59.027,000 --> 0:14:01,000
because of some random jerk.

282
0:14:02.117,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Because here's what I know about women:

283
0:14:05.116,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we will not longer be underestimated, intimidated or set back;

284
0:14:09.881,000 --> 0:14:12,000
we will not be silenced by the ways of the establishment

285
0:14:13.257,000 --> 0:14:14,000
or the relics of the past.

286
0:14:15.209,000 --> 0:14:16,000
No.

287
0:14:16.819,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We will stand up and speak up

288
0:14:20.214,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and have our voices heard.

289
0:14:22.778,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We will be the women we were meant to be.

290
0:14:27.957,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And above all,

291
0:14:29.938,000 --> 0:14:32,000
we will always be fierce.

292
0:14:34.196,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Thank you.

293
0:14:35.701,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Applause)

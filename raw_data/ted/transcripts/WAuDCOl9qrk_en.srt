2
0:00:15.508,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.

3
0:00:17.911,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I understand we have over 80 countries here,

4
0:00:21.112,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak

5
0:00:23.326,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to all of these countries.

6
0:00:24.705,000 --> 0:00:25,000
In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called

7
0:00:26.69,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the parent-teacher conference.

8
0:00:28.811,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?

9
0:00:30.925,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Not the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child,

10
0:00:33.325,000 --> 0:00:35,000
where your parents come to school and your teacher

11
0:00:36.143,000 --> 0:00:38,000
talks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.

12
0:00:38.641,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment

13
0:00:41.982,000 --> 0:00:43,000
where my father, who never takes off from work,

14
0:00:44.838,000 --> 0:00:47,000
he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person,

15
0:00:48.768,000 --> 0:00:51,000
going to school to see his son, how he's doing,

16
0:00:51.928,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the teacher said to him, he said, "You know,

17
0:00:54.435,000 --> 0:00:56,000
John is good at math and art."

18
0:00:56.71,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And he kind of nodded, you know?

19
0:00:58.772,000 --> 0:01:,000
The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our

20
0:01:01.142,000 --> 0:01:04,000
tofu store, and he said, "You know, John's good at math."

21
0:01:04.937,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:08.228,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And that always stuck with me all my life.

23
0:01:10.659,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?

24
0:01:13.516,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Why? It became a question my entire life, and

25
0:01:16.922,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that's all right, because being good at math meant

26
0:01:19.839,000 --> 0:01:22,000
he bought me a computer, and some of you remember

27
0:01:23.371,000 --> 0:01:24,000
this computer, this was my first computer.

28
0:01:25.22,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Who had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool. (Applause)

29
0:01:29.073,000 --> 0:01:32,000
As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all. (Laughter)

30
0:01:32.327,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.

31
0:01:34.588,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It would say you're wrong most of the time.

32
0:01:36.145,000 --> 0:01:37,000
That was the computer we knew.

33
0:01:37.979,000 --> 0:01:39,000
That computer is a computer that I learned about

34
0:01:40.62,000 --> 0:01:44,000
going to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however,

35
0:01:45.197,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I learned about the computer at all levels,

36
0:01:48.443,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and after, I went to art school to get away from computers,

37
0:01:52.123,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I began to think about the computer as more of

38
0:01:54.361,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a spiritual space of thinking.

39
0:01:56.542,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And I was influenced by performance art --

40
0:01:59.396,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people.

41
0:02:03.631,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.

42
0:02:06.669,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc.,

43
0:02:10.348,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.

44
0:02:14.135,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's a room broken in two halves.

45
0:02:16.1,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I've turned the computer on,

46
0:02:18.2,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk

47
0:02:21.753,000 --> 0:02:23,000
built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.

48
0:02:24.599,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And the floppy disk drive person wears it. (Laughter)

49
0:02:28.908,000 --> 0:02:3,000
She finds the first sector on the disk, and

50
0:02:31.425,000 --> 0:02:36,000
takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.

51
0:02:36.756,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer

52
0:02:40.312,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc.,

53
0:02:43.756,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really. (Laughter)

54
0:02:48.537,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver,

55
0:02:51.014,000 --> 0:02:52,000
where it's XY. (Laughter)

56
0:02:53.013,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually

57
0:02:54.722,000 --> 0:02:57,000
a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow

58
0:02:57.918,000 --> 0:03:01,000
this computer was compared to how fast a computer is,

59
0:03:02.041,000 --> 0:03:06,000
it made me wonder about computers and technology in general.

60
0:03:06.678,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.

61
0:03:08.803,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The first three things are about how I've been curious

62
0:03:12.495,000 --> 0:03:15,000
about technology, design and art, and how they intersect,

63
0:03:16.029,000 --> 0:03:18,000
how they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on

64
0:03:18.986,000 --> 0:03:2,000
since four years ago I became the President

65
0:03:21.247,000 --> 0:03:24,000
of Rhode Island School of Design: leadership.

66
0:03:24.82,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine

67
0:03:27.537,000 --> 0:03:31,000
these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment.

68
0:03:32.172,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So starting from technology,

69
0:03:34.807,000 --> 0:03:36,000
technology is a wonderful thing.

70
0:03:37.142,000 --> 0:03:4,000
When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.

71
0:03:40.666,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It could show text and

72
0:03:43.136,000 --> 0:03:46,000
after we waited a bit, we had these things called images.

73
0:03:46.734,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Remember when images were first possible with a computer,

74
0:03:49.216,000 --> 0:03:51,000
those gorgeous, full-color images?

75
0:03:51.612,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.

76
0:03:54.83,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer.

77
0:03:57.182,000 --> 0:04:,000
And then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing.

78
0:04:01.119,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Remember that excitement?

79
0:04:03.262,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And then the browser appeared. The browser was great,

80
0:04:06.959,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but the browser was very primitive, very narrow bandwidth.

81
0:04:09.816,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Text first, then images, we waited,

82
0:04:13.073,000 --> 0:04:14,000
CD-quality sound over the Net,

83
0:04:14.869,000 --> 0:04:18,000
then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible.

84
0:04:19.513,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And then the mobile phone occurred,

85
0:04:22.383,000 --> 0:04:27,000
text, images, audio, video. And now we have iPhone,

86
0:04:27.918,000 --> 0:04:31,000
iPad, Android, with text, video, audio, etc.

87
0:04:32.042,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You see this little pattern here?

88
0:04:34.069,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense

89
0:04:37.402,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of possibility from computing is something I've been

90
0:04:40.008,000 --> 0:04:42,000
questioning for the last 10 or so years,

91
0:04:42.825,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and have looked to design, as we understand most things,

92
0:04:47.039,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.

93
0:04:50.927,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson.

94
0:04:55.683,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Designers talk about the relationship between form

95
0:04:58.181,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and content, content and form. Now what does that mean?

96
0:05:01.522,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Well, content is the word up there: fear.

97
0:05:04.089,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's a four-letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word, fear.

98
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Fear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful,

99
0:05:13.817,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica,

100
0:05:16.518,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it's like, "Oh, fear, who cares?" Right? (Laughter)

101
0:05:20.456,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big,

102
0:05:23.054,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and like, whoa, that hurts. Fear.

103
0:05:25.596,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So you can see how you change the scale, you change

104
0:05:27.511,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the form. Content is the same, but you feel differently.

105
0:05:31.819,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You change the typeface to, like, this typeface,

106
0:05:33.886,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface,

107
0:05:36.669,000 --> 0:05:38,000
like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr! Fear!

108
0:05:39.593,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Like, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny.

109
0:05:42.484,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface. (Laughter)

110
0:05:46.353,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Like, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter)

111
0:05:48.773,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause)

112
0:05:51.786,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It just changes the same content.

113
0:05:54.238,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart,

114
0:05:56.492,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic,

115
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.

116
0:06:01.679,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You feel for them.

117
0:06:03.864,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Or you change the typeface to something like this.

118
0:06:05.998,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear.

119
0:06:09.53,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I can never get in there. (Laughter)

120
0:06:11.816,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content.

121
0:06:17.102,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If you just change one letter in that content,

122
0:06:20.151,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you get a much better word, much better content: free.

123
0:06:24.131,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"Free" is a great word. You can serve it almost any way.

124
0:06:28.499,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Free bold feels like Mandela free.

125
0:06:31.094,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It's like, yes, I can be free.

126
0:06:33.775,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.

127
0:06:37.047,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It feels great. Or even free spread out,

128
0:06:39.777,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it's like, ah, I can breathe in free, so easily.

129
0:06:43.349,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove,

130
0:06:46.556,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I have, like, Don Draper free. (Laughter)

131
0:06:48.907,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.

132
0:06:52.269,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's a powerful thing. It's like magic, almost,

133
0:06:54.702,000 --> 0:06:58,000
like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic.

134
0:06:58.988,000 --> 0:07:,000
Design does that.

135
0:07:01.275,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect,

136
0:07:04.423,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and I'm going to show you some old work I never really

137
0:07:05.892,000 --> 0:07:08,000
show anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do.

138
0:07:09.18,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So -- yeah.

139
0:07:11.806,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So I made a lot of work in the '90s.

140
0:07:14.997,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This was a square that responds to sound.

141
0:07:18.293,000 --> 0:07:21,000
People ask me why I made that. It's not clear. (Laughter)

142
0:07:21.719,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But I thought it'd be neat for the square

143
0:07:27.435,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to respond to me, and my kids were small then,

144
0:07:32.491,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and my kids would play with these things, like, "Aaah,"

145
0:07:35.067,000 --> 0:07:37,000
you know, they would say, "Daddy, aaah, aaah." You know, like that.

146
0:07:37.993,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.

147
0:07:40.378,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And they'd say, "Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"

148
0:07:43.55,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?

149
0:07:47.093,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.

150
0:07:50.312,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of

151
0:07:53.496,000 --> 0:07:55,000
interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because

152
0:07:56.465,000 --> 0:07:58,000
my students at MIT got so much better than myself,

153
0:07:59.177,000 --> 0:08:,000
so I had to hang up my mouse.

154
0:08:00.987,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white,

155
0:08:04.555,000 --> 0:08:07,000
monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.

156
0:08:07.782,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's called "Tap, Type, Write."

157
0:08:09.448,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter

158
0:08:12.934,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.

159
0:08:17.019,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It has 10 variations. (Typing noise)

160
0:08:19.54,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Typing noise)

161
0:08:21.669,000 --> 0:08:24,000
There's a shift.

162
0:08:25.042,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Ten variations. This is, like, spin the letter around.

163
0:08:29.307,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Typing noises)

164
0:08:32.911,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is, like, a ring of letters. (Typing noises)

165
0:08:39.896,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is 20 years old, so it's kind of a --

166
0:08:42.807,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Let's see, this is —

167
0:08:44.621,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I love the French film "The Red Balloon."

168
0:08:46.737,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Great movie, right? I love that movie. So,

169
0:08:48.995,000 --> 0:08:51,000
this is sort of like a play on that. (Typing noises) (Typewriter bell)

170
0:08:52.603,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's peaceful, like that. (Laughter)

171
0:08:56.733,000 --> 0:09:,000
I'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know.

172
0:09:00.9,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you

173
0:09:02.851,000 --> 0:09:05,000
type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.

174
0:09:06.212,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

175
0:09:08.282,000 --> 0:09:1,000
If you hit G, life's okay, so I always say,

176
0:09:10.83,000 --> 0:09:13,000
"Hit G, and it's going to be all right.

177
0:09:14.187,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Thank you. (Applause)

178
0:09:16.698,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Thank you.

179
0:09:19.345,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So that was 20 years ago, and

180
0:09:22.677,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I was always on the periphery of art.

181
0:09:27.319,000 --> 0:09:29,000
By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art,

182
0:09:29.669,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.

183
0:09:33.328,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.

184
0:09:36.132,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?

185
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say,

186
0:09:42.596,000 --> 0:09:44,000
like, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great. (Laughter)

187
0:09:45.56,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Art does that, because art is about asking questions,

188
0:09:48.192,000 --> 0:09:5,000
questions that may not be answerable.

189
0:09:50.904,000 --> 0:09:51,000
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called

190
0:09:52.832,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples

191
0:09:56.502,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of animal, bone, mineral, plants.

192
0:10:00.083,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road,

193
0:10:02.793,000 --> 0:10:05,000
they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.

194
0:10:05.967,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And why do we have this facility?

195
0:10:08.508,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal,

196
0:10:11.951,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.

197
0:10:14.831,000 --> 0:10:16,000
At RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.

198
0:10:17.543,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just

199
0:10:19.208,000 --> 0:10:23,000
digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?

200
0:10:23.336,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things

201
0:10:26.278,000 --> 0:10:29,000
used to be done. There's something very different about it,

202
0:10:29.943,000 --> 0:10:31,000
something we should figure out what is good about

203
0:10:32.269,000 --> 0:10:35,000
how we did it, even in this new era.

204
0:10:35.346,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named

205
0:10:38.237,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo,

206
0:10:41.775,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but when he was based in London, he had a game

207
0:10:43.877,000 --> 0:10:46,000
with his wife. He would go to antique shops,

208
0:10:47.168,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and the game was as such:

209
0:10:49.315,000 --> 0:10:51,000
When we look at an antique we want,

210
0:10:51.996,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique,

211
0:10:54.843,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and if it's a good story, we'll buy it.

212
0:10:56.473,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup,

213
0:10:58.714,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."

214
0:11:00.043,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And the shopkeeper would say, "It's old." (Laughter)

215
0:11:04.147,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old." (Laughter)

216
0:11:07.871,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And he saw, over and over, the antique's value

217
0:11:10.417,000 --> 0:11:12,000
was all about it being old.

218
0:11:13.08,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said,

219
0:11:15.589,000 --> 0:11:17,000
you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.

220
0:11:18.233,000 --> 0:11:22,000
People say, "Wow, your art, what is it?" It's new media.

221
0:11:22.935,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And he realized, it isn't about old or new.

222
0:11:25.973,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It's about something in between.

223
0:11:27.487,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It isn't about "old," the dirt, "new," the cloud. It's about what is good.

224
0:11:32.948,000 --> 0:11:37,000
A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.

225
0:11:38.382,000 --> 0:11:39,000
You see it in all interesting art today, in all

226
0:11:40.366,000 --> 0:11:42,000
interesting businesses today. How we combine

227
0:11:42.385,000 --> 0:11:46,000
those two together to make good is very interesting.

228
0:11:46.674,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So art makes questions, and

229
0:11:49.445,000 --> 0:11:53,000
leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.

230
0:11:54.268,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We aren't functioning so easily anymore.

231
0:11:56.27,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.

232
0:11:59.398,000 --> 0:12:02,000
As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time

233
0:12:02.804,000 --> 0:12:04,000
traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument,

234
0:12:04.98,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass,"

235
0:12:08.142,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English,

236
0:12:09.785,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.

237
0:12:12.522,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people,

238
0:12:15.396,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and it was the best sign ever to say no.

239
0:12:18.569,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It was like, "No swimming, no hiking, no anything."

240
0:12:21.293,000 --> 0:12:26,000
My favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure.

241
0:12:26.892,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And also "no love." (Laughter)

242
0:12:29.165,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So that is authoritarianism.

243
0:12:32.718,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And what is that, structurally?

244
0:12:34.883,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run

245
0:12:37.633,000 --> 0:12:4,000
many systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted.

246
0:12:40.658,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.

247
0:12:44.176,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward.

248
0:12:47.396,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And so today, leaders are faced

249
0:12:50.796,000 --> 0:12:51,000
with how to lead differently, I believe.

250
0:12:52.71,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont

251
0:12:54.94,000 --> 0:12:56,000
on creative leadership. What can we learn

252
0:12:57.18,000 --> 0:12:59,000
from artists and designers for how to lead?

253
0:12:59.605,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.

254
0:13:03.61,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.

255
0:13:07.683,000 --> 0:13:1,000
A traditional leader is always wanting to be right,

256
0:13:10.861,000 --> 0:13:14,000
whereas a creative leader hopes to be right.

257
0:13:15.322,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And this frame is important today, in this complex,

258
0:13:17.82,000 --> 0:13:21,000
ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe.

259
0:13:22.59,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And I had a show in London recently where my friends

260
0:13:26.3,000 --> 0:13:27,000
invited me to come to London for four days

261
0:13:28.177,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to sit in a sandbox, and I said great.

262
0:13:30.639,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight,

263
0:13:33.987,000 --> 0:13:36,000
six hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London,

264
0:13:37.148,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and that was really bad.

265
0:13:39.335,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But I would listen to people, hear their issues,

266
0:13:42.967,000 --> 0:13:43,000
draw in the sand, try to figure things out,

267
0:13:44.861,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.

268
0:13:47.404,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days.

269
0:13:50.112,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And it felt kind of like being president, actually.

270
0:13:52.018,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I was like, "Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?"

271
0:13:55.015,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And by the end of the experience,

272
0:13:56.923,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I realized why I was doing this.

273
0:13:59.762,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It's because leaders, what we do is we connect

274
0:14:03.891,000 --> 0:14:07,000
improbable connections and hope something will happen,

275
0:14:08.048,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and in that room I found so many connections

276
0:14:09.803,000 --> 0:14:13,000
between people across all of London, and so leadership,

277
0:14:14.123,000 --> 0:14:16,000
connecting people, is the great question today.

278
0:14:16.76,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy,

279
0:14:19.017,000 --> 0:14:21,000
it's a wonderful design challenge.

280
0:14:21.412,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And one thing I've been doing is doing some research

281
0:14:25.137,000 --> 0:14:28,000
on systems that can combine technology and leadership

282
0:14:28.785,000 --> 0:14:28,000
with an art and design perspective.

283
0:14:29.779,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually.

284
0:14:34.052,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch

285
0:14:36.494,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop?

286
0:14:39.052,000 --> 0:14:43,000
This is called Powershop, and the way it works is

287
0:14:43.311,000 --> 0:14:46,000
imagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever

288
0:14:46.338,000 --> 0:14:48,000
at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization.

289
0:14:48.62,000 --> 0:14:5,000
There may be different subdivisions in the organization,

290
0:14:50.839,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and you might want to look into different areas. For instance,

291
0:14:53.524,000 --> 0:14:56,000
green are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly.

292
0:14:57.026,000 --> 0:14:59,000
You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect,

293
0:14:59.276,000 --> 0:15:02,000
make things happen? So for instance, you might open up

294
0:15:02.28,000 --> 0:15:05,000
a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there,

295
0:15:05.43,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and know that you know someone in Eco, over here,

296
0:15:09.141,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and

297
0:15:11.122,000 --> 0:15:13,000
these people here are in Eco, the people you might

298
0:15:13.13,000 --> 0:15:17,000
engage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy.

299
0:15:17.198,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find

300
0:15:20.283,000 --> 0:15:23,000
connections across areas, and so you might look in R&D,

301
0:15:23.742,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and here you see one person who crosses the two areas

302
0:15:26.942,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of interest, and it's a person important to engage.

303
0:15:30.499,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display

304
0:15:34.535,000 --> 0:15:36,000
on how you're interacting with them.

305
0:15:37.134,000 --> 0:15:38,000
How many coffees do you have?

306
0:15:38.713,000 --> 0:15:41,000
How often are you calling them, emailing them?

307
0:15:42.107,000 --> 0:15:44,000
What is the tenor of their email? How is it working out?

308
0:15:44.897,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Leaders might be able to use these systems to

309
0:15:47.259,000 --> 0:15:49,000
better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.

310
0:15:50.241,000 --> 0:15:53,000
You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso,

311
0:15:53.668,000 --> 0:15:55,000
the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep

312
0:15:56.193,000 --> 0:15:59,000
text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications?

313
0:15:59.422,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So these kind of systems, I believe, are important.

314
0:16:02.875,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They're targeted social media systems around leaders.

315
0:16:05.733,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin

316
0:16:09.042,000 --> 0:16:14,000
to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design,

317
0:16:14.349,000 --> 0:16:17,000
because art and design lets you think like this,

318
0:16:17.774,000 --> 0:16:18,000
find different systems like this,

319
0:16:19.549,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and I've just begun thinking like this,

320
0:16:21.422,000 --> 0:16:22,000
so I'm glad to share that with you.

321
0:16:23.355,000 --> 0:16:26,000
So in closing, I want to thank all of you

322
0:16:26.537,000 --> 0:16:3,000
for your attention. Thanks very much. (Applause)

323
0:16:30.619,000 --> 0:16:34,000

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was five years old

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I fell in love with airplanes.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now I'm talking about the '30s.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In the '30s an airplane had two wings

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and a round motor,

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and was always flown

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by a guy who looked like Cary Grant.

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
He had high leather boots,

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
jodhpurs, an old leather jacket,

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a wonderful helmet

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and those marvelous goggles --

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and, inevitably, a white scarf,

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to flow in the wind.

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He'd always walk up to his airplane

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
in a kind of saunter,

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
devil-may-care saunter,

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
flick the cigarette away,

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
grab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And then mount his airplane,

21
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
maybe for the last time.

22
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Of course I always wondered what would happen

23
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
if he'd kissed the airplane first.

24
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But this was real romance to me.

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Everything about flying in those years,

27
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment --

28
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
was probably the most advanced

29
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
technological thing going on at the time.

30
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So as a youngster,

31
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I tried to get close to this

32
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
by drawing airplanes,

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
constantly drawing airplanes.

34
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's the way I got

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a part of this romance.

36
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
And of course, in a way, when I say romance,

37
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I mean in part

38
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the aesthetics of that whole situation.

39
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I think the word is the holistic experience

40
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
revolving around a product.

41
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The product was that airplane.

42
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But it built a romance.

43
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Even the parts of the airplane

44
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
had French names.

45
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Ze fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.

46
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You know, from a romance language.

47
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So that it was something that just got into your spirit.

48
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It did mine.

49
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And I decided I had to get closer than

50
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
just drawing fantasy airplanes.

51
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I wanted to build airplanes.

52
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So I built model airplanes.

53
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I found that in doing the model airplanes

54
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the appearance drawings were not enough.

55
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
You couldn't transfer those

56
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to the model itself.

57
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
If you wanted it to fly

58
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you had to learn the discipline

59
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of flying.

60
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You had to learn about aeronautics.

61
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
You had to learn what made an airplane

62
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
stay in the air.

63
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.

64
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So it had to be self-righting,

65
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and stay up without crashing.

66
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So I had to give up

67
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the approach of drawing

68
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the fantasy shapes

69
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and convert it to technical drawings --

70
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on --

71
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and build an airplane over these drawings

72
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that I knew followed some of the principles

73
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of flying.

74
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And in so doing, I could produce

75
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a model that would fly, stay in the air.

76
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And it had, once it was in the air,

77
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
some of this romance that I was in love with.

78
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Well the act of drawing airplanes

79
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
led me to,

80
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
when I had the opportunity to choose

81
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a course in school,

82
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.

83
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And when I was sitting in classes --

84
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in which no one asked me to draw an airplane --

85
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to my surprise.

86
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics

87
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and all this sort of thing.

88
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes

89
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in the class.

90
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
One day a young man looked over my shoulder,

91
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
he said, "You draw very well.

92
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You should be in the art department."

93
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I said, "Why?"

94
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."

95
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So my romance was temporarily shifted.

97
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I went into art

99
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because they appreciated drawing.

100
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Studied painting; didn't do very well at that.

101
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Went through design,

102
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
some architecture.

103
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Eventually hired myself out as a designer.

104
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And for the following 25 years,

105
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
living in Italy,

106
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
living in America,

107
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I doled out a piece of this romance

108
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to anybody who'd pay for it --

109
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
this sense, this aesthetic feeling,

110
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for the experience revolving around

111
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
a designed object.

112
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And it exists.

113
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Any of you who rode the automobiles --

114
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
was it yesterday? --

115
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
at the track, you know the romance

116
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
revolving around those high performance cars.

117
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Well in 25 years

118
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I was mostly putting out

119
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
pieces of this romance

120
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and not getting a lot back in

121
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
because design on call

122
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
doesn't always connect you with a circumstance

123
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in which you can produce things of this nature.

124
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So after 25 years I began to feel

125
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
as though I was running dry.

126
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I quit.

127
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I started up a very small operation --

128
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
went from 40 people

129
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to one,

130
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in an effort to rediscover my innocence.

131
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I wanted to get back

132
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where the romance was.

133
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And I couldn't choose airplanes

134
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because they had gotten sort of unromantic

135
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
at that point,

136
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
even though I'd done a lot of airplane work,

137
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
on the interiors.

138
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So I chose furniture.

139
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I chose chairs specifically

140
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because I knew something about them.

141
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years

142
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
for tractors and trucks

143
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and submarines --

144
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
all kinds of things.

145
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But not office chairs.

146
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So I started doing that.

147
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And I found that there were ways

148
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to duplicate the same approach

149
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that I used to use on the airplane.

150
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Only this time,

151
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
instead of the product being shaped by the wind,

152
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it was shaped by the human body.

153
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So the discipline was --

154
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
as in the airplane you learn a lot about

155
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
how to deal with the air,

156
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
for a chair

157
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
you have to learn a lot about how to deal

158
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
with the body,

159
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and what the body needs, wants,

160
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
indicates it needs.

161
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And that's the way, ultimately

162
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
after some ups and downs,

163
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you.

164
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I should say one more thing. When I was doing those

165
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
model airplanes,

166
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I did everything.

167
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
I conceived the kind of airplane.

168
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I basically engineered it.

169
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I built it.

170
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I flew it.

171
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And that's the way I work now.

172
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When I started this chair

173
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
it was not a preconceived notion.

174
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Design nowadays, if you mean it,

175
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you don't start with styling sketches.

176
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I started with a lot of loose ideas,

177
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
roughly eight or nine years ago.

178
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And the loose ideas had something

179
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to do with what I knew happened with

180
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
people in the office,

181
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
at the work place -- people who worked,

182
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and used task seating,

183
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
a great many of them sitting in front of a computer

184
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
all day long.

185
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And I felt,

186
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the one thing they don't need,

187
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is a chair that interferes

188
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with their main reason for sitting there.

189
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So I took the approach

190
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that the chair should do as much for them

191
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
as humanly possible

192
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
or as mechanistically possible

193
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
so that they didn't have to fuss with it.

194
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So my idea was that,

195
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
instead of sitting down and reaching

196
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
for a lot of controls,

197
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that you would sit on the chair,

198
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and it would automatically balance your weight

199
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
against the force required

200
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to recline.

201
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you.

202
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But you know most good chairs do recline

203
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because it's beneficial to open up this joint

204
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
between your legs and your upper body

205
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
for better breathing

206
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and better flow.

207
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So that if you sit down

208
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
on my chair,

209
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
whether you're five feet tall

210
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
or six foot six,

211
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
it always deals with your weight

212
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
and transfers the amount of force required

213
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to recline

214
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in a way that you don't have to look

215
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for something to adjust.

216
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I'll tell you right up front,

217
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
this is a trade off.

218
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
There are drawbacks to this.

219
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
One is: you can't

220
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
accommodate everybody.

221
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
There are some very light people,

222
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
some extremely heavy people,

223
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
maybe people with a lot of bulk up top.

224
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They begin to fall off the end of your chart.

225
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But the compromise, I felt,

226
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
was in my favor

227
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because most people don't adjust their chairs.

228
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They will sit in them forever.

229
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack

230
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
tell me about his sister calling him.

231
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
He said she had one of the new, better chairs.

232
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
She said, "Oh I love it."

233
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
She said, "But it's too high."

234
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

235
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it."

236
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
He came over and looked at it.

237
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.

238
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
She said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?"

239
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And he showed her the lever.

240
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Well, that's typical

241
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
of a lot of us working in chairs.

242
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And why should you

243
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
get a 20-page manual

244
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
about how to run a chair?

245
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

246
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.

247
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Anyway, I felt that it was important

248
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that you didn't have to make an adjustment

249
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in order to get this kind of action.

250
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The other thing I felt was that armrests

251
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
had never really been properly approached

252
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
from the standpoint of how much

253
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of an aid they could be

254
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to your work life.

255
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But I felt it was too much to ask

256
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to have to adjust each individual armrest

257
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in order to get it where you wanted.

258
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So I spent a long time.

259
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I said I worked eight or nine years on it.

260
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And each of these things went along

261
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
sort of in parallel

262
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but incrementally were a problem of their own.

263
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I worked a long time on figuring out

264
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
how to move the arms over a much greater arc --

265
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that is up and down --

266
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and make them a lot easier,

267
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
so that you didn't have to use a button.

268
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And so after many trials, many failures,

269
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we came up with a very simple arrangement

270
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
in which we could just move

271
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
one arm or the other.

272
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And they go up easily.

273
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And stop where you want.

274
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You can put them down, essentially out of the way.

275
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
No arms at all.

276
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Or you can pull them up where you want them.

277
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And this was another thing that I felt,

278
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
while not nearly as romantic

279
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
as Cary Grant,

280
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
nevertheless begins to

281
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
grab a little bit of aesthetic

282
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
operation, aesthetic performance

283
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
into a product.

284
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The next area that was of interest to me

285
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
was the fact that reclining

286
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
was a very important factor.

287
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And the more you can recline,

288
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
in a way, the better it is.

289
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
The more the angle between here and here opens up --

290
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and nowadays, with a screen in front of you,

291
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,

292
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
so we keep it at more or less the same level --

293
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but you transfer weight

294
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
off your tailbones.

295
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Would everybody put their hand under their bottom

296
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and feel their tailbone?

297
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

298
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You feel that bone under there?

299
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

300
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Just your own.

301
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
(Laughter)

302
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
There's two of them, one on either side.

303
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
All the weight of your upper torso --

304
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
your arms, your head --

305
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
goes right down through your back,

306
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
your spine, into those bones when you sit.

307
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And that's a lot of load.

308
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Just relieving your arms with armrests

309
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
takes 20 percent of that load off.

310
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Now that, if your spine is not held in a good position,

311
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
will help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.

312
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So to unload

313
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that great weight --

314
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
if that indeed exists --

315
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
you can recline.

316
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
When you recline you take away a lot of that load

317
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.

318
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.

319
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And breathability is good.

320
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
But to do that, if you have any

321
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
amount of recline,

322
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
it gets to the point where you need a headrest

323
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
because nearly always,

324
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
automatically hold your head

325
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
in a vertical position, see?

326
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.

327
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Well if you're reclined a great deal,

328
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
you have to use muscle force

329
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to hold your head there.

330
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So that's where a headrest comes in.

331
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Now headrest is a challenge

332
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
because you want it to adjust

333
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
enough so that it'll fit,

334
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you know, a tall guy and a short girl.

335
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So here we are.

336
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I've got five inches of adjustment here

337
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
in order to get the headrest in the right place.

338
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
But then I knew from experience

339
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and looking around in offices

340
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
where there were chairs with headrests

341
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that nobody would ever bother

342
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to reach back and turn a knob

343
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and adjust the headrest to put it in position.

344
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And you need it in a different position

345
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
when you're upright, then when you're reclined.

346
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
So I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.

347
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So if you watch this chair

348
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
as I recline, the headrest comes up

349
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to meet my neck.

350
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Ideally you want to put the head support

351
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
in the cranial area, right there.

352
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So that part of it took a long time

353
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
to work out.

354
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions,

355
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
the gel we put.

356
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We stole the idea from bicycle seats,

357
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and put gel in the cushions

358
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and in the armrests

359
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to absorb point load --

360
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.

361
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
You cant hit your elbow

362
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
on bottom.

363
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And I did want to demonstrate

364
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
the fact that the chair can accommodate people.

365
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
While you're sitting in it you can adjust it

366
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
down for the five-footer,

367
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
or you can adjust it

368
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
for the six-foot-six guy --

369
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
all within the scope of a few simple adjustments.

370
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000

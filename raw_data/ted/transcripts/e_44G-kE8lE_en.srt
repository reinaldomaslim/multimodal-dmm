0:00:15.805,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.

3
0:00:19.337,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures,

4
0:00:23.799,000 --> 0:00:25,000
creatures from a far-distant world.

5
0:00:26.102,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But basically, I figured out that I could find

6
0:00:28.889,000 --> 0:00:3,000
those alien creatures right on Earth.

7
0:00:31.866,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And what I do is I study insects.

8
0:00:34.519,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.

9
0:00:37.775,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps

10
0:00:40.916,000 --> 0:00:42,000
one of the most important events in the history of life.

11
0:00:43.658,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants.

12
0:00:45.895,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Without flowering plants, there would be no

13
0:00:47.811,000 --> 0:00:5,000
clever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks.

14
0:00:50.948,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:53.248,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now,

16
0:00:55.235,000 --> 0:00:58,000
David and Hidehiko and Ketaki

17
0:00:58.274,000 --> 0:01:01,000
gave a very compelling story about

18
0:01:01.719,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the similarities between fruit flies and humans,

19
0:01:04.524,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and there are many similarities,

20
0:01:06.013,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,

21
0:01:09.015,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example --

22
0:01:12.812,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:15.094,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities

24
0:01:18.285,000 --> 0:01:21,000
between humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,

25
0:01:21.352,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.

26
0:01:26.639,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence

27
0:01:29.495,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,

28
0:01:33.43,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator

29
0:01:37.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that is going to go at the fly.

30
0:01:39.075,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The fly is going to sense this predator.

31
0:01:40.913,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It is going to extend its legs out.

32
0:01:43.368,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's going to sashay away

33
0:01:44.981,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to live to fly another day.

34
0:01:47.546,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Now I have carefully cropped this sequence

35
0:01:49.908,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,

36
0:01:53.068,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,

37
0:01:55.902,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the fly has seen this looming predator,

38
0:01:59.167,000 --> 0:02:05,000
estimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,

39
0:02:05.335,000 --> 0:02:09,000
beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.

40
0:02:09.799,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I think this is a fascinating behavior

41
0:02:11.772,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information.

42
0:02:15.693,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, flight -- what does it take to fly?

43
0:02:18.535,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Well, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,

44
0:02:21.399,000 --> 0:02:23,000
you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,

45
0:02:24.134,000 --> 0:02:27,000
you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,

46
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and you need a controller,

47
0:02:29.389,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically

48
0:02:32.015,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit.

49
0:02:36.327,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, how does this compare to a fly?

50
0:02:39.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out

51
0:02:42.331,000 --> 0:02:46,000
how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.

52
0:02:46.667,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And you might have heard how engineers proved

53
0:02:48.277,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that bumblebees couldn't fly.

54
0:02:50.911,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings

55
0:02:53.531,000 --> 0:02:56,000
function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.

56
0:02:56.65,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And we tackle this problem by building giant,

57
0:02:59.504,000 --> 0:03:02,000
dynamically scaled model robot insects

58
0:03:02.936,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil

59
0:03:06.272,000 --> 0:03:08,000
where we could study the aerodynamic forces.

60
0:03:08.546,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And it turns out that the insects flap their wings

61
0:03:10.704,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack

62
0:03:13.296,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,

63
0:03:16.417,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,

64
0:03:19.616,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings

65
0:03:22.57,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.

66
0:03:25.929,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But the thing that's actually most -- so, what's fascinating

67
0:03:28.357,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.

68
0:03:31.332,000 --> 0:03:34,000
What's clever is the way the fly flaps it,

69
0:03:34.977,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,

70
0:03:38.113,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and this is what enables flies to perform

71
0:03:40.76,000 --> 0:03:42,000
these remarkable aerial maneuvers.

72
0:03:43.567,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, what about the engine?

73
0:03:45.664,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.

74
0:03:48.156,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They have two types of flight muscle:

75
0:03:50.054,000 --> 0:03:52,000
so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,

76
0:03:53.039,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled

77
0:03:56.765,000 --> 0:03:59,000
on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.

78
0:04:00.104,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,

79
0:04:04.713,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and it fills the middle portion of the fly,

80
0:04:06.792,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so when a fly hits your windshield,

81
0:04:08.339,000 --> 0:04:1,000
it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.

82
0:04:10.745,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But attached to the base of the wing

83
0:04:12.891,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is a set of little, tiny control muscles

84
0:04:15.529,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,

85
0:04:18.83,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing

86
0:04:22.036,000 --> 0:04:23,000
on a stroke-by-stroke basis,

87
0:04:23.798,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and this is what enables the fly to change its wing

88
0:04:26.94,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces

89
0:04:29.911,000 --> 0:04:31,000
which change its flight trajectory.

90
0:04:32.484,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this.

91
0:04:36.047,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So let's look at the controller.

92
0:04:37.559,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors

93
0:04:40.206,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that they carry to this problem.

94
0:04:42.49,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.

95
0:04:46.617,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They have a sophisticated eye which is

96
0:04:48.292,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the fastest visual system on the planet.

97
0:04:50.748,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They have another set of eyes on the top of their head.

98
0:04:52.784,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We have no idea what they do.

99
0:04:54.836,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They have sensors on their wing.

100
0:04:57.79,000 --> 0:05:,000
Their wing is covered with sensors, including sensors

101
0:05:01.55,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that sense deformation of the wing.

102
0:05:03.596,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They can even taste with their wings.

103
0:05:05.705,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has

104
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is a structure called the halteres.

105
0:05:10.067,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The halteres are actually gyroscopes.

106
0:05:11.946,000 --> 0:05:15,000
These devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,

107
0:05:16.395,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation

108
0:05:19.068,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.

109
0:05:23.036,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But all of this sensory information has to be processed

110
0:05:25.365,000 --> 0:05:28,000
by a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,

111
0:05:29.085,000 --> 0:05:32,000
a brain of about 100,000 neurons.

112
0:05:32.244,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now several people at this conference

113
0:05:34.437,000 --> 0:05:38,000
have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience

114
0:05:39.245,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because they're a simple model of brain function.

115
0:05:42.492,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And the basic punchline of my talk is,

116
0:05:44.569,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I'd like to turn that over on its head.

117
0:05:47.227,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I don't think they're a simple model of anything.

118
0:05:49.855,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I think that flies are a great model.

119
0:05:52.332,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They're a great model for flies.

120
0:05:54.848,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:57.329,000 --> 0:06:,000
And let's explore this notion of simplicity.

122
0:06:00.332,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,

123
0:06:02.763,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we're all somewhat narcissistic.

124
0:06:04.595,000 --> 0:06:07,000
When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.

125
0:06:08.028,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But remember that this kind of brain,

126
0:06:09.988,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which is much, much smaller

127
0:06:11.756,000 --> 0:06:13,000
— instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons —

128
0:06:14.434,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but this is the most common form of brain on the planet

129
0:06:17.316,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and has been for 400 million years.

130
0:06:20.22,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And is it fair to say that it's simple?

131
0:06:22.508,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Well, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,

132
0:06:24.603,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but is that a fair metric?

133
0:06:26.357,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I would propose it's not a fair metric.

134
0:06:28.633,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare --

135
0:06:31.733,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter) —

136
0:06:33.292,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we have to compare the size of the brain

137
0:06:38.413,000 --> 0:06:4,000
with what the brain can do.

138
0:06:40.443,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So I propose we have a Trump number,

139
0:06:43.324,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's

140
0:06:46.189,000 --> 0:06:49,000
behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.

141
0:06:49.868,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.

142
0:06:52.536,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now, how many people here think the Trump number

143
0:06:55.22,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is higher for the fruit fly?

144
0:06:57.709,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Applause)

145
0:07:00.14,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It's a very smart, smart audience.

146
0:07:03.568,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it.

147
0:07:06.895,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd

148
0:07:09.277,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.

149
0:07:12.835,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.

150
0:07:16.978,000 --> 0:07:2,000
A mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.

151
0:07:21.283,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I used to study mice. When I studied mice,

152
0:07:23.31,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I used to talk really slowly.

153
0:07:26.147,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And then something happened when I started to work on flies.

154
0:07:28.723,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:31.135,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,

156
0:07:34.595,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it's really comparable. They have to forage for food.

157
0:07:37.908,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They have to engage in courtship.

158
0:07:40.355,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They have sex. They hide from predators.

159
0:07:43.826,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They do a lot of the similar things.

160
0:07:45.806,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But I would argue that flies do more.

161
0:07:47.524,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,

162
0:07:50.902,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,

163
0:07:55.107,000 --> 0:07:57,000
so I'm showing this classified sequence

164
0:07:57.179,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?

165
0:08:01.272,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So I want you to look at the payload

166
0:08:03.18,000 --> 0:08:06,000
at the tail of the fruit fly.

167
0:08:06.206,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Watch it very closely,

168
0:08:08.307,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and you'll see why my six-year-old son

169
0:08:12.604,000 --> 0:08:16,000
now wants to be a neuroscientist.

170
0:08:17.333,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Wait for it.

171
0:08:18.512,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Pshhew.

172
0:08:20.081,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,

173
0:08:23.165,000 --> 0:08:27,000
they're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter)

174
0:08:28.081,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers

175
0:08:32.048,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but also the challenge for a fly to compute

176
0:08:34.646,000 --> 0:08:36,000
everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.

177
0:08:37.495,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse

178
0:08:40.483,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,

179
0:08:43.251,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and you can see the wonderful images of brains

180
0:08:46.498,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that he showed in his talk.

181
0:08:49.691,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,

182
0:08:52.059,000 --> 0:08:56,000
at the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.

183
0:08:56.171,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And I'll expand this up.

184
0:08:58.012,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it's a beautifully complex neuron.

185
0:09:00.182,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges

186
0:09:03.667,000 --> 0:09:06,000
with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.

187
0:09:07.29,000 --> 0:09:1,000
How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.

188
0:09:10.827,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,

189
0:09:13.039,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,

190
0:09:15.838,000 --> 0:09:18,000
it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars

191
0:09:18.934,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to parasatize,

192
0:09:20.316,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,

193
0:09:24.431,000 --> 0:09:25,000
which is comparable for a fruit fly,

194
0:09:26.4,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it is the size of a salt grain.

195
0:09:29.326,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So here's some other organisms at the similar scale.

196
0:09:32.961,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,

197
0:09:37.091,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small --

198
0:09:40.971,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,

199
0:09:43.427,000 --> 0:09:44,000
where the nucleus of the neuron is?

200
0:09:45.078,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.

201
0:09:48.538,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.

202
0:09:51.011,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.

203
0:09:56.371,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?

204
0:10:02.004,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And I think, from an engineering perspective,

205
0:10:04.526,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you think of multiplexing.

206
0:10:06.255,000 --> 0:10:08,000
You can take a hardware and have that hardware

207
0:10:08.958,000 --> 0:10:09,000
do different things at different times,

208
0:10:10.571,000 --> 0:10:12,000
or have different parts of the hardware doing different things.

209
0:10:13.566,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.

210
0:10:16.837,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And they're not concepts that I've come up with,

211
0:10:18.495,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past.

212
0:10:23.04,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.

213
0:10:26.115,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And I don't mean chewing the crabs.

214
0:10:27.982,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.

215
0:10:31.581,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.

216
0:10:34.438,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Crab chewing is actually really fascinating.

217
0:10:36.468,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace

218
0:10:39.727,000 --> 0:10:4,000
called the gastric mill

219
0:10:41.037,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that grinds their food in a variety of different ways.

220
0:10:43.467,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.

221
0:10:48.726,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled

222
0:10:51.286,000 --> 0:10:54,000
by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons

223
0:10:54.718,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,

224
0:10:59.681,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion

225
0:11:04.028,000 --> 0:11:08,000
in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.

226
0:11:08.212,000 --> 0:11:1,000
You heard about neuromodulators earlier.

227
0:11:10.353,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There are more neuromodulators

228
0:11:12.578,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,

229
0:11:18.063,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.

230
0:11:22.305,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues

231
0:11:25.746,000 --> 0:11:27,000
who've been studying this fascinating system

232
0:11:28.041,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that show how a smaller cluster of neurons

233
0:11:30.193,000 --> 0:11:31,000
can do many, many, many things

234
0:11:32.018,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.

235
0:11:36.874,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So this is basically multiplexing in time.

236
0:11:39.313,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.

237
0:11:42.098,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,

238
0:11:45.576,000 --> 0:11:47,000
another neuromodulator, another set of cells,

239
0:11:48.194,000 --> 0:11:49,000
a different pattern, and you can imagine

240
0:11:49.907,000 --> 0:11:52,000
you could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.

241
0:11:53.785,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Is there any evidence that flies do this?

242
0:11:55.879,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,

243
0:11:59.254,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.

244
0:12:01.902,000 --> 0:12:02,000
You can tether a fly to a little stick.

245
0:12:03.608,000 --> 0:12:05,000
You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.

246
0:12:06.109,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You can let the fly play a little video game

247
0:12:08.655,000 --> 0:12:11,000
by letting it fly around in a visual display.

248
0:12:12.533,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.

249
0:12:14.87,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Here's a fly

250
0:12:16.097,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,

251
0:12:19.534,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and this is a game the flies love to play.

252
0:12:21.489,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You allow them to steer towards the little stripe,

253
0:12:23.926,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.

254
0:12:26.751,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's part of their visual guidance system.

255
0:12:30.309,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But very, very recently, it's been possible

256
0:12:32.654,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.

257
0:12:37.594,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,

258
0:12:40.082,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,

259
0:12:42.525,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and it's basically a flight simulator

260
0:12:44.211,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode

261
0:12:47.286,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in the brain of the fly and record

262
0:12:49.55,000 --> 0:12:52,000
from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.

263
0:12:53.206,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And this is what one of these experiments looks like.

264
0:12:55.504,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,

265
0:12:58.475,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Bettina Schnell.

266
0:12:59.674,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential

267
0:13:03.066,000 --> 0:13:05,000
of a neuron in the fly's brain,

268
0:13:05.096,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually

269
0:13:08.038,000 --> 0:13:11,000
controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself

270
0:13:11.317,000 --> 0:13:12,000
by its own wing motion,

271
0:13:12.796,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and you can see this visual interneuron

272
0:13:14.906,000 --> 0:13:17,000
respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.

273
0:13:18.814,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So for the first time we've actually been able to record

274
0:13:21.19,000 --> 0:13:23,000
from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly

275
0:13:24.098,000 --> 0:13:28,000
is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.

276
0:13:28.566,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And one of the lessons we've been learning

277
0:13:30.421,000 --> 0:13:32,000
is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying

278
0:13:32.841,000 --> 0:13:34,000
for many years in quiescent flies

279
0:13:35.262,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is not the same as the physiology of those cells

280
0:13:37.91,000 --> 0:13:39,000
when the flies actually engage in active behaviors

281
0:13:40.646,000 --> 0:13:42,000
like flying and walking and so forth.

282
0:13:43.185,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And why is the physiology different?

283
0:13:46.11,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators,

284
0:13:48.167,000 --> 0:13:51,000
just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.

285
0:13:52.118,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So here's a picture of the octopamine system.

286
0:13:54.668,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Octopamine is a neuromodulator

287
0:13:56.422,000 --> 0:14:,000
that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.

288
0:14:00.758,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But this is just one of many neuromodulators

289
0:14:03.23,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that's in the fly's brain.

290
0:14:04.301,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So I really think that, as we learn more,

291
0:14:06.967,000 --> 0:14:08,000
it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain

292
0:14:09.494,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,

293
0:14:12.583,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.

294
0:14:16.943,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Now, another idea, another way of multiplexing

295
0:14:19.73,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is multiplexing in space,

296
0:14:21.386,000 --> 0:14:22,000
having different parts of a neuron

297
0:14:23.08,000 --> 0:14:25,000
do different things at the same time.

298
0:14:25.202,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So here's two sort of canonical neurons

299
0:14:27.035,000 --> 0:14:29,000
from a vertebrate and an invertebrate,

300
0:14:29.32,000 --> 0:14:32,000
a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,

301
0:14:32.57,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,

302
0:14:36.573,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,

303
0:14:40.72,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea

304
0:14:43.795,000 --> 0:14:45,000
based on the fact that this neuron from a locust

305
0:14:46.677,000 --> 0:14:47,000
does not fire action potentials.

306
0:14:48.636,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It's a non-spiking cell.

307
0:14:50.384,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,

308
0:14:53.164,000 --> 0:14:55,000
has a region called the dendrites that receives input,

309
0:14:55.916,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and that input sums together

310
0:14:58.505,000 --> 0:15:,000
and will produce action potentials

311
0:15:00.801,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that run down the axon and then activate

312
0:15:03.132,000 --> 0:15:05,000
all the output regions of the neuron.

313
0:15:05.428,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated

314
0:15:08.304,000 --> 0:15:11,000
because they can have input synapses and output synapses

315
0:15:11.416,000 --> 0:15:14,000
all interdigitated, and there's no single action potential

316
0:15:15.079,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that drives all the outputs at the same time.

317
0:15:18.205,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments

318
0:15:22.112,000 --> 0:15:25,000
that allow the different parts of the neuron

319
0:15:26.09,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to do different things at the same time.

320
0:15:28.65,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So these basic concepts of multitasking in time

321
0:15:33.321,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and multitasking in space,

322
0:15:35.682,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I think these are things that are true in our brains as well,

323
0:15:38.514,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but I think the insects are the true masters of this.

324
0:15:41.091,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,

325
0:15:44.207,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and as I say up here, please think before you swat.

326
0:15:47.142,000 --> 0:15:49,000

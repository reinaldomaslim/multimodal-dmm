2
0:00:13.087,000 --> 0:00:17,000
There is something about physics

3
0:00:17.296,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that has been really bothering me since I was a little kid.

4
0:00:23.01,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And it's related to a question

5
0:00:24.843,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that scientists have been asking for almost 100 years,

6
0:00:28.111,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with no answer.

7
0:00:31.108,000 --> 0:00:34,000
How do the smallest things in nature,

8
0:00:34.142,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the particles of the quantum world,

9
0:00:36.319,000 --> 0:00:39,000
match up with the largest things in nature --

10
0:00:39.374,000 --> 0:00:42,000
planets and stars and galaxies held together by gravity?

11
0:00:43.25,000 --> 0:00:45,000
As a kid, I would puzzle over questions just like this.

12
0:00:46.047,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets,

13
0:00:48.963,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I would read about the forces of the small

14
0:00:51.182,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and about quantum mechanics

15
0:00:52.54,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I would marvel at how well that description matched up

16
0:00:56.128,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to our observation.

17
0:00:58.22,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Then I would look at the stars,

18
0:00:59.827,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and I would read about how well we understand gravity,

19
0:01:02.375,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I would think surely, there must be some elegant way

20
0:01:05.749,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that these two systems match up.

21
0:01:09.021,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But there's not.

22
0:01:11.673,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And the books would say,

23
0:01:12.857,000 --> 0:01:15,000
yeah, we understand a lot about these two realms separately,

24
0:01:16.064,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but when we try to link them mathematically,

25
0:01:18.698,000 --> 0:01:19,000
everything breaks.

26
0:01:20.674,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And for 100 years,

27
0:01:22.008,000 --> 0:01:27,000
none of our ideas as to how to solve this basically physics disaster,

28
0:01:27.06,000 --> 0:01:28,000
has ever been supported by evidence.

29
0:01:30.271,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And to little old me --

30
0:01:31.949,000 --> 0:01:32,000
little, curious, skeptical James --

31
0:01:33.783,000 --> 0:01:35,000
this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.

32
0:01:38.011,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.

33
0:01:40.268,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Flash-forward now to December of 2015,

34
0:01:45.029,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when I found myself smack in the middle

35
0:01:47.527,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of the physics world being flipped on its head.

36
0:01:51.999,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It all started when we at CERN saw something intriguing in our data:

37
0:01:55.343,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a hint of a new particle,

38
0:01:57.641,000 --> 0:02:01,000
an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question.

39
0:02:03.777,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So I'm still a skeptical little kid, I think,

40
0:02:05.928,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but I'm also now a particle hunter.

41
0:02:08.085,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I am a physicist at CERN's Large Hadron Collider,

42
0:02:11.572,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the largest science experiment ever mounted.

43
0:02:15.877,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's a 27-kilometer tunnel on the border of France and Switzerland

44
0:02:19.436,000 --> 0:02:2,000
buried 100 meters underground.

45
0:02:21.31,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And in this tunnel,

46
0:02:22.488,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space

47
0:02:26.465,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light

48
0:02:29.55,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and slam them into each other millions of times per second,

49
0:02:33.451,000 --> 0:02:35,000
collecting the debris of these collisions

50
0:02:36.301,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to search for new, undiscovered fundamental particles.

51
0:02:40.727,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Its design and construction took decades of work

52
0:02:43.215,000 --> 0:02:46,000
by thousands of physicists from around the globe,

53
0:02:46.271,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and in the summer of 2015,

54
0:02:48.836,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we had been working tirelessly to switch on the LHC

55
0:02:52.284,000 --> 0:02:56,000
at the highest energy that humans have ever used in a collider experiment.

56
0:02:57.735,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now, higher energy is important

57
0:03:00.282,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because for particles, there is an equivalence

58
0:03:02.493,000 --> 0:03:04,000
between energy and particle mass,

59
0:03:04.718,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and mass is just a number put there by nature.

60
0:03:08.068,000 --> 0:03:09,000
To discover new particles,

61
0:03:09.41,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we need to reach these bigger numbers.

62
0:03:11.556,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And to do that, we have to build a bigger, higher energy collider,

63
0:03:14.834,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the biggest, highest energy collider in the world

64
0:03:17.423,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is the Large Hadron Collider.

65
0:03:20.271,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And then, we collide protons quadrillions of times,

66
0:03:25.194,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and we collect this data very slowly, over months and months.

67
0:03:30.813,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And then new particles might show up in our data as bumps --

68
0:03:35.172,000 --> 0:03:37,000
slight deviations from what you expect,

69
0:03:37.641,000 --> 0:03:4,000
little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth.

70
0:03:42.379,000 --> 0:03:43,000
For example, this bump,

71
0:03:45.01,000 --> 0:03:47,000
after months of data-taking in 2012,

72
0:03:47.567,000 --> 0:03:49,000
led to the discovery of the Higgs particle --

73
0:03:49.72,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the Higgs boson --

74
0:03:50.949,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and to a Nobel Prize for the confirmation of its existence.

75
0:03:55.972,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This jump up in energy in 2015

76
0:04:00.628,000 --> 0:04:03,000
represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had

77
0:04:03.944,000 --> 0:04:04,000
of discovering new particles --

78
0:04:05.445,000 --> 0:04:07,000
new answers to these long-standing questions,

79
0:04:07.581,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because it was almost twice as much energy as we used

80
0:04:10.702,000 --> 0:04:11,000
when we discovered the Higgs boson.

81
0:04:12.648,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Many of my colleagues had been working their entire careers for this moment,

82
0:04:16.413,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and frankly, to little curious me,

83
0:04:18.513,000 --> 0:04:2,000
this was the moment I'd been waiting for my entire life.

84
0:04:21.447,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So 2015 was go time.

85
0:04:24.654,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So June 2015,

86
0:04:27.722,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the LHC is switched back on.

87
0:04:31.04,000 --> 0:04:33,000
My colleagues and I held our breath and bit our fingernails,

88
0:04:33.941,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and then finally we saw the first proton collisions

89
0:04:36.476,000 --> 0:04:37,000
at this highest energy ever.

90
0:04:38.456,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Applause, champagne, celebration.

91
0:04:40.556,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This was a milestone for science,

92
0:04:44.176,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and we had no idea what we would find in this brand-new data.

93
0:04:51.99,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And then a few weeks later, we found a bump.

94
0:04:56.192,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It wasn't a very big bump,

95
0:04:58.952,000 --> 0:05:,000
but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow.

96
0:05:01.488,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But on a scale of one to 10 for eyebrow raises,

97
0:05:03.763,000 --> 0:05:05,000
if 10 indicates that you've discovered a new particle,

98
0:05:06.397,000 --> 0:05:07,000
this eyebrow raise is about a four.

99
0:05:08.148,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:10.432,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I spent hours, days, weeks in secret meetings,

101
0:05:15.667,000 --> 0:05:17,000
arguing with my colleagues over this little bump,

102
0:05:18.051,000 --> 0:05:21,000
poking and prodding it with our most ruthless experimental sticks

103
0:05:21.311,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to see if it would withstand scrutiny.

104
0:05:23.988,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But even after months of working feverishly --

105
0:05:27.473,000 --> 0:05:29,000
sleeping in our offices and not going home,

106
0:05:29.929,000 --> 0:05:31,000
candy bars for dinner,

107
0:05:32.03,000 --> 0:05:33,000
coffee by the bucketful --

108
0:05:33.624,000 --> 0:05:37,000
physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams --

109
0:05:37.891,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:39.314,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This little bump would not go away.

111
0:05:42.704,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So after a few months,

112
0:05:44.866,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message:

113
0:05:49.457,000 --> 0:05:51,000
this little bump is interesting but it's not definitive,

114
0:05:52.192,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so let's keep an eye on it as we take more data.

115
0:05:55.872,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So we were trying to be extremely cool about it.

116
0:05:59.463,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And the world ran with it anyway.

117
0:06:02.383,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The news loved it.

118
0:06:04.735,000 --> 0:06:06,000
People said it reminded them of the little bump

119
0:06:07.314,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that was shown on the way toward the Higgs boson discovery.

120
0:06:10.761,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Better than that, my theorist colleagues --

121
0:06:14.548,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I love my theorist colleagues --

122
0:06:16.889,000 --> 0:06:19,000
my theorist colleagues wrote 500 papers about this little bump.

123
0:06:20.525,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:22.574,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The world of particle physics had been flipped on its head.

125
0:06:27.745,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But what was it about this particular bump

126
0:06:32.011,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool?

127
0:06:37.596,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This little bump was unique.

128
0:06:40.198,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This little bump indicated

129
0:06:41.591,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that we were seeing an unexpectedly large number of collisions

130
0:06:44.637,000 --> 0:06:47,000
whose debris consisted of only two photons,

131
0:06:47.992,000 --> 0:06:48,000
two particles of light.

132
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And that's rare.

133
0:06:51.069,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Particle collisions are not like automobile collisions.

134
0:06:53.713,000 --> 0:06:54,000
They have different rules.

135
0:06:55.256,000 --> 0:06:57,000
When two particles collide at almost the speed of light,

136
0:06:57.93,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the quantum world takes over.

137
0:06:59.375,000 --> 0:07:,000
And in the quantum world,

138
0:07:00.659,000 --> 0:07:03,000
these two particles can briefly create a new particle

139
0:07:03.876,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that lives for a tiny fraction of a second

140
0:07:06.68,000 --> 0:07:08,000
before splitting into other particles that hit our detector.

141
0:07:09.585,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Imagine a car collision where the two cars vanish upon impact,

142
0:07:13.014,000 --> 0:07:15,000
a bicycle appears in their place --

143
0:07:15.307,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:16.402,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And then that bicycle explodes into two skateboards,

145
0:07:18.887,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which hit our detector.

146
0:07:20.092,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:21.495,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Hopefully, not literally.

148
0:07:23.472,000 --> 0:07:24,000
They're very expensive.

149
0:07:26.191,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Events where only two photons hit out detector are very rare.

150
0:07:29.963,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And because of the special quantum properties of photons,

151
0:07:33.709,000 --> 0:07:36,000
there's a very small number of possible new particles --

152
0:07:37.521,000 --> 0:07:38,000
these mythical bicycles --

153
0:07:39.042,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that can give birth to only two photons.

154
0:07:41.812,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But one of these options is huge,

155
0:07:44.672,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and it has to do with that long-standing question

156
0:07:47.532,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that bothered me as a tiny little kid,

157
0:07:50.078,000 --> 0:07:51,000
about gravity.

158
0:07:53.946,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Gravity may seem super strong to you,

159
0:07:56.642,000 --> 0:08:,000
but it's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature.

160
0:08:00.766,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I can briefly beat gravity when I jump,

161
0:08:04.39,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.

162
0:08:08.463,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature?

163
0:08:12.48,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's 10 to the minus 39.

164
0:08:14.694,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it.

165
0:08:17.255,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Worse than that,

166
0:08:18.436,000 --> 0:08:21,000
all of the other known forces of nature are perfectly described

167
0:08:21.487,000 --> 0:08:23,000
by this thing we call the Standard Model,

168
0:08:23.548,000 --> 0:08:26,000
which is our current best description of nature at its smallest scales,

169
0:08:27.007,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and quite frankly,

170
0:08:28.187,000 --> 0:08:32,000
one of the most successful achievements of humankind --

171
0:08:32.388,000 --> 0:08:36,000
except for gravity, which is absent from the Standard Model.

172
0:08:36.424,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's crazy.

173
0:08:38.046,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing.

174
0:08:42.394,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We feel a little bit of it,

175
0:08:44.085,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but where's the rest of it?

176
0:08:45.785,000 --> 0:08:46,000
No one knows.

177
0:08:48.003,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution.

178
0:08:54.12,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You and I --

179
0:08:55.483,000 --> 0:08:56,000
even you in the back --

180
0:08:57.085,000 --> 0:08:59,000
we live in three dimensions of space.

181
0:08:59.254,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I hope that's a non-controversial statement.

182
0:09:01.835,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:03.688,000 --> 0:09:06,000
All of the known particles also live in three dimensions of space.

184
0:09:07.15,000 --> 0:09:09,000
In fact, a particle is just another name

185
0:09:09.364,000 --> 0:09:12,000
for an excitation in a three-dimensional field;

186
0:09:12.397,000 --> 0:09:13,000
a localized wobbling in space.

187
0:09:15.288,000 --> 0:09:18,000
More importantly, all the math that we use to describe all this stuff

188
0:09:18.841,000 --> 0:09:21,000
assumes that there are only three dimensions of space.

189
0:09:21.938,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But math is math, and we can play around with our math however we want.

190
0:09:25.343,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space

191
0:09:28.533,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for a very long time,

192
0:09:29.712,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but it's always been an abstract mathematical concept.

193
0:09:32.321,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I mean, just look around you -- you at the back, look around --

194
0:09:35.517,000 --> 0:09:37,000
there's clearly only three dimensions of space.

195
0:09:38.954,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But what if that's not true?

196
0:09:42.109,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What if the missing gravity is leaking into an extra-spatial dimension

197
0:09:48.388,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that's invisible to you and I?

198
0:09:51.355,000 --> 0:09:54,000
What if gravity is just as strong as the other forces

199
0:09:54.473,000 --> 0:09:57,000
if you were to view it in this extra-spatial dimension,

200
0:09:57.638,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and what you and I experience is a tiny slice of gravity

201
0:10:00.562,000 --> 0:10:01,000
make it seem very weak?

202
0:10:04.158,000 --> 0:10:05,000
If this were true,

203
0:10:05.357,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we would have to expand our Standard Model of particles

204
0:10:08.129,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to include an extra particle, a hyperdimensional particle of gravity,

205
0:10:12.239,000 --> 0:10:14,000
a special graviton that lives in extra-spatial dimensions.

206
0:10:15.258,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I see the looks on your faces.

207
0:10:16.747,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You should be asking me the question,

208
0:10:18.59,000 --> 0:10:21,000
"How in the world are we going to test this crazy, science fiction idea,

209
0:10:22.258,000 --> 0:10:24,000
stuck as we are in three dimensions?"

210
0:10:24.773,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The way we always do,

211
0:10:26.079,000 --> 0:10:28,000
by slamming together two protons --

212
0:10:28.242,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:29.418,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Hard enough that the collision reverberates

214
0:10:32.006,000 --> 0:10:34,000
into any extra-spatial dimensions that might be there,

215
0:10:34.721,000 --> 0:10:36,000
momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton

216
0:10:37.344,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the LHC

217
0:10:41.748,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and spits off two photons,

218
0:10:44.278,000 --> 0:10:45,000
two particles of light.

219
0:10:47.417,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And this hypothetical, extra-dimensional graviton

220
0:10:50.351,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is one of the only possible, hypothetical new particles

221
0:10:54.082,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that has the special quantum properties

222
0:10:56.241,000 --> 0:11:,000
that could give birth to our little, two-photon bump.

223
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So, the possibility of explaining the mysteries of gravity

224
0:11:07.844,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and of discovering extra dimensions of space --

225
0:11:11.366,000 --> 0:11:12,000
perhaps now you get a sense

226
0:11:12.982,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as to why thousands of physics geeks collectively lost their cool

227
0:11:17.13,000 --> 0:11:18,000
over our little, two-photon bump.

228
0:11:19.036,000 --> 0:11:21,000
A discovery of this type would rewrite the textbooks.

229
0:11:22.739,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But remember,

230
0:11:23.915,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the message from us experimentalists

231
0:11:25.663,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that actually were doing this work at the time,

232
0:11:27.926,000 --> 0:11:28,000
was very clear:

233
0:11:29.104,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we need more data.

234
0:11:30.302,000 --> 0:11:31,000
With more data,

235
0:11:31.845,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the little bump will either turn into a nice, crisp Nobel Prize --

236
0:11:35.893,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:37.677,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Or the extra data will fill in the space around the bump

238
0:11:40.665,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and turn it into a nice, smooth line.

239
0:11:43.515,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So we took more data,

240
0:11:44.757,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and with five times the data, several months later,

241
0:11:47.358,000 --> 0:11:48,000
our little bump

242
0:11:49.072,000 --> 0:11:51,000
turned into a smooth line.

243
0:11:55.217,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The news reported on a "huge disappointment," on "faded hopes,"

244
0:11:58.725,000 --> 0:12:,000
and on particle physicists "being sad."

245
0:12:01.259,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Given the tone of the coverage,

246
0:12:03.094,000 --> 0:12:06,000
you'd think that we had decided to shut down the LHC and go home.

247
0:12:06.606,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Laughter)

248
0:12:08.628,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But that's not what we did.

249
0:12:13.057,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But why not?

250
0:12:16.475,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I mean, if I didn't discover a particle -- and I didn't --

251
0:12:20.209,000 --> 0:12:23,000
if I didn't discover a particle, why am I here talking to you?

252
0:12:23.262,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Why didn't I just hang my head in shame

253
0:12:25.723,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and go home?

254
0:12:31.169,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Particle physicists are explorers.

255
0:12:35.421,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And very much of what we do is cartography.

256
0:12:39.468,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Let me put it this way: forget about the LHC for a second.

257
0:12:42.344,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Imagine you are a space explorer arriving at a distant planet,

258
0:12:45.75,000 --> 0:12:46,000
searching for aliens.

259
0:12:47.099,000 --> 0:12:48,000
What is your first task?

260
0:12:49.931,000 --> 0:12:52,000
To immediately orbit the planet, land, take a quick look around

261
0:12:53.031,000 --> 0:12:54,000
for any big, obvious signs of life,

262
0:12:54.941,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and report back to home base.

263
0:12:56.784,000 --> 0:12:57,000
That's the stage we're at now.

264
0:12:59.269,000 --> 0:13:,000
We took a first look at the LHC

265
0:13:00.78,000 --> 0:13:02,000
for any new, big, obvious-to-spot particles,

266
0:13:03.088,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and we can report that there are none.

267
0:13:05.631,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We saw a weird-looking alien bump on a distant mountain,

268
0:13:08.328,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but once we got closer, we saw it was a rock.

269
0:13:10.816,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But then what do we do? Do we just give up and fly away?

270
0:13:13.48,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Absolutely not;

271
0:13:14.791,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we would be terrible scientists if we did.

272
0:13:17.12,000 --> 0:13:2,000
No, we spend the next couple of decades exploring,

273
0:13:20.757,000 --> 0:13:21,000
mapping out the territory,

274
0:13:22.261,000 --> 0:13:24,000
sifting through the sand with a fine instrument,

275
0:13:24.65,000 --> 0:13:25,000
peeking under every stone,

276
0:13:26.132,000 --> 0:13:27,000
drilling under the surface.

277
0:13:28.106,000 --> 0:13:3,000
New particles can either show up immediately

278
0:13:30.723,000 --> 0:13:32,000
as big, obvious-to-spot bumps,

279
0:13:32.88,000 --> 0:13:35,000
or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking.

280
0:13:38.103,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Humanity has just begun its exploration at the LHC at this big high energy,

281
0:13:42.537,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and we have much searching to do.

282
0:13:44.352,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But what if, even after 10 or 20 years, we still find no new particles?

283
0:13:51.053,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We build a bigger machine.

284
0:13:52.772,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Laughter)

285
0:13:54.37,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We search at higher energies.

286
0:13:56.476,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We search at higher energies.

287
0:13:58.946,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Planning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel

288
0:14:02.612,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that will collide particles at 10 times the energy of the LHC.

289
0:14:05.612,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We don't decide where nature places new particles.

290
0:14:08.366,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We only decide to keep exploring.

291
0:14:10.036,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But what if, even after a 100-kilometer tunnel

292
0:14:12.618,000 --> 0:14:13,000
or a 500-kilometer tunnel

293
0:14:14.502,000 --> 0:14:16,000
or a 10,000-kilometer collider floating in space

294
0:14:17.367,000 --> 0:14:18,000
between the Earth and the Moon,

295
0:14:18.969,000 --> 0:14:21,000
we still find no new particles?

296
0:14:23.597,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Then perhaps we're doing particle physics wrong.

297
0:14:26.315,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Laughter)

298
0:14:28.13,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Perhaps we need to rethink things.

299
0:14:31.127,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Maybe we need more resources, technology, expertise

300
0:14:34.413,000 --> 0:14:35,000
than what we currently have.

301
0:14:36.61,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques

302
0:14:39.975,000 --> 0:14:4,000
in parts of the LHC,

303
0:14:41.152,000 --> 0:14:43,000
but imagine designing a particle physics experiment

304
0:14:43.582,000 --> 0:14:44,000
using such sophisticated algorithms

305
0:14:45.275,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that it could teach itself to discover a hyperdimensional graviton.

306
0:14:48.467,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But what if?

307
0:14:49.648,000 --> 0:14:5,000
What if the ultimate question:

308
0:14:51.117,000 --> 0:14:54,000
What if even artificial intelligence can't help us answer our questions?

309
0:14:54.614,000 --> 0:14:56,000
What if these open questions, for centuries,

310
0:14:56.749,000 --> 0:14:58,000
are destined to be unanswered for the foreseeable future?

311
0:14:59.442,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What if the stuff that's bothered me since I was a little kid

312
0:15:02.395,000 --> 0:15:04,000
is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime?

313
0:15:06.395,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Then that ...

314
0:15:08.282,000 --> 0:15:1,000
will be even more fascinating.

315
0:15:12.144,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We will be forced to think in completely new ways.

316
0:15:16.361,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We'll have to go back to our assumptions,

317
0:15:18.443,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and determine if there was a flaw somewhere.

318
0:15:21.401,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And we'll need to encourage more people to join us in studying science

319
0:15:24.82,000 --> 0:15:27,000
since we need fresh eyes on these century-old problems.

320
0:15:27.906,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I don't have the answers, and I'm still searching for them.

321
0:15:31.064,000 --> 0:15:33,000
But someone -- maybe she's in school right now,

322
0:15:33.417,000 --> 0:15:34,000
maybe she's not even born yet --

323
0:15:35.783,000 --> 0:15:38,000
could eventually guide us to see physics in a completely new way,

324
0:15:38.94,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and to point out that perhaps we're just asking the wrong questions.

325
0:15:44.112,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Which would not be the end of physics,

326
0:15:46.546,000 --> 0:15:47,000
but a novel beginning.

327
0:15:49.204,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Thank you.

328
0:15:50.378,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Applause)

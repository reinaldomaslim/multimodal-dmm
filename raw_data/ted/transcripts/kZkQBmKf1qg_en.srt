1
0:00:12.996,000 --> 0:00:13,000
In June of 1998,

2
0:00:14.807,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head, North Carolina for France.

3
0:00:20.147,000 --> 0:00:22,000
That's her boat, the American Pearl.

4
0:00:22.469,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's 23 feet long and just six feet across

5
0:00:24.913,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at its widest point.

6
0:00:26.881,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The deck was the size of a cargo bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

7
0:00:31.873,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Tori and her friends built it by hand,

8
0:00:34.357,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.

9
0:00:37.051,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Her plan was to row it alone

10
0:00:39.414,000 --> 0:00:4,000
across the Atlantic Ocean --

11
0:00:41.364,000 --> 0:00:43,000
no motor, no sail --

12
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:46,000
something no woman and no American had ever done before.

13
0:00:47.262,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This would be her route:

14
0:00:48.841,000 --> 0:00:52,000
over 3,600 miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean.

15
0:00:53.068,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Professionally, Tori worked as a project administrator

16
0:00:55.683,000 --> 0:00:56,000
for the city of Louisville, Kentucky,

17
0:00:57.478,000 --> 0:00:58,000
her hometown,

18
0:00:59.289,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but her real passion was exploring.

19
0:01:01.704,000 --> 0:01:03,000
This was not her first big expedition.

20
0:01:04.188,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Several years earlier, she'd become the first woman to ski to the South Pole.

21
0:01:08.554,000 --> 0:01:1,000
She was an accomplished rower in college,

22
0:01:10.783,000 --> 0:01:13,000
even competed for a spot on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team,

23
0:01:14.265,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but this, this was different.

24
0:01:18.189,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure: Hi. It's Sunday, July 5.

25
0:01:24.83,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Sector time 9 a.m.

26
0:01:26.711,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So that's Kentucky time now.

27
0:01:29.892,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Dawn Landes: Tori made these videos as she rowed.

28
0:01:32.237,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This is her 21st day at sea.

29
0:01:34.536,000 --> 0:01:36,000
At this point, she'd covered over 1,000 miles,

30
0:01:37.299,000 --> 0:01:39,000
had had no radio contact in more than two weeks

31
0:01:39.969,000 --> 0:01:42,000
following a storm that disabled all her long-range communications systems

32
0:01:43.409,000 --> 0:01:44,000
just five days in.

33
0:01:45.123,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Most days looked like this.

34
0:01:47.144,000 --> 0:01:5,000
At this point, she'd rowed over 200,000 strokes,

35
0:01:50.905,000 --> 0:01:52,000
fighting the current and the wind.

36
0:01:53.227,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Some days, she traveled as little as 15 feet.

37
0:01:56.71,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Yeah.

38
0:01:58.219,000 --> 0:02:,000
And as frustrating as those days were,

39
0:02:00.866,000 --> 0:02:03,000
other days were like this.

40
0:02:03.908,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Video) TMM: And I want to show you my little friends.

41
0:02:07.019,000 --> 0:02:11,000
DL: She saw fish, dolphins,

42
0:02:11.93,000 --> 0:02:13,000
whales, sharks,

43
0:02:14.461,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and even some sea turtles.

44
0:02:17.34,000 --> 0:02:19,000
After two weeks with no human contact,

45
0:02:19.615,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Tori was able to contact a local cargo ship

46
0:02:21.937,000 --> 0:02:23,000
via VHF radio.

47
0:02:24.863,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Video) TMM: Do you guys have a weather report, over?

48
0:02:28.648,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Man: Heading up to a low

49
0:02:31.782,000 --> 0:02:33,000
ahead of you but it's heading,

50
0:02:34.267,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and you're obviously going northeast

51
0:02:36.147,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and there's a high behind us.

52
0:02:38.051,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That'd be coming

53
0:02:39.909,000 --> 0:02:41,000
east-northeast also.

54
0:02:42.416,000 --> 0:02:43,000
TMM: Good.

55
0:02:44.019,000 --> 0:02:47,000
DL: She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point.

56
0:02:47.925,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Video) TMM: So weather report says nothing dramatic

57
0:02:50.367,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is going to happen soon.

58
0:02:52.98,000 --> 0:02:54,000
DL: What the weather report didn't tell her

59
0:02:54.991,000 --> 0:02:57,000
was that she was rowing right into the path of Hurricane Danielle

60
0:02:58.089,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in the worst hurricane season on record in the North Atlantic.

61
0:03:04.138,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.

62
0:03:07.133,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There's a very strong wind from the east now.

63
0:03:10.848,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's blowing about.

64
0:03:13.286,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's blowing!

65
0:03:16.165,000 --> 0:03:18,000
After 12 days of storm

66
0:03:18.859,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I get to row for four hours

67
0:03:20.693,000 --> 0:03:22,000
without a flagging wind.

68
0:03:22.837,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I'm not very happy right now.

69
0:03:24.527,000 --> 0:03:25,000
As happy as I was this morning,

70
0:03:26.196,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I am unhappy now, so ...

71
0:03:32.2,000 --> 0:03:33,000
DL: After nearly three months at sea,

72
0:03:34.195,000 --> 0:03:36,000
she'd covered over 3,000 miles.

73
0:03:36.888,000 --> 0:03:38,000
She was two thirds of the way there,

74
0:03:38.908,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but in the storm, the waves were the size of a seven-story building.

75
0:03:42.438,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Her boat kept capsizing.

76
0:03:44.614,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Some of them were pitchpole capsizes, flipping her end over end,

77
0:03:47.818,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and rowing became impossible.

78
0:03:50.303,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.

79
0:03:53.706,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'm in something big, bad and ugly.

80
0:03:57.06,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Two capsizes.

81
0:03:59.66,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Last capsize, I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back.

82
0:04:08.356,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I've had about six capsizes now.

83
0:04:11.839,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The last one was a pitchpole.

84
0:04:14.346,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I have the Argus beacon with me.

85
0:04:17.295,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I would set off the distress signal,

86
0:04:19.083,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but quite frankly, I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat.

87
0:04:23.309,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's so far underwater right now,

88
0:04:25.12,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin.

89
0:04:29.299,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's about 10 a.m.

90
0:04:32.434,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I've lost track of the number of capsizes.

91
0:04:35.127,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I seem to capsize about every 15 minutes.

92
0:04:38.169,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I think I may have broken my left arm.

93
0:04:45.204,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The waves

94
0:04:46.667,000 --> 0:04:48,000
are tearing the boat to shreds.

95
0:04:50.556,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I keep praying because

96
0:04:52.042,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'm not sure I'm going to make it through this.

97
0:04:55.128,000 --> 0:04:57,000
DL: Tori set off her distress beacon

98
0:04:57.447,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and was rescued by a passing container ship.

99
0:05:00.341,000 --> 0:05:03,000
They found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near France.

100
0:05:04.325,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I read about it in the newspaper.

101
0:05:07.506,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In 1998, I was a high school student living in Louisville, Kentucky.

102
0:05:11.779,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now, I live in New York City. I'm a songwriter.

103
0:05:14.333,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And her bravery stuck with me, and I'm adapting her story

104
0:05:17.63,000 --> 0:05:2,000
into a musical called "Row."

105
0:05:24.99,000 --> 0:05:25,000
When Tori returned home,

106
0:05:26.639,000 --> 0:05:27,000
she was feeling disheartened,

107
0:05:28.473,000 --> 0:05:29,000
she was broke.

108
0:05:29.667,000 --> 0:05:31,000
She was having a hard time making the transition

109
0:05:31.956,000 --> 0:05:33,000
back into civilization.

110
0:05:36.085,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In this scene, she sits at home.

111
0:05:38.718,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The phone is ringing, her friends are calling,

112
0:05:40.965,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but she doesn't know how to talk to them.

113
0:05:43.171,000 --> 0:05:45,000
She sings this song. It's called "Dear Heart."

114
0:05:46.166,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Guitar)

115
0:05:52.331,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When I was dreaming,

116
0:05:56.046,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I took my body

117
0:05:59.297,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to beautiful places

118
0:06:02.617,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I'd never been.

119
0:06:05.937,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I saw Gibraltar,

120
0:06:09.211,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and stars of Kentucky

121
0:06:12.601,000 --> 0:06:15,000
burned in the moonlight,

122
0:06:15.875,000 --> 0:06:18,000
making me smile.

123
0:06:19.451,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And when I awoke here,

124
0:06:22.714,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the sky was so cloudy.

125
0:06:26.161,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I walked to a party

126
0:06:29.534,000 --> 0:06:32,000
where people I know

127
0:06:32.995,000 --> 0:06:35,000
try hard to know me

128
0:06:36.222,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and ask where I've been,

129
0:06:39.426,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but I can't explain

130
0:06:42.514,000 --> 0:06:45,000
what I've seen to them.

131
0:06:46.369,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Ah, listen, dear heart.

132
0:06:53.242,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Just pay attention,

133
0:06:56.359,000 --> 0:07:,000
go right from the start.

134
0:07:00.395,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Ah, listen, dear heart.

135
0:07:06.313,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You can fall off the map,

136
0:07:09.052,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but don't fall apart.

137
0:07:13.532,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Ooh ooh ooh,

138
0:07:15.377,000 --> 0:07:19,000
ah ah ah ah ah.

139
0:07:20.245,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Ah ah,

140
0:07:23.589,000 --> 0:07:25,000
ah ah ah.

141
0:07:26.421,000 --> 0:07:29,000
When I was out there,

142
0:07:29.63,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the ocean would hold me,

143
0:07:33.02,000 --> 0:07:36,000
rock me and throw me,

144
0:07:36.364,000 --> 0:07:39,000
light as a child.

145
0:07:39.684,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But now I'm so heavy,

146
0:07:43.121,000 --> 0:07:46,000
nothing consoles me.

147
0:07:46.325,000 --> 0:07:49,000
My mind floats like driftwood,

148
0:07:49.761,000 --> 0:07:52,000
wayward and wild.

149
0:07:53.035,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Ah, listen, dear heart.

150
0:07:59.582,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Just pay attention,

151
0:08:02.717,000 --> 0:08:05,000
go right from the start.

152
0:08:06.456,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Ah, listen, dear heart.

153
0:08:12.748,000 --> 0:08:15,000
You can fall off the map,

154
0:08:16.208,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but don't fall apart.

155
0:08:20.132,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Ooh.

156
0:08:26.912,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Eventually, Tori starts to get her feet under her.

157
0:08:30.139,000 --> 0:08:32,000
She starts hanging out with her friends again.

158
0:08:32.6,000 --> 0:08:35,000
She meets a guy and falls in love for the first time.

159
0:08:36.478,000 --> 0:08:39,000
She gets a new job working for another Louisville native,

160
0:08:39.543,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Muhammad Ali.

0:08:41.818,000 --> 0:08:43,000
One day, at lunch with her new boss,

162
0:08:44.558,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Tori shares the news that two other women

163
0:08:46.926,000 --> 0:08:48,000
are setting out to row across the mid-Atlantic,

164
0:08:49.689,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to do something that she almost died trying to do.

165
0:08:53.381,000 --> 0:08:56,000
His response was classic Ali:

166
0:08:56.502,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"You don't want to go through life

167
0:08:58.418,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as the woman who almost rowed across the ocean."

168
0:09:02.175,000 --> 0:09:03,000
He was right.

169
0:09:04.172,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Tori rebuilt the American Pearl,

170
0:09:05.89,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and in December of 1999,

171
0:09:07.678,000 --> 0:09:09,000
she did it.

172
0:09:09.954,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Applause) (Guitar)

173
0:09:16.873,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Thank you.

174
0:09:19.404,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Applause)

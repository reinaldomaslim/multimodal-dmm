2
0:00:15.863,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, this book that I have in my hand

3
0:00:18.929,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is a directory of everybody who had an email address

4
0:00:22.863,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in 1982. (Laughter)

5
0:00:26.382,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Actually, it's deceptively large.

6
0:00:30.067,000 --> 0:00:33,000
There's actually only about 20 people on each page,

7
0:00:33.504,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because we have the name, address

8
0:00:35.394,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and telephone number of every single person.

9
0:00:38.487,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And, in fact, everybody's listed twice,

10
0:00:40.67,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.

11
0:00:45.228,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Obviously a very small community.

12
0:00:48.129,000 --> 0:00:51,000
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.

13
0:00:51.56,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I knew them both.

14
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We didn't all know each other,

15
0:00:54.916,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but we all kind of trusted each other,

16
0:00:58.029,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and that basic feeling of trust

17
0:01:01.827,000 --> 0:01:03,000
permeated the whole network,

18
0:01:04.414,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and there was a real sense that

19
0:01:06.771,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we could depend on each other to do things.

20
0:01:09.777,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community,

21
0:01:13.352,000 --> 0:01:14,000
let me tell you what it was like

22
0:01:14.977,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to register a domain name in the early days.

23
0:01:19.082,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, it just so happened that I got to register

24
0:01:21.712,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the third domain name on the Internet.

25
0:01:24.172,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So I could have anything I wanted

26
0:01:25.82,000 --> 0:01:29,000
other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.

27
0:01:30.265,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So I picked think.com, but then I thought,

28
0:01:33.679,000 --> 0:01:35,000
you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.

29
0:01:36.665,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case.

30
0:01:40.874,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."

31
0:01:44.158,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:49.853,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That attitude of only taking what you need

33
0:01:53.482,000 --> 0:01:57,000
was really what everybody had on the network in those days,

34
0:01:57.526,000 --> 0:02:,000
and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network,

35
0:02:00.823,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but it was actually kind of built into the protocols

36
0:02:03.543,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of the Internet itself.

37
0:02:05.487,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol,

38
0:02:09.346,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it,

39
0:02:13.075,000 --> 0:02:17,000
were fundamentally "from each according to their ability,

40
0:02:17.204,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to each according to their need."

41
0:02:19.322,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And so, if you had some extra bandwidth,

42
0:02:22.335,000 --> 0:02:23,000
you'd deliver a message for someone.

43
0:02:23.778,000 --> 0:02:25,000
If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.

44
0:02:26.771,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You'd kind of depend on people to do that,

45
0:02:28.785,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and that was the building block.

46
0:02:31.449,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle

47
0:02:34.076,000 --> 0:02:36,000
was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War

48
0:02:36.512,000 --> 0:02:38,000
by the Defense Department,

49
0:02:38.943,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but it obviously worked really well,

50
0:02:42.013,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and we all saw what happened with the Internet.

51
0:02:45.456,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It was incredibly successful.

52
0:02:47.728,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In fact, it was so successful that there's no way

53
0:02:51.025,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that these days you could make a book like this.

54
0:02:54.613,000 --> 0:03:,000
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.

55
0:03:00.779,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But, of course, you couldn't do it,

56
0:03:01.953,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because we don't know the names of all the people

57
0:03:03.743,000 --> 0:03:06,000
with Internet or email addresses,

58
0:03:06.817,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and even if we did know their names,

59
0:03:08.349,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name,

60
0:03:10.782,000 --> 0:03:14,000
address and telephone number published to everyone.

61
0:03:15.078,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days,

62
0:03:18.78,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and so we dealt with that by making

63
0:03:22.951,000 --> 0:03:23,000
walled communities,

64
0:03:24.85,000 --> 0:03:28,000
secure subnetworks, VPNs,

65
0:03:29.587,000 --> 0:03:3,000
little things that aren't really the Internet

66
0:03:31.183,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but are made out of the same building blocks,

67
0:03:33.154,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but we're still basically building it out of those

68
0:03:35.394,000 --> 0:03:39,000
same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.

69
0:03:39.661,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And that means that it's vulnerable

70
0:03:42.383,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen,

71
0:03:44.779,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or certain kinds of deliberate attacks,

72
0:03:46.64,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but even the mistakes can be bad.

73
0:03:49.745,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So, for instance,

74
0:03:52.694,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in all of Asia recently,

75
0:03:54.647,000 --> 0:03:57,000
it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while

76
0:03:58.08,000 --> 0:04:,000
because Pakistan made some mistakes

77
0:04:00.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.

78
0:04:04.095,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did

79
0:04:07.189,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because of the way that the protocols work.

80
0:04:10.093,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is,

81
0:04:13.317,000 --> 0:04:15,000
you may remember a couple of years ago,

82
0:04:15.908,000 --> 0:04:17,000
all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded

83
0:04:18.721,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because a single routing card in Salt Lake City

84
0:04:21.613,000 --> 0:04:23,000
had a bug in it.

85
0:04:23.975,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, you don't really think

86
0:04:26.248,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that our airplane system depends on the Internet,

87
0:04:29.274,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and in some sense it doesn't.

88
0:04:30.28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'll come back to that later.

89
0:04:31.896,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But the fact is that people couldn't take off

90
0:04:34.146,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because something was going wrong on the Internet,

91
0:04:36.421,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and the router card was down.

92
0:04:38.996,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And so, there are many of those things that start to happen.

93
0:04:42.775,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.

94
0:04:45.914,000 --> 0:04:46,000
All of a sudden,

95
0:04:47.44,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet,

96
0:04:50.772,000 --> 0:04:54,000
including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations,

97
0:04:54.903,000 --> 0:04:56,000
started getting re-routed through China.

98
0:04:57.671,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So for a few hours, it all passed through China.

99
0:05:00.393,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake,

100
0:05:04.967,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work,

101
0:05:08.824,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but certainly somebody could make

102
0:05:10.859,000 --> 0:05:13,000
a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to,

103
0:05:14.132,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.

104
0:05:17.49,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.

105
0:05:22.411,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States

106
0:05:25.809,000 --> 0:05:27,000
or Western civilization these days,

107
0:05:27.901,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they're not going to do it with tanks.

108
0:05:30.09,000 --> 0:05:32,000
That will not succeed.

109
0:05:32.503,000 --> 0:05:34,000
What they'll probably do is something

110
0:05:34.506,000 --> 0:05:37,000
very much like the attack that happened

111
0:05:37.797,000 --> 0:05:39,000
on the Iranian nuclear facility.

112
0:05:40.504,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Nobody has claimed credit for that.

113
0:05:42.778,000 --> 0:05:45,000
There was basically a factory of industrial machines.

114
0:05:46.285,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.

115
0:05:48.862,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet,

116
0:05:51.449,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but it was possible for somebody to smuggle

117
0:05:53.396,000 --> 0:05:55,000
a USB drive in there, or something like that,

118
0:05:55.928,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and software got in there that causes the centrifuges,

119
0:05:59.324,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in that case, to actually destroy themselves.

120
0:06:02.317,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery

121
0:06:04.983,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.

122
0:06:09.405,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And so there's a lot of -- I'm sure you've read a lot in papers,

123
0:06:12.671,000 --> 0:06:14,000
about worries about cyberattacks

124
0:06:14.862,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and defenses against those.

125
0:06:17.472,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But the fact is, people are mostly focused on

126
0:06:19.452,000 --> 0:06:21,000
defending the computers on the Internet,

127
0:06:21.735,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and there's been surprisingly little attention

128
0:06:24.121,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.

129
0:06:28.486,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I think we probably do need to pay

130
0:06:30.349,000 --> 0:06:33,000
some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.

131
0:06:33.437,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So actually, in the early days,

132
0:06:36.364,000 --> 0:06:37,000
back when it was the ARPANET,

133
0:06:38.088,000 --> 0:06:41,000
there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely

134
0:06:41.677,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because one single message processor

135
0:06:44.962,000 --> 0:06:46,000
actually got a bug in it.

136
0:06:47.438,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And the way the Internet works is

137
0:06:49.71,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the routers are basically exchanging information

138
0:06:53.277,000 --> 0:06:55,000
about how they can get messages to places,

139
0:06:55.867,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and this one processor, because of a broken card,

140
0:06:59.765,000 --> 0:07:01,000
decided it could actually get a message

141
0:07:01.774,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to some place in negative time.

142
0:07:04.462,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.

143
0:07:08.445,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere

144
0:07:11.595,000 --> 0:07:12,000
was to send it to this guy,

145
0:07:13.471,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who would send it back in time and get it there super early,

146
0:07:17.018,000 --> 0:07:19,000
so every message in the Internet

147
0:07:19.874,000 --> 0:07:22,000
started getting switched through this one node,

148
0:07:23.116,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and of course that clogged everything up.

149
0:07:24.632,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Everything started breaking.

150
0:07:26.787,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The interesting thing was, though,

151
0:07:28.827,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that the sysadmins were able to fix it,

152
0:07:30.667,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.

153
0:07:35.449,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now, of course you couldn't do that today.

154
0:07:36.847,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I mean, everything off, it's like

155
0:07:39.241,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the service call you get from the cable company,

156
0:07:41.473,000 --> 0:07:44,000
except for the whole world.

157
0:07:45.234,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.

158
0:07:47.293,000 --> 0:07:49,000
One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones

159
0:07:49.915,000 --> 0:07:51,000
use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on

160
0:07:52.884,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that go through the Internet right now,

161
0:07:54.953,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it

162
0:07:58.235,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for more and more different things,

163
0:08:00.027,000 --> 0:08:02,000
like when you take off from LAX,

164
0:08:02.965,000 --> 0:08:03,000
you're really not thinking you're using the Internet.

165
0:08:04.846,000 --> 0:08:08,000
When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.

166
0:08:08.962,000 --> 0:08:1,000
What's happening increasingly, though, is these systems

167
0:08:11.087,000 --> 0:08:12,000
are beginning to use the Internet.

168
0:08:12.954,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet,

169
0:08:16.004,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions,

170
0:08:18.54,000 --> 0:08:19,000
for administrative functions,

171
0:08:20.445,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and so if you take something like the cell phone system,

172
0:08:23.508,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part,

173
0:08:27.828,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it

174
0:08:30.787,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in terms of some of the control and administrative functions,

175
0:08:34.591,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks

176
0:08:36.921,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because they work so well, they're cheap,

177
0:08:39.185,000 --> 0:08:4,000
they're repeated, and so on.

178
0:08:40.285,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So all of our systems, more and more,

179
0:08:43.057,000 --> 0:08:44,000
are starting to use the same technology

180
0:08:44.837,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and starting to depend on this technology.

181
0:08:46.904,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And so even a modern rocket ship these days

182
0:08:49.329,000 --> 0:08:51,000
actually uses Internet protocol to talk

183
0:08:52.055,000 --> 0:08:53,000
from one end of the rocket ship to the other.

184
0:08:53.871,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.

185
0:08:57.057,000 --> 0:09:,000
So we've built this system

186
0:09:00.174,000 --> 0:09:03,000
where we understand all the parts of it,

187
0:09:03.284,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it,

188
0:09:06.982,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and it's gotten a very, very different scale

189
0:09:09.421,000 --> 0:09:11,000
than it was designed for.

190
0:09:11.592,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And in fact, nobody really exactly understands

191
0:09:14.268,000 --> 0:09:16,000
all the things it's being used for right now.

192
0:09:16.531,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's turning into one of these big emergent systems

193
0:09:19.034,000 --> 0:09:22,000
like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts

194
0:09:22.515,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but nobody really exactly understands

195
0:09:25.121,000 --> 0:09:28,000
how it operates and all the little details of it

196
0:09:28.348,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.

197
0:09:31.067,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet

198
0:09:34.2,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that,

199
0:09:36.895,000 --> 0:09:38,000
you should treat it with the same skepticism

200
0:09:39.356,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy

201
0:09:43.771,000 --> 0:09:45,000
or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.

202
0:09:46.038,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They have an informed opinion,

203
0:09:48.686,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but it's changing so quickly that even the experts

204
0:09:51.227,000 --> 0:09:52,000
don't know exactly what's going on.

205
0:09:53.045,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet,

206
0:09:55.737,000 --> 0:09:56,000
it's just somebody's guess.

207
0:09:57.403,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now

208
0:09:59.601,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because it's different than it was an hour ago.

209
0:10:02.342,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.

210
0:10:05.143,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And the problem with it is,

211
0:10:06.657,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster

212
0:10:09.998,000 --> 0:10:11,000
like the disaster we had in the financial system,

213
0:10:12.793,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where we take a system that's basically built on trust,

214
0:10:18.137,000 --> 0:10:2,000
was basically built for a smaller-scale system,

215
0:10:20.758,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits

216
0:10:23.667,000 --> 0:10:24,000
of how it was meant to operate.

217
0:10:25.663,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And so right now, I think it's literally true

218
0:10:28.931,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that we don't know what the consequences

219
0:10:32.436,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of an effective denial-of-service attack

220
0:10:34.87,000 --> 0:10:35,000
on the Internet would be,

221
0:10:36.643,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year,

222
0:10:38.517,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and worse next year, and so on.

223
0:10:39.925,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But so what we need is a plan B.

224
0:10:42.474,000 --> 0:10:43,000
There is no plan B right now.

225
0:10:44.106,000 --> 0:10:47,000
There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept

226
0:10:47.609,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to be independent of the Internet,

227
0:10:49.555,000 --> 0:10:52,000
made out of completely different sets of building blocks.

228
0:10:52.621,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily

229
0:10:55.634,000 --> 0:10:57,000
have to have the performance of the Internet,

230
0:10:58.368,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but the police department has to be able

231
0:10:59.885,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to call up the fire department even without the Internet,

232
0:11:02.408,000 --> 0:11:04,000
or the hospitals have to order fuel oil.

233
0:11:04.973,000 --> 0:11:08,000
This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.

234
0:11:09.587,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's actually relatively simple to do, technically,

235
0:11:12.335,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground,

236
0:11:16.137,000 --> 0:11:17,000
existing wireless infrastructure.

237
0:11:18.096,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It's basically a matter of deciding to do it.

238
0:11:20.861,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But people won't decide to do it

239
0:11:23.345,000 --> 0:11:25,000
until they recognize the need for it,

240
0:11:25.724,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and that's the problem that we have right now.

241
0:11:27.222,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So there's been plenty of people,

242
0:11:30.005,000 --> 0:11:33,000
plenty of us have been quietly arguing

243
0:11:33.049,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that we should have this independent system for years,

244
0:11:35.967,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B

245
0:11:38.976,000 --> 0:11:41,000
when plan A seems to be working so well.

246
0:11:42.65,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So I think that, if people understand

247
0:11:46.079,000 --> 0:11:49,000
how much we're starting to depend on the Internet,

248
0:11:49.133,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and how vulnerable it is,

249
0:11:51.11,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we could get focused on

250
0:11:53.216,000 --> 0:11:56,000
just wanting this other system to exist,

251
0:11:56.24,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it,

252
0:11:59.317,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.

253
0:12:02.327,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It's not that hard a problem.

254
0:12:03.75,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It could definitely be done by people in this room.

255
0:12:06.985,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And so I think that this is actually,

256
0:12:11.344,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference,

257
0:12:14.523,000 --> 0:12:16,000
this is probably one of the very easiest to fix.

258
0:12:17.201,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it.

259
0:12:19.968,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Thank you very much.

260
0:12:22.579,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

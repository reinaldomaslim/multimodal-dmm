2
0:00:14.966,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to talk a little bit about where technology's going.

3
0:00:19.509,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And often technology comes to us,

4
0:00:22.566,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we're surprised by what it brings.

5
0:00:24.455,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But there's actually a large aspect of technology

6
0:00:28.162,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that's much more predictable,

7
0:00:29.988,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and that's because technological systems of all sorts have leanings,

8
0:00:34.1,000 --> 0:00:35,000
they have urgencies,

9
0:00:35.299,000 --> 0:00:36,000
they have tendencies.

10
0:00:36.884,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And those tendencies are derived from the very nature of the physics,

11
0:00:41.84,000 --> 0:00:44,000
chemistry of wires and switches and electrons,

12
0:00:45.659,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and they will make reoccurring patterns again and again.

13
0:00:49.745,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And so those patterns produce these tendencies, these leanings.

14
0:00:54.643,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You can almost think of it as sort of like gravity.

15
0:00:57.498,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.

16
0:00:59.841,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The actual path of a raindrop as it goes down the valley

17
0:01:02.953,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is unpredictable.

18
0:01:04.651,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We cannot see where it's going,

19
0:01:06.193,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but the general direction is very inevitable:

20
0:01:08.494,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it's downward.

21
0:01:10.377,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And so these baked-in tendencies and urgencies

22
0:01:14.973,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in technological systems

23
0:01:17.051,000 --> 0:01:2,000
give us a sense of where things are going at the large form.

24
0:01:21.149,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So in a large sense,

25
0:01:22.574,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I would say that telephones were inevitable,

26
0:01:27.005,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but the iPhone was not.

27
0:01:29.094,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The Internet was inevitable,

28
0:01:31.274,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but Twitter was not.

29
0:01:33.036,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So we have many ongoing tendencies right now,

30
0:01:36.988,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and I think one of the chief among them

31
0:01:39.732,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is this tendency to make things smarter and smarter.

32
0:01:44.041,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I call it cognifying -- cognification --

33
0:01:46.783,000 --> 0:01:48,000
also known as artificial intelligence, or AI.

34
0:01:50.025,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And I think that's going to be one of the most influential developments

35
0:01:53.795,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and trends and directions and drives in our society in the next 20 years.

36
0:02:00.021,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So, of course, it's already here.

37
0:02:02.03,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We already have AI,

38
0:02:04.258,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and often it works in the background,

39
0:02:06.68,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in the back offices of hospitals,

40
0:02:08.29,000 --> 0:02:12,000
where it's used to diagnose X-rays better than a human doctor.

41
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's in legal offices,

42
0:02:14.75,000 --> 0:02:16,000
where it's used to go through legal evidence

43
0:02:17.142,000 --> 0:02:18,000
better than a human paralawyer.

44
0:02:19.506,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It's used to fly the plane that you came here with.

45
0:02:24.165,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Human pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes,

46
0:02:26.57,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the rest of the time the AI was driving.

47
0:02:28.547,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,

48
0:02:30.744,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it's in the background, making those recommendations.

49
0:02:33.298,000 --> 0:02:34,000
That's what we have today.

50
0:02:34.583,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And we have an example, of course, in a more front-facing aspect of it,

51
0:02:39.408,000 --> 0:02:45,000
with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat the world's greatest Go champion.

52
0:02:46.478,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But it's more than that.

53
0:02:50.555,000 --> 0:02:52,000
If you play a video game, you're playing against an AI.

54
0:02:53.221,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But recently, Google taught their AI

55
0:02:57.783,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to actually learn how to play video games.

56
0:03:00.686,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Again, teaching video games was already done,

57
0:03:03.419,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but learning how to play a video game is another step.

58
0:03:07.34,000 --> 0:03:08,000
That's artificial smartness.

59
0:03:10.571,000 --> 0:03:14,000
What we're doing is taking this artificial smartness

60
0:03:15.117,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we're making it smarter and smarter.

61
0:03:18.71,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There are three aspects to this general trend

62
0:03:22.629,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that I think are underappreciated;

63
0:03:24.342,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I think we would understand AI a lot better

64
0:03:26.643,000 --> 0:03:28,000
if we understood these three things.

65
0:03:28.968,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I think these things also would help us embrace AI,

66
0:03:32.275,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because it's only by embracing it that we actually can steer it.

67
0:03:35.887,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We can actually steer the specifics by embracing the larger trend.

68
0:03:39.467,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So let me talk about those three different aspects.

69
0:03:42.47,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The first one is: our own intelligence has a very poor understanding

70
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of what intelligence is.

71
0:03:48.11,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We tend to think of intelligence as a single dimension,

72
0:03:51.787,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that it's kind of like a note that gets louder and louder.

73
0:03:54.561,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It starts like with IQ measurement.

74
0:03:57.192,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It starts with maybe a simple low IQ in a rat or mouse,

75
0:04:01.308,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,

76
0:04:03.887,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and then maybe there's more in a stupid person,

77
0:04:06.102,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and then maybe an average person like myself,

78
0:04:08.222,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and then maybe a genius.

79
0:04:09.536,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And this single IQ intelligence is getting greater and greater.

80
0:04:14.516,000 --> 0:04:15,000
That's completely wrong.

81
0:04:15.691,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That's not what intelligence is -- not what human intelligence is, anyway.

82
0:04:19.673,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's much more like a symphony of different notes,

83
0:04:24.203,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and each of these notes is played on a different instrument of cognition.

84
0:04:27.836,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There are many types of intelligences in our own minds.

85
0:04:31.561,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We have deductive reasoning,

86
0:04:34.633,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we have emotional intelligence,

87
0:04:36.878,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we have spatial intelligence;

88
0:04:38.295,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we have maybe 100 different types that are all grouped together,

89
0:04:42.34,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and they vary in different strengths with different people.

90
0:04:46.269,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And of course, if we go to animals, they also have another basket --

91
0:04:50.819,000 --> 0:04:52,000
another symphony of different kinds of intelligences,

92
0:04:53.384,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and sometimes those same instruments are the same that we have.

93
0:04:56.974,000 --> 0:04:59,000
They can think in the same way, but they may have a different arrangement,

94
0:05:00.559,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and maybe they're higher in some cases than humans,

95
0:05:03.05,000 --> 0:05:05,000
like long-term memory in a squirrel is actually phenomenal,

96
0:05:05.911,000 --> 0:05:07,000
so it can remember where it buried its nuts.

97
0:05:08.222,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But in other cases they may be lower.

98
0:05:10.233,000 --> 0:05:12,000
When we go to make machines,

99
0:05:12.987,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we're going to engineer them in the same way,

100
0:05:15.207,000 --> 0:05:2,000
where we'll make some of those types of smartness much greater than ours,

101
0:05:20.241,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and many of them won't be anywhere near ours,

102
0:05:22.836,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because they're not needed.

103
0:05:24.404,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So we're going to take these things,

104
0:05:26.631,000 --> 0:05:28,000
these artificial clusters,

105
0:05:28.736,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and we'll be adding more varieties of artificial cognition to our AIs.

106
0:05:34.507,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We're going to make them very, very specific.

107
0:05:38.602,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So your calculator is smarter than you are in arithmetic already;

108
0:05:45.168,000 --> 0:05:48,000
your GPS is smarter than you are in spatial navigation;

109
0:05:49.337,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Google, Bing, are smarter than you are in long-term memory.

110
0:05:54.339,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we're going to take, again, these kinds of different types of thinking

111
0:05:58.893,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and we'll put them into, like, a car.

112
0:06:00.85,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The reason why we want to put them in a car so the car drives,

113
0:06:03.931,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is because it's not driving like a human.

114
0:06:06.257,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's not thinking like us.

115
0:06:07.677,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That's the whole feature of it.

116
0:06:09.621,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's not being distracted,

117
0:06:11.18,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it's not worrying about whether it left the stove on,

118
0:06:13.958,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or whether it should have majored in finance.

119
0:06:16.12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's just driving.

120
0:06:17.297,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:18.463,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Just driving, OK?

122
0:06:20.328,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And we actually might even come to advertise these

123
0:06:23.289,000 --> 0:06:24,000
as "consciousness-free."

124
0:06:24.858,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They're without consciousness,

125
0:06:26.656,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they're not concerned about those things,

126
0:06:28.784,000 --> 0:06:29,000
they're not distracted.

127
0:06:29.964,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So in general, what we're trying to do

128
0:06:32.954,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is make as many different types of thinking as we can.

129
0:06:37.804,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We're going to populate the space

130
0:06:39.911,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of all the different possible types, or species, of thinking.

131
0:06:44.094,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And there actually may be some problems

132
0:06:46.186,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that are so difficult in business and science

133
0:06:49.01,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that our own type of human thinking may not be able to solve them alone.

134
0:06:53.076,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We may need a two-step program,

135
0:06:55.092,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which is to invent new kinds of thinking

136
0:06:59.692,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems,

137
0:07:03.45,000 --> 0:07:05,000
say, like dark energy or quantum gravity.

138
0:07:08.496,000 --> 0:07:1,000
What we're doing is making alien intelligences.

139
0:07:11.166,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You might even think of this as, sort of, artificial aliens

140
0:07:15.259,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in some senses.

141
0:07:16.49,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And they're going to help us think different,

142
0:07:18.814,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because thinking different is the engine of creation

143
0:07:22.47,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and wealth and new economy.

144
0:07:25.835,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The second aspect of this is that we are going to use AI

145
0:07:30.782,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to basically make a second Industrial Revolution.

146
0:07:34.135,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The first Industrial Revolution was based on the fact

147
0:07:36.932,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that we invented something I would call artificial power.

148
0:07:40.879,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Previous to that,

149
0:07:42.053,000 --> 0:07:44,000
during the Agricultural Revolution,

150
0:07:44.111,000 --> 0:07:47,000
everything that was made had to be made with human muscle

151
0:07:47.837,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or animal power.

152
0:07:49.565,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That was the only way to get anything done.

153
0:07:51.652,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The great innovation during the Industrial Revolution was,

154
0:07:54.621,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,

155
0:07:57.754,000 --> 0:08:,000
to make this artificial power that we could use

156
0:08:01.634,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to do anything we wanted to do.

157
0:08:03.327,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So today when you drive down the highway,

158
0:08:06.571,000 --> 0:08:1,000
you are, with a flick of the switch, commanding 250 horses --

159
0:08:11.12,000 --> 0:08:12,000
250 horsepower --

160
0:08:12.716,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which we can use to build skyscrapers, to build cities, to build roads,

161
0:08:17.432,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to make factories that would churn out lines of chairs or refrigerators

162
0:08:23.245,000 --> 0:08:24,000
way beyond our own power.

163
0:08:24.923,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And that artificial power can also be distributed on wires on a grid

164
0:08:31.058,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to every home, factory, farmstead,

165
0:08:34.281,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and anybody could buy that artificial power,

166
0:08:38.496,000 --> 0:08:39,000
just by plugging something in.

167
0:08:39.992,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So this was a source of innovation as well,

168
0:08:42.455,000 --> 0:08:45,000
because a farmer could take a manual hand pump,

169
0:08:45.897,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and they could add this artificial power, this electricity,

170
0:08:48.837,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and he'd have an electric pump.

171
0:08:50.358,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And you multiply that by thousands or tens of thousands of times,

172
0:08:53.7,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and that formula was what brought us the Industrial Revolution.

173
0:08:56.883,000 --> 0:08:59,000
All the things that we see, all this progress that we now enjoy,

174
0:09:00.492,000 --> 0:09:02,000
has come from the fact that we've done that.

175
0:09:02.579,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We're going to do the same thing now with AI.

176
0:09:04.951,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We're going to distribute that on a grid,

177
0:09:07.05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and now you can take that electric pump.

178
0:09:09.448,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You can add some artificial intelligence,

179
0:09:12.44,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and now you have a smart pump.

180
0:09:13.945,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And that, multiplied by a million times,

181
0:09:15.897,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is going to be this second Industrial Revolution.

182
0:09:18.284,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So now the car is going down the highway,

183
0:09:20.69,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it's 250 horsepower, but in addition, it's 250 minds.

184
0:09:25.008,000 --> 0:09:26,000
That's the auto-driven car.

185
0:09:26.801,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's like a new commodity;

186
0:09:28.214,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it's a new utility.

187
0:09:29.541,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The AI is going to flow across the grid -- the cloud --

188
0:09:32.606,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in the same way electricity did.

189
0:09:34.197,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So everything that we had electrified,

190
0:09:36.601,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we're now going to cognify.

191
0:09:38.693,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And I would suggest, then,

192
0:09:40.102,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that the formula for the next 10,000 start-ups

193
0:09:43.858,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is very, very simple,

194
0:09:45.044,000 --> 0:09:48,000
which is to take x and add AI.

195
0:09:49.1,000 --> 0:09:51,000
That is the formula, that's what we're going to be doing.

196
0:09:51.936,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And that is the way in which we're going to make

197
0:09:55.266,000 --> 0:09:56,000
this second Industrial Revolution.

198
0:09:57.148,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And by the way -- right now, this minute,

199
0:09:59.326,000 --> 0:10:,000
you can log on to Google

200
0:10:00.519,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and you can purchase AI for six cents, 100 hits.

201
0:10:04.758,000 --> 0:10:05,000
That's available right now.

202
0:10:06.386,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So the third aspect of this

203
0:10:09.315,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is that when we take this AI and embody it,

204
0:10:12.017,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we get robots.

205
0:10:13.214,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And robots are going to be bots,

206
0:10:14.941,000 --> 0:10:17,000
they're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done.

207
0:10:20.357,000 --> 0:10:21,000
A job is just a bunch of tasks,

208
0:10:21.909,000 --> 0:10:22,000
so they're going to redefine our jobs

209
0:10:23.695,000 --> 0:10:25,000
because they're going to do some of those tasks.

210
0:10:25.978,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But they're also going to create whole new categories,

211
0:10:29.199,000 --> 0:10:31,000
a whole new slew of tasks

212
0:10:31.47,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that we didn't know we wanted to do before.

213
0:10:33.951,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They're going to actually engender new kinds of jobs,

214
0:10:37.612,000 --> 0:10:39,000
new kinds of tasks that we want done,

215
0:10:39.907,000 --> 0:10:42,000
just as automation made up a whole bunch of new things

216
0:10:43.336,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that we didn't know we needed before,

217
0:10:45.194,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and now we can't live without them.

218
0:10:47.174,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So they're going to produce even more jobs than they take away,

219
0:10:51.154,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but it's important that a lot of the tasks that we're going to give them

220
0:10:54.612,000 --> 0:10:58,000
are tasks that can be defined in terms of efficiency or productivity.

221
0:10:59.676,000 --> 0:11:,000
If you can specify a task,

222
0:11:01.528,000 --> 0:11:03,000
either manual or conceptual,

223
0:11:03.787,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that can be specified in terms of efficiency or productivity,

224
0:11:08.591,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that goes to the bots.

225
0:11:10.758,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Productivity is for robots.

226
0:11:12.96,000 --> 0:11:15,000
What we're really good at is basically wasting time.

227
0:11:16.054,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

228
0:11:17.106,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We're really good at things that are inefficient.

229
0:11:19.446,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Science is inherently inefficient.

230
0:11:22.816,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It runs on that fact that you have one failure after another.

231
0:11:25.746,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It runs on the fact that you make tests and experiments that don't work,

232
0:11:29.194,000 --> 0:11:3,000
otherwise you're not learning.

233
0:11:30.66,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It runs on the fact

234
0:11:31.846,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that there is not a lot of efficiency in it.

235
0:11:33.953,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Innovation by definition is inefficient,

236
0:11:36.756,000 --> 0:11:37,000
because you make prototypes,

237
0:11:38.171,000 --> 0:11:4,000
because you try stuff that fails, that doesn't work.

238
0:11:40.902,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Exploration is inherently inefficiency.

239
0:11:44.038,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Art is not efficient.

240
0:11:45.593,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Human relationships are not efficient.

241
0:11:47.744,000 --> 0:11:49,000
These are all the kinds of things we're going to gravitate to,

242
0:11:50.708,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because they're not efficient.

243
0:11:52.207,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Efficiency is for robots.

244
0:11:55.338,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We're also going to learn that we're going to work with these AIs

245
0:11:59.485,000 --> 0:12:,000
because they think differently than us.

246
0:12:02.005,000 --> 0:12:06,000
When Deep Blue beat the world's best chess champion,

247
0:12:06.343,000 --> 0:12:07,000
people thought it was the end of chess.

248
0:12:08.296,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But actually, it turns out that today, the best chess champion in the world

249
0:12:12.722,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is not an AI.

250
0:12:14.906,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And it's not a human.

251
0:12:16.111,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's the team of a human and an AI.

252
0:12:18.85,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The best medical diagnostician is not a doctor, it's not an AI,

253
0:12:22.874,000 --> 0:12:23,000
it's the team.

254
0:12:24.074,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We're going to be working with these AIs,

255
0:12:26.247,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and I think you'll be paid in the future

256
0:12:28.266,000 --> 0:12:3,000
by how well you work with these bots.

257
0:12:31.026,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So that's the third thing, is that they're different,

258
0:12:35.307,000 --> 0:12:36,000
they're utility

259
0:12:36.496,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and they are going to be something we work with rather than against.

260
0:12:40.336,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We're working with these rather than against them.

261
0:12:42.999,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So, the future:

262
0:12:44.5,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Where does that take us?

263
0:12:45.944,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I think that 25 years from now, they'll look back

264
0:12:49.535,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and look at our understanding of AI and say,

265
0:12:52.684,000 --> 0:12:55,000
"You didn't have AI. In fact, you didn't even have the Internet yet,

266
0:12:56.008,000 --> 0:12:58,000
compared to what we're going to have 25 years from now."

267
0:12:59.849,000 --> 0:13:02,000
There are no AI experts right now.

268
0:13:02.92,000 --> 0:13:03,000
There's a lot of money going to it,

269
0:13:04.643,000 --> 0:13:06,000
there are billions of dollars being spent on it;

270
0:13:06.935,000 --> 0:13:08,000
it's a huge business,

271
0:13:09.123,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but there are no experts, compared to what we'll know 20 years from now.

272
0:13:14.064,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So we are just at the beginning of the beginning,

273
0:13:16.973,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we're in the first hour of all this.

274
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We're in the first hour of the Internet.

275
0:13:21.119,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We're in the first hour of what's coming.

276
0:13:23.183,000 --> 0:13:27,000
The most popular AI product in 20 years from now,

277
0:13:27.36,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that everybody uses,

278
0:13:29.499,000 --> 0:13:3,000
has not been invented yet.

279
0:13:32.464,000 --> 0:13:34,000
That means that you're not late.

280
0:13:35.684,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Thank you.

281
0:13:36.859,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Laughter)

282
0:13:37.909,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Applause)

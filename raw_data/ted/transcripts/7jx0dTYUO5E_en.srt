1
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Alright.

2
0:00:23.676,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm going to show you a couple of images

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.

4
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper

5
0:00:37.03,000 --> 0:00:39,000
ever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.

6
0:00:39.73,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The title is "Observations of In-Utero Masturbation."

7
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Okay. Now on the left you can see the hand -- that's the big arrow --

9
0:00:51.63,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the penis on the right. The hand hovering.

10
0:00:54.876,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And over here we have,

11
0:00:56.86,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in the words of radiologist Israel Meisner,

12
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements."

13
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Bear in mind this was an ultrasound,

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so it would have been moving images.

15
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system.

16
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, this is the part of the nervous system

17
0:01:13.354,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that deals with the things that we don't consciously control,

18
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
like digestion, heart rate and sexual arousal.

19
0:01:20.639,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input.

20
0:01:26.81,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Genital stimulation. Duh.

21
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman

22
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow.

23
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
People with spinal cord injuries,

24
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
like paraplegias, quadriplegias,

25
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
will often develop a very, very sensitive area

26
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
right above the level of their injury,

27
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
wherever that is.

28
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature.

29
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I think the most curious one that I came across

30
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
was a case report of a woman

31
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth.

32
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Something in the complex sensory-motor action of brushing her teeth

34
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was triggering orgasm.

35
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And she went to a neurologist, who was fascinated.

36
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste,

37
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but no -- it happened with any brand.

38
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They stimulated her gums with a toothpick, to see if that was doing it.

39
0:02:26.497,000 --> 0:02:29,000
No. It was the whole, you know, motion.

40
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And the amazing thing to me

41
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene.

42
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Sadly -- this is what it said in the journal paper --

44
0:02:44.069,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"She believed that she was possessed by demons

45
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and switched to mouthwash for her oral care."

46
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's so sad.

47
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:52.431,000 --> 0:02:54,000
When I was working on the book,

49
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm.

50
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
She was part of a study at Rutgers University.

51
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You've got to love that. Rutgers.

52
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So I interviewed her in Oakland, in a sushi restaurant.

53
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I said, "So, could you do it right here?"

54
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And she said,

55
0:03:13.53,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"Yeah, but you know I'd rather finish my meal if you don't mind."

56
0:03:16.669,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:17.73,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But afterwards, she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside.

58
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It was remarkable. It took about one minute.

59
0:03:23.45,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And I said to her,

60
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
"Are you just doing this all the time?"

61
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:30.431,000 --> 0:03:34,000
She said, "No. Honestly, when I get home, I'm usually too tired."

63
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
She said that the last time she had done it

65
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
was on the Disneyland tram.

66
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The headquarters for orgasm, along the spinal nerve,

68
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is something called the sacral nerve root,

69
0:03:53.089,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which is back here.

70
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode,

71
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
the precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm.

72
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people --

73
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a certain kind of dead person, a beating-heart cadaver.

74
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now this is somebody who is brain-dead,

75
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
legally dead, definitely checked out,

76
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but is being kept alive on a respirator,

77
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation.

78
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now in one of these brain-dead people,

79
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
if you trigger the right spot,

80
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you will see something every now and then.

81
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex.

82
0:04:30.402,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And this is -- I'll demonstrate as best I can, not being dead.

83
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's like this. You trigger the spot.

84
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.

85
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs.

86
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:47.431,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now, if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,

88
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
why not the orgasm reflex?

89
0:04:55.615,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I asked this question to a brain death expert,

90
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to return my emails.

91
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:03.431,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I said, "So, could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person?"

93
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
She said, "Yes, if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated,

94
0:05:11.021,000 --> 0:05:14,000
you conceivably could."

95
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person.

96
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But it would be an orgasm --

97
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:21.431,000 --> 0:05:22,000
nonetheless.

99
0:05:22.911,000 --> 0:05:26,000
There is a researcher at the University of Alabama

100
0:05:27.021,000 --> 0:05:28,000
who does orgasm research.

101
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I said to her, "You should do an experiment.

102
0:05:30.45,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You know? You can get cadavers if you work at a university."

103
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I said, "You should actually do this."

104
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
She said, "You get the human subjects review board approval for this one."

105
0:05:38.832,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:40.719,000 --> 0:05:42,000
According to 1930s marriage manual author,

107
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Theodoor van De Velde,

108
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman

109
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
within about an hour after sexual intercourse.

110
0:05:53.647,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur.

111
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This is a guy writing a book, "Ideal Marriage," you know.

113
0:06:02.021,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Very heavy hetero guy.

114
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But he wrote in this book, "Ideal Marriage" --

115
0:06:06.497,000 --> 0:06:09,000
he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man,

116
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
which he said had a fresh, exhilarating smell,

117
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and the semen of mature men, whose semen smelled, quote,

118
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut.

119
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Sometimes quite freshly floral,

120
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and then again sometimes extremely pungent."

121
0:06:25.402,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel, a man began hiccupping.

123
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And this was one of those cases that went on and on.

124
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
He tried everything his friends suggested.

125
0:06:40.354,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Nothing seemed to help.

126
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Days went by.

127
0:06:43.776,000 --> 0:06:47,000
At a certain point, the man, still hiccupping, had sex with his wife.

128
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.

129
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
He told his doctor, who published a case report

130
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in a Canadian medical journal under the title,

131
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups."

132
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I love this article because at a certain point they suggested

133
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation.

134
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:10.431,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I love that because there is like a whole demographic: unattached hiccuppers.

136
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Married, single, unattached hiccupper.

138
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
In the 1900s, early 1900s,

139
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm,

140
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix

141
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg,

142
0:07:37.64,000 --> 0:07:39,000
thereby upping the odds of conception.

143
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It was called the "upsuck" theory.

144
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:45.353,000 --> 0:07:48,000
If you go all the way back to Hippocrates,

146
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
physicians believed that orgasm in women

147
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
was not just helpful for conception, but necessary.

148
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Doctors back then were routinely telling men

149
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the importance of pleasuring their wives.

150
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer Theodoor van De Velde --

151
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:08.431,000 --> 0:08:1,000
has a line in his book.

153
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I loved this guy.

154
0:08:12.418,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde.

155
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
He had this line in his book

156
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy,

157
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where there was an empress Maria Theresa,

158
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
who was having trouble conceiving.

159
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And apparently the royal court physician said to her,

160
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty

161
0:08:32.354,000 --> 0:08:34,000
be titillated for some time prior to intercourse."

162
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:36.431,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It's apparently, I don't know, on the record somewhere.

164
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Masters and Johnson:

165
0:08:42.192,000 --> 0:08:44,000
now we're moving forward to the 1950s.

166
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,

167
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which is also really fun to say.

168
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They didn't buy it.

169
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And they decided, being Masters and Johnson,

170
0:08:54.43,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that they would get to the bottom of it.

171
0:08:56.43,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They brought women into the lab -- I think it was five women --

172
0:08:59.43,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen.

173
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And in the artificial semen was a radio-opaque substance,

174
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
such that it would show up on an X-ray.

175
0:09:12.933,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is the 1950s.

176
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Anyway, these women sat in front of an X-ray device.

177
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And they masturbated.

178
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up.

179
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Did not find any evidence of upsuck.

180
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You may be wondering, "How do you make artificial semen?"

181
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I have an answer for you. I have two answers.

183
0:09:37.45,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You can use flour and water, or cornstarch and water.

184
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I actually found three separate recipes in the literature.

185
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:45.431,000 --> 0:09:46,000
My favorite being the one that says --

187
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
you know, they have the ingredients listed,

188
0:09:49.431,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and then in a recipe it will say, for example,

189
0:09:51.646,000 --> 0:09:52,000
"Yield: two dozen cupcakes."

190
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
This one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."

191
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
There's another way that orgasm might boost fertility.

193
0:10:01.878,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This one involves men.

194
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more

195
0:10:05.783,000 --> 0:10:07,000
start to develop abnormalities

196
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that make them less effective at head-banging their way into the egg.

197
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
British sexologist Roy Levin has speculated

198
0:10:15.794,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that this is perhaps why men

199
0:10:17.353,000 --> 0:10:19,000
evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators.

200
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He said, "If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made."

201
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Which I thought was an interesting idea, theory.

202
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So now you have an evolutionary excuse.

203
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

204
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Okay.

205
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
All righty. There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom --

207
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
pigs, for instance.

208
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
In Denmark, the Danish National Committee for Pig Production

209
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow

210
0:10:55.307,000 --> 0:10:56,000
while you artificially inseminate her,

211
0:10:57.185,000 --> 0:10:59,000
you will see a six-percent increase in the farrowing rate,

212
0:11:00.03,000 --> 0:11:02,000
which is the number of piglets produced.

213
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So they came up with this five-point stimulation plan for the sows.

214
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
There is posters they put in the barn, and they have a DVD.

215
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I got a copy of this DVD.

216
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

217
0:11:15.431,000 --> 0:11:18,000
This is my unveiling, because I am going to show you a clip.

218
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Laughter)

219
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So, okay.

220
0:11:23.98,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now, here we go, la la la, off to work.

221
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It all looks very innocent.

222
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
He's going to be doing things with his hands

223
0:11:31.45,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that the boar would use his snout, lacking hands. Okay.

224
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Laughter)

225
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
This is it.

226
0:11:39.954,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The boar has a very odd courtship repertoire.

227
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

228
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
This is to mimic the weight of the boar.

229
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
You should know, the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina.

231
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So this may be sort of titillating for her.

232
0:11:57.629,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Here we go.

233
0:11:58.692,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Laughter)

234
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And the happy result.

235
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Applause)

236
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I love this video.

237
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
There is a point in this video, towards the beginning,

238
0:12:28.954,000 --> 0:12:31,000
where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring,

239
0:12:32.216,000 --> 0:12:34,000
as if to say, "It's okay, it's just his job.

240
0:12:34.337,000 --> 0:12:35,000
He really does like women."

241
0:12:35.73,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

242
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Okay. When I was in Denmark, my host was named Anne Marie.

243
0:12:44.81,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And I said, "So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig?

244
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Why don't you have the farmers do that?

245
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
That's not one of your five steps."

246
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I have to read you what she said, because I love it.

247
0:12:55.377,000 --> 0:12:56,000
She said, "It was a big hurdle

248
0:12:56.83,000 --> 0:12:58,000
just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva.

249
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So we thought, let's not mention the clitoris right now."

250
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

251
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however, can purchase a -- this is true --

252
0:13:10.783,000 --> 0:13:11,000
a sow vibrator,

253
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate.

254
0:13:14.693,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Because, as I mentioned, the clitoris is inside the vagina.

255
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks.

256
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I also said to her,

257
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
"Now, these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there.

258
0:13:26.831,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy."

259
0:13:29.43,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And she said, you can't make that conclusion,

260
0:13:31.597,000 --> 0:13:34,000
because animals don't register pain or pleasure

261
0:13:35.541,000 --> 0:13:37,000
on their faces in the same way that we do.

262
0:13:37.612,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Pigs, for example, are more like dogs.

263
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
They use the upper half of the face; the ears are very expressive.

264
0:13:43.45,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So you're not really sure what's going on with the pig.

265
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Primates, on the other hand, we use our mouths more.

266
0:13:50.818,000 --> 0:13:53,000
This is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque.

267
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Laughter)

268
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And, interestingly, this has been observed in female macaques,

269
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but only when mounting another female.

270
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter)

271
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Masters and Johnson.

272
0:14:08.617,000 --> 0:14:11,000
In the 1950s, they decided, okay, we're going to figure out

273
0:14:11.828,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the entire human sexual response cycle,

274
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
from arousal, all the way through orgasm, in men and women --

275
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
everything that happens in the human body.

276
0:14:19.354,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Okay, with women, a lot of this is happening inside.

277
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
This did not stop Masters and Johnson.

278
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They developed an artificial coition machine.

279
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This is basically a penis camera on a motor.

280
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
There is a phallus,

281
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
clear acrylic phallus, with a camera and a light source,

282
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
attached to a motor that is kind of going like this.

283
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And the woman would have sex with it.

284
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
That is what they would do. Pretty amazing.

285
0:14:45.354,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Sadly, this device has been dismantled.

286
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This just kills me, not because I wanted to use it --

287
0:14:49.878,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I wanted to see it.

288
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Laughter)

289
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
One fine day,

290
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate

291
0:15:02.236,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen.

292
0:15:06.831,000 --> 0:15:07,000
This was not idle curiosity.

293
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Doctor Kinsey had heard --

294
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and there was a theory going around at the time, this being the 1940s --

295
0:15:15.83,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix

296
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
was a factor in fertility.

297
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Kinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.

298
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
He got together in his lab

299
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
300 men, a measuring tape, and a movie camera.

300
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Laughter)

301
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And in fact, he found that in three quarters of the men

302
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the stuff just kind of slopped out.

303
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force.

304
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
However, the record holder

305
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
landed just shy of the eight-foot mark, which is impressive.

306
0:15:53.212,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Laughter)

307
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
(Applause)

308
0:15:55.431,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Yes. Exactly.

309
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Laughter)

310
0:15:58.431,000 --> 0:16:,000
Sadly, he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned.

311
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
(Laughter)

312
0:16:04.298,000 --> 0:16:07,000
In his write-up of this experiment in his book,

313
0:16:07.593,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Kinsey wrote,

314
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
"Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets."

315
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Laughter)

316
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.

My favorite being, "Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats

0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000

0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000

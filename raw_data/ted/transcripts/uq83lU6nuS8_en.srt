1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm going to talk to you tonight

2
0:00:14.348,000 --> 0:00:15,000
about coming out of the closet,

3
0:00:16.044,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and not in the traditional sense,

4
0:00:17.256,000 --> 0:00:19,000
not just the gay closet.

5
0:00:19.568,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I think we all have closets.

6
0:00:21.622,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Your closet may be telling someone

7
0:00:23.514,000 --> 0:00:25,000
you love her for the first time,

8
0:00:25.736,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or telling someone that you're pregnant,

9
0:00:27.882,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or telling someone you have cancer,

10
0:00:30.414,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or any of the other hard conversations

11
0:00:32.445,000 --> 0:00:34,000
we have throughout our lives.

12
0:00:34.711,000 --> 0:00:37,000
All a closet is is a hard conversation,

13
0:00:38.381,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and although our topics may vary tremendously,

14
0:00:41.435,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the experience of being in

15
0:00:43.107,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and coming out of the closet is universal.

16
0:00:46.438,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.

17
0:00:52.03,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Several years ago,

18
0:00:53.399,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,

19
0:00:57.17,000 --> 0:00:59,000
a local diner in town,

20
0:00:59.241,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and during my time there I would go through phases

21
0:01:01.956,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of militant lesbian intensity:

22
0:01:05.521,000 --> 0:01:06,000
not shaving my armpits,

23
0:01:07.296,000 --> 0:01:1,000
quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.

24
0:01:10.845,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts

25
0:01:13.1,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and how recently I had shaved my head,

26
0:01:15.8,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the question would often be sprung on me,

27
0:01:17.327,000 --> 0:01:19,000
usually by a little kid:

28
0:01:19.41,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"

29
0:01:24.577,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And there would be an awkward silence at the table.

30
0:01:27.249,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I'd clench my jaw a little tighter,

31
0:01:29.672,000 --> 0:01:32,000
hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.

32
0:01:32.791,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper

33
0:01:35.628,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.

34
0:01:37.946,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But I would say nothing,

35
0:01:39.65,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I would seethe inside.

36
0:01:41.886,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And it got to the point where every time I walked up

37
0:01:43.534,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.

38
0:01:47.562,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:49.008,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And that is a terrible feeling.

40
0:01:51.256,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.

41
0:01:55.104,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I would have that hard conversation.

42
0:01:57.472,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.

43
0:02:00.023,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"

44
0:02:02.795,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Familiar silence, but this time I'm ready,

45
0:02:05.948,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I am about to go all Women's Studies 101

46
0:02:09.899,000 --> 0:02:11,000
on this table. (Laughter)

47
0:02:12.237,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I've got my Betty Friedan quotes.

48
0:02:14.737,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.

49
0:02:16.535,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I've even got this little bit from "Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.

50
0:02:19.833,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So I take a deep breath and I look down

51
0:02:23.428,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress,

52
0:02:27.807,000 --> 0:02:29,000
not a challenge to a feminist duel,

53
0:02:29.852,000 --> 0:02:31,000
just a kid with a question:

54
0:02:32.412,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"

55
0:02:34.783,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So I take another deep breath,

56
0:02:36.428,000 --> 0:02:37,000
squat down to next to her, and say,

57
0:02:37.795,000 --> 0:02:39,000
"Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.

58
0:02:39.917,000 --> 0:02:4,000
My hair is short like a boy's,

59
0:02:41.679,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,

60
0:02:43.711,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress,

61
0:02:45.678,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies?

62
0:02:48.334,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."

63
0:02:52.026,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And this kid looks me dead in the eye,

64
0:02:54.114,000 --> 0:02:55,000
without missing a beat, and says,

65
0:02:55.745,000 --> 0:02:56,000
"My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.

66
0:02:57.697,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Can I get a pancake, please?"

67
0:02:59.588,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:02.309,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And that was it. Just, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.

69
0:03:05.775,000 --> 0:03:07,000
How about that pancake?"

70
0:03:08.018,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It was the easiest hard conversation

71
0:03:10.5,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I have ever had.

72
0:03:12.892,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And why? Because Pancake Girl and I,

73
0:03:15.554,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we were both real with each other.

74
0:03:18.915,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So like many of us,

75
0:03:20.691,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,

76
0:03:23.028,000 --> 0:03:25,000
most often, my walls happened to be rainbow.

77
0:03:25.642,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But inside, in the dark,

78
0:03:27.666,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you can't tell what color the walls are.

79
0:03:29.834,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You just know what it feels like to live in a closet.

80
0:03:33.244,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So really, my closet is no different than yours

81
0:03:36.995,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or yours or yours.

82
0:03:39.82,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons

83
0:03:41.564,000 --> 0:03:43,000
why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours,

84
0:03:43.895,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but here's the thing: Hard is not relative.

85
0:03:46.097,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Hard is hard.

86
0:03:48.09,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy

87
0:03:52.233,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them?

88
0:03:54.472,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Who can tell me that his coming out story

89
0:03:57.059,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is harder than telling your five-year-old you're getting a divorce?

90
0:03:59.936,000 --> 0:04:02,000
There is no harder, there is just hard.

91
0:04:03.275,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard

92
0:04:06.813,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to make us feel better or worse about our closets

93
0:04:09.212,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and just commiserate on the fact that we all have hard.

94
0:04:13.275,000 --> 0:04:16,000
At some point in our lives, we all live in closets,

95
0:04:16.611,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and they may feel safe,

96
0:04:18.541,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door.

97
0:04:21.488,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But I am here to tell you,

98
0:04:23.253,000 --> 0:04:25,000
no matter what your walls are made of,

99
0:04:25.378,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a closet is no place for a person to live.

100
0:04:29.946,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Thanks. (Applause)

101
0:04:32.106,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So imagine yourself 20 years ago.

102
0:04:36.334,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,

103
0:04:41.142,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and high-heeled shoes.

104
0:04:43.1,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was not the militant lesbian

105
0:04:44.995,000 --> 0:04:47,000
ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe.

106
0:04:48.934,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner

107
0:04:52.623,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of my pitch-black closet

108
0:04:54.887,000 --> 0:04:56,000
clutching my gay grenade,

109
0:04:57.142,000 --> 0:05:,000
and moving one muscle is the scariest thing

110
0:05:00.774,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I have ever done.

111
0:05:03.087,000 --> 0:05:05,000
My family, my friends, complete strangers --

112
0:05:05.303,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I had spent my entire life

113
0:05:06.745,000 --> 0:05:07,000
trying to not disappoint these people,

114
0:05:08.369,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and now I was turning the world upside down

115
0:05:11.985,000 --> 0:05:12,000
on purpose.

116
0:05:13.609,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I was burning the pages of the script

117
0:05:15.727,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we had all followed for so long,

118
0:05:17.954,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.

119
0:05:21.597,000 --> 0:05:22,000
One of my most memorable grenade tosses

120
0:05:23.475,000 --> 0:05:25,000
was at my sister's wedding.

121
0:05:25.636,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:27.546,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It was the first time that many in attendance

123
0:05:30.241,000 --> 0:05:33,000
knew I was gay, so in doing my maid of honor duties,

124
0:05:33.412,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in my black dress and heels,

125
0:05:35.528,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I walked around to tables

126
0:05:37.333,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,

127
0:05:39.502,000 --> 0:05:42,000
folks that had known me for years.

128
0:05:42.67,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And after a little small talk, one of the women shouted out,

129
0:05:45.781,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"I love Nathan Lane!"

130
0:05:48.283,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And the battle of gay relatability had begun.

131
0:05:51.371,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"

132
0:05:53.218,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francisco."

133
0:05:55.85,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous."

134
0:05:58.385,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?

135
0:06:00.246,000 --> 0:06:03,000
He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend."

136
0:06:03.395,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Ash, what's your favorite TV show?

137
0:06:05.033,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will & Grace.

138
0:06:07.168,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And you know who we love? Jack.

139
0:06:08.771,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Jack is our favorite."

140
0:06:10.596,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And then one woman, stumped

141
0:06:13.188,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but wanting so desperately to show her support,

142
0:06:15.676,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to let me know she was on my side,

143
0:06:18.05,000 --> 0:06:19,000
she finally blurted out,

144
0:06:19.93,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."

145
0:06:23.276,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:25.839,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And I had a choice in that moment,

147
0:06:27.918,000 --> 0:06:28,000
as all grenade throwers do.

148
0:06:29.846,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table

149
0:06:33.286,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and mock their responses,

150
0:06:35.185,000 --> 0:06:37,000
chastise their unworldliness and their inability

151
0:06:37.559,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to jump through the politically correct gay hoops I had brought with me,

152
0:06:40.477,000 --> 0:06:42,000
or I could empathize with them

153
0:06:43.345,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done,

154
0:06:47.062,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that starting and having that conversation

155
0:06:50.458,000 --> 0:06:52,000
was them coming out of their closets.

156
0:06:52.843,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Sure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt short.

157
0:06:56.111,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's a lot harder to meet them where they are

158
0:06:58.366,000 --> 0:07:,000
and acknowledge the fact that they were trying.

159
0:07:00.658,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And what else can you ask someone to do but try?

160
0:07:05.503,000 --> 0:07:07,000
If you're going to be real with someone,

161
0:07:07.576,000 --> 0:07:1,000
you gotta be ready for real in return.

162
0:07:11.146,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.

163
0:07:14.545,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Ask anybody I have ever dated.

164
0:07:16.566,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call

165
0:07:19.794,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the three Pancake Girl principles.

166
0:07:21.431,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses,

167
0:07:25.203,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but know what it takes to come out of any closet

168
0:07:28.379,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is essentially the same.

169
0:07:30.338,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Number one: Be authentic.

170
0:07:33.018,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Take the armor off. Be yourself.

171
0:07:34.732,000 --> 0:07:35,000
That kid in the cafe had no armor,

172
0:07:36.468,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but I was ready for battle.

173
0:07:38.764,000 --> 0:07:4,000
If you want someone to be real with you,

174
0:07:41.353,000 --> 0:07:43,000
they need to know that you bleed too.

175
0:07:44.337,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Number two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.

176
0:07:47.347,000 --> 0:07:49,000
If you know you are gay, just say it.

177
0:07:50.083,000 --> 0:07:51,000
If you tell your parents you might be gay,

178
0:07:51.951,000 --> 0:07:52,000
they will hold out hope that this will change.

179
0:07:53.593,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Do not give them that sense of false hope.

180
0:07:56.502,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:58.455,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And number three, and most important --

182
0:08:03.062,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:05.386,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Be unapologetic.

184
0:08:09.117,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You are speaking your truth.

185
0:08:11.182,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Never apologize for that.

186
0:08:15.079,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,

187
0:08:17.501,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so sure, apologize for what you've done,

188
0:08:20.439,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but never apologize for who you are.

189
0:08:23.943,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And yeah, some folks may be disappointed,

190
0:08:26.687,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but that is on them, not on you.

191
0:08:29.447,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Those are their expectations of who you are, not yours.

192
0:08:31.919,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That is their story, not yours.

193
0:08:36.14,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The only story that matters

194
0:08:37.926,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is the one that you want to write.

195
0:08:40.642,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So the next time you find yourself

196
0:08:42.485,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,

197
0:08:44.705,000 --> 0:08:47,000
know we have all been there before.

198
0:08:48.027,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.

199
0:08:51.205,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And we know it's hard but we need you out here,

200
0:08:54.923,000 --> 0:08:56,000
no matter what your walls are made of,

201
0:08:57.604,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because I guarantee you there are others

202
0:08:59.618,000 --> 0:09:,000
peering through the keyholes of their closets

203
0:09:01.545,000 --> 0:09:05,000
looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person

204
0:09:05.677,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and show the world that we are bigger than our closets

205
0:09:08.707,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and that a closet is no place for a person

206
0:09:12.099,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to truly live.

207
0:09:13.839,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night. (Applause)

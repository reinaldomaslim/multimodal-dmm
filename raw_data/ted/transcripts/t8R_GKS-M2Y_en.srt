1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was six when I had the first chance to learn what patience means.

2
0:00:18.099,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My grandmother gave me a magic box as a birthday present,

3
0:00:21.485,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which neither of us knew would become a gift for life.

4
0:00:25.817,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I became obsessed with magic,

5
0:00:28.318,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and at 20, I became an amateur dove magician.

6
0:00:33.467,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This act of magic requires that I train my doves

7
0:00:36.618,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to sit and wait inside my clothing.

8
0:00:39.738,000 --> 0:00:43,000
As a young magician, I was always in a rush to make them appear,

9
0:00:44.485,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but my teacher told me

10
0:00:46.056,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the secret to the success of this magical act

11
0:00:49.468,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is to make my doves appear only after they've waited patiently

12
0:00:53.715,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in my tuxedo.

13
0:00:55.797,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It has to be a mindful kind of patience,

14
0:00:58.841,000 --> 0:01:,000
the kind that took me some years to master.

15
0:01:03.789,000 --> 0:01:06,000
When life took me to Shanghai seven years ago,

16
0:01:06.928,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the mindful patience I learned became almost impossible to practice.

17
0:01:12.419,000 --> 0:01:15,000
In China, where everyone and everything is in a hurry,

18
0:01:16.412,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you need to outperform over 1.3 billion other people

19
0:01:19.888,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to build a better life.

20
0:01:22.601,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You hack the system, bend the rules,

21
0:01:25.039,000 --> 0:01:26,000
circumvent the boundaries.

22
0:01:27.53,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It is the same when it comes to food ...

23
0:01:30.5,000 --> 0:01:33,000
except that when it comes to food,

24
0:01:33.538,000 --> 0:01:36,000
impatience can have dire consequences.

25
0:01:37.618,000 --> 0:01:39,000
In the haste to grow more, sell more,

26
0:01:40.381,000 --> 0:01:44,000
4,000 years of agriculture in a country of rich natural resources

27
0:01:45.388,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is spoiled by the overuse of chemicals and pesticides.

28
0:01:49.65,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In 2016, the Chinese government revealed

29
0:01:52.627,000 --> 0:01:56,000
half a million food safety violations in just nine months.

30
0:01:58.125,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Alarmingly, one in every four diabetics in the world

31
0:02:01.88,000 --> 0:02:02,000
now comes from China.

32
0:02:04.742,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The stories around food

33
0:02:06.479,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are scary and somewhat overwhelming,

34
0:02:09.965,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I told myself it's time to bring a mindful patience into the impatience.

35
0:02:16.352,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When I say mindful patience,

36
0:02:18.194,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I don't mean the ability to wait.

37
0:02:20.966,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I mean knowing how to act while waiting.

38
0:02:25.751,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And so, while I wait for the day

39
0:02:28.36,000 --> 0:02:31,000
when a sustainable food system becomes a reality in China,

40
0:02:32.352,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I launched one of China's first online farmers market

41
0:02:35.686,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to bring local, organically grown produce to families.

42
0:02:40.488,000 --> 0:02:42,000
When we went live, 18 months ago,

43
0:02:42.685,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the food we could sell then was somewhat dismal.

44
0:02:46.006,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We had no fruit and hardly any meat to sell,

45
0:02:49.07,000 --> 0:02:52,000
as none that was sent to the lab passed our zero tolerance test

46
0:02:53.086,000 --> 0:02:57,000
towards pesticides, chemicals, antibiotics and hormones.

47
0:02:57.572,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I told our very anxious employees

48
0:02:59.692,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that we would not give up until we've met every local farmer in China.

49
0:03:05.882,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Today, we supply 240 types of produce

50
0:03:09.748,000 --> 0:03:11,000
from 57 local farmers.

51
0:03:12.732,000 --> 0:03:14,000
After almost one year of searching,

52
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we finally found chemical-free bananas

53
0:03:18.201,000 --> 0:03:21,000
grown in the backyards of villagers on Hainan Island.

54
0:03:22.569,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And only two hours away from Shanghai,

55
0:03:25.376,000 --> 0:03:29,000
on an island that even Google Maps does not have coordinates for,

56
0:03:29.471,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we found a place where cows eat grass

57
0:03:32.265,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and roam free under the blue sky.

58
0:03:35.941,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We also work hard on logistics.

59
0:03:38.69,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We deliver our customers' orders in as fast as three hours

60
0:03:42.135,000 --> 0:03:43,000
on electric vehicles,

61
0:03:44.103,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we use biodegradable, reusable boxes

62
0:03:46.826,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to minimize our environmental footprint.

63
0:03:50.885,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I have no doubt that our offerings will continue to grow,

64
0:03:54.941,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but it will take time,

65
0:03:56.878,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I know a lot more people are needed to shape the future of good food.

66
0:04:02.39,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So last year, I founded China's first food tech accelerator and VC platform

67
0:04:07.883,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to help start-ups to shape the future of good food

68
0:04:10.868,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the way they want,

69
0:04:12.455,000 --> 0:04:16,000
be that through using edible insects as a more sustainable source of protein

70
0:04:17.424,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or using essential oils to keep food fresh for longer.

71
0:04:22.514,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So, you may still ask:

72
0:04:24.618,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Why are you trying to build a sustainable food system

73
0:04:27.959,000 --> 0:04:28,000
by driving a patient movement

74
0:04:29.966,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in a country where it's almost a crime to take it slow?

75
0:04:34.329,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Because, for me,

76
0:04:35.71,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the real secret to success is patience --

77
0:04:39.29,000 --> 0:04:4,000
a mindful kind of patience

78
0:04:41.123,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that requires knowing how to act while waiting,

79
0:04:44.949,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the kind of patience I learned with my grandmother's magic box.

80
0:04:49.865,000 --> 0:04:53,000
After all, we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors.

81
0:04:55.03,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We borrow it from our children.

82
0:04:57.199,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Thank you.

83
0:04:58.374,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Applause)

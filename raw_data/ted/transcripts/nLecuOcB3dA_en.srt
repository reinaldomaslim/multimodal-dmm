1
0:00:12.788,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My dream is to build the world's first

2
0:00:14.97,000 --> 0:00:16,000
underground park in New York City.

3
0:00:17.294,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, why would someone want to build an underground park,

4
0:00:19.841,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and why in New York City?

5
0:00:23.038,000 --> 0:00:24,000
These three tough little buggers

6
0:00:24.562,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are, on the left, my grandmother, age five,

7
0:00:27.778,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and then her sister and brother,

8
0:00:29.128,000 --> 0:00:3,000
ages 11 and nine.

9
0:00:30.666,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This photo was taken just before they left

10
0:00:32.863,000 --> 0:00:34,000
from Italy to immigrate to the United States,

11
0:00:35.471,000 --> 0:00:37,000
just about a century ago.

12
0:00:37.982,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And like many immigrants at the time,

13
0:00:39.377,000 --> 0:00:4,000
they arrived on the Lower East Side

14
0:00:41.09,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in New York City

15
0:00:42.291,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and they encountered a crazy melting pot.

16
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
What was amazing about their generation

17
0:00:46.567,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was that they were not only building new lives

18
0:00:49.627,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in this new, unfamiliar area,

19
0:00:51.75,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but they were also literally building the city.

20
0:00:54.346,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I've always been fascinated by those decades

21
0:00:56.479,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and by that history,

22
0:00:57.799,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I would often beg my grandmother

23
0:01:00.278,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to tell me as many stories as possible

24
0:01:01.947,000 --> 0:01:03,000
about the old New York.

25
0:01:03.955,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But she would often just shrug it off,

26
0:01:06.133,000 --> 0:01:08,000
tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,

27
0:01:08.383,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and so I very rarely got

28
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
any of the history that I wanted to hear about.

29
0:01:13.355,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The New York City that I encountered

30
0:01:14.616,000 --> 0:01:15,000
felt pretty built up.

31
0:01:16.514,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I always knew as a kid that I wanted

32
0:01:18.711,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to make a difference, and to somehow

33
0:01:20.229,000 --> 0:01:22,000
make the world more beautiful, more interesting

34
0:01:22.435,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and more just.

35
0:01:23.462,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I just didn't really know how.

36
0:01:25.259,000 --> 0:01:26,000
At first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,

37
0:01:26.947,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.

38
0:01:29.366,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But it felt weird to me that I knew more about

39
0:01:31.481,000 --> 0:01:34,000
local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown.

40
0:01:35.115,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I took a job with the City of New York,

41
0:01:37.121,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but very quickly felt frustrated

42
0:01:39.27,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with the slowness of government bureaucracy.

43
0:01:42.308,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I even took a job at Google,

44
0:01:44.013,000 --> 0:01:47,000
where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid

45
0:01:47.11,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and believed almost wholeheartedly

46
0:01:48.856,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that technology could solve all social problems.

47
0:01:52.474,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place.

48
0:01:55.96,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It was in 2009 that my friend

49
0:01:57.819,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and now business partner James Ramsey

50
0:01:59.787,000 --> 0:02:02,000
alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site,

51
0:02:02.881,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which is this.

52
0:02:04.331,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is the former trolley terminal

53
0:02:06.166,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that was the depot for passengers

54
0:02:08.744,000 --> 0:02:09,000
traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge

55
0:02:10.648,000 --> 0:02:12,000
from Brooklyn to Manhattan,

56
0:02:12.932,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and it was open between 1908 and 1948,

57
0:02:15.701,000 --> 0:02:17,000
just around the time when my grandparents were

58
0:02:18.143,000 --> 0:02:19,000
living right in the area.

59
0:02:19.992,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And we learned also that the site

60
0:02:21.64,000 --> 0:02:24,000
was entirely abandoned in 1948.

61
0:02:24.882,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Fascinated by this discovery,

62
0:02:26.805,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we begged the authorities to draw us into the space,

63
0:02:29.933,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and we finally got a tour,

64
0:02:31.44,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and this is what we saw.

65
0:02:33.59,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now, this photo doesn't really do it justice.

66
0:02:35.3,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical

67
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:39,000
feeling that you have when you get in this space.

68
0:02:40.119,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's a football field of unused land

69
0:02:43.807,000 --> 0:02:46,000
immediately below a very crowded area of the city,

70
0:02:47.21,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones

71
0:02:49.345,000 --> 0:02:5,000
on an archaeological dig,

72
0:02:51.06,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and all the details are all still there.

73
0:02:52.833,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's really pretty remarkable.

74
0:02:54.801,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now, the site itself is located at the very heart

75
0:02:57.401,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of the Lower East Side,

76
0:02:59.27,000 --> 0:03:,000
and today it still remains one of the most

77
0:03:00.766,000 --> 0:03:01,000
crowded neighborhoods in the city.

78
0:03:02.757,000 --> 0:03:03,000
New York City has two thirds the green space

79
0:03:04.557,000 --> 0:03:06,000
per resident as other big cities,

80
0:03:06.605,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.

81
0:03:09.778,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So we immediately started thinking about how we

82
0:03:11.601,000 --> 0:03:13,000
could take this site and turn it into something

83
0:03:13.671,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that could be used for the public,

84
0:03:15.058,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but also could potentially even be green.

85
0:03:17.81,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Our plan, in a nutshell,

86
0:03:19.14,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is to draw natural sunlight underground

87
0:03:21.841,000 --> 0:03:24,000
using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street,

88
0:03:24.944,000 --> 0:03:26,000
directs it below the city sidewalks,

89
0:03:27.38,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and would allow plants and trees to grow

90
0:03:29.31,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with the light that's directed underneath.

91
0:03:31.999,000 --> 0:03:32,000
With this approach, you could take a site

92
0:03:33.73,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that looks like this today

93
0:03:35.941,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and transform it into something

94
0:03:37.707,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that looks like this.

95
0:03:39.673,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In 2011, we first released some of these images,

96
0:03:43.704,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and what was funny was,

97
0:03:45.093,000 --> 0:03:47,000
a lot of people said to us, "Oh, it kind of looks

98
0:03:47.417,000 --> 0:03:48,000
like the High Line underground."

99
0:03:49.353,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And so what our nickname ended up becoming,

100
0:03:53.673,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and what ended up sticking,

101
0:03:55.473,000 --> 0:03:57,000
was the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.

102
0:03:58.319,000 --> 0:03:59,000
What was also clear was that people really wanted

103
0:03:59.996,000 --> 0:04:,000
to know a lot more about how the technology

104
0:04:01.694,000 --> 0:04:02,000
would look and feel,

105
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and that there was really much more interest in this

106
0:04:05.393,000 --> 0:04:07,000
than we had ever thought possible.

107
0:04:07.488,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job

108
0:04:09.727,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and focus entirely on this project.

109
0:04:11.921,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Here is us with our team

110
0:04:13.743,000 --> 0:04:15,000
putting together a technology demonstration

111
0:04:16.151,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in a warehouse.

112
0:04:18.17,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy

113
0:04:21.27,000 --> 0:04:23,000
which we built to show the technology.

114
0:04:23.599,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You can see the six solar collectors at the center there.

115
0:04:26.479,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And here's the full exhibit all put together

116
0:04:29.09,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in this warehouse.

117
0:04:30.541,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You can see the solar canopy overhead,

118
0:04:32.318,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the light streaming in,

119
0:04:33.734,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and this entirely live green space below.

120
0:04:36.358,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So in the course of just a few weeks,

121
0:04:37.784,000 --> 0:04:4,000
tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,

122
0:04:41.353,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and since that time, we've grown

123
0:04:42.81,000 --> 0:04:44,000
our numbers of supporters both locally

124
0:04:45.111,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and among design enthusiasts all over the world.

125
0:04:47.823,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Here's a rendering of the neighborhood

126
0:04:49.884,000 --> 0:04:51,000
just immediately above the Line's site,

127
0:04:52.25,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and a rendering of how it will look

128
0:04:54.384,000 --> 0:04:56,000
after major redevelopment that is coming

129
0:04:56.668,000 --> 0:04:58,000
over the course of the next 10 years.

130
0:04:58.671,000 --> 0:05:,000
Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels

131
0:05:00.786,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and how there's really a lack of green space.

132
0:05:02.71,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So what we're proposing is really something that will

133
0:05:05.43,000 --> 0:05:08,000
add one football field of green space

134
0:05:09.18,000 --> 0:05:11,000
underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly

135
0:05:12.046,000 --> 0:05:14,000
will introduce a really community-driven focus

136
0:05:14.76,000 --> 0:05:16,000
in a rapidly gentrifying area.

137
0:05:16.943,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And right now, we're focusing very closely

138
0:05:18.687,000 --> 0:05:2,000
on how we engage with the City of New York

139
0:05:21.106,000 --> 0:05:24,000
on really transforming the overall ecosystem

140
0:05:24.549,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in an integrated way.

141
0:05:26.63,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Here's our rendering of how we would actually

142
0:05:28.239,000 --> 0:05:3,000
invite people into the space itself.

143
0:05:30.377,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So here you see this iconic entrance

144
0:05:32.683,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in which we would literally peel up the street

145
0:05:34.855,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and reveal the historical layers of the city,

146
0:05:37.87,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and invite people into this warm underground space.

147
0:05:40.775,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In the middle of winter, when it's absolutely freezing outside,

148
0:05:43.034,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the last place you'd want to go would be

149
0:05:44.124,000 --> 0:05:46,000
an outdoor space or outdoor park.

150
0:05:46.634,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The Lowline would really be a four-season space

151
0:05:48.559,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and a respite for the city.

152
0:05:51.045,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings

153
0:05:53.363,000 --> 0:05:55,000
my own family's story full circle.

154
0:05:55.984,000 --> 0:05:56,000
If my grandparents and my parents were really

155
0:05:57.918,000 --> 0:06:,000
focused on building the city up and out,

156
0:06:01.205,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I think my generation is focused on reclaiming

157
0:06:03.281,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the spaces that we already have,

158
0:06:05.189,000 --> 0:06:06,000
rediscovering our shared history,

159
0:06:07.146,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and reimagining how we can make our communities

160
0:06:09.724,000 --> 0:06:12,000
more interesting, more beautiful and more just.

161
0:06:12.737,000 --> 0:06:13,000

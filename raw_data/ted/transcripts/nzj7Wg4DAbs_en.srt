1
0:00:13.309,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals.

2
0:00:18.398,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans

3
0:00:22.521,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is that they were unimportant.

4
0:00:24.497,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish

5
0:00:29.655,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or fireflies or woodpeckers.

6
0:00:32.643,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Today, in contrast, we control this planet.

7
0:00:36.853,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And the question is:

8
0:00:38.219,000 --> 0:00:41,000
How did we come from there to here?

9
0:00:41.666,000 --> 0:00:44,000
How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes,

10
0:00:45.342,000 --> 0:00:48,000
minding their own business in a corner of Africa,

11
0:00:48.513,000 --> 0:00:5,000
into the rulers of planet Earth?

12
0:00:51.876,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Usually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals

13
0:00:57.59,000 --> 0:00:58,000
on the individual level.

14
0:00:59.412,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We want to believe -- I want to believe --

15
0:01:02.43,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that there is something special about me,

16
0:01:06.002,000 --> 0:01:09,000
about my body, about my brain,

17
0:01:09.152,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.

18
0:01:15.221,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But the truth is that, on the individual level,

19
0:01:18.506,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee.

20
0:01:22.029,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island,

21
0:01:27.288,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better,

22
0:01:31.56,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee, not on myself.

23
0:01:37.419,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And this is not something wrong with me personally.

24
0:01:40.469,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone

25
0:01:44.619,000 --> 0:01:45,000
with a chimpanzee on some island,

26
0:01:46.608,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the chimpanzee would do much better.

27
0:01:50.823,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The real difference between humans and all other animals

28
0:01:55.032,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is not on the individual level;

29
0:01:57.503,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it's on the collective level.

30
0:01:59.518,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Humans control the planet because they are the only animals

31
0:02:04.348,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers.

32
0:02:10.167,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, there are other animals --

33
0:02:11.959,000 --> 0:02:14,000
like the social insects, the bees, the ants --

34
0:02:15.154,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly.

35
0:02:20.099,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Their cooperation is very rigid.

36
0:02:23.012,000 --> 0:02:27,000
There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function.

37
0:02:27.215,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger,

38
0:02:31.05,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight.

39
0:02:35.617,000 --> 0:02:37,000
They cannot, for example, execute the queen

40
0:02:38.521,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and establish a republic of bees,

41
0:02:40.451,000 --> 0:02:43,000
or a communist dictatorship of worker bees.

42
0:02:44.442,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Other animals, like the social mammals --

43
0:02:46.809,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees --

44
0:02:50.707,000 --> 0:02:52,000
they can cooperate much more flexibly,

45
0:02:53.477,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but they do so only in small numbers,

46
0:02:56.842,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because cooperation among chimpanzees

47
0:02:59.739,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is based on intimate knowledge, one of the other.

48
0:03:03.811,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,

49
0:03:06.603,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and I want to cooperate with you.

50
0:03:08.43,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I need to know you personally.

51
0:03:11.049,000 --> 0:03:12,000
What kind of chimpanzee are you?

52
0:03:12.843,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Are you a nice chimpanzee?

53
0:03:14.28,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Are you an evil chimpanzee?

54
0:03:15.957,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Are you trustworthy?

55
0:03:17.425,000 --> 0:03:2,000
If I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you?

56
0:03:21.676,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The only animal that can combine the two abilities together

57
0:03:25.451,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers

58
0:03:30.771,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is us, Homo sapiens.

59
0:03:32.973,000 --> 0:03:36,000
One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,

60
0:03:37.128,000 --> 0:03:39,000
chimpanzees might be better than us.

61
0:03:40.112,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But, if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees,

62
0:03:45.315,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the humans will win easily, for the simple reason

63
0:03:48.957,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all.

64
0:03:53.337,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees

65
0:03:57.412,000 --> 0:04:,000
into Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium,

66
0:04:01.052,000 --> 0:04:03,000
or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,

67
0:04:03.608,000 --> 0:04:05,000
you will get chaos, complete chaos.

68
0:04:06.249,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees.

69
0:04:10.616,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Complete madness.

70
0:04:12.219,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In contrast, humans normally gather there in tens of thousands,

71
0:04:18.185,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and what we get is not chaos, usually.

72
0:04:21.273,000 --> 0:04:27,000
What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation.

73
0:04:28.554,000 --> 0:04:32,000
All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history,

74
0:04:33.168,000 --> 0:04:36,000
whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon,

75
0:04:36.475,000 --> 0:04:38,000
have been based not on individual abilities,

76
0:04:39.074,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.

77
0:04:43.465,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now:

78
0:04:47.146,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people,

79
0:04:53.154,000 --> 0:04:56,000
most of you are complete strangers to me.

80
0:04:56.928,000 --> 0:05:,000
Similarly, I don't really know all the people who have organized

81
0:05:01.936,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and worked on this event.

82
0:05:03.994,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane

83
0:05:07.811,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that brought me over here, yesterday, to London.

84
0:05:11.286,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I don't know the people who invented and manufactured

85
0:05:15.033,000 --> 0:05:19,000
this microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying.

86
0:05:20.123,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles

87
0:05:23.684,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that I read in preparation for this talk.

88
0:05:26.495,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I certainly don't know all the people

89
0:05:29.329,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who might be watching this talk over the Internet,

90
0:05:32.572,000 --> 0:05:35,000
somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.

91
0:05:36.162,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Nevertheless, even though we don't know each other,

92
0:05:39.695,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas.

93
0:05:46.081,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This is something chimpanzees cannot do.

94
0:05:49.156,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They communicate, of course,

95
0:05:50.994,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band

96
0:05:56.817,000 --> 0:06:,000
to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants,

97
0:06:00.961,000 --> 0:06:03,000
or anything else that might interest chimpanzees.

98
0:06:05.389,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now cooperation is, of course, not always nice;

99
0:06:08.903,000 --> 0:06:12,000
all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history --

100
0:06:12.952,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and we have been doing some very horrible things --

101
0:06:15.715,000 --> 0:06:2,000
all those things are also based on large-scale cooperation.

102
0:06:20.888,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Prisons are a system of cooperation;

103
0:06:23.508,000 --> 0:06:25,000
slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation;

104
0:06:26.522,000 --> 0:06:29,000
concentration camps are a system of cooperation.

105
0:06:29.907,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps.

106
0:06:36.183,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes,

107
0:06:40.037,000 --> 0:06:45,000
we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers.

108
0:06:45.516,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The next question that immediately arises

109
0:06:48.488,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:

110
0:06:51.395,000 --> 0:06:53,000
How, exactly, do we do it?

111
0:06:54.083,000 --> 0:06:59,000
What enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way?

112
0:07:01.714,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The answer is our imagination.

113
0:07:04.998,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers,

114
0:07:10.454,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because we alone, of all the animals on the planet,

115
0:07:14.174,000 --> 0:07:18,000
can create and believe fictions, fictional stories.

116
0:07:19.326,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction,

117
0:07:23.938,000 --> 0:07:26,000
everybody obeys and follows the same rules,

118
0:07:27.504,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the same norms, the same values.

119
0:07:30.639,000 --> 0:07:33,000
All other animals use their communication system

120
0:07:34.562,000 --> 0:07:36,000
only to describe reality.

121
0:07:37.59,000 --> 0:07:41,000
A chimpanzee may say, "Look! There's a lion, let's run away!"

122
0:07:41.831,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Or, "Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!"

123
0:07:45.961,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality,

124
0:07:52.262,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but also to create new realities, fictional realities.

125
0:07:57.278,000 --> 0:08:,000
A human can say, "Look, there is a god above the clouds!

126
0:08:01.256,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And if you don't do what I tell you to do,

127
0:08:03.36,000 --> 0:08:06,000
when you die, God will punish you and send you to hell."

128
0:08:06.986,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And if you all believe this story that I've invented,

129
0:08:10.782,000 --> 0:08:13,000
then you will follow the same norms and laws and values,

130
0:08:14.621,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and you can cooperate.

131
0:08:16.278,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This is something only humans can do.

132
0:08:19.207,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana

133
0:08:23.072,000 --> 0:08:26,000
by promising him, "... after you die, you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."

134
0:08:26.889,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

135
0:08:27.936,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds.

136
0:08:31.222,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So now give me this banana."

137
0:08:32.668,000 --> 0:08:34,000
No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story.

138
0:08:35.776,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Only humans believe such stories,

139
0:08:38.49,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is why we control the world,

140
0:08:40.597,000 --> 0:08:44,000
whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.

141
0:08:46.904,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Now you may find it acceptable that yes,

142
0:08:49.868,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in the religious field, humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions.

143
0:08:56.032,000 --> 0:09:,000
Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque

144
0:09:01.008,000 --> 0:09:06,000
or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because they all believe in the same stories

145
0:09:06.774,000 --> 0:09:08,000
about God and heaven and hell.

146
0:09:09.979,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism

147
0:09:15.242,000 --> 0:09:2,000
underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation,

148
0:09:21.13,000 --> 0:09:23,000
not only in the religious field.

149
0:09:23.674,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Take, for example, the legal field.

150
0:09:26.531,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights.

151
0:09:33.247,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But what are human rights?

152
0:09:35.596,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented.

153
0:09:40.322,000 --> 0:09:42,000
They are not an objective reality;

154
0:09:42.664,000 --> 0:09:45,000
they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens.

155
0:09:46.719,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Take a human being, cut him open, look inside,

156
0:09:50.542,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA,

157
0:09:55.693,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but you won't find any rights.

158
0:09:58.2,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The only place you find rights are in the stories

159
0:10:02.145,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries.

160
0:10:06.607,000 --> 0:10:1,000
They may be very positive stories, very good stories,

161
0:10:11.561,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented.

162
0:10:15.664,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The same is true of the political field.

163
0:10:18.565,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations.

164
0:10:25.333,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But what are states and nations?

165
0:10:27.593,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They are not an objective reality.

166
0:10:29.742,000 --> 0:10:31,000
A mountain is an objective reality.

167
0:10:32.479,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You can see it, you can touch it, you can even smell it.

168
0:10:36.223,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But a nation or a state,

169
0:10:38.019,000 --> 0:10:41,000
like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,

170
0:10:41.823,000 --> 0:10:43,000
this is just a story that we've invented

171
0:10:44.587,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and became extremely attached to.

172
0:10:46.949,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The same is true of the economic field.

173
0:10:49.892,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The most important actors today in the global economy

174
0:10:53.622,000 --> 0:10:55,000
are companies and corporations.

175
0:10:56.407,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Many of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation,

176
0:11:00.162,000 --> 0:11:03,000
like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.

177
0:11:03.577,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What exactly are these things?

178
0:11:05.982,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They are what lawyers call legal fictions.

179
0:11:10.359,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They are stories invented and maintained

180
0:11:13.859,000 --> 0:11:16,000
by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.

181
0:11:17.216,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

182
0:11:18.685,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And what do corporations do all day?

183
0:11:22.128,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Mostly, they try to make money.

184
0:11:25.411,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Yet, what is money?

185
0:11:26.768,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value.

186
0:11:31.958,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Take this green piece of paper, the dollar bill.

187
0:11:35.299,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Look at it -- it has no value.

188
0:11:37.7,000 --> 0:11:39,000
You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,

189
0:11:39.958,000 --> 0:11:4,000
you cannot wear it.

190
0:11:41.633,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But then came along these master storytellers --

191
0:11:45.698,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the big bankers,

192
0:11:47.206,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the finance ministers,

193
0:11:48.67,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the prime ministers --

194
0:11:50.048,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and they tell us a very convincing story:

195
0:11:52.55,000 --> 0:11:53,000
"Look, you see this green piece of paper?

196
0:11:54.532,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It is actually worth 10 bananas."

197
0:11:57.591,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And if I believe it, and you believe it,

198
0:11:59.724,000 --> 0:12:,000
and everybody believes it,

199
0:12:01.264,000 --> 0:12:02,000
it actually works.

200
0:12:03.152,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I can take this worthless piece of paper,

201
0:12:06.089,000 --> 0:12:07,000
go to the supermarket,

202
0:12:07.75,000 --> 0:12:11,000
give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before,

203
0:12:11.781,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat.

204
0:12:16.87,000 --> 0:12:17,000
This is something amazing.

205
0:12:18.615,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You could never do it with chimpanzees.

206
0:12:20.717,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Chimpanzees trade, of course:

207
0:12:22.686,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana."

208
0:12:25.46,000 --> 0:12:26,000
That can work.

209
0:12:26.722,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But, you give me a worthless piece of paper

210
0:12:29.738,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and you except me to give you a banana?

211
0:12:31.776,000 --> 0:12:32,000
No way!

212
0:12:32.952,000 --> 0:12:33,000
What do you think I am, a human?

213
0:12:34.557,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Laughter)

214
0:12:36.954,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Money, in fact, is the most successful story

215
0:12:41.097,000 --> 0:12:43,000
ever invented and told by humans,

216
0:12:43.777,000 --> 0:12:47,000
because it is the only story everybody believes.

217
0:12:48.692,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Not everybody believes in God,

218
0:12:51.506,000 --> 0:12:54,000
not everybody believes in human rights,

219
0:12:54.555,000 --> 0:12:56,000
not everybody believes in nationalism,

220
0:12:57.364,000 --> 0:13:,000
but everybody believes in money, and in the dollar bill.

221
0:13:01.514,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Take, even, Osama Bin Laden.

222
0:13:03.519,000 --> 0:13:06,000
He hated American politics and American religion

223
0:13:07.23,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and American culture,

224
0:13:08.703,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but he had no objection to American dollars.

225
0:13:11.533,000 --> 0:13:13,000
He was quite fond of them, actually.

226
0:13:13.652,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

227
0:13:16.166,000 --> 0:13:17,000
To conclude, then:

228
0:13:17.89,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality.

229
0:13:24.531,000 --> 0:13:27,000
All other animals live in an objective reality.

230
0:13:28.992,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Their reality consists of objective entities,

231
0:13:33.568,000 --> 0:13:36,000
like rivers and trees and lions and elephants.

232
0:13:38.067,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We humans, we also live in an objective reality.

233
0:13:41.774,000 --> 0:13:46,000
In our world, too, there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants.

234
0:13:47.421,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But over the centuries,

235
0:13:49.29,000 --> 0:13:53,000
we have constructed on top of this objective reality

236
0:13:54.041,000 --> 0:13:57,000
a second layer of fictional reality,

237
0:13:57.558,000 --> 0:14:,000
a reality made of fictional entities,

238
0:14:01.146,000 --> 0:14:05,000
like nations, like gods, like money, like corporations.

239
0:14:06.481,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And what is amazing is that as history unfolded,

240
0:14:11.139,000 --> 0:14:16,000
this fictional reality became more and more powerful

241
0:14:16.559,000 --> 0:14:2,000
so that today, the most powerful forces in the world

242
0:14:21.084,000 --> 0:14:22,000
are these fictional entities.

243
0:14:23.715,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Today, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants

244
0:14:30.533,000 --> 0:14:35,000
depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities,

245
0:14:35.662,000 --> 0:14:39,000
like the United States, like Google, like the World Bank --

246
0:14:40.223,000 --> 0:14:44,000
entities that exist only in our own imagination.

247
0:14:44.929,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Thank you.

248
0:14:46.105,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Applause)

249
0:14:56.299,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have a new book out.

250
0:14:58.533,000 --> 0:14:59,000
After Sapiens, you wrote another one,

251
0:15:00.36,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into ...

252
0:15:02.971,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on the translation as we speak.

253
0:15:05.924,000 --> 0:15:07,000
BG: In the book, if I understand it correctly,

254
0:15:08.116,000 --> 0:15:13,000
you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now

255
0:15:13.769,000 --> 0:15:15,000
not only will potentially make our lives better,

256
0:15:16.052,000 --> 0:15:18,000
but they will create -- and I quote you --

257
0:15:18.312,000 --> 0:15:22,000
"... new classes and new class struggles, just as the industrial revolution did."

258
0:15:22.954,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Can you elaborate for us?

259
0:15:24.67,000 --> 0:15:25,000
YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,

260
0:15:26.618,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat.

261
0:15:31.544,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved

262
0:15:36.678,000 --> 0:15:39,000
what to do with this class, and the new problems and opportunities.

263
0:15:40.328,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Now, we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people.

264
0:15:44.984,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Laughter)

265
0:15:46.009,000 --> 0:15:51,000
As computers become better and better in more and more fields,

266
0:15:51.394,000 --> 0:15:55,000
there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us

267
0:15:56.31,000 --> 0:15:59,000
in most tasks and will make humans redundant.

268
0:15:59.937,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And then the big political and economic question

269
0:16:02.698,000 --> 0:16:04,000
of the 21st century will be,

270
0:16:05.085,000 --> 0:16:07,000
"What do we need humans for?",

271
0:16:07.271,000 --> 0:16:1,000
or at least, "What do we need so many humans for?"

272
0:16:10.662,000 --> 0:16:12,000
BG: Do you have an answer in the book?

273
0:16:13.144,000 --> 0:16:17,000
YNH: At present, the best guess we have is to keep them happy

274
0:16:17.188,000 --> 0:16:18,000
with drugs and computer games ...

275
0:16:19.009,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Laughter)

276
0:16:20.034,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future.

277
0:16:23.329,000 --> 0:16:25,000
BG: Ok, so you're basically saying in the book and now,

278
0:16:26.162,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that for all the discussion about the growing evidence

279
0:16:28.972,000 --> 0:16:31,000
of significant economic inequality, we are just kind of at the beginning

280
0:16:32.759,000 --> 0:16:33,000
of the process?

281
0:16:34.225,000 --> 0:16:35,000
YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;

282
0:16:35.775,000 --> 0:16:38,000
it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us.

283
0:16:39.742,000 --> 0:16:43,000
One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people.

284
0:16:44.748,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Another possibility is the division of humankind

285
0:16:47.912,000 --> 0:16:49,000
into different biological castes,

286
0:16:50.927,000 --> 0:16:54,000
with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods,

287
0:16:55.242,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people.

288
0:16:59.574,000 --> 0:17:02,000
BG: I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two.

289
0:17:02.62,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.

290
0:17:04.466,000 --> 0:17:05,000
YNH: Thanks!

291
0:17:05.646,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here

2
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,

3
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.

4
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.

5
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:57,000
What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories

8
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
and talk about a different Africa.

9
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa

10
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,

11
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,

12
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and the Africa of disasters.

13
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
While it is true that those things are going on,

14
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.

15
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.

16
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.

17
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This is the Africa of opportunity.

18
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of

19
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
their own futures and their own destinies.

20
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships

21
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.

22
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I want to start by telling you

23
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a story about that change in Africa.

24
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:58,000
On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,

25
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,

26
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.

27
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars

28
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that went into some dormant accounts

29
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that belonged to him and his family.

30
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation

31
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
between the London Metropolitan Police

32
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --

33
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:36,000
led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.

34
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.

35
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman

36
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and ran from London back to Nigeria where,

37
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
according to our constitution, those in office

38
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
as governors, president -- as in many countries --

39
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:

40
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible

41
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.

42
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.

43
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa

44
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.

45
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources

46
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:32,000
managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places

47
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.

48
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --

49
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people

50
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and the governments are trying hard to fight this

51
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.

52
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.

53
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.

54
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.

55
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So when you hear about corruption,

56
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
don't just feel that nothing is being done about this --

57
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that you can't operate in any African country

58
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.

59
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing

60
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and is being won. In others, like mine,

61
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,

62
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.

63
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.

64
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The results are showing:

65
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:4,000
independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations

66
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
show that in many instances the trend is downwards

67
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.

68
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed

69
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.

70
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And let me say just one more thing

71
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
before I leave this area of governance.

72
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.

73
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
All the time when they talk about it

74
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you immediately think about Africa.

75
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this:

76
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:16,000
if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --

77
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:22,000
if the other people who had taken money, estimated at

78
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies

79
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,

80
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
what is that? Is that not corruption?

81
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?

82
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think

83
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
about what is happening on the other side of the globe --

84
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.

85
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,

86
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:54,000
on asset recovery, trying to do what we can

87
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to get the monies that have been taken abroad --

88
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.

89
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,

90
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it may be far more for some of these countries

91
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
than all the aid that is being put together.

92
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Applause)

93
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.

94
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired

95
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.

96
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We are grateful, but we know that

97
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.

98
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization

99
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that no one can do it but us. We have to do it.

100
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.

101
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We have to reform our economies, change our leadership,

102
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:59,000
become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.

103
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And this is what we started to do

104
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.

105
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.

106
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I want to tell you that.

107
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

108
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,

109
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --

110
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.

111
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

112
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
What we started to do was to realize

113
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.

114
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And with the support of a leader

115
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,

116
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we put forward a comprehensive reform program,

117
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
which we developed ourselves.

118
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,

119
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.

120
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.

121
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We put together a program that would, one: get the state

122
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.

123
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The state should not be in the business

124
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:58,000
of producing goods and services

125
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because it's inefficient and incompetent.

126
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.

127
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Applause)

128
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.

129
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Can you believe that prior to this reform --

130
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington

131
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to go and take up the post of Finance Minister --

132
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop

133
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:34,000
4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?

134
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

135
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.

136
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.

137
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You had to do everything to get your phone.

138
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
When President Obasanjo supported and launched

139
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the liberalization of the telecommunications sector,

140
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:59,000
we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.

141
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,

142
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year

143
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.

144
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

145
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The smartest one, first to come in,

146
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
was the MTN company of South Africa.

147
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister,

148
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.

149
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,

150
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.

151
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So the market is there.

152
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.

153
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Nigerians themselves began to develop

154
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
some wireless telecommunications companies,

155
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and three or four others have come in.

156
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:,000
But there's a huge market out there,

157
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.

158
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So privatization is one of the things we've done.

159
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.

160
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Because nobody's going to help you and support you

161
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
if you're not managing your own finances well.

162
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation

163
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:3,000
of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.

164
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule

165
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that de-linked our budget from the oil price.

166
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,

167
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector

168
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.

169
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget

170
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
at a price slightly lower than the oil price

171
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:,000
and save whatever was above that price.

172
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.

173
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But what it immediately did was that the volatility

174
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that had been present in terms of our economic development --

175
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.

176
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
When they crashed, we crashed.

177
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.

178
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:25,000
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,

179
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:31,000
27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --

180
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.

181
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And

182
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves

183
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:47,000
due to proper management of our finances.

184
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.

185
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time

186
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people

187
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:03,000
have a predictability of prices in the economy.

188
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.

189
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade

190
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to about 6.5 percent now.

191
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make

192
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.

193
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil

194
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities

195
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --

196
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
what was remarkable is that much of this growth came

197
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.

198
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.

199
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:51,000
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,

200
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that

201
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
once you get the macro-economy straightened out,

202
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.

203
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.

204
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals

205
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized

206
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that without the proper legislation to make that possible,

207
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code

208
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that is comparable with some of the best in the world.

209
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.

210
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people --

211
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:34,000
no shopping malls as you know them here.

212
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This was an investment opportunity for someone

213
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that excited the imagination of people.

214
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall

215
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.

216
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So, huge things in construction, real estate,

217
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
mortgage markets. Financial services:

218
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:58,000
we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.

219
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring

220
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that they increase their capital -- share capital.

221
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.

222
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening

223
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.

224
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.

225
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.

226
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.

227
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We are doing the same with the insurance sector.

228
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.

229
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:42,000
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.

230
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And that's what many people know East Africa for:

231
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.

232
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But managing the tourism market in a way

233
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that can really benefit the people is very important.

234
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you

235
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that there's a new wave on the continent.

236
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:06,000
A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,

237
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
more than two-thirds of African countries have had

238
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
multi-party democratic elections.

239
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Not all of them have been perfect, or will be,

240
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but the trend is very clear.

241
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,

242
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
the average rate of growth on the continent has moved

243
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:27,000
from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.

244
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:31,000
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.

245
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So it's clear that things are changing.

246
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Conflicts are down on the continent;

247
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
from about 12 conflicts a decade ago,

248
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we are down to three or four conflicts --

249
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.

250
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where

251
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:51,000
if something is going on in one part of the continent,

252
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:54,000
it looks like the entire continent is affected.

253
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:57,000
But you should know that this continent is not --

254
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:03,000
is a continent of many countries, not one country.

255
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And if we are down to three or four conflicts,

256
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest

257
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:15,000
in stable, growing, exciting economies

258
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
where there's plenty of opportunity.

259
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And I want to just make one point about this investment.

260
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
The best way to help Africans today

261
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
is to help them to stand on their own feet.

262
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.

263
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:39,000
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that

264
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.

265
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed

266
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and make sure that their children go to school,

267
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:53,000
that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.

268
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:57,000
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money

269
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:02,000
whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,

270
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:07,000
isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?

271
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in

272
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
on the continent are the women.

273
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

274
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.

275
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.

276
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It says, "Africa: Open for Business."

277
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And this is a video that has actually won an award

278
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:36,000
as the best documentary of the year.

279
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Understand that the woman who made it

280
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:43,000
is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.

281
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:49,000
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who

282
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:54,000
against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.

283
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:57,000
One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,

284
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:59,000
making children's clothes --

285
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:04,000
which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.

286
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Mixing African materials, such as we have,

287
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:09,000
with materials from elsewhere.

288
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:14,000
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,

289
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:18,000
with African material mixed in. Very creative designs,

290
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:23,000
has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.

291
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:25,000
(Laughter)

292
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
For 10,000 pieces.

293
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:33,000
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.

294
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.

295
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I could go on giving examples:

296
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business

297
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning

298
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.

299
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:58,000
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand,

300
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:02,000
because nobody believes outside of our countries

301
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:07,000
that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.

302
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.

303
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:13,000
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,

304
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:15,000
will miss it forever.

305
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:21,000
So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.

306
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,

307
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:31,000
who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them

308
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:34,000
into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure

309
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:37,000
that their fellow men and women are employed,

310
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:39,000
and that the children in those households get educated

311
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:42,000
because their parents are earning adequate income.

312
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:47,000
So I invite you to explore the opportunities.

313
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:52,000
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,

314
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:56,000
because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be

315
0:19:56,000 --> 0:20:01,000
for you to get involved in something that will do good

316
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:06,000
for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.

317
0:20:06,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Thank you very much.

318
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:15,000
(Applause)

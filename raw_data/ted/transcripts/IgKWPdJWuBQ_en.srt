Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:15.614,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream

3
0:00:18.746,000 --> 0:00:2,000
would persuade you to think of trying

4
0:00:20.902,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.

6
0:00:27.662,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely

7
0:00:29.814,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?

8
0:00:32.886,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport

9
0:00:36.378,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and sustainable energy production.

10
0:00:38.737,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That sort of overall sustainable energy problem

11
0:00:40.782,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,

12
0:00:43.281,000 --> 0:00:45,000
independent of environmental concerns.

13
0:00:45.486,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,

14
0:00:48.403,000 --> 0:00:51,000
given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,

15
0:00:51.483,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we need to find some sustainable means of operating.

16
0:00:55.538,000 --> 0:00:59,000
CA: Most of American electricity comes from

17
0:00:59.548,000 --> 0:01:,000
burning fossil fuels.

18
0:01:01.21,000 --> 0:01:05,000
How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?

19
0:01:05.825,000 --> 0:01:07,000
EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.

20
0:01:08.784,000 --> 0:01:1,000
One is that, even if you take the same source fuel

21
0:01:11.744,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and produce power at the power plant

22
0:01:13.733,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.

23
0:01:16.627,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So if you take, say, natural gas,

24
0:01:18.606,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,

25
0:01:21.214,000 --> 0:01:23,000
if you burn that in a modern

26
0:01:24.212,000 --> 0:01:26,000
General Electric natural gas turbine,

27
0:01:26.407,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you'll get about 60 percent efficiency.

28
0:01:28.245,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,

29
0:01:30.956,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you get about 20 percent efficiency.

30
0:01:32.856,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,

31
0:01:34.436,000 --> 0:01:36,000
you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,

32
0:01:36.804,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is voluminous,

33
0:01:38.519,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and you can take the waste heat

34
0:01:39.973,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and run a steam turbine and generate

35
0:01:41.342,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a secondary power source.

36
0:01:43.126,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,

37
0:01:46.912,000 --> 0:01:49,000
even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off

38
0:01:50.316,000 --> 0:01:52,000
charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.

39
0:01:52.788,000 --> 0:01:54,000
CA: That scale delivers efficiency.

40
0:01:54.899,000 --> 0:01:55,000
EM: Yes, it does.

41
0:01:56.638,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means

42
0:01:59.656,000 --> 0:02:01,000
of power generation anyway, electricity generation.

43
0:02:02.059,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,

44
0:02:05.128,000 --> 0:02:08,000
then it makes sense for us to have electric cars

45
0:02:08.593,000 --> 0:02:1,000
as the mode of transport.

46
0:02:11.168,000 --> 0:02:12,000
CA: So we've got some video here

47
0:02:12.603,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of the Tesla being assembled,

48
0:02:15.094,000 --> 0:02:17,000
which, if we could play that first video --

49
0:02:17.808,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?

50
0:02:22.752,000 --> 0:02:25,000
EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,

51
0:02:26.328,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and I should say that I think, actually,

52
0:02:28.398,000 --> 0:02:3,000
all modes of transport will become fully electric

53
0:02:30.856,000 --> 0:02:35,000
with the ironic exception of rockets.

54
0:02:35.923,000 --> 0:02:37,000
There's just no way around Newton's third law.

55
0:02:38.68,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The question is how do you accelerate

56
0:02:42.132,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the advent of electric transport?

57
0:02:43.712,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with

58
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
a really energy efficient car,

59
0:02:48.487,000 --> 0:02:49,000
so that means making it incredibly light,

60
0:02:50.344,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and so what you're seeing here

61
0:02:51.37,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car

62
0:02:54.116,000 --> 0:02:55,000
made in North America.

63
0:02:55.702,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques

64
0:02:58.39,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.

65
0:03:02.007,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient

66
0:03:04.167,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of any car of its size.

67
0:03:05.535,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So as a result, the energy usage is very low,

68
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and it has the most advanced battery pack,

69
0:03:11.416,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and that's what gives it the range that's competitive,

70
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.

71
0:03:16.939,000 --> 0:03:19,000
CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,

72
0:03:20.528,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but you think the math can still work out intelligently --

73
0:03:23.799,000 --> 0:03:25,000
by combining light body, heavy battery,

74
0:03:25.935,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you can still gain spectacular efficiency.

75
0:03:28.208,000 --> 0:03:29,000
EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light

76
0:03:30.04,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to offset the mass of the pack,

77
0:03:31.801,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.

78
0:03:34.83,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And in fact, customers of the Model S

79
0:03:38.555,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are sort of competing with each other

80
0:03:39.634,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to try to get the highest possible range.

81
0:03:42.653,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.

82
0:03:46.183,000 --> 0:03:49,000
CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,

83
0:03:49.271,000 --> 0:03:51,000
broke the world record.EM: Congratulations.

84
0:03:51.861,000 --> 0:03:52,000
CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that

85
0:03:53.473,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed

86
0:03:56.287,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)

87
0:04:00.199,000 --> 0:04:03,000
EM: I mean, you can certainly drive --

88
0:04:04.089,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if you drive it 65 miles an hour,

89
0:04:06.727,000 --> 0:04:07,000
under normal conditions,

90
0:04:08.691,000 --> 0:04:09,000
250 miles is a reasonable number.

91
0:04:10.575,000 --> 0:04:11,000
CA: Let's show that second video

92
0:04:11.713,000 --> 0:04:13,000
showing the Tesla in action on ice.

93
0:04:14.559,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.

94
0:04:17.227,000 --> 0:04:19,000
What is the most surprising thing about the experience

95
0:04:19.642,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of driving the car?

96
0:04:21.15,000 --> 0:04:22,000
EM: In creating an electric car,

97
0:04:22.628,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the responsiveness of the car is really incredible.

98
0:04:25.026,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So we wanted really to have people feel as though

99
0:04:27.713,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they've almost got to mind meld with the car,

100
0:04:29.816,000 --> 0:04:32,000
so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,

101
0:04:32.99,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,

102
0:04:37.036,000 --> 0:04:38,000
like the car has ESP.

103
0:04:38.87,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.

104
0:04:41.366,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You can't do that with a gasoline car.

105
0:04:43.493,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I think that's really a profound difference,

106
0:04:45.475,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and people only experience that when they have a test drive.

107
0:04:48.262,000 --> 0:04:52,000
CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.

108
0:04:52.556,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Is there a road map where this becomes

109
0:04:56.131,000 --> 0:04:57,000
a mass-market vehicle?

110
0:04:57.71,000 --> 0:04:59,000
EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been

111
0:05:00.27,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to have a sort of three-step process,

112
0:05:02.542,000 --> 0:05:05,000
where version one was an expensive car at low volume,

113
0:05:06.308,000 --> 0:05:09,000
version two is medium priced and medium volume,

114
0:05:09.373,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and then version three would be low price, high volume.

115
0:05:11.662,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So we're at step two at this point.

116
0:05:13.345,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.

117
0:05:16.295,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.

118
0:05:19.294,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And our third generation car, which should hopefully

119
0:05:21.398,000 --> 0:05:22,000
be out in about three or four years

120
0:05:23.127,000 --> 0:05:25,000
will be a $30,000 car.

121
0:05:25.782,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But whenever you've got really new technology,

122
0:05:28.264,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it generally takes about three major versions

123
0:05:30.358,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in order to make it a compelling mass-market product.

124
0:05:33.578,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And so I think we're making progress in that direction,

125
0:05:36.302,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and I feel confident that we'll get there.

126
0:05:38.574,000 --> 0:05:39,000
CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,

127
0:05:40.483,000 --> 0:05:43,000
you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.

128
0:05:44.231,000 --> 0:05:48,000
There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.

129
0:05:48.478,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Do you see that coming, really, truly,

130
0:05:51.318,000 --> 0:05:53,000
or just on a few key routes?

131
0:05:53.571,000 --> 0:05:55,000
EM: There actually are far more charging stations

132
0:05:56.446,000 --> 0:05:58,000
than people realize,

133
0:05:58.671,000 --> 0:06:,000
and at Tesla we developed something

134
0:06:01.03,000 --> 0:06:03,000
called a Supercharging technology,

135
0:06:03.238,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we're offering that if you buy a Model S

136
0:06:06.55,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for free, forever.

137
0:06:08.015,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.

138
0:06:10.67,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We actually have California and Nevada covered,

139
0:06:13.5,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and we've got the Eastern seaboard

140
0:06:15.774,000 --> 0:06:17,000
from Boston to D.C. covered.

141
0:06:18.026,000 --> 0:06:19,000
By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive

142
0:06:19.408,000 --> 0:06:21,000
from L.A. to New York

143
0:06:21.551,000 --> 0:06:22,000
just using the Supercharger network,

144
0:06:23.153,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which charges at five times the rate of anything else.

145
0:06:27.37,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,

146
0:06:31.796,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to stop time, of about six or seven.

147
0:06:34.795,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So if you drive for three hours,

148
0:06:37.025,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,

149
0:06:38.663,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because that's normally what people will stop for.

150
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,

151
0:06:43.28,000 --> 0:06:45,000
by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,

152
0:06:45.818,000 --> 0:06:46,000
hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.

153
0:06:47.557,000 --> 0:06:5,000
CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.

154
0:06:50.914,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.

155
0:06:54.89,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Wait for an hour, but the good news is,

156
0:06:56.857,000 --> 0:06:57,000
you're helping save the planet,

157
0:06:58.296,000 --> 0:07:,000
and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.

158
0:07:00.989,000 --> 0:07:01,000
EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people

159
0:07:02.853,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.

160
0:07:06.378,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles

161
0:07:14.106,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and then stop for half an hour

162
0:07:16.204,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and then keep going.

163
0:07:17.569,000 --> 0:07:2,000
That's the natural cadence of a trip.

164
0:07:20.851,000 --> 0:07:24,000
CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.

165
0:07:25.232,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You've been working on this solar company SolarCity.

166
0:07:27.874,000 --> 0:07:29,000
What's unusual about that?

167
0:07:30.386,000 --> 0:07:32,000
EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,

168
0:07:32.746,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we have to have sustainable electricity production

169
0:07:36.386,000 --> 0:07:37,000
as well as consumption,

170
0:07:38.034,000 --> 0:07:41,000
so I'm quite confident that the primary means

171
0:07:41.856,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of power generation will be solar.

172
0:07:44.337,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.

173
0:07:46.672,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,

174
0:07:49.906,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy

175
0:07:52.798,000 --> 0:07:54,000
for purposes of human civilization.

176
0:07:55.674,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What most people know but don't realize they know

177
0:07:57.68,000 --> 0:08:,000
is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.

178
0:08:01.034,000 --> 0:08:04,000
If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball

179
0:08:04.274,000 --> 0:08:06,000
at three degrees Kelvin,

180
0:08:06.436,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.

181
0:08:10.234,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The whole ecosystem is solar-powered.

182
0:08:12.89,000 --> 0:08:14,000
CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,

183
0:08:15.241,000 --> 0:08:17,000
effectively, thousands of years of sun power

184
0:08:17.505,000 --> 0:08:19,000
compressed into a small space,

185
0:08:19.57,000 --> 0:08:21,000
so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,

186
0:08:22.549,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,

187
0:08:25.638,000 --> 0:08:28,000
fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?

188
0:08:29.082,000 --> 0:08:32,000
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar

189
0:08:32.391,000 --> 0:08:35,000
will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.

190
0:08:36.307,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Applause)CA: How?

191
0:08:38.694,000 --> 0:08:41,000
EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.

192
0:08:42.267,000 --> 0:08:45,000
CA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.

193
0:08:45.301,000 --> 0:08:46,000
What are you doing?

194
0:08:46.452,000 --> 0:08:49,000
EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system

195
0:08:49.7,000 --> 0:08:5,000
or you can lease a solar system.

196
0:08:51.242,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Most people choose to lease.

197
0:08:53.232,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And the thing about solar power is that

198
0:08:55.298,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,

199
0:08:58.049,000 --> 0:09:01,000
so once it's installed, it's just there.

200
0:09:01.274,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.

201
0:09:05.775,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost

202
0:09:08.713,000 --> 0:09:09,000
of that initial installation low,

203
0:09:10.688,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then get the cost of the financing low,

204
0:09:13.323,000 --> 0:09:16,000
because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.

205
0:09:16.947,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And we've made huge progress in that direction,

206
0:09:20.363,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.

207
0:09:23.931,000 --> 0:09:25,000
CA: So your current proposition to consumers is,

208
0:09:26.708,000 --> 0:09:28,000
don't pay so much up front.

209
0:09:28.924,000 --> 0:09:3,000
EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.

210
0:09:31.604,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We will install panels on your roof.

211
0:09:34.243,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You will then pay, how long is a typical lease?

212
0:09:37.844,000 --> 0:09:4,000
EM: Typical leases are 20 years,

213
0:09:41.088,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.

214
0:09:45.751,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.

215
0:09:49.901,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Pretty good deal.

216
0:09:51.781,000 --> 0:09:52,000
CA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.

217
0:09:53.694,000 --> 0:09:55,000
No risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.

218
0:09:56.149,000 --> 0:09:58,000
For you, the dream here then is that --

219
0:09:58.544,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?

220
0:10:03.319,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I mean, how do you, the company, benefit?

221
0:10:06.501,000 --> 0:10:09,000
EM: Well, essentially,

222
0:10:10.043,000 --> 0:10:15,000
SolarCity raises a chunk of capital

223
0:10:15.93,000 --> 0:10:18,000
from say, a company or a bank.

224
0:10:19.6,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Google is one of our big partners here.

225
0:10:21.813,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And they have an expected return on that capital.

226
0:10:24.237,000 --> 0:10:28,000
With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof

227
0:10:28.623,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and then charges the homeowner or business owner

228
0:10:32.069,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.

229
0:10:35.779,000 --> 0:10:38,000
CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.

230
0:10:39.292,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.

231
0:10:43.056,000 --> 0:10:44,000
EM: Exactly. What it amounts to

232
0:10:44.731,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is a giant distributed utility.

233
0:10:48.072,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I think it's a good thing, because utilities

234
0:10:50.955,000 --> 0:10:52,000
have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.

235
0:10:53.792,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So effectively it's the first time

236
0:10:55.887,000 --> 0:10:58,000
there's been competition for this monopoly,

237
0:10:59.152,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because the utilities have been the only ones

238
0:11:02.152,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.

239
0:11:04.799,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So I think it's actually very empowering

240
0:11:06.69,000 --> 0:11:08,000
for homeowners and businesses.

241
0:11:09.327,000 --> 0:11:1,000
CA: And you really picture a future

242
0:11:10.685,000 --> 0:11:13,000
where a majority of power in America,

243
0:11:14.604,000 --> 0:11:18,000
within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?

244
0:11:19.306,000 --> 0:11:24,000
EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,

245
0:11:25.104,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and most likely a majority,

246
0:11:27.216,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.

247
0:11:32.476,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I made that bet with someone —CA: Definition of plurality is?

248
0:11:35.944,000 --> 0:11:36,000
EM: More from solar than any other source.

249
0:11:37.69,000 --> 0:11:4,000
CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?

250
0:11:41.448,000 --> 0:11:44,000
EM: With a friend who will remain nameless.

251
0:11:44.848,000 --> 0:11:48,000
CA: Just between us. (Laughter)

252
0:11:49.168,000 --> 0:11:51,000
EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,

253
0:11:51.96,000 --> 0:11:52,000
so in roughly 18 years,

254
0:11:53.763,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.

255
0:11:57.32,000 --> 0:11:58,000
CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made

256
0:11:59.089,000 --> 0:12:01,000
with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.

257
0:12:01.305,000 --> 0:12:05,000
You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.

258
0:12:06.082,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You decided to build a space company.

259
0:12:08.518,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Why on Earth would someone do that?

260
0:12:10.591,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

261
0:12:12.771,000 --> 0:12:14,000
EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.

262
0:12:15.584,000 --> 0:12:17,000
People would say, "Did you hear the joke about the guy

263
0:12:17.843,000 --> 0:12:19,000
who made a small fortune in the space industry?"

264
0:12:20.744,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Obviously, "He started with a large one," is the punchline.

265
0:12:24.992,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out

266
0:12:27.538,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.

267
0:12:29.825,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And they'd look at me, like, "Is he serious?"

268
0:12:32.866,000 --> 0:12:37,000
CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?

269
0:12:37.928,000 --> 0:12:4,000
EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.

270
0:12:41.11,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We came very close to failure,

271
0:12:42.86,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but we managed to get through that point in 2008.

272
0:12:45.994,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,

273
0:12:52.144,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and in particular to try to crack a problem

274
0:12:54.098,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that I think is vital

275
0:12:55.682,000 --> 0:12:57,000
for humanity to become a space-faring civilization,

276
0:12:57.709,000 --> 0:13:01,000
which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.

277
0:13:02.593,000 --> 0:13:05,000
CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?

278
0:13:05.684,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?

279
0:13:09.698,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You've dreamed of Mars and beyond?

280
0:13:13.077,000 --> 0:13:15,000
EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,

281
0:13:15.213,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.

282
0:13:16.609,000 --> 0:13:17,000
It was really more from the standpoint of

283
0:13:18.594,000 --> 0:13:21,000
what are the things that need to happen in order for

284
0:13:22.464,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the future to be an exciting and inspiring one?

285
0:13:25.284,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And I really think there's a fundamental difference,

286
0:13:29.373,000 --> 0:13:3,000
if you sort of look into the future,

287
0:13:30.769,000 --> 0:13:33,000
between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,

288
0:13:34.226,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,

289
0:13:37.341,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and I think that's really exciting,

290
0:13:39.553,000 --> 0:13:42,000
compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth

291
0:13:42.724,000 --> 0:13:44,000
until some eventual extinction event.

292
0:13:45.012,000 --> 0:13:46,000
CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building

293
0:13:46.764,000 --> 0:13:49,000
a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.

294
0:13:50.108,000 --> 0:13:52,000
How on Earth have you done that?

295
0:13:52.387,000 --> 0:13:55,000
NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?

296
0:13:55.498,000 --> 0:13:57,000
EM: Well, we've made significant advances

297
0:13:57.899,000 --> 0:13:59,000
in the technology of the airframe, the engines,

298
0:14:00.662,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the electronics and the launch operation.

299
0:14:03.883,000 --> 0:14:05,000
There's a long list of innovations

300
0:14:06.604,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that we've come up with there

301
0:14:08.772,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but --

302
0:14:14.447,000 --> 0:14:17,000
CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?

303
0:14:17.86,000 --> 0:14:19,000
You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.

304
0:14:20.475,000 --> 0:14:22,000
EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's

305
0:14:22.715,000 --> 0:14:24,000
more dangerous to patent than not to patent.

306
0:14:25.463,000 --> 0:14:27,000
EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,

307
0:14:28.159,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause)

308
0:14:32.628,000 --> 0:14:35,000
CA: That's really, really interesting.

309
0:14:36.047,000 --> 0:14:38,000
But the big innovation is still ahead,

310
0:14:38.676,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and you're working on it now. Tell us about this.

311
0:14:41.415,000 --> 0:14:42,000
EM: Right, so the big innovation—

312
0:14:43.104,000 --> 0:14:47,000
CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.

313
0:14:47.341,000 --> 0:14:51,000
EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that

314
0:14:51.415,000 --> 0:14:52,000
they're all expendable.

315
0:14:52.957,000 --> 0:14:54,000
All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.

316
0:14:55.219,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,

317
0:14:57.353,000 --> 0:14:59,000
but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,

318
0:15:00.279,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and the parts that were reusable

319
0:15:02.375,000 --> 0:15:07,000
took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.

320
0:15:07.431,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.

321
0:15:11.017,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Obviously that doesn't work very well for —

322
0:15:13.199,000 --> 0:15:16,000
CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?

323
0:15:16.419,000 --> 0:15:2,000
EM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages

324
0:15:20.75,000 --> 0:15:23,000
be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site

325
0:15:24.115,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours.

326
0:15:27.132,000 --> 0:15:31,000
CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)

327
0:15:31.815,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And so what a lot of people don't realize is,

328
0:15:35.023,000 --> 0:15:37,000
the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.

329
0:15:37.621,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It's much like on a jet.

330
0:15:39.325,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent

331
0:15:42.841,000 --> 0:15:43,000
of the cost of the rocket.

332
0:15:44.743,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So it's possible to achieve, let's say,

333
0:15:46.895,000 --> 0:15:48,000
roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight

334
0:15:49.735,000 --> 0:15:52,000
if you can effectively reuse the rocket.

335
0:15:52.815,000 --> 0:15:53,000
That's why it's so important.

336
0:15:54.255,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Every mode of transport that we use,

337
0:15:56.477,000 --> 0:15:58,000
whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,

338
0:15:59.407,000 --> 0:16:01,000
is reusable, but not rockets.

339
0:16:01.743,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.

340
0:16:05.031,000 --> 0:16:06,000
CA: You asked me the question earlier

341
0:16:06.498,000 --> 0:16:09,000
of how popular traveling on cruises would be

342
0:16:10.293,000 --> 0:16:16,000
if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.

343
0:16:16.428,000 --> 0:16:18,000
CA: Definitely more expensive.

344
0:16:18.623,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,

345
0:16:22.594,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,

346
0:16:26.767,000 --> 0:16:29,000
at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.

347
0:16:30.564,000 --> 0:16:32,000
You'd like to see a colony on Mars.

348
0:16:32.861,000 --> 0:16:35,000
EM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination

349
0:16:36.398,000 --> 0:16:39,000
of companies and governments, needs to make progress

350
0:16:39.431,000 --> 0:16:41,000
in the direction of making life multi-planetary,

351
0:16:42.39,000 --> 0:16:45,000
of establishing a base on another planet,

352
0:16:46.022,000 --> 0:16:48,000
on Mars -- being the only realistic option --

353
0:16:48.367,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and then building that base up

354
0:16:49.749,000 --> 0:16:51,000
until we're a true multi-planet species.

355
0:16:52.698,000 --> 0:16:54,000
CA: So progress on this "let's make it reusable,"

356
0:16:55.671,000 --> 0:16:58,000
how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.

357
0:16:59.49,000 --> 0:17:,000
How's it going?

358
0:17:00.595,000 --> 0:17:03,000
EM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently

359
0:17:03.759,000 --> 0:17:05,000
with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,

360
0:17:06.343,000 --> 0:17:1,000
where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,

361
0:17:10.519,000 --> 0:17:12,000
the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.

362
0:17:13.268,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And we've had some good tests.

363
0:17:16.304,000 --> 0:17:18,000
CA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.

364
0:17:18.365,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So that's just to give a sense of scale.

365
0:17:20.008,000 --> 0:17:21,000
We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash

366
0:17:21.448,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter)

367
0:17:25.303,000 --> 0:17:26,000
CA: All right, let's see that video then,

368
0:17:27.255,000 --> 0:17:29,000
because this is actually amazing when you think about it.

369
0:17:29.286,000 --> 0:17:34,000
You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then --

370
0:17:34.993,000 --> 0:17:35,000
EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size

371
0:17:36.911,000 --> 0:17:38,000
of a 12-story building.

372
0:17:39.537,000 --> 0:17:44,000
(Rocket launch)

373
0:17:50.358,000 --> 0:17:53,000
So now it's hovering at about 40 meters,

374
0:17:54.331,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and it's constantly adjusting

375
0:17:56.207,000 --> 0:17:58,000
the angle, the pitch and yaw of the main engine,

376
0:17:59.168,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters.

377
0:18:09.306,000 --> 0:18:15,000
CA: How cool is that? (Applause)

378
0:18:15.619,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Elon, how have you done this?

379
0:18:20.293,000 --> 0:18:25,000
These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity,

380
0:18:25.607,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,

381
0:18:28.285,000 --> 0:18:3,000
they're such ambitious projects at scale.

382
0:18:30.87,000 --> 0:18:32,000
How on Earth has one person

383
0:18:33.334,000 --> 0:18:35,000
been able to innovate in this way?

384
0:18:35.809,000 --> 0:18:36,000
What is it about you?

385
0:18:37.646,000 --> 0:18:42,000
EM: I don't know, actually.

386
0:18:43.042,000 --> 0:18:45,000
I don't have a good answer for you.

387
0:18:45.282,000 --> 0:18:48,000
I work a lot. I mean, a lot.

388
0:18:48.917,000 --> 0:18:5,000
CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right.

389
0:18:51.23,000 --> 0:18:54,000
CA: My theory is that you

390
0:18:54.794,000 --> 0:18:58,000
have an ability to think at a system level of design

391
0:18:58.95,000 --> 0:19:01,000
that pulls together design, technology and business,

392
0:19:02.593,000 --> 0:19:05,000
so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,

393
0:19:06.069,000 --> 0:19:08,000
into one package,

394
0:19:08.566,000 --> 0:19:1,000
synthesize it in a way that very few people can and --

395
0:19:10.925,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident

396
0:19:15.019,000 --> 0:19:19,000
in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.

397
0:19:19.635,000 --> 0:19:23,000
You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.

398
0:19:24.514,000 --> 0:19:26,000
I mean, almost no one can do that.

399
0:19:26.611,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?

400
0:19:29.883,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?

401
0:19:33.307,000 --> 0:19:34,000
It is truly amazing what you've done.

402
0:19:35.046,000 --> 0:19:37,000
EM: Well, thanks. Thank you.

403
0:19:37.055,000 --> 0:19:41,000
Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.

404
0:19:41.865,000 --> 0:19:43,000
It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.

405
0:19:44.489,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is,

406
0:19:49.243,000 --> 0:19:52,000
boil things down to their fundamental truths

407
0:19:52.618,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and reason up from there,

408
0:19:54.009,000 --> 0:19:56,000
as opposed to reasoning by analogy.

409
0:19:56.595,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Through most of our life, we get through life

410
0:19:58.809,000 --> 0:19:59,000
by reasoning by analogy,

411
0:19:59.897,000 --> 0:20:02,000
which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.

412
0:20:03.435,000 --> 0:20:04,000
And you have to do that.

413
0:20:04.915,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.

414
0:20:09.489,000 --> 0:20:11,000
But when you want to do something new,

415
0:20:11.633,000 --> 0:20:14,000
you have to apply the physics approach.

416
0:20:15.365,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Physics is really figuring out how to discover

417
0:20:17.613,000 --> 0:20:19,000
new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.

418
0:20:20.258,000 --> 0:20:21,000
It's really counterintuitive.

419
0:20:22.161,000 --> 0:20:24,000
So I think that's an important thing to do,

420
0:20:24.682,000 --> 0:20:28,000
and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,

421
0:20:29.24,000 --> 0:20:31,000
and solicit it, particularly from friends.

422
0:20:31.361,000 --> 0:20:34,000
This may sound like simple advice,

423
0:20:34.827,000 --> 0:20:36,000
but hardly anyone does that,

424
0:20:37.249,000 --> 0:20:39,000
and it's incredibly helpful.

425
0:20:39.601,000 --> 0:20:42,000
CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.

426
0:20:42.963,000 --> 0:20:43,000
Learn from this man.

427
0:20:44.247,000 --> 0:20:47,000
Elon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED.

428
0:20:47.737,000 --> 0:20:5,000
EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.

429
0:20:51.147,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Look at that. (Applause)

430
0:20:53.408,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Just take a bow. That was fantastic.

431
0:20:58.235,000 --> 0:20:59,000
Thank you so much.

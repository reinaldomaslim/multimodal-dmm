1
0:00:12.973,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Good morning.

2
0:00:14.068,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.

3
0:00:19.094,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But no, I wasn't born there.

4
0:00:21.803,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This was where I was born:

5
0:00:24.335,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Shanghai, at the height of the Cultural Revolution.

6
0:00:28.308,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My grandmother tells me that she heard

7
0:00:30.142,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the sound of gunfire along with my first cries.

8
0:00:33.155,000 --> 0:00:36,000
When I was growing up, I was told a story

9
0:00:36.91,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that explained all I ever needed to know about humanity.

10
0:00:40.515,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It went like this.

11
0:00:41.954,000 --> 0:00:44,000
All human societies develop in linear progression,

12
0:00:45.212,000 --> 0:00:48,000
beginning with primitive society, then slave society,

13
0:00:48.804,000 --> 0:00:51,000
feudalism, capitalism, socialism,

14
0:00:51.835,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and finally, guess where we end up?

15
0:00:54.179,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Communism!

16
0:00:57.303,000 --> 0:01:,000
Sooner or later, all of humanity,

17
0:01:01.015,000 --> 0:01:03,000
regardless of culture, language, nationality,

18
0:01:03.781,000 --> 0:01:05,000
will arrive at this final stage

19
0:01:06.237,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of political and social development.

20
0:01:08.67,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The entire world's peoples will be unified

21
0:01:10.926,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in this paradise on Earth

22
0:01:13.19,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and live happily ever after.

23
0:01:15.958,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But before we get there, we're engaged

24
0:01:18.245,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in a struggle between good and evil,

25
0:01:20.686,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism,

26
0:01:23.827,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and the good shall triumph.

27
0:01:25.774,000 --> 0:01:27,000
That, of course, was the meta-narrative

28
0:01:28.27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.

29
0:01:31.05,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the Chinese bought it.

30
0:01:33.652,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We were taught that grand story day in and day out.

31
0:01:36.565,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It became part of us, and we believed in it.

32
0:01:39.338,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The story was a bestseller.

33
0:01:41.532,000 --> 0:01:43,000
About one third of the entire world's population

34
0:01:43.842,000 --> 0:01:45,000
lived under that meta-narrative.

35
0:01:46.495,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Then, the world changed overnight.

36
0:01:49.262,000 --> 0:01:52,000
As for me, disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth,

37
0:01:52.908,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I went to America and became a Berkeley hippie.

38
0:01:55.821,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:59.02,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, as I was coming of age, something else happened.

40
0:02:02.736,000 --> 0:02:04,000
As if one big story wasn't enough,

41
0:02:04.932,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I was told another one.

42
0:02:07.444,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This one was just as grand.

43
0:02:10.676,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It also claims that all human societies

44
0:02:12.839,000 --> 0:02:15,000
develop in a linear progression towards a singular end.

45
0:02:16.684,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This one went as follows:

46
0:02:19.209,000 --> 0:02:21,000
All societies, regardless of culture,

47
0:02:21.565,000 --> 0:02:23,000
be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,

48
0:02:24.255,000 --> 0:02:26,000
must progress from traditional societies

49
0:02:26.984,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in which groups are the basic units

50
0:02:29.53,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to modern societies in which atomized individuals

51
0:02:33.031,000 --> 0:02:34,000
are the sovereign units,

52
0:02:34.494,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and all these individuals are, by definition, rational,

53
0:02:38.237,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and they all want one thing:

54
0:02:40.303,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the vote.

55
0:02:42.803,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Because they are all rational, once given the vote,

56
0:02:45.463,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they produce good government

57
0:02:46.897,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and live happily ever after.

58
0:02:49.096,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Paradise on Earth, again.

59
0:02:52.015,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Sooner or later, electoral democracy will be

60
0:02:55.116,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the only political system for all countries and all peoples,

61
0:02:59.127,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with a free market to make them all rich.

62
0:03:01.591,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle

63
0:03:05.141,000 --> 0:03:06,000
between good and evil.

64
0:03:06.834,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:08.394,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The good belongs to those who are democracies

66
0:03:10.632,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and are charged with a mission of spreading it

67
0:03:12.847,000 --> 0:03:15,000
around the globe, sometimes by force,

68
0:03:16.04,000 --> 0:03:19,000
against the evil of those who do not hold elections.

69
0:03:19.466,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Video) George H.W. Bush: A new world order...

70
0:03:21.356,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Video) George W. Bush:... ending tyranny in our world...

71
0:03:24.047,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Video) Barack Obama:... a single standard for all

72
0:03:26.5,000 --> 0:03:28,000
who would hold power.

73
0:03:28.84,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Eric X. Li: Now --

74
0:03:30.644,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

75
0:03:38.325,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This story also became a bestseller.

76
0:03:42.348,000 --> 0:03:43,000
According to Freedom House,

77
0:03:44.215,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the number of democracies went from 45 in 1970

78
0:03:47.218,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to 115 in 2010.

79
0:03:49.753,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In the last 20 years, Western elites tirelessly

80
0:03:52.947,000 --> 0:03:55,000
trotted around the globe selling this prospectus:

81
0:03:56.242,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Multiple parties fight for political power

82
0:03:58.857,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and everyone voting on them

83
0:04:00.403,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is the only path to salvation

84
0:04:02.424,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to the long-suffering developing world.

85
0:04:05.191,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Those who buy the prospectus are destined for success.

86
0:04:08.303,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Those who do not are doomed to fail.

87
0:04:11.395,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.

88
0:04:14.593,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Fool me once...

89
0:04:17.112,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:21.681,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The rest is history.

91
0:04:23.983,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In just 30 years, China went from

92
0:04:25.579,000 --> 0:04:27,000
one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world

93
0:04:28.175,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to its second-largest economy.

94
0:04:30.098,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Six hundred fifty million people

95
0:04:32.154,000 --> 0:04:33,000
were lifted out of poverty.

96
0:04:33.769,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Eighty percent of the entire world's poverty alleviation

97
0:04:36.757,000 --> 0:04:38,000
during that period happened in China.

98
0:04:38.982,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In other words, all the new and old democracies

99
0:04:41.631,000 --> 0:04:44,000
put together amounted to a mere fraction

100
0:04:44.699,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of what a single, one-party state did without voting.

101
0:04:49.968,000 --> 0:04:52,000
See, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.

102
0:04:53.146,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams

103
0:04:55.079,000 --> 0:04:57,000
per person per month at one point.

104
0:04:57.671,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Needless to say, I ate all my grandmother's portions.

105
0:05:01.842,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So I asked myself, what's wrong with this picture?

106
0:05:05.577,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Here I am in my hometown,

107
0:05:07.578,000 --> 0:05:08,000
my business growing leaps and bounds.

108
0:05:09.364,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Entrepreneurs are starting companies every day.

109
0:05:11.663,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Middle class is expanding in speed and scale

110
0:05:14.744,000 --> 0:05:15,000
unprecedented in human history.

111
0:05:16.745,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Yet, according to the grand story,

112
0:05:19.282,000 --> 0:05:21,000
none of this should be happening.

113
0:05:22.217,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So I went and did the only thing I could. I studied it.

114
0:05:25.423,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Yes, China is a one-party state

115
0:05:27.43,000 --> 0:05:3,000
run by the Chinese Communist Party, the Party,

116
0:05:31.315,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and they don't hold elections.

117
0:05:33.267,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Three assumptions are made

118
0:05:35.826,000 --> 0:05:37,000
by the dominant political theories of our time.

119
0:05:38.48,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Such a system is operationally rigid,

120
0:05:41.363,000 --> 0:05:44,000
politically closed, and morally illegitimate.

121
0:05:45.049,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Well, the assumptions are wrong.

122
0:05:48.259,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The opposites are true.

123
0:05:50.469,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy

124
0:05:53.807,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are the three defining characteristics

125
0:05:55.741,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of China's one-party system.

126
0:05:58.112,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, most political scientists will tell us

127
0:06:00.184,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that a one-party system is inherently incapable

128
0:06:03.369,000 --> 0:06:04,000
of self-correction.

129
0:06:05.297,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It won't last long because it cannot adapt.

130
0:06:07.615,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now here are the facts.

131
0:06:09.413,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In 64 years of running the largest country in the world,

132
0:06:12.973,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the range of the Party's policies has been wider

133
0:06:15.533,000 --> 0:06:17,000
than any other country in recent memory,

134
0:06:18.45,000 --> 0:06:21,000
from radical land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward,

135
0:06:22.421,000 --> 0:06:24,000
then privatization of farmland,

136
0:06:25.073,000 --> 0:06:27,000
then the Cultural Revolution,

137
0:06:27.369,000 --> 0:06:29,000
then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,

138
0:06:30.065,000 --> 0:06:33,000
then successor Jiang Zemin took the giant political step

139
0:06:33.478,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of opening up Party membership to private businesspeople,

140
0:06:36.626,000 --> 0:06:39,000
something unimaginable during Mao's rule.

141
0:06:39.689,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So the Party self-corrects in rather dramatic fashions.

142
0:06:43.51,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Institutionally, new rules get enacted

143
0:06:46.14,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to correct previous dysfunctions.

144
0:06:48.719,000 --> 0:06:49,000
For example, term limits.

145
0:06:50.593,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Political leaders used to retain their positions for life,

146
0:06:53.379,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and they used that to accumulate power

147
0:06:55.213,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and perpetuate their rules.

148
0:06:56.782,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Mao was the father of modern China,

149
0:06:59.002,000 --> 0:07:01,000
yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes.

150
0:07:01.874,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So the Party instituted term limits

151
0:07:04.034,000 --> 0:07:07,000
with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.

152
0:07:07.787,000 --> 0:07:09,000
One thing we often hear is,

153
0:07:10.036,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"Political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms,"

154
0:07:13.214,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and "China is in dire need of political reform."

155
0:07:16.488,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But this claim is a rhetorical trap

156
0:07:19.447,000 --> 0:07:21,000
hidden behind a political bias.

157
0:07:22.063,000 --> 0:07:24,000
See, some have decided a priori

158
0:07:24.56,000 --> 0:07:25,000
what kinds of changes they want to see,

159
0:07:26.442,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and only such changes can be called political reform.

160
0:07:30.049,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The truth is, political reforms have never stopped.

161
0:07:33.009,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Compared with 30 years ago, 20 years, even 10 years ago,

162
0:07:36.242,000 --> 0:07:38,000
every aspect of Chinese society,

163
0:07:38.632,000 --> 0:07:38,000
how the country is governed,

164
0:07:39.504,000 --> 0:07:41,000
from the most local level to the highest center,

165
0:07:41.814,000 --> 0:07:43,000
are unrecognizable today.

166
0:07:44.237,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now such changes are simply not possible

167
0:07:47.423,000 --> 0:07:5,000
without political reforms of the most fundamental kind.

168
0:07:51.143,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now I would venture to suggest the Party

169
0:07:53.336,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is the world's leading expert in political reform.

170
0:07:57.443,000 --> 0:08:,000
The second assumption is that in a one-party state,

171
0:08:00.475,000 --> 0:08:02,000
power gets concentrated in the hands of the few,

172
0:08:03.206,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and bad governance and corruption follow.

173
0:08:05.908,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Indeed, corruption is a big problem,

174
0:08:08.081,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but let's first look at the larger context.

175
0:08:10.215,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.

176
0:08:12.343,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The Party happens to be one of the most meritocratic

177
0:08:15.362,000 --> 0:08:17,000
political institutions in the world today.

178
0:08:18.158,000 --> 0:08:22,000
China's highest ruling body, the Politburo, has 25 members.

179
0:08:22.259,000 --> 0:08:24,000
In the most recent one, only five of them

180
0:08:24.347,000 --> 0:08:27,000
came from a background of privilege, so-called princelings.

181
0:08:27.969,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The other 20, including the president and the premier,

182
0:08:30.565,000 --> 0:08:32,000
came from entirely ordinary backgrounds.

183
0:08:33.22,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In the larger central committee of 300 or more,

184
0:08:35.661,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the percentage of those who were born

185
0:08:37.528,000 --> 0:08:39,000
into power and wealth was even smaller.

186
0:08:39.987,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The vast majority of senior Chinese leaders

187
0:08:42.817,000 --> 0:08:44,000
worked and competed their way to the top.

188
0:08:45.462,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Compare that with the ruling elites

189
0:08:47.594,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in both developed and developing countries,

190
0:08:49.696,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I think you'll find the Party being near the top

191
0:08:52.206,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in upward mobility.

192
0:08:54.84,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The question then is, how could that be possible

193
0:08:57.369,000 --> 0:09:,000
in a system run by one party?

194
0:09:00.588,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now we come to a powerful political institution,

195
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
little-known to Westerners:

196
0:09:04.997,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the Party's Organization Department.

197
0:09:07.648,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The department functions like a giant

198
0:09:09.848,000 --> 0:09:11,000
human resource engine that would be the envy

199
0:09:12.224,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of even some of the most successful corporations.

200
0:09:15.554,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It operates a rotating pyramid

201
0:09:17.823,000 --> 0:09:18,000
made up of three components:

202
0:09:19.19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
civil service, state-owned enterprises,

203
0:09:21.746,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and social organizations like a university

204
0:09:23.99,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or a community program.

205
0:09:26.128,000 --> 0:09:28,000
They form separate yet integrated career paths

206
0:09:28.639,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for Chinese officials.

207
0:09:30.543,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They recruit college grads into entry-level positions

208
0:09:33.628,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in all three tracks, and they start from the bottom,

209
0:09:36.378,000 --> 0:09:37,000
called "keyuan" [clerk].

210
0:09:37.934,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Then they could get promoted

211
0:09:39.317,000 --> 0:09:44,000
through four increasingly elite ranks:

212
0:09:44.433,000 --> 0:09:47,000
fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu [deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].

213
0:09:47.745,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now these are not moves from "Karate Kid," okay?

214
0:09:50.055,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's serious business.

215
0:09:53.399,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The range of positions is wide,

216
0:09:55.736,000 --> 0:09:56,000
from running health care in a village

217
0:09:57.522,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to foreign investment in a city district

218
0:09:59.583,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to manager in a company.

219
0:10:01.708,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Once a year, the department reviews their performance.

220
0:10:04.304,000 --> 0:10:06,000
They interview their superiors, their peers,

221
0:10:06.639,000 --> 0:10:08,000
their subordinates. They vet their personal conduct.

222
0:10:09.42,000 --> 0:10:11,000
They conduct public opinion surveys.

223
0:10:11.452,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Then they promote the winners.

224
0:10:13.415,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Throughout their careers, these cadres

225
0:10:15.249,000 --> 0:10:17,000
can move through and out of all three tracks.

226
0:10:18.083,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Over time, the good ones move beyond the four base levels

227
0:10:20.961,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to the fuju [deputy bureau chief] and ju [bureau chief] levels.

228
0:10:23.985,000 --> 0:10:25,000
There, they enter high officialdom.

229
0:10:26.497,000 --> 0:10:28,000
By that point, a typical assignment will be

230
0:10:28.657,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to manage a district with a population in the millions

231
0:10:31.516,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

232
0:10:35.047,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Just to show you how competitive the system is,

233
0:10:38.976,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in 2012, there were 900,000 fuke and ke levels,

234
0:10:42.694,000 --> 0:10:44,000
600,000 fuchu and chu levels,

235
0:10:45.518,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.

236
0:10:48.953,000 --> 0:10:49,000
After the ju levels,

237
0:10:50.681,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the best few move further up several more ranks,

238
0:10:53.282,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and eventually make it to the Central Committee.

239
0:10:56.413,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The process takes two to three decades.

240
0:10:59.165,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Does patronage play a role? Yes, of course.

241
0:11:02.274,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But merit remains the fundamental driver.

242
0:11:05.846,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In essence, the Organization Department runs

243
0:11:08.376,000 --> 0:11:1,000
a modernized version of China's centuries-old

244
0:11:10.849,000 --> 0:11:12,000
mentoring system.

245
0:11:12.913,000 --> 0:11:14,000
China's new president, Xi Jinping,

246
0:11:15.004,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is the son of a former leader, which is very unusual,

247
0:11:17.583,000 --> 0:11:19,000
first of his kind to make the top job.

248
0:11:19.803,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Even for him, the career took 30 years.

249
0:11:22.698,000 --> 0:11:23,000
He started as a village manager,

250
0:11:24.566,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and by the time he entered the Politburo,

251
0:11:26.543,000 --> 0:11:28,000
he had managed areas with a total population

252
0:11:28.684,000 --> 0:11:29,000
of 150 million people

253
0:11:30.288,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars.

254
0:11:34.734,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Now, please don't get me wrong, okay?

255
0:11:37.054,000 --> 0:11:4,000
This is not a put-down of anyone. It's just a statement of fact.

256
0:11:40.308,000 --> 0:11:43,000
George W. Bush, remember him?

257
0:11:44.142,000 --> 0:11:46,000
This is not a put-down.

258
0:11:46.583,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

259
0:11:47.388,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Before becoming governor of Texas,

260
0:11:50.487,000 --> 0:11:52,000
or Barack Obama before running for president,

261
0:11:53.106,000 --> 0:11:55,000
could not make even a small county manager

262
0:11:55.865,000 --> 0:11:56,000
in China's system.

263
0:11:57.793,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Winston Churchill once said that democracy

264
0:11:59.817,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is a terrible system except for all the rest.

265
0:12:02.134,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Well, apparently he hadn't heard of the Organization Department.

266
0:12:06.415,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Now, Westerners always assume that

267
0:12:08.759,000 --> 0:12:1,000
multi-party election with universal suffrage

268
0:12:11.777,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is the only source of political legitimacy.

269
0:12:14.919,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I was asked once, "The Party wasn't voted in by election.

270
0:12:18.281,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Where is the source of legitimacy?"

271
0:12:20.511,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I said, "How about competency?"

272
0:12:24.073,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We all know the facts.

273
0:12:25.55,000 --> 0:12:26,000
In 1949, when the Party took power,

274
0:12:27.491,000 --> 0:12:3,000
China was mired in civil wars, dismembered by foreign aggression,

275
0:12:30.818,000 --> 0:12:34,000
average life expectancy at that time, 41 years old.

276
0:12:35.113,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Today, it's the second largest economy in the world,

277
0:12:38.023,000 --> 0:12:4,000
an industrial powerhouse, and its people live

278
0:12:40.626,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in increasing prosperity.

279
0:12:42.713,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Pew Research polls Chinese public attitudes,

280
0:12:45.866,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and here are the numbers in recent years.

281
0:12:47.923,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Satisfaction with the direction of the country: 85 percent.

282
0:12:52.423,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Those who think they're better off than five years ago:

283
0:12:55.067,000 --> 0:12:56,000
70 percent.

284
0:12:56.998,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Those who expect the future to be better:

285
0:12:59.382,000 --> 0:13:01,000
a whopping 82 percent.

286
0:13:02.046,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Financial Times polls global youth attitudes,

287
0:13:05.575,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and these numbers, brand new, just came from last week.

288
0:13:08.99,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Ninety-three percent of China's Generation Y

289
0:13:11.772,000 --> 0:13:13,000
are optimistic about their country's future.

290
0:13:14.358,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now, if this is not legitimacy, I'm not sure what is.

291
0:13:20.246,000 --> 0:13:23,000
In contrast, most electoral democracies around the world

292
0:13:23.415,000 --> 0:13:25,000
are suffering from dismal performance.

293
0:13:25.518,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I don't need to elaborate for this audience

294
0:13:27.833,000 --> 0:13:31,000
how dysfunctional it is, from Washington to European capitals.

295
0:13:32.17,000 --> 0:13:34,000
With a few exceptions, the vast number

296
0:13:35.059,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes

297
0:13:37.966,000 --> 0:13:4,000
are still suffering from poverty and civil strife.

298
0:13:41.777,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Governments get elected, and then they fall

299
0:13:43.849,000 --> 0:13:45,000
below 50 percent approval in a few months

300
0:13:46.452,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and stay there and get worse until the next election.

301
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle

302
0:13:52.423,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of elect and regret.

303
0:13:54.801,000 --> 0:13:57,000
At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,

304
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
not China's one-party system, that is in danger

305
0:14:00.95,000 --> 0:14:02,000
of losing legitimacy.

306
0:14:03.209,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now, I don't want to create the misimpression

307
0:14:06.059,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that China's hunky-dory, on the way

308
0:14:08.067,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to some kind of superpowerdom.

309
0:14:09.86,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The country faces enormous challenges.

310
0:14:12.819,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The social and economic problems that come

311
0:14:14.843,000 --> 0:14:17,000
with wrenching change like this are mind-boggling.

312
0:14:18.728,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Pollution is one. Food safety. Population issues.

313
0:14:22.275,000 --> 0:14:25,000
On the political front, the worst problem is corruption.

314
0:14:26.222,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Corruption is widespread and undermines the system

315
0:14:29.054,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and its moral legitimacy.

316
0:14:30.856,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.

317
0:14:33.703,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They say that corruption is the result of the one-party system,

318
0:14:36.612,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and therefore, in order to cure it,

319
0:14:38.303,000 --> 0:14:4,000
you have to do away with the entire system.

320
0:14:40.375,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But a more careful look would tell us otherwise.

321
0:14:43.252,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Transparency International ranks China

322
0:14:46.172,000 --> 0:14:49,000
between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries,

323
0:14:49.938,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and it's been moving up.

324
0:14:52.115,000 --> 0:14:54,000
India, the largest democracy in the world,

325
0:14:54.178,000 --> 0:14:56,000
94 and dropping.

326
0:14:56.325,000 --> 0:14:58,000
For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China,

327
0:14:59.207,000 --> 0:15:01,000
more than half of them are electoral democracies.

328
0:15:01.796,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So if election is the panacea for corruption,

329
0:15:05.091,000 --> 0:15:08,000
how come these countries can't fix it?

330
0:15:08.334,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now, I'm a venture capitalist. I make bets.

331
0:15:11.928,000 --> 0:15:13,000
It wouldn't be fair to end this talk without

332
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
putting myself on the line and making some predictions.

333
0:15:16.904,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So here they are.

334
0:15:18.609,000 --> 0:15:2,000
In the next 10 years, China will surpass the U.S.

335
0:15:21.411,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and become the largest economy in the world.

336
0:15:23.788,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Income per capita will be near the top

337
0:15:25.869,000 --> 0:15:27,000
of all developing countries.

338
0:15:28.051,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Corruption will be curbed, but not eliminated,

339
0:15:30.373,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and China will move up 10 to 20 notches

340
0:15:32.786,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to above 60 in T.I. ranking.

341
0:15:35.628,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Economic reform will accelerate, political reform will continue,

342
0:15:38.7,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and the one-party system will hold firm.

343
0:15:42.056,000 --> 0:15:45,000
We live in the dusk of an era.

344
0:15:45.214,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Meta-narratives that make universal claims

345
0:15:48.499,000 --> 0:15:49,000
failed us in the 20th century

346
0:15:50.46,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and are failing us in the 21st.

347
0:15:53.244,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Meta-narrative is the cancer

348
0:15:55.838,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that is killing democracy from the inside.

349
0:15:58.645,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Now, I want to clarify something.

350
0:16:00.412,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I'm not here to make an indictment of democracy.

351
0:16:02.932,000 --> 0:16:04,000
On the contrary, I think democracy contributed

352
0:16:05.525,000 --> 0:16:08,000
to the rise of the West and the creation of the modern world.

353
0:16:08.721,000 --> 0:16:11,000
It is the universal claim that many Western elites

354
0:16:11.832,000 --> 0:16:14,000
are making about their political system, the hubris,

355
0:16:15.321,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that is at the heart of the West's current ills.

356
0:16:18.56,000 --> 0:16:2,000
If they would spend just a little less time

357
0:16:20.865,000 --> 0:16:22,000
on trying to force their way onto others,

358
0:16:23.005,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and a little bit more on political reform at home,

359
0:16:26.672,000 --> 0:16:29,000
they might give their democracy a better chance.

360
0:16:30.062,000 --> 0:16:32,000
China's political model will never supplant

361
0:16:32.44,000 --> 0:16:34,000
electoral democracy, because unlike the latter,

362
0:16:34.76,000 --> 0:16:35,000
it doesn't pretend to be universal.

363
0:16:36.717,000 --> 0:16:39,000
It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely.

364
0:16:40.549,000 --> 0:16:42,000
The significance of China's example

365
0:16:43.148,000 --> 0:16:44,000
is not that it provides an alternative,

366
0:16:45.115,000 --> 0:16:49,000
but the demonstration that alternatives exist.

367
0:16:49.555,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Let us draw to a close this era of meta-narratives.

368
0:16:53.189,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals,

369
0:16:56.552,000 --> 0:17:,000
but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over.

370
0:17:00.653,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Let us stop telling people and our children

371
0:17:03.14,000 --> 0:17:05,000
there's only one way to govern ourselves

372
0:17:05.392,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and a singular future towards which

373
0:17:07.201,000 --> 0:17:09,000
all societies must evolve.

374
0:17:09.583,000 --> 0:17:11,000
It is wrong. It is irresponsible.

375
0:17:12.378,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And worst of all, it is boring.

376
0:17:16.616,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Let universality make way for plurality.

377
0:17:20.535,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us.

378
0:17:23.732,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Are we brave enough to welcome it?

379
0:17:25.944,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

380
0:17:27.138,000 --> 0:17:42,000
(Applause)

381
0:17:43.158,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

382
0:17:46.794,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Bruno Giussani: Eric, stay with me for a couple of minutes,

383
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:51,000
because I want to ask you a couple of questions.

384
0:17:51.714,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I think many here, and in general in Western countries,

385
0:17:55.242,000 --> 0:17:58,000
would agree with your statement about analysis

386
0:17:58.644,000 --> 0:18:,000
of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional,

387
0:18:01.349,000 --> 0:18:03,000
but at the same time, many would kind of find

388
0:18:04.276,000 --> 0:18:07,000
unsettling the thought that there is an unelected

389
0:18:08.221,000 --> 0:18:13,000
authority that, without any form of oversight or consultation,

390
0:18:13.617,000 --> 0:18:15,000
decides what the national interest is.

391
0:18:16.532,000 --> 0:18:18,000
What is the mechanism in the Chinese model

392
0:18:19.534,000 --> 0:18:21,000
that allows people to say, actually,

393
0:18:21.753,000 --> 0:18:23,000
the national interest as you defined it is wrong?

394
0:18:24.34,000 --> 0:18:28,000
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist,

395
0:18:28.402,000 --> 0:18:31,000
called the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism."

396
0:18:32.246,000 --> 0:18:35,000
It's not exactly right, but I think it comes close.

397
0:18:35.356,000 --> 0:18:38,000
So I know the largest public opinion survey company

398
0:18:39.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
in China, okay?

399
0:18:41.212,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Do you know who their biggest client is?

400
0:18:43.892,000 --> 0:18:44,000
The Chinese government.

401
0:18:45.738,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Not just from the central government,

402
0:18:48.204,000 --> 0:18:49,000
the city government, the provincial government,

403
0:18:49.628,000 --> 0:18:51,000
to the most local neighborhood districts.

404
0:18:51.707,000 --> 0:18:53,000
They conduct surveys all the time.

405
0:18:53.85,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Are you happy with the garbage collection?

406
0:18:56.46,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Are you happy with the general direction of the country?

407
0:18:58.572,000 --> 0:19:01,000
So there is, in China, there is a different kind of mechanism

408
0:19:01.833,000 --> 0:19:04,000
to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people.

409
0:19:05.394,000 --> 0:19:08,000
My point is, I think we should get unstuck

410
0:19:08.602,000 --> 0:19:1,000
from the thinking that there's only one political system --

411
0:19:11.033,000 --> 0:19:12,000
election, election, election --

412
0:19:12.578,000 --> 0:19:13,000
that could make it responsive.

413
0:19:14.306,000 --> 0:19:15,000
I'm not sure, actually, elections produce

414
0:19:16.29,000 --> 0:19:18,000
responsive government anymore in the world.

415
0:19:19.236,000 --> 0:19:23,000
(Applause)

416
0:19:23.943,000 --> 0:19:24,000
BG: Many seem to agree.

417
0:19:25.103,000 --> 0:19:27,000
One of the features of a democratic system

418
0:19:27.759,000 --> 0:19:3,000
is a space for civil society to express itself.

419
0:19:31.028,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And you have shown figures about the support

420
0:19:33.396,000 --> 0:19:35,000
that the government and the authorities have in China.

421
0:19:36.3,000 --> 0:19:39,000
But then you've just mentioned other elements

422
0:19:39.605,000 --> 0:19:41,000
like, you know, big challenges, and there are, of course,

423
0:19:41.759,000 --> 0:19:43,000
a lot of other data that go in a different direction:

424
0:19:44.685,000 --> 0:19:46,000
tens of thousands of unrests and protests

425
0:19:47.342,000 --> 0:19:49,000
and environmental protests, etc.

426
0:19:50.201,000 --> 0:19:52,000
So you seem to suggest the Chinese model

427
0:19:53.217,000 --> 0:19:55,000
doesn't have a space outside of the Party

428
0:19:55.328,000 --> 0:19:57,000
for civil society to express itself.

429
0:19:57.629,000 --> 0:20:01,000
EXL: There's a vibrant civil society in China,

430
0:20:01.807,000 --> 0:20:02,000
whether it's environment or what-have-you.

431
0:20:03.436,000 --> 0:20:05,000
But it's different. You wouldn't recognize it.

432
0:20:05.684,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Because, by Western definitions, a so-called civil society

433
0:20:08.566,000 --> 0:20:1,000
has to be separate or even in opposition

434
0:20:11.41,000 --> 0:20:12,000
to the political system,

435
0:20:13.101,000 --> 0:20:17,000
but that concept is alien for Chinese culture.

436
0:20:17.866,000 --> 0:20:19,000
For thousands of years, you have civil society,

437
0:20:20.339,000 --> 0:20:22,000
yet they are consistent and coherent

438
0:20:22.828,000 --> 0:20:24,000
and part of a political order, and I think

439
0:20:25.675,000 --> 0:20:28,000
it's a big cultural difference.

440
0:20:29.045,000 --> 0:20:32,000
BG: Eric, thank you for sharing this with TED. EXL: Thank you.

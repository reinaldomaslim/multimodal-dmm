1
0:00:13.032,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Look all around you.

2
0:00:14.586,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Whether you're in a subway, a park, an airport, a restaurant,

3
0:00:20.31,000 --> 0:00:21,000
even at this conference,

4
0:00:22.053,000 --> 0:00:25,000
all of you have a phone in your hands or maybe in your pockets.

5
0:00:25.465,000 --> 0:00:26,000
How many of you have a book?

6
0:00:27.315,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Very few, right?

7
0:00:29.069,000 --> 0:00:3,000
This is the sight that used to greet me

8
0:00:30.97,000 --> 0:00:32,000
every time I walked out of my office block.

9
0:00:33.101,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I was surrounded by a sea of 20-something professionals

10
0:00:36.776,000 --> 0:00:37,000
glued to their phones.

11
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And not a single one had a book in their hands.

12
0:00:41.6,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And this used to make me very, very frustrated.

13
0:00:44.505,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was a bookworm all my life.

14
0:00:46.695,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Books formed the milestones of my life.

15
0:00:49.427,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The first man I fell in love with was Mr. Darcy.

16
0:00:52.99,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I first read "Harry Potter" when I was 21, on a summer break from college.

17
0:00:58.601,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And I remember the first night I spent in a little flat I bought in my mid-20s,

18
0:01:03.014,000 --> 0:01:04,000
very proudly,

19
0:01:04.45,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I spent the whole night reading "The Da Vinci Code."

20
0:01:07.379,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And then I'm going to make a terrible confession:

21
0:01:09.712,000 --> 0:01:12,000
even today, when I'm low, I get into bed with "War and Peace."

22
0:01:13.415,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Don't laugh.

23
0:01:14.589,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:16.03,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But I was also like all those people I saw around me:

25
0:01:19.355,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I, too, lived on my phone.

26
0:01:21.053,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I ordered my groceries online,

27
0:01:23.561,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and soon my app knew that I needed a monthly dose of diapers.

28
0:01:28.339,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I booked my cinemas on my phone.

29
0:01:31.244,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I booked planes on my phone.

30
0:01:33.937,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And when I did the long commute back home like most urban Indians,

31
0:01:38.35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and was stuck in traffic,

32
0:01:40.167,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I passed the time on WhatsApp, video-chatting my twin.

33
0:01:45.437,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I was part of an extraordinary revolution that was happening in India.

34
0:01:49.827,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Indians are the second-largest users of smartphones in the world.

35
0:01:54.466,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And data prices have been slashed so radically

36
0:01:58.347,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that half of urban India and even a part of rural India

37
0:02:02.069,000 --> 0:02:05,000
now have a smartphone with a data connection in their hands.

38
0:02:05.371,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And if you know anything about India,

39
0:02:07.228,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you'll know that "half" means, like, all of America or something.

40
0:02:10.578,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You know, it's large numbers.

41
0:02:12.149,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:14.22,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And these numbers are just growing and growing and growing.

43
0:02:17.022,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They're exploding.

44
0:02:18.228,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And what they're doing is empowering Indians

45
0:02:20.324,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in all kinds of extraordinary ways.

46
0:02:22.806,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And yet, none of these changes that I was seeing around me

47
0:02:26.268,000 --> 0:02:28,000
were reflected in my world, my world of books.

48
0:02:30.006,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I live in a country the size of Europe,

49
0:02:33.125,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and it only has 50 decent bookshops.

50
0:02:36.053,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And Indians just didn't seem to want to read for fun.

51
0:02:39.314,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So if you look at all the best-seller lists in India,

52
0:02:41.849,000 --> 0:02:43,000
what you'll always find in the best-seller list

53
0:02:44.094,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is exam and professional guides.

54
0:02:45.933,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Imagine if you found the SAT guides as the "New York Times" number one seller,

55
0:02:49.953,000 --> 0:02:5,000
month after month.

56
0:02:53.659,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And yet, the smartphone revolution was creating readers and writers

57
0:02:58.484,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of a different kind.

58
0:03:00.254,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Whether it was on Facebook or WhatsApp,

59
0:03:03.119,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Indians were writing and sharing and reading all kinds of things:

60
0:03:07.984,000 --> 0:03:1,000
terrible jokes, spurious pop history,

61
0:03:11.722,000 --> 0:03:13,000
long, emotional confessions,

62
0:03:14.422,000 --> 0:03:16,000
diatribes against the government.

63
0:03:16.617,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And as I read and shared these things, I wondered to myself,

64
0:03:19.927,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"Could I get these writers and these readers,

65
0:03:24.213,000 --> 0:03:26,000
could I turn them into my readers?"

66
0:03:27.212,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And so I left my plush corner office

67
0:03:29.919,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and my job as the publisher of India's top publishing company,

68
0:03:34.315,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I set up on my own.

69
0:03:36.017,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I moved into a single large room in a cheap bohemian district of Delhi,

70
0:03:42.744,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with a small team.

71
0:03:44.402,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And there, I set up a new kind of publishing house.

72
0:03:48.355,000 --> 0:03:51,000
A new kind of publishing house needs a new kind of reader

73
0:03:51.789,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and a new kind of book.

74
0:03:54.218,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And so I asked myself, "What would this new reader want?

75
0:03:57.162,000 --> 0:04:,000
Would they prize urgency, relevance,

76
0:04:00.98,000 --> 0:04:02,000
timeliness, directness --

77
0:04:03.282,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the very qualities they seem to want from their online services,

78
0:04:06.982,000 --> 0:04:09,000
indeed, the qualities they seem to want from life today?"

79
0:04:11.149,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I knew that my readers were always on the go.

80
0:04:13.807,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I'd have to fit into their lifestyle and schedules.

81
0:04:16.752,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Would they actually want to read a 200-page book?

82
0:04:19.834,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Or would they want something a little bit more digestible?

83
0:04:23.676,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Indians are incredibly value-conscious,

84
0:04:26.676,000 --> 0:04:28,000
especially when it comes to their online reading.

85
0:04:29.244,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I knew I had to give them books under a dollar.

86
0:04:33.735,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And so my company was formed, and it was born.

87
0:04:37.191,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It was a platform where we created a list of stories designed for the smartphone,

88
0:04:43.45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but it also allowed amateur writers to upload their own stories,

89
0:04:47.649,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so they could be showcased along with the very writers

90
0:04:50.244,000 --> 0:04:51,000
they read and admired.

91
0:04:51.998,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And we could also enter into other people's digital platforms.

92
0:04:56.999,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, imagine this:

93
0:04:58.809,000 --> 0:05:01,000
imagine you're a receptionist, you've had a long day at work,

94
0:05:02.197,000 --> 0:05:04,000
you book your cab in your ride-hailing app,

95
0:05:04.668,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it shows up,

96
0:05:06.031,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and you get into your car, and you lie back on your seat,

97
0:05:08.935,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and you put on your app.

98
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And you find a set of stories waiting for you, timed to your journey.

99
0:05:16.347,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Imagine you're a gay young woman,

100
0:05:18.538,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in a relatively conservative city like Lucknow, which lies near Delhi.

101
0:05:23.3,000 --> 0:05:25,000
There's no way your parents know about your sexuality.

102
0:05:26.046,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They'd completely freak out.

103
0:05:28.403,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Would you like lesbian love stories written in Hindi, priced under a dollar,

104
0:05:34.339,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to be read in the privacy of your phone?

105
0:05:37.244,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And could I match readers

106
0:05:39.879,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to the events that were taking place around them in real time?

107
0:05:44.982,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So we published biographies of very famous politicians

108
0:05:49.18,000 --> 0:05:51,000
after they won big elections.

109
0:05:52.633,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When the supreme court decriminalized homosexuality,

110
0:05:56.212,000 --> 0:05:59,000
an LGBTQ collection was waiting on our home page.

111
0:06:00.482,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And when India's Toni Morrison, the great writer Mahasweta Devi died,

112
0:06:05.615,000 --> 0:06:08,000
our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit.

113
0:06:10.046,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The idea was to be relevant to every moment of a reader's life.

114
0:06:15.823,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Who are our readers?

115
0:06:17.562,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They're mostly young men under the age of 30.

116
0:06:20.681,000 --> 0:06:21,000
There's someone like Salil,

117
0:06:22.689,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who lives in a city where there isn't a modern bookshop.

118
0:06:25.792,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And he comes to our app almost every day.

119
0:06:28.852,000 --> 0:06:29,000
There's someone like Manoj,

120
0:06:30.702,000 --> 0:06:33,000
who mostly reads us during the long commute back home.

121
0:06:34.266,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And there's someone like Ahmed, who loves our nonfiction

122
0:06:37.885,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that he can read in a single sitting, and that's priced very low.

123
0:06:42.831,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Imagine if you're like a young, techie boy

124
0:06:45.856,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in India's Silicon Valley city of Bangalore.

125
0:06:51.031,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And one day, you get an in-app notification

126
0:06:53.602,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and it says that your favorite actress has written a sexy short story

127
0:06:57.077,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and it's waiting for you.

128
0:06:58.696,000 --> 0:07:,000
That's how we launched Juggernaut.

129
0:07:00.792,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We got a very famous ex-adult star, called Sunny Leone.

130
0:07:05.212,000 --> 0:07:08,000
She's India's most Googled person, as it happens.

131
0:07:08.371,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And we got her to write us a collection of sexy short stories

132
0:07:12.419,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that we published every night for a week.

133
0:07:14.982,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And it was a sensation.

134
0:07:16.434,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I mean, no one could believe that we'd asked Sunny Leone to write.

135
0:07:20.466,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But she did,

136
0:07:21.65,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and she proved everyone wrong,

137
0:07:24.236,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and she found this immense readership.

138
0:07:27.084,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And just as we've redefined what a book is and how a reader behaves,

139
0:07:32.728,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we're rethinking who an author is.

140
0:07:35.228,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In our amateur writing platform,

141
0:07:36.905,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we have writers that range from teenagers to housewives.

142
0:07:40.315,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And they're writing all kinds of things.

143
0:07:42.421,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It starts as small as a poem, an essay, a single short story ...

144
0:07:48.292,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Fifty percent of them are returning to the app to write again.

145
0:07:52.514,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Take someone like Neeraj.

146
0:07:54.024,000 --> 0:07:59,000
He's a middle-aged executive, wife, two kids, a good job.

147
0:07:59.053,000 --> 0:08:,000
And Neeraj loves to read.

148
0:08:00.839,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But every time Neeraj read a book that he loved,

149
0:08:03.697,000 --> 0:08:05,000
he was also filled with regret.

150
0:08:05.895,000 --> 0:08:07,000
He wondered to himself if he could write, too.

151
0:08:08.529,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He was convinced he had stories in his mind.

152
0:08:11.45,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But time and real life had happened, and he couldn't really manage it.

153
0:08:16.434,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And then he heard about the Juggernaut writer's platform.

154
0:08:19.672,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And what he loved about it was that he felt this was a place

155
0:08:23.546,000 --> 0:08:26,000
where he could stand head and shoulders, equally,

156
0:08:26.637,000 --> 0:08:28,000
with the very writers that he most admired.

157
0:08:29.165,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And so he began to write.

158
0:08:31.252,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And he snatched a minute here, an hour there,

159
0:08:35.038,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in between flights in airports,

160
0:08:37.276,000 --> 0:08:39,000
late at night, when he had a little bit of time on his hands.

161
0:08:40.867,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And he wrote this extraordinary story for us.

162
0:08:43.208,000 --> 0:08:45,000
He wrote a story about a family of assassins

163
0:08:46.057,000 --> 0:08:49,000
who lived in the winding lanes of Old Delhi.

164
0:08:49.371,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We loved it, it was so fresh and original.

165
0:08:52.275,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And before Neeraj knew it, he'd not only scored a film deal

166
0:08:56.736,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but also a second contract to write another story.

167
0:09:00.323,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Neeraj's story is one of the most read stories on our app.

168
0:09:05.619,000 --> 0:09:07,000
My journey is very, very young.

169
0:09:08.159,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We're a two-year-old company, and we have a long way to go.

170
0:09:12.984,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But we already, and we will by the end of this year,

171
0:09:16.029,000 --> 0:09:19,000
have about half a million stories, many priced at under a dollar.

172
0:09:21.159,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Most of our readers love reading

173
0:09:23.959,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and trying out authors they've never, ever heard of before.

174
0:09:27.117,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Thirty percent of our home page reads

175
0:09:29.601,000 --> 0:09:32,000
comes out of the writing that comes from our writer's platform.

176
0:09:34.21,000 --> 0:09:36,000
By being everywhere,

177
0:09:36.345,000 --> 0:09:38,000
by being accessible and relevant,

178
0:09:39.734,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I hope to make reading a daily habit,

179
0:09:42.538,000 --> 0:09:45,000
as easy and effortless as checking your email,

180
0:09:46.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
as booking a ticket online

181
0:09:48.514,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or ordering your groceries.

182
0:09:50.8,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And as for me,

183
0:09:52.419,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I've discovered that as I entered the six-inch world of the smartphone,

184
0:09:56.54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
my own world just got very, very big.

185
0:10:00.484,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Thank you.

186
0:10:01.706,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Applause)

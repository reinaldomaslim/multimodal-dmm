1
0:00:12.913,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am a neurosurgeon,

2
0:00:15.134,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I'm here to tell you today that people like me need your help.

3
0:00:20.119,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And in a few moments, I will tell you how.

4
0:00:22.167,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But first, let me start off by telling you about a patient of mine.

5
0:00:26.311,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This was a woman in her 50s,

6
0:00:28.978,000 --> 0:00:3,000
she was in generally good shape,

7
0:00:31.049,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but she had been in and out of hospital a few times

8
0:00:33.461,000 --> 0:00:36,000
due to curative breast cancer treatment.

9
0:00:37.768,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now she had gotten a prolapse from a cervical disc,

10
0:00:40.665,000 --> 0:00:43,000
giving her radiating pain of a tense kind,

11
0:00:44.363,000 --> 0:00:45,000
out into the right arm.

12
0:00:47.061,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Looking at her MRI before the consultation,

13
0:00:49.847,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I decided to suggest an operation.

14
0:00:52.411,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, neck operations like these are standardized, and they're quick.

15
0:00:57.279,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But they carry a certain risk.

16
0:00:58.914,000 --> 0:01:,000
You make an incision right here,

17
0:01:01.088,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and you dissect carefully past the trachea,

18
0:01:03.969,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the esophagus,

19
0:01:05.331,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and you try not to cut into the internal carotid artery.

20
0:01:08.592,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:09.879,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Then you bring in the microscope,

22
0:01:12.141,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and you carefully remove the disc and the prolapse

23
0:01:14.538,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in the nerve root canal,

24
0:01:15.752,000 --> 0:01:17,000
without damaging the cord and the nerve root

25
0:01:17.895,000 --> 0:01:19,000
lying only millimeters underneath.

26
0:01:20.625,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The worst case scenario is the damage to the cord,

27
0:01:23.109,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which can result in paralysis from the neck down.

28
0:01:28.673,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Explaining this to the patient, she fell silent.

29
0:01:31.229,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And after a few moments,

30
0:01:32.46,000 --> 0:01:35,000
she uttered a few very decisive words for me and for her.

31
0:01:37.887,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"Doctor, is this really necessary?"

32
0:01:41.395,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:44.101,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And you know what I realized, right there and then?

34
0:01:47.418,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It was not.

35
0:01:49.561,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In fact, when I get patients like this woman,

36
0:01:52.609,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I tend to advise not to operate.

37
0:01:55.665,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So what made me do it this time?

38
0:01:59.153,000 --> 0:02:,000
Well, you see,

39
0:02:00.829,000 --> 0:02:02,000
this prolapse was so delicate,

40
0:02:03.089,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I could practically see myself pulling it out of the nerve root canal

41
0:02:06.804,000 --> 0:02:08,000
before she entered the consultation room.

42
0:02:09.907,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I have to admit it, I wanted to operate on her.

43
0:02:13.359,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I'd love to operate on her.

44
0:02:15.256,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Operating, after all, is the most fun part of my job.

45
0:02:18.897,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:22.538,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I think you can relate to this feeling.

47
0:02:24.752,000 --> 0:02:27,000
My architect neighbor says he loves to just sit and draw

48
0:02:28.657,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and design houses.

49
0:02:30.117,000 --> 0:02:31,000
He'd rather do that all day

50
0:02:31.514,000 --> 0:02:34,000
than talk to the client paying for the house

51
0:02:35.43,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that might even give him restrictions on what to do.

52
0:02:39.073,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But like every architect,

53
0:02:40.372,000 --> 0:02:42,000
every surgeon needs to look their patient in the eye

54
0:02:43.382,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and together with the patient,

55
0:02:44.871,000 --> 0:02:47,000
they need to decide on what is best for the person having the operation.

56
0:02:50.264,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And that might sound easy.

57
0:02:51.708,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But let's look at some statistics.

58
0:02:56.009,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The tonsils are the two lumps in the back of your throat.

59
0:02:59.419,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They can be removed surgically,

60
0:03:01.593,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and that's called a tonsillectomy.

61
0:03:03.673,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This chart shows the operation rate of tonsillectomies in Norway

62
0:03:07.998,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in different regions.

63
0:03:09.451,000 --> 0:03:12,000
What might strike you is that there is twice the chance

64
0:03:13.157,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that your kid -- because this is for children --

65
0:03:16.712,000 --> 0:03:19,000
will get a tonsillectomy in Finnmark than in Trondheim.

66
0:03:20.862,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The indications in both regions are the same.

67
0:03:24.196,000 --> 0:03:26,000
There should be no difference, but there is.

68
0:03:26.759,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Here's another chart.

69
0:03:28.235,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The meniscus helps stabilize the knee

70
0:03:30.427,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and can be torn or fragmented acutely,

71
0:03:32.707,000 --> 0:03:34,000
topically during sports like soccer.

72
0:03:35.625,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What you see here is the operation rate for this condition.

73
0:03:39.354,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And you see that the operation rate in Møre og Romsdal

74
0:03:43.149,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is five times the operation rate in Stavanger.

75
0:03:47.427,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Five times.

76
0:03:49.133,000 --> 0:03:5,000
How can this be?

77
0:03:50.442,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Did the soccer players in Møre og Romsdal

78
0:03:52.448,000 --> 0:03:54,000
play more dirty than elsewhere in the country?

79
0:03:54.623,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:56.815,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Probably not.

81
0:03:59.109,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I added some information now.

82
0:04:01.292,000 --> 0:04:03,000
What you see now is the procedures performed

83
0:04:03.466,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in public hospitals, in light blue,

84
0:04:05.522,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the ones in private clinics are light green.

85
0:04:08.53,000 --> 0:04:11,000
There is a lot of activity in the private clinics

86
0:04:11.904,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in Møre og Romsdal, isn't there?

87
0:04:14.363,000 --> 0:04:15,000
What does this indicate?

88
0:04:15.76,000 --> 0:04:18,000
A possible economic motivation to treat the patients.

89
0:04:20.522,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And there's more.

90
0:04:23.577,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Recent research has shown that the difference of treatment effect

91
0:04:27.364,000 --> 0:04:3,000
between regular physical therapy and operations for the knee --

92
0:04:30.839,000 --> 0:04:31,000
there is no difference.

93
0:04:32.387,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Meaning that most of the procedures performed

94
0:04:36.166,000 --> 0:04:38,000
on the chart I've just shown

95
0:04:38.396,000 --> 0:04:4,000
could have been avoided, even in Stavanger.

96
0:04:41.785,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So what am I trying to tell you here?

97
0:04:44.246,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Even though most indications for treatments in the world

98
0:04:49.395,000 --> 0:04:5,000
are standardized,

99
0:04:50.585,000 --> 0:04:54,000
there is a lot of unnecessary variation of treatment decisions,

100
0:04:54.903,000 --> 0:04:55,000
especially in the Western world.

101
0:04:57.572,000 --> 0:05:,000
Some people are not getting the treatment that they need,

102
0:05:01.493,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but an even greater portion of you

103
0:05:04.58,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are being overtreated.

104
0:05:08.649,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"Doctor, is this really necessary?"

105
0:05:11.458,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I've only heard that question once in my career.

106
0:05:14.474,000 --> 0:05:17,000
My colleagues say they never heard these words from a patient.

107
0:05:19.431,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And to turn it the other way around,

108
0:05:21.209,000 --> 0:05:23,000
how often do you think you'll get a "no" from a doctor

109
0:05:23.788,000 --> 0:05:24,000
if you ask such a question?

110
0:05:26.487,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Researchers have investigated this,

111
0:05:28.22,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and they come up with about the same "no" rate

112
0:05:30.997,000 --> 0:05:31,000
wherever they go.

113
0:05:32.188,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And that is 30 percent.

114
0:05:33.919,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Meaning, three out of 10 times,

115
0:05:37.91,000 --> 0:05:4,000
your doctor prescribes or suggests something

116
0:05:41.473,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that is completely unnecessary.

117
0:05:46.545,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And you know what they claim the reason for this is?

118
0:05:50.117,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Patient pressure.

119
0:05:52.832,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In other words, you.

120
0:05:54.943,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You want something to be done.

121
0:05:58.665,000 --> 0:06:,000
A friend of mine came to me for medical advice.

122
0:06:01.085,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This is a sporty guy,

123
0:06:02.261,000 --> 0:06:05,000
he does a lot of cross-country skiing in the winter time,

124
0:06:05.839,000 --> 0:06:06,000
he runs in the summer time.

125
0:06:07.569,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And this time, he'd gotten a bad back ache whenever he went jogging.

126
0:06:11.593,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So much that he had to stop doing it.

127
0:06:15.053,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I did an examination, I questioned him thoroughly,

128
0:06:18.381,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and what I found out is that he probably had a degenerated disc

129
0:06:21.539,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in the lower part of his spine.

130
0:06:24.087,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Whenever it got strained, it hurt.

131
0:06:28.165,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He'd already taken up swimming instead of jogging,

132
0:06:30.537,000 --> 0:06:31,000
there was really nothing to do,

133
0:06:32.062,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so I told him, "You need to be more selective

134
0:06:34.22,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when it comes to training.

135
0:06:35.561,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Some activities are good for you,

136
0:06:37.188,000 --> 0:06:38,000
some are not."

137
0:06:39.665,000 --> 0:06:4,000
His reply was,

138
0:06:41.919,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"I want an MRI of my back."

139
0:06:45.776,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"Why do you want an MRI?"

140
0:06:48.236,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"I can get it for free through my insurance at work."

141
0:06:51.807,000 --> 0:06:54,000
"Come on," I said -- he was also, after all, my friend.

142
0:06:54.95,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"That's not the real reason."

143
0:06:56.856,000 --> 0:07:,000
"Well, I think it's going to be good to see how bad it looks back there."

144
0:07:03.094,000 --> 0:07:05,000
"When did you start interpreting MRI scans?" I said.

145
0:07:06.063,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:08.137,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"Trust me on this.

147
0:07:10.026,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You're not going to need the scan."

148
0:07:12.78,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"Well," he said,

149
0:07:14.557,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and after a while, he continued, "It could be cancer."

150
0:07:17.869,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:20.097,000 --> 0:07:21,000
He got the scan, obviously.

152
0:07:22.907,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And through his insurance at work,

153
0:07:24.565,000 --> 0:07:26,000
he got to see one of my colleagues at work,

154
0:07:26.629,000 --> 0:07:28,000
telling him about the degenerated disc,

155
0:07:28.78,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that there was nothing to do,

156
0:07:30.22,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and that he should keep on swimming and quit the jogging.

157
0:07:36.196,000 --> 0:07:38,000
After a while, I met him again and he said,

158
0:07:38.284,000 --> 0:07:39,000
"At least now I know what this is."

159
0:07:40.712,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But let me ask you a question.

160
0:07:42.355,000 --> 0:07:46,000
What if all of you in this room with the same symptoms had an MRI?

161
0:07:46.498,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And what if all the people in Norway

162
0:07:49.212,000 --> 0:07:52,000
had an MRI due to occasional back pain?

163
0:07:54.061,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The waiting list for an MRI would quadruple, maybe even more.

164
0:07:58.18,000 --> 0:08:,000
And you would all take the spot on that list

165
0:08:00.969,000 --> 0:08:02,000
from someone who really had cancer.

166
0:08:03.919,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So a good doctor sometimes says no,

167
0:08:07.515,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but the sensible patient also turns down, sometimes,

168
0:08:11.888,000 --> 0:08:13,000
an opportunity to get diagnosed or treated.

169
0:08:16.782,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Doctor, is this really necessary?"

170
0:08:20.472,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I know this can be a difficult question to ask.

171
0:08:24.377,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In fact, if you go back 50 years,

172
0:08:26.3,000 --> 0:08:28,000
this was even considered rude.

173
0:08:28.677,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:29.823,000 --> 0:08:31,000
If the doctor had decided what to do with you,

175
0:08:32.293,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that's what you did.

176
0:08:35.574,000 --> 0:08:37,000
A colleague of mine, now a general practitioner,

177
0:08:37.843,000 --> 0:08:41,000
was sent away to a tuberculosis sanatorium as a little girl,

178
0:08:42.208,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for six months.

179
0:08:43.391,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It was a terrible trauma for her.

180
0:08:45.703,000 --> 0:08:47,000
She later found out, as a grown-up,

181
0:08:48.068,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that her tests on tuberculosis had been negative all along.

182
0:08:52.403,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The doctor had sent her away on nothing but wrong suspicion.

183
0:08:56.419,000 --> 0:09:,000
No one had dared or even considered confronting him about it.

184
0:09:01.268,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Not even her parents.

185
0:09:03.506,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Today, the Norwegian health minister

186
0:09:06.776,000 --> 0:09:09,000
talks about the patient health care service.

187
0:09:10.68,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The patient is supposed to get advice from the doctor about what to do.

188
0:09:16.34,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This is great progress.

189
0:09:18.205,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But it also puts more responsibility on you.

190
0:09:21.919,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You need to get in the front seat with your doctor

191
0:09:24.86,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and start sharing decisions on where to go.

192
0:09:27.42,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So, the next time you're in a doctor's office,

193
0:09:31.007,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I want you to ask,

194
0:09:32.92,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"Doctor, is this really necessary?"

195
0:09:36.315,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And in my female patient's case,

196
0:09:38.648,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the answer would be no,

197
0:09:40.982,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but an operation could also be justified.

198
0:09:44.165,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"So doctors, what are the risks attached to this operation?"

199
0:09:49.488,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Well, five to ten percent of patients will have worsening of pain symptoms.

200
0:09:55.427,000 --> 0:09:56,000
One to two percent of patients

201
0:09:57.165,000 --> 0:10:,000
will have an infection in the wound or even a rehemorrhage

202
0:10:00.204,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that might end up in a re-operation.

203
0:10:04.069,000 --> 0:10:07,000
0.5 percent of patients also experience permanent hoarseness

204
0:10:07.68,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and a few, but still a few,

205
0:10:09.498,000 --> 0:10:13,000
will experience reduced function in the arms or even legs.

206
0:10:15.163,000 --> 0:10:17,000
"Doctor, are there other options?"

207
0:10:18.131,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Yes, rest and physical therapy over some time

208
0:10:21.533,000 --> 0:10:23,000
might get you perfectly well.

209
0:10:25.105,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"And what happens if I don't do anything?"

210
0:10:27.859,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's not recommended,

211
0:10:29.058,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but even then, there's a slight chance that you will get well.

212
0:10:33.002,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Four questions.

213
0:10:34.78,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Simple questions.

214
0:10:36.321,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Consider them your new toolbox to help us.

215
0:10:40.702,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Is this really necessary?

216
0:10:42.337,000 --> 0:10:43,000
What are the risks?

217
0:10:44.154,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Are there other options?

218
0:10:45.734,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And what happens if I don't do anything?

219
0:10:49.334,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Ask them when your doctor wants to send you to an MRI,

220
0:10:53.405,000 --> 0:10:55,000
when he prescribes antibiotics

221
0:10:55.722,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or suggests an operation.

222
0:10:58.282,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What we know from research

223
0:11:00.014,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is that one out of five of you, 20 percent,

224
0:11:03.228,000 --> 0:11:05,000
will change your opinion on what to do.

225
0:11:06.624,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And by doing that, you will not only have made your life

226
0:11:09.99,000 --> 0:11:12,000
a whole lot easier, and probably even better,

227
0:11:13.576,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but the whole health care sector

228
0:11:15.556,000 --> 0:11:18,000
will have benefited from your decision.

229
0:11:19.354,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Thank you.

230
0:11:20.56,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Applause)

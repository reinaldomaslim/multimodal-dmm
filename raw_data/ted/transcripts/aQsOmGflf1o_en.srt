2
0:00:12.738,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have a tendency to assume the worst,

3
0:00:15.757,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and once in a while, this habit plays tricks on me.

4
0:00:18.644,000 --> 0:00:21,000
For example, if I feel unexpected pain in my body

5
0:00:21.949,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I have not experienced before and that I cannot attribute,

6
0:00:25.48,000 --> 0:00:29,000
then all of a sudden, my mind might turn a tense back into heart disease

7
0:00:30.024,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or calf muscle pain into deep vein thrombosis.

8
0:00:33.699,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But so far, I haven't been diagnosed with any deadly or incurable disease.

9
0:00:37.241,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Sometimes things just hurt for no clear reason.

10
0:00:41.098,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But not everyone is as lucky as me.

11
0:00:43.97,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Every year, more than 50 million people die worldwide.

12
0:00:48.287,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Especially in high-income economies like ours,

13
0:00:51.844,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a large fraction of deaths is caused by slowly progressing diseases:

14
0:00:56.623,000 --> 0:01:,000
heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes,

15
0:01:00.955,000 --> 0:01:01,000
just to name a few.

16
0:01:03.3,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, humanity has made tremendous progress in diagnosing and treating many of these.

17
0:01:08.859,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But we are at a stage where further advancement in health

18
0:01:12.084,000 --> 0:01:15,000
cannot be achieved only by developing new treatments.

19
0:01:15.398,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And this becomes evident when we look at one aspect

20
0:01:17.822,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that many of these diseases have in common:

21
0:01:21.418,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the probability for successful treatment

22
0:01:24.27,000 --> 0:01:26,000
strongly depends on when treatment is started.

23
0:01:27.37,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But a disease is typically only detected once symptoms occur.

24
0:01:31.632,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The problem here is that, in fact, many diseases can remain asymptomatic,

25
0:01:36.049,000 --> 0:01:38,000
hence undetected, for a long period of time.

26
0:01:39.902,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Because of this, there is a persisting need for new ways

27
0:01:43.827,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of detecting disease at early stage,

28
0:01:45.799,000 --> 0:01:47,000
way before any symptoms occur.

29
0:01:49.135,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In health care, this is called screening.

30
0:01:51.435,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And as defined by the World Health Organization,

31
0:01:54.624,000 --> 0:01:59,000
screening is "the presumptive identification of unrecognized disease

32
0:02:00.306,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in an apparently healthy person,

33
0:02:02.891,000 --> 0:02:05,000
by means of tests ... that can be applied rapidly and easily ..."

34
0:02:07.429,000 --> 0:02:09,000
That's a long definition, so let me repeat it:

35
0:02:10.237,000 --> 0:02:13,000
identification of unrecognized disease

36
0:02:13.746,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in an apparently healthy person

37
0:02:16.254,000 --> 0:02:2,000
by means of tests that can be applied both rapidly and easily.

38
0:02:20.292,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And I want to put special emphasis on the words "rapidly" and "easily"

39
0:02:23.695,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because many of the existing screening methods

40
0:02:25.969,000 --> 0:02:26,000
are exactly the opposite.

41
0:02:28.189,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And those of you who have undergone colonoscopy

42
0:02:30.912,000 --> 0:02:33,000
as part of a screening program for colorectal cancer

43
0:02:34.135,000 --> 0:02:35,000
will know what I mean.

44
0:02:37.209,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Obviously, there's a variety of medical tools available

45
0:02:40.309,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to perform screening tests.

46
0:02:42.298,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This ranges from imaging techniques such as radiography

47
0:02:46.008,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or magnetic resonance imaging

48
0:02:48.162,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to the analysis of blood or tissue.

49
0:02:50.19,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We have all had such tests.

50
0:02:53.344,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But there's one medium that for long has been overlooked:

51
0:02:57.674,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a medium that is easily accessible,

52
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:02,000
basically nondepletable,

53
0:03:02.485,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and it holds tremendous promise for medical analysis.

54
0:03:06.994,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And that is our breath.

55
0:03:10.514,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Human breath is essentially composed of five components:

56
0:03:14.649,000 --> 0:03:2,000
nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and argon.

57
0:03:21.349,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But besides these five, there are hundreds of other components

58
0:03:24.772,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that are present in very low quantity.

59
0:03:27.179,000 --> 0:03:29,000
These are called volatile organic compounds,

60
0:03:29.756,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and we release hundreds, even thousands of them

61
0:03:32.113,000 --> 0:03:33,000
every time we exhale.

62
0:03:35.11,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The analysis of these volatile organic compounds in our breath

63
0:03:38.503,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is called breath analysis.

64
0:03:41.545,000 --> 0:03:44,000
In fact, I believe that many of you have already experienced breath analysis.

65
0:03:45.333,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Imagine: you're driving home late at night,

66
0:03:48.958,000 --> 0:03:5,000
when suddenly, there's a friendly police officer

67
0:03:51.68,000 --> 0:03:53,000
who asks you kindly but firmly

68
0:03:54.496,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to pull over and blow into a device like this one.

69
0:03:59.486,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This is an alcohol breath tester

70
0:04:02.733,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that is used to measure the ethanol concentration in your breath

71
0:04:06.464,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and determine whether driving in your condition is a clever idea.

72
0:04:10.509,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, I'd say my driving was pretty good,

73
0:04:12.48,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but let me check.

74
0:04:14.788,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Beep)

75
0:04:20.445,000 --> 0:04:22,000
0.0, so nothing to worry about, all fine.

76
0:04:23.429,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:26.298,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now imagine a device like this one,

78
0:04:28.983,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that does not only measure alcohol levels in your breath,

79
0:04:31.951,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but that detects diseases like the ones I've shown you

80
0:04:35.791,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and potentially many more.

81
0:04:38.868,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The concept of correlating the smell of a person's breath

82
0:04:42.69,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with certain medical conditions,

83
0:04:44.834,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in fact, dates back to Ancient Greece.

84
0:04:47.905,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But only recently, research efforts on breath analysis have skyrocketed,

85
0:04:52.9,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and what once was a dream is now becoming reality.

86
0:04:57.307,000 --> 0:05:,000
And let me pull up this list again that I showed you earlier.

87
0:05:01.047,000 --> 0:05:03,000
For the majority of diseases listed here,

88
0:05:04.495,000 --> 0:05:06,000
there's substantial scientific evidence

89
0:05:06.712,000 --> 0:05:09,000
suggesting that the disease could be detected by breath analysis.

90
0:05:11.917,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But how does it work, exactly?

91
0:05:14.421,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The essential part is a sensor device

92
0:05:17.223,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that detects the volatile organic compounds in our breath.

93
0:05:21.364,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Simply put: when exposed to a breath sample,

94
0:05:24.318,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the sensor outputs a complex signature

95
0:05:27.026,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that results from the mixture of volatile organic compounds that we exhale.

96
0:05:32.141,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now, this signature represents a fingerprint of your metabolism,

97
0:05:36.481,000 --> 0:05:37,000
your microbiome

98
0:05:37.67,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and the biochemical processes that occur in your body.

99
0:05:41.98,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If you have a disease,

100
0:05:43.597,000 --> 0:05:45,000
your organism will change,

101
0:05:45.908,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and so will the composition of your exhaled breath.

102
0:05:49.479,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And then the only thing that is left to do is to correlate a certain signature

103
0:05:54.633,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with the presence or absence of certain medical conditions.

104
0:05:59.921,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The technology promises several undeniable benefits.

105
0:06:03.719,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Firstly, the sensor can be miniaturized

106
0:06:06.84,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and integrated into small, handheld devices

107
0:06:09.71,000 --> 0:06:1,000
like this alcohol breath tester.

108
0:06:12.437,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This would allow the test to be used in many different settings

109
0:06:15.474,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and even at home,

110
0:06:17.272,000 --> 0:06:18,000
so that a visit at the doctor's office

111
0:06:19.29,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is not needed each time a test shall be performed.

112
0:06:22.946,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Secondly, breath analysis is noninvasive

113
0:06:26.35,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and can be as simple as blowing into an alcohol breath tester.

114
0:06:30.9,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Such simplicity and ease of use would reduce patient burden

115
0:06:35.918,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and provide an incentive for broad adoption of the technology.

116
0:06:39.973,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And thirdly, the technology is so flexible

117
0:06:44.105,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that the same device could be used

118
0:06:46.369,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to detect a broad range of medical conditions.

119
0:06:50.224,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Breath analysis could be used to screen for multiple diseases at the same time.

120
0:06:56.195,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Nowadays, each disease typically requires a different medical tool

121
0:06:59.55,000 --> 0:07:,000
to perform a screening test.

122
0:07:01.561,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But this means you can only find what you're looking for.

123
0:07:06.637,000 --> 0:07:09,000
With all of these features, breath analysis is predestined

124
0:07:10.52,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to deliver what many traditional screening tests are lacking.

125
0:07:14.671,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And most importantly,

126
0:07:16.334,000 --> 0:07:19,000
all of these features should eventually provide us

127
0:07:19.708,000 --> 0:07:21,000
with a platform for medical analysis

128
0:07:22.238,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that can operate at attractively low cost per test.

129
0:07:27.713,000 --> 0:07:3,000
On the contrary, existing medical tools

130
0:07:30.987,000 --> 0:07:32,000
often lead to rather high cost per test.

131
0:07:33.92,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Then, in order to keep costs down,

132
0:07:36.222,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the number of tests needs to be restricted,

133
0:07:39.562,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and this means (a) that the tests can only be performed

134
0:07:42.827,000 --> 0:07:46,000
on a narrow part of the population, for example, the high-risk population;

135
0:07:47.535,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and (b) that the number of tests per person needs to be kept at a minimum.

136
0:07:53.459,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But wouldn't it actually be beneficial

137
0:07:55.327,000 --> 0:07:57,000
if the test was performed on a larger group of people,

138
0:07:58.311,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and more often and over a longer period of time for each individual?

139
0:08:03.845,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Especially the latter would give access to something very valuable

140
0:08:07.73,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that is called longitudinal data.

141
0:08:10.95,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Longitudinal data is a data set that tracks the same patient

142
0:08:15.076,000 --> 0:08:17,000
over the course of many months or years.

143
0:08:19.318,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Nowadays, medical decisions are often based on a limited data set,

144
0:08:24.392,000 --> 0:08:27,000
where only a glimpse of a patient's medical history

145
0:08:27.608,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is available for decision-making.

146
0:08:30.21,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In such a case,

147
0:08:32.533,000 --> 0:08:34,000
abnormalities are typically detected

148
0:08:35.35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
by comparing a patient's health profile

149
0:08:37.94,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to the average health profile of a reference population.

150
0:08:42.419,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Longitudinal data would open up a new dimension

151
0:08:46.361,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and allow abnormalities to be detected

152
0:08:49.253,000 --> 0:08:51,000
based on a patient's own medical history.

153
0:08:52.862,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This will pave the way for personalized treatment.

154
0:08:56.741,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Sounds pretty great, right?

155
0:08:59.194,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Now you will certainly have a question that is something like,

156
0:09:02.193,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"If the technology is as great as he says, then why aren't we using it today?"

157
0:09:07.012,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And the only answer I can give you is:

158
0:09:09.514,000 --> 0:09:11,000
not everything is as easy as it sounds.

159
0:09:12.983,000 --> 0:09:15,000
There are technical challenges, for example.

160
0:09:16.494,000 --> 0:09:19,000
There's the need for extremely reliable sensors

161
0:09:19.532,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that can detect mixtures of volatile organic compounds

162
0:09:22.824,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with sufficient reproducibility.

163
0:09:25.629,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And another technical challenge is this:

164
0:09:28.088,000 --> 0:09:32,000
How do you sample a person's breath in a very defined manner

165
0:09:33.098,000 --> 0:09:35,000
so that the sampling process itself

166
0:09:35.47,000 --> 0:09:37,000
does not alter the result of the analysis?

167
0:09:39.187,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And there's the need for data.

168
0:09:41.556,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Breath analysis needs to be validated in clinical trials,

169
0:09:45.538,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and enough data needs to be collected

170
0:09:48.054,000 --> 0:09:52,000
so that individual conditions can be measured against baselines.

171
0:09:53.167,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Breath analysis can only succeed

172
0:09:55.664,000 --> 0:09:57,000
if a large enough data set can be generated

173
0:09:58.461,000 --> 0:10:,000
and made available for broad use.

174
0:10:03.05,000 --> 0:10:05,000
If breath analysis holds up to its promises,

175
0:10:06.745,000 --> 0:10:08,000
this is a technology that could truly aid us

176
0:10:09.295,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to transform our health care system --

177
0:10:12.41,000 --> 0:10:15,000
transform it from a reactive system

178
0:10:15.588,000 --> 0:10:18,000
where treatment is triggered by symptoms of disease

179
0:10:18.774,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to a proactive system,

180
0:10:20.813,000 --> 0:10:23,000
where disease detection, diagnosis and treatment

181
0:10:24.051,000 --> 0:10:25,000
can happen at early stage,

182
0:10:25.959,000 --> 0:10:27,000
way before any symptoms occur.

183
0:10:29.59,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Now this brings me to my last point, and it's a fundamental one.

184
0:10:33.537,000 --> 0:10:34,000
What exactly is a disease?

185
0:10:36.59,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Imagine that breath analysis can be commercialized as I describe it,

186
0:10:40.649,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and early detection becomes routine.

187
0:10:44.417,000 --> 0:10:46,000
A problem that remains is, in fact, a problem

188
0:10:46.745,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that any screening activity has to face

189
0:10:49.757,000 --> 0:10:5,000
because, for many diseases,

190
0:10:51.602,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it is often impossible to predict with sufficient certainty

191
0:10:55.45,000 --> 0:10:57,000
whether the disease would ever cause any symptoms

192
0:10:58.016,000 --> 0:11:,000
or put a person's life at risk.

193
0:11:00.99,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is called overdiagnosis,

194
0:11:03.573,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and it leads to a dilemma.

195
0:11:05.927,000 --> 0:11:07,000
If a disease is identified,

196
0:11:08.035,000 --> 0:11:1,000
you could decide not to treat it

197
0:11:10.103,000 --> 0:11:13,000
because there's a certain probability that you would never suffer from it.

198
0:11:14.955,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But how much would you suffer

199
0:11:16.478,000 --> 0:11:19,000
just from knowing that you have a potentially deadly disease?

200
0:11:19.889,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And wouldn't you actually regret that the disease was detected

201
0:11:22.823,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in the first place?

202
0:11:25.281,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Your second option is to undergo early treatment

203
0:11:29.193,000 --> 0:11:3,000
with the hope for curing it.

204
0:11:31.485,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But often, this would not come without side effects.

205
0:11:37.623,000 --> 0:11:39,000
To be precise:

206
0:11:39.751,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the bigger problem is not overdiagnosis,

207
0:11:42.349,000 --> 0:11:43,000
it's overtreatment,

208
0:11:43.826,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because not every disease has to be treated immediately

209
0:11:46.865,000 --> 0:11:48,000
just because a treatment is available.

210
0:11:51.441,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The increasing adoption of routine screening

211
0:11:54.163,000 --> 0:11:55,000
will raise the question:

212
0:11:57.082,000 --> 0:12:01,000
What do we call a disease that can rationalize treatment,

213
0:12:01.197,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and what is just an abnormality that should not be a source of concern?

214
0:12:07.404,000 --> 0:12:11,000
My hopes are that routine screening using breath analysis

215
0:12:12.36,000 --> 0:12:14,000
can provide enough data and insight

216
0:12:15.144,000 --> 0:12:19,000
so that at some point, we'll be able to break this dilemma

217
0:12:19.714,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and predict with sufficient certainty

218
0:12:22.168,000 --> 0:12:24,000
whether and when to treat at early stage.

219
0:12:26.794,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Our breath and the mixture of volatile organic compounds that we exhale

220
0:12:31.537,000 --> 0:12:35,000
hold tremendous amounts of information on our physiological condition.

221
0:12:37.262,000 --> 0:12:4,000
With what we know today, we have only scratched the surface.

222
0:12:41.993,000 --> 0:12:45,000
As we collect more and more data and breath profiles across the population,

223
0:12:46.258,000 --> 0:12:5,000
including all varieties of gender, age, origin and lifestyle,

224
0:12:50.814,000 --> 0:12:52,000
the power of breath analysis should increase.

225
0:12:54.147,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And eventually, breath analysis should provide us with a powerful tool

226
0:12:59.749,000 --> 0:13:03,000
not only to proactively detect specific diseases

227
0:13:04.239,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but to predict and ultimately prevent them.

228
0:13:09.11,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And this should be enough motivation

229
0:13:11.752,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to embrace the opportunities and challenges

230
0:13:15.959,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that breath analysis can provide,

231
0:13:18.444,000 --> 0:13:21,000
even for people that are not part-time hypochondriacs like me.

232
0:13:22.532,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Thank you.

233
0:13:23.713,000 --> 0:13:27,000

1
0:00:12.944,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, I want to talk to you about the forgotten middle.

2
0:00:18.325,000 --> 0:00:23,000
To me, they are the students, coworkers and plain old regular folks

3
0:00:24.14,000 --> 0:00:26,000
who are often overlooked

4
0:00:26.219,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because they're seen as neither exceptional nor problematic.

5
0:00:31.267,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They're the kids we think we can ignore

6
0:00:34.188,000 --> 0:00:38,000
because their needs for support don't seem particularly urgent.

7
0:00:39.506,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They're the coworkers

8
0:00:41.379,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who actually keep the engines of our organizations running,

9
0:00:45.64,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but who aren't seen as the innovators who drive excellence.

10
0:00:50.91,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In many ways, we overlook the folks in the middle

11
0:00:54.91,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because they don't keep us up awake at night

12
0:00:57.776,000 --> 0:00:59,000
wondering what crazy thing they're going to come up with next.

13
0:01:00.755,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

14
0:01:02.696,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And the truth is that we've come to rely on their complacency

15
0:01:07.725,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and sense of disconnection

16
0:01:10.274,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because it makes our work easier.

17
0:01:14.077,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You see, I know a little bit about the forgotten middle.

18
0:01:18.578,000 --> 0:01:22,000
As a junior high school student, I hung out in the middle.

19
0:01:23.848,000 --> 0:01:25,000
For a long time, I had been a good student.

20
0:01:27.315,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But seventh grade was a game changer.

21
0:01:31.045,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I spent my days gossiping, passing notes,

22
0:01:35.609,000 --> 0:01:37,000
generally goofing off with my friends.

23
0:01:38.649,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I spent my homework time on the phone, reviewing each day's events.

24
0:01:44.932,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And in many ways, although I was a typical 12-year-old girl,

25
0:01:51.75,000 --> 0:01:56,000
my ambivalence about my education led to pretty average grades.

26
0:01:59.256,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Luckily for me, my mother understood something important,

27
0:02:05.133,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and that was that my location was not my destination.

28
0:02:11.625,000 --> 0:02:16,000
As a former research librarian and an educator,

29
0:02:16.823,000 --> 0:02:2,000
my mother knew that I was capable of accomplishing a lot more.

30
0:02:22.424,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But she also understood

31
0:02:24.575,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that because I was a young black woman in America,

32
0:02:28.059,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I might not have opportunities out of the middle

33
0:02:31.664,000 --> 0:02:34,000
if she wasn't intentional about creating them.

34
0:02:36.149,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So she moved me to a different school.

35
0:02:40.267,000 --> 0:02:44,000
She signed me up for leadership activities in my neighborhood.

36
0:02:45.22,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And she began to talk to me more seriously

37
0:02:48.196,000 --> 0:02:52,000
about college and career options I could aspire to.

38
0:02:53.609,000 --> 0:02:57,000
My mother's formula for getting me out of the middle was pretty simple.

39
0:02:59.117,000 --> 0:03:02,000
She started with high expectations.

40
0:03:03.109,000 --> 0:03:07,000
She made it her business to figure out how to set me up for success.

41
0:03:08.879,000 --> 0:03:11,000
She held me accountable

42
0:03:12.506,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and, along the way, she convinced me that I had the power

43
0:03:18.084,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to create my own story.

44
0:03:22.355,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That formula didn't just help me get out of my seventh grade slump --

45
0:03:27.453,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I used it later on in New York City,

46
0:03:30.263,000 --> 0:03:33,000
when I was working with kids who had a lot of potential,

47
0:03:33.477,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but not a lot of opportunities to go to and complete college.

48
0:03:38.882,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You see, high-performing students

49
0:03:41.66,000 --> 0:03:44,000
tend to have access to additional resources,

50
0:03:45.35,000 --> 0:03:47,000
like summer enrichment activities,

51
0:03:48.157,000 --> 0:03:49,000
internships

52
0:03:49.704,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and an expansive curriculum

53
0:03:51.8,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that takes them out of the classroom and into the world

54
0:03:55.833,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in ways that look great on college applications.

55
0:03:59.737,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But we're not providing those kinds of opportunities for everyone.

56
0:04:04.712,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And the result isn't just that some kids miss out.

57
0:04:08.141,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I think we, as a society, miss out too.

58
0:04:11.582,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You see, I've got a crazy theory about the folks in the middle.

59
0:04:16.36,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I think there are some unclaimed winning lottery tickets in the middle.

60
0:04:22.038,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I think the cure for cancer and the path to world peace

61
0:04:26.284,000 --> 0:04:28,000
might very well reside there.

62
0:04:29.378,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now, as a former middle school teacher,

63
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I'm not saying that magically everyone is suddenly going to become an A student.

64
0:04:37.228,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But I also believe that most folks in the middle

65
0:04:40.998,000 --> 0:04:42,000
are capable of a lot more.

66
0:04:43.665,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I think people stay in the middle because that's where we relegated them to

67
0:04:48.204,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and, sometimes, that's just where they're kind of chilling

68
0:04:51.343,000 --> 0:04:53,000
while they figure things out.

69
0:04:54.609,000 --> 0:04:55,000
All of our journeys

70
0:04:56.546,000 --> 0:05:02,000
are made up of a series of rest stops, accelerations, losses and wins.

71
0:05:03.856,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We have a responsibility to make sure

72
0:05:06.546,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that one's racial, gender, cultural and socioeconomic identity

73
0:05:13.339,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is never the reason you didn't have access out of the middle.

74
0:05:19.03,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So, just as my mother did with me,

75
0:05:22.284,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I began with high expectations with my young people.

76
0:05:26.815,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I started with a question.

77
0:05:28.895,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I stopped asking kids, "Hey, do you want to go to college?"

78
0:05:33.49,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I started asking them,

79
0:05:35.458,000 --> 0:05:37,000
"What college would you like to attend?"

80
0:05:38.855,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You see, the first question --

81
0:05:40.452,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

82
0:05:45.668,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The first question leaves a lot of vague possibilities open.

83
0:05:50.585,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But the second question

84
0:05:52.45,000 --> 0:05:56,000
says something about what I thought my young people were capable of.

85
0:05:57.72,000 --> 0:05:58,000
On a basic level,

86
0:05:58.983,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it assumes that they're going to graduate from high school successfully.

87
0:06:03.715,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It also assumed

88
0:06:05.675,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that they would have the kinds of academic records

89
0:06:08.945,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that could get them college and university admissions.

90
0:06:13.707,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And I'm proud to say that the high expectations worked.

91
0:06:18.035,000 --> 0:06:2,000
While black and Latinx students

92
0:06:20.459,000 --> 0:06:24,000
nationally tend to graduate from college in six years or less,

93
0:06:25.171,000 --> 0:06:28,000
at a percent of 38,

94
0:06:28.236,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we were recognized by the College Board

95
0:06:31.053,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for our ability not to just get kids into college

96
0:06:34.72,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but to get them through college.

97
0:06:37.307,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Applause)

98
0:06:43.419,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But I also understand that high expectations are great,

99
0:06:47.277,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but it takes a little bit more than that.

100
0:06:49.65,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You wouldn't ask a pastry chef to bake a cake without an oven.

101
0:06:54.244,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And we should not be asking the folks in the middle to make the leap

102
0:06:58.737,000 --> 0:07:04,000
without providing them with the tools, strategies and support they deserve

103
0:07:04.942,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to make progress in their lives.

104
0:07:08.368,000 --> 0:07:12,000
A young woman I had been mentoring for a long time, Nicole,

105
0:07:12.796,000 --> 0:07:14,000
came to my office one day,

106
0:07:14.884,000 --> 0:07:19,000
after her guidance counselor looked at her pretty strong transcript

107
0:07:20.214,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and expressed utter shock and amazement

108
0:07:22.945,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that she was even interested in going to college.

109
0:07:26.952,000 --> 0:07:3,000
What the guidance counselor didn't know was that through her community,

110
0:07:31.768,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Nicole had had access to college prep work,

111
0:07:35.577,000 --> 0:07:38,000
SAT prep and international travel programs.

112
0:07:40.129,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Not only was college in her future,

113
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but I'm proud to say that Nicole went on to earn two master's degrees

114
0:07:48.117,000 --> 0:07:5,000
after graduating from Purdue University.

115
0:07:51.061,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

116
0:07:57.145,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We also made it our business to hold our young people accountable,

117
0:08:02.232,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but also to instill a sense of accountability in those young people

118
0:08:07.736,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to themselves, to each other, to their families and their communities.

119
0:08:14.117,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We doubled down on asset-based youth development.

120
0:08:18.72,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We went on leadership retreats

121
0:08:20.783,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and did high ropes courses and low ropes courses

122
0:08:24.569,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and tackled life's biggest questions together.

123
0:08:29.561,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The result was that the kids really bought into the notion

124
0:08:33.193,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that they were accountable for achieving these college degrees.

125
0:08:38.728,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It was so gratifying to see the kids calling each other and texting each other

126
0:08:44.724,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to say, "Hey, why are you late for SAT prep?"

127
0:08:48.135,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And, "What are you packing for the college tour tomorrow?"

128
0:08:53.019,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We really worked to kind of make college the thing to do.

129
0:08:57.734,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We began to create programs on college campuses

130
0:09:02.343,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and events that allow young people to really visualize themselves

131
0:09:07.356,000 --> 0:09:1,000
as college students and college graduates.

132
0:09:11.069,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Me and my staff rocked our own college gear

133
0:09:14.403,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and had lots of fun, healthy competition about whose school was better than whose.

134
0:09:21.355,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The kids really bought into it,

135
0:09:23.371,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and they began to see that something more was possible for their lives.

136
0:09:28.871,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Not only that -- they could look around at that college-going community

137
0:09:33.294,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and see kids who came from the same backgrounds

138
0:09:36.294,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and the same neighborhoods

139
0:09:38.008,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and who were aspiring to the same things.

140
0:09:42.046,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That sense of belonging was really key,

141
0:09:45.641,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and it showed up in a remarkable, beautiful way one day

142
0:09:49.643,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when we were in the Johannesburg airport, waiting to go through customs

143
0:09:54.585,000 --> 0:09:56,000
on our way to Botswana for a service learning trip.

144
0:09:58.046,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I saw a group of kids kind of huddled in a circle.

145
0:10:01.752,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Usually, with teens, that means something's going on.

146
0:10:04.459,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

147
0:10:06.363,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So I kind of walked up behind the kids

148
0:10:08.673,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to figure out what they were talking about.

149
0:10:11.711,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They were comparing passport stamps.

150
0:10:14.57,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter)

151
0:10:15.595,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And they were dreaming out loud about all the other countries

152
0:10:19.49,000 --> 0:10:21,000
they planned to visit in the future.

153
0:10:22.728,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And seeing these young people from New York City

154
0:10:27.936,000 --> 0:10:29,000
go on to not just become college students

155
0:10:30.807,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but to participate in study abroad programs

156
0:10:34.141,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and to then take jobs around the world

157
0:10:37.031,000 --> 0:10:38,000
was incredibly gratifying.

158
0:10:39.712,000 --> 0:10:4,000
When I think of my kids

159
0:10:41.506,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and all the doctors, lawyers, teachers, social workers,

160
0:10:46.157,000 --> 0:10:48,000
journalists and artists

161
0:10:48.236,000 --> 0:10:51,000
who came from our little nook in New York City,

162
0:10:52.235,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I hate to think of what would have happened

163
0:10:55.156,000 --> 0:10:57,000
if we hadn't invested in the middle.

164
0:10:58.076,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Just think about all that their communities and the world

165
0:11:01.803,000 --> 0:11:02,000
would have missed out on.

166
0:11:04.673,000 --> 0:11:08,000
This formula for the middle doesn't just work with young people.

167
0:11:09.724,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It can transform our organizations as well.

168
0:11:13.843,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We can be more bold

169
0:11:16.082,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in coming up and articulating a mission that inspires everyone.

170
0:11:21.418,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We can authentically invite our colleagues to the table

171
0:11:25.799,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to come up with a strategy to meet the mission.

172
0:11:30.157,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We can give meaningful feedback to folks along the way,

173
0:11:35.141,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and -- and sometimes most importantly --

174
0:11:38.427,000 --> 0:11:43,000
make sure that you're sharing credit for everyone's contributions.

175
0:11:45.211,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What happened when my staff aimed high for themselves

176
0:11:49.766,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is that what they were able to do for young people

177
0:11:53.036,000 --> 0:11:55,000
was pretty transformational.

178
0:11:55.728,000 --> 0:12:,000
And it's been so wonderful to look back and see all of my former colleagues

179
0:12:00.903,000 --> 0:12:02,000
who've gone on to get doctorates

180
0:12:03.038,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and assume leadership roles in other organizations.

181
0:12:08.585,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We have what it takes to inspire and uplift the folks in the middle.

182
0:12:15.41,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We can extend love to the people in the middle.

183
0:12:20.244,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We can challenge our own biases about who deserves a hand-up, and how.

184
0:12:27.982,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We can structure our organizations, communities and institutions

185
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in ways that are inclusive and that uphold principles of equity.

186
0:12:38.72,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Because, in the final analysis, what is often mistaken for a period

187
0:12:45.236,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is really just a comma.

188
0:12:48.37,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thank you.

189
0:12:49.545,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

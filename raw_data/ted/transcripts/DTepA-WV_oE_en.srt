1
0:00:27.023,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's wonderful to be back.

2
0:00:29.666,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I love this wonderful gathering.

3
0:00:32.392,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And you must be wondering, "What on earth?

4
0:00:34.613,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Have they put up the wrong slide?"

5
0:00:36.289,000 --> 0:00:37,000
No, no.

6
0:00:38.426,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Look at this magnificent beast,

7
0:00:42.662,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and ask the question: Who designed it?

8
0:00:48.152,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design,

9
0:00:52.086,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and there's a dairy cow.

10
0:00:53.849,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.

11
0:00:58.104,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I was thinking, how do I introduce this?

12
0:01:00.326,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,

13
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you know: "Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree."

14
0:01:10.004,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And you might say, "Well, God designed the cow."

15
0:01:12.692,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But, of course, God got a lot of help.

16
0:01:16.525,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is the ancestor of cattle.

17
0:01:18.858,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This is the aurochs.

18
0:01:21.739,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And it was designed by natural selection,

19
0:01:23.784,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the process of natural selection, over many millions of years.

20
0:01:27.719,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago.

21
0:01:32.274,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And human beings became its stewards,

22
0:01:36.947,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and, without even knowing what they were doing,

23
0:01:39.201,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it.

24
0:01:43.521,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast

25
0:01:49.783,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked

26
0:01:52.578,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better.

27
0:01:57.22,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, why am I talking about cows?

28
0:02:01.181,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions.

29
0:02:06.489,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Religions are natural phenomena -- they're just as natural as cows.

30
0:02:11.862,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They have evolved over millennia.

31
0:02:16.438,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They have a biological base, just like the aurochs.

32
0:02:20.798,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They have become domesticated,

33
0:02:22.89,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years.

34
0:02:29.138,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This is TED, and I want to talk about design.

35
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Because what I've been doing for the last four years --

36
0:02:35.937,000 --> 0:02:37,000
really since the first time you saw me --

37
0:02:37.981,000 --> 0:02:4,000
some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion --

38
0:02:41.008,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and in the last four years,

39
0:02:42.525,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I've been working just about non-stop on this topic.

40
0:02:45.961,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions.

41
0:02:51.59,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people,

42
0:02:57.177,000 --> 0:03:01,000
or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another.

43
0:03:02.743,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And that is the spell that I want to break.

44
0:03:05.194,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon.

45
0:03:08.933,000 --> 0:03:11,000
We should study them with the same intensity

46
0:03:12.205,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that we study all the other important natural phenomena,

47
0:03:15.396,000 --> 0:03:18,000
like global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore.

48
0:03:20.128,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Today's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed.

49
0:03:24.62,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They are immensely powerful social institutions

50
0:03:28.977,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features

51
0:03:34.281,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering.

52
0:03:39.333,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design --

53
0:03:44.729,000 --> 0:03:45,000
designed by natural selection itself --

54
0:03:46.722,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and intelligent design --

55
0:03:49.853,000 --> 0:03:5,000
more or less intelligent design --

56
0:03:51.691,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and redesigned by human beings

57
0:03:53.413,000 --> 0:03:55,000
who are trying to redesign their religions.

58
0:03:57.564,000 --> 0:04:,000
You don't do book talks at TED,

59
0:04:01.168,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but I'm going to have just one slide about my book,

60
0:04:05.316,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because there is one message in it

61
0:04:08.013,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which I think this group really needs to hear.

62
0:04:10.201,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I would be very interested to get your responses to this.

63
0:04:15.05,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book,

64
0:04:19.719,000 --> 0:04:22,000
at this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion

65
0:04:23.106,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to know what other policy proposals to make.

66
0:04:25.749,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.

67
0:04:30.321,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Here's my proposal,

68
0:04:31.504,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it:

69
0:04:34.458,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Education on world religions for all of our children --

70
0:04:40.026,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in primary school, in high school,

71
0:04:42.193,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling.

72
0:04:46.521,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So what I'm proposing is,

73
0:04:48.203,000 --> 0:04:53,000
just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history,

74
0:04:54.087,000 --> 0:05:01,000
so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world --

75
0:05:01.111,000 --> 0:05:05,000
about their history, about their creeds, about their texts,

76
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements.

77
0:05:11.994,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly,

78
0:05:16.837,000 --> 0:05:21,000
with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country.

79
0:05:23.507,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And as long as you teach them that,

80
0:05:26.824,000 --> 0:05:28,000
you can teach them anything else you like.

81
0:05:29.713,000 --> 0:05:32,000
That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom.

82
0:05:34.363,000 --> 0:05:38,000
As long as you inform your children about other religions,

83
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:42,000
then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like --

84
0:05:42.17,000 --> 0:05:45,000
teach them whatever creed you want them to learn.

85
0:05:45.956,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But also let them know about other religions.

86
0:05:48.616,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Now, why do I say that?

87
0:05:52.365,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship.

88
0:05:59.25,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy.

89
0:06:06.93,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Misinformed consent is not worth it.

90
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really.

91
0:06:13.247,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Democracy depends on informed consent.

92
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults.

93
0:06:21.812,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, children below the age of consent are a special case.

94
0:06:30.608,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Parents -- I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used --

95
0:06:36.223,000 --> 0:06:38,000
parents are stewards of their children.

96
0:06:39.159,000 --> 0:06:4,000
They don't own them.

97
0:06:41.286,000 --> 0:06:42,000
You can't own your children.

98
0:06:43.212,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You have a responsibility to the world,

99
0:06:46.919,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to the state, to them, to take care of them right.

100
0:06:52.843,000 --> 0:06:58,000
You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important,

101
0:06:58.914,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed

102
0:07:03.764,000 --> 0:07:05,000
about all the other creeds in the world, too.

103
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear

104
0:07:11.492,000 --> 0:07:12,000
some of the reactions to this.

105
0:07:14.663,000 --> 0:07:19,000
One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it "totalitarian."

106
0:07:21.849,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It strikes me as practically libertarian.

107
0:07:26.071,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic?

108
0:07:29.118,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I don't think so.

109
0:07:30.301,000 --> 0:07:31,000
All I'm saying is --

110
0:07:32.304,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and facts, facts only; no values, just facts --

111
0:07:38.252,000 --> 0:07:39,000
about all the world's religions.

112
0:07:41.683,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Another reviewer called it "hilarious."

113
0:07:44.9,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact

114
0:07:48.581,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that anybody would think that was hilarious.

115
0:07:51.224,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It seems to me to be such a plausible,

116
0:07:55.229,000 --> 0:07:59,000
natural extension of the democratic principles we already have

117
0:07:59.649,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous.

118
0:08:05.002,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I know many religions

119
0:08:08.543,000 --> 0:08:14,000
are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children

120
0:08:15.204,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths.

121
0:08:22.145,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I don't think that's defensible.

122
0:08:25.184,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that --

123
0:08:27.842,000 --> 0:08:28,000
any reactions to that -- later.

124
0:08:29.393,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But now I'm going to move on.

125
0:08:31.54,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Back to the cow.

126
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
This picture, which I pulled off the web --

127
0:08:36.388,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture.

128
0:08:39.717,000 --> 0:08:4,000
That's the steward.

129
0:08:41.305,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Cows couldn't live without human stewards -- they're domesticated.

130
0:08:46.838,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They're a sort of ectosymbiont.

131
0:08:50.132,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They depend on us for their survival.

132
0:08:55.38,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep.

133
0:08:58.747,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I'm going to talk about sheep, too.

134
0:09:00.47,000 --> 0:09:02,000
There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here.

135
0:09:04.007,000 --> 0:09:07,000
How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!

136
0:09:07.94,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

137
0:09:10.297,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Think of what this got them.

138
0:09:12.438,000 --> 0:09:14,000
They could outsource all their problems:

139
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
protection from predators, food-finding ...

140
0:09:17.635,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

141
0:09:18.666,000 --> 0:09:19,000
... health maintenance.

142
0:09:20.025,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

143
0:09:22.712,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The only cost in most flocks -- not even this -- a loss of free mating.

144
0:09:29.665,000 --> 0:09:3,000
What a deal!

145
0:09:31.673,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"How clever of sheep!" you might say.

146
0:09:33.573,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Except, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.

147
0:09:36.098,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they're not very smart.

148
0:09:41.427,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all.

149
0:09:43.574,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They were clueless.

150
0:09:46.201,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But it was a very clever move.

151
0:09:48.159,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Whose clever move was it?

152
0:09:49.506,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It was the clever move of natural selection itself.

153
0:09:53.818,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA

154
0:09:59.625,000 --> 0:10:,000
with Jim Watson,

155
0:10:01.412,000 --> 0:10:03,000
once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule.

156
0:10:04.578,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy,

157
0:10:09.853,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and Orgel's Second Rule is:

158
0:10:11.247,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Evolution is cleverer than you are.

159
0:10:14.96,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, that is not Intelligent Design -- not from Francis Crick.

160
0:10:21.479,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Evolution is cleverer than you are.

161
0:10:23.194,000 --> 0:10:26,000
If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand

162
0:10:26.352,000 --> 0:10:3,000
why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.

163
0:10:33.216,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The designs discovered by the process of natural selection

164
0:10:37.654,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.

165
0:10:40.058,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered.

166
0:10:45.283,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But the process itself is without purpose,

167
0:10:48.472,000 --> 0:10:5,000
without foresight, without design.

168
0:10:51.358,000 --> 0:10:52,000
When I was here four years ago,

169
0:10:52.913,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass.

170
0:10:55.858,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected

171
0:10:59.748,000 --> 0:11:04,000
with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow

172
0:11:04.944,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in order to reproduce.

173
0:11:07.342,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So it was sort of a spooky story.

174
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And I think some people may have misunderstood.

175
0:11:11.77,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Lancet flukes aren't smart.

176
0:11:13.874,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there,

177
0:11:18.132,000 --> 0:11:2,000
somewhere between petunia and carrot.

178
0:11:20.336,000 --> 0:11:22,000
They're not really bright. They don't have to be.

179
0:11:22.662,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The lesson we learn from this is:

180
0:11:24.273,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.

181
0:11:27.797,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.

182
0:11:32.75,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It doesn't have to be.

183
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That's the way evolution works.

184
0:11:36.635,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Question: Was domestication good for sheep?

185
0:11:39.223,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It was great for their genetic fitness.

186
0:11:41.294,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point

187
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago.

188
0:11:47.997,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Here's what he said:

189
0:11:50.012,000 --> 0:11:52,000
"Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of agriculture,

190
0:11:52.667,000 --> 0:11:54,000
human population, plus livestock and pets,

191
0:11:55.103,000 --> 0:12:,000
was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass."

192
0:12:00.519,000 --> 0:12:01,000
That was just 10,000 years ago.

193
0:12:03.234,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Yesterday, in biological terms.

194
0:12:05.708,000 --> 0:12:07,000
What is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us?

195
0:12:09.167,000 --> 0:12:11,000
98 percent.

196
0:12:11.639,000 --> 0:12:13,000
That is what we have done on this planet.

197
0:12:14.456,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Now, I talked to Paul afterwards -- I wanted to check to find out

198
0:12:17.549,000 --> 0:12:19,000
how he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth --

199
0:12:20.446,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this.

200
0:12:23.169,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And there was a passage in it which he did not present here

201
0:12:26.015,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you:

202
0:12:28.634,000 --> 0:12:31,000
"Over billions of years on a unique sphere,

203
0:12:31.798,000 --> 0:12:33,000
chance has painted a thin covering of life:

204
0:12:34.663,000 --> 0:12:37,000
complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.

205
0:12:38.05,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species

206
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --

207
0:12:44.472,000 --> 0:12:46,000
have grown in population, technology and intelligence

208
0:12:47.314,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to a position of terrible power.

209
0:12:49.281,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We now wield the paintbrush."

210
0:12:52.358,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish.

211
0:12:55.771,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet.

212
0:12:59.83,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush.

213
0:13:02.576,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And how can we do that?

214
0:13:04.179,000 --> 0:13:07,000
The key to our domination of the planet is culture.

215
0:13:08.557,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And the key to culture is religion.

216
0:13:11.99,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.

217
0:13:14.958,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They would be puzzled by many things.

218
0:13:18.683,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Anybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is.

219
0:13:22.562,000 --> 0:13:27,000
This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,

220
0:13:27.879,000 --> 0:13:3,000
perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever,

221
0:13:31.365,000 --> 0:13:32,000
as seen from satellite photograph.

222
0:13:33.597,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Here's a big crowd.

223
0:13:34.773,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Here's another crowd in Mecca.

224
0:13:37.153,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Martians would be amazed by this.

225
0:13:39.985,000 --> 0:13:4,000
They'd want to know how it originated,

226
0:13:41.831,000 --> 0:13:43,000
what it was for and how it perpetuates itself.

227
0:13:45.061,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Actually, I'm going to pass over this.

228
0:13:48.156,000 --> 0:13:49,000
The ant isn't alone.

229
0:13:49.435,000 --> 0:13:54,000
There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which -- in that case --

230
0:13:56.617,000 --> 0:13:59,000
A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat.

231
0:14:00.347,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,

232
0:14:03.232,000 --> 0:14:05,000
so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat.

233
0:14:06.039,000 --> 0:14:07,000
True story.

234
0:14:07.73,000 --> 0:14:09,000
In other words, we have these hijackers --

235
0:14:09.766,000 --> 0:14:11,000
you've seen this slide before, from four years ago --

236
0:14:12.274,000 --> 0:14:15,000
a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior,

237
0:14:16.184,000 --> 0:14:19,000
on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness.

238
0:14:20.314,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Does that ever happen to us?

239
0:14:22.562,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.

240
0:14:27.102,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."

241
0:14:29.133,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah."

242
0:14:32.617,000 --> 0:14:33,000
But I'm not just talking about Islam.

243
0:14:34.424,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I'm talking also about Christianity.

244
0:14:36.597,000 --> 0:14:39,000
This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall

245
0:14:39.959,000 --> 0:14:4,000
50 years ago.

246
0:14:41.251,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And on it, it says, in Latin:

247
0:14:44.528,000 --> 0:14:46,000
"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus."

248
0:14:47.512,000 --> 0:14:5,000
The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ.

249
0:14:51.418,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Same idea. Well, not quite.

250
0:14:53.621,000 --> 0:14:57,000
But in fact, Christians, too ...

251
0:14:58.297,000 --> 0:15:01,000
glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God.

252
0:15:01.956,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I'll give you a few quotes.

253
0:15:03.328,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"The heart of worship is surrender.

254
0:15:06.173,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Surrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense."

255
0:15:11.182,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Those words are by Rick Warren.

256
0:15:13.802,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."

257
0:15:16.898,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read.

258
0:15:20.548,000 --> 0:15:21,000
You've all got a copy,

259
0:15:21.915,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and you've just heard the man.

260
0:15:24.131,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book

261
0:15:27.862,000 --> 0:15:28,000
from the design standpoint,

262
0:15:29.321,000 --> 0:15:31,000
because I think it's actually a brilliant book.

263
0:15:33.369,000 --> 0:15:36,000
First of all, the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is --

264
0:15:36.608,000 --> 0:15:39,000
it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded.

265
0:15:39.943,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.

266
0:15:43.739,000 --> 0:15:44,000
He's absolutely right.

267
0:15:44.914,000 --> 0:15:47,000
There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life,

268
0:15:48.746,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal.

269
0:15:51.58,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I give him an A+ on this.

270
0:15:53.196,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Laughter)

271
0:15:55.044,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Is the goal achieved?

272
0:15:58.822,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Yes.

273
0:16:01.266,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Thirty million copies of this book.

274
0:16:05.519,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Al Gore, eat your heart out.

275
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Laughter)

276
0:16:10.681,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Just exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing.

277
0:16:14.326,000 --> 0:16:16,000
This is a fantastic achievement.

278
0:16:18.028,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And the means -- how does he do it?

279
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:24,000
It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes --

280
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features,

281
0:16:28.325,000 --> 0:16:3,000
putting new interpretations on other features.

282
0:16:30.507,000 --> 0:16:33,000
This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years,

283
0:16:34.222,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it.

284
0:16:38.833,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man.

285
0:16:41.413,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page.

286
0:16:47.079,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood.

287
0:16:50.431,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I really appreciated that.

288
0:16:51.804,000 --> 0:16:53,000
For instance, he has an appendix where he explains

289
0:16:54.272,000 --> 0:16:57,000
his choice of translations of different Bible verses.

290
0:16:57.999,000 --> 0:17:02,000
The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted.

291
0:17:04.323,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Just enough repetition.

292
0:17:06.528,000 --> 0:17:07,000
That's really important.

293
0:17:08.568,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.

294
0:17:13.871,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.

295
0:17:17.64,000 --> 0:17:18,000
(Laughter)

296
0:17:18.672,000 --> 0:17:19,000
With me, everybody --

297
0:17:19.94,000 --> 0:17:21,000
(Audience and Dan Dennett) Every time you read it or say it,

298
0:17:22.94,000 --> 0:17:24,000
you make another copy in your brain.

299
0:17:25.265,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

300
0:17:26.45,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And now we come to my problem.

301
0:17:28.767,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation

302
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:33,000
of all that I said about this book.

303
0:17:34.56,000 --> 0:17:35,000
But I wish it were better.

304
0:17:36.242,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I have some problems with the book.

305
0:17:38.202,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems.

306
0:17:42.346,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I wish he could do this with a revision,

307
0:17:46.133,000 --> 0:17:48,000
a Mark 2 version of his book.

308
0:17:50.6,000 --> 0:17:51,000
"The truth will set you free."

309
0:17:52.536,000 --> 0:17:53,000
That's what it says in the Bible,

310
0:17:54.467,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and it's something that I want to live by, too.

311
0:17:57.418,000 --> 0:18:01,000
My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true.

312
0:18:02.748,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Now some of this is a difference of opinion.

313
0:18:07.173,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning.

314
0:18:10.062,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Here's a passage -- it's very much what he said, anyway:

315
0:18:13.275,000 --> 0:18:15,000
"If there was no God we would all be accidents,

316
0:18:15.798,000 --> 0:18:18,000
the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe.

317
0:18:18.933,000 --> 0:18:21,000
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose

318
0:18:22.335,000 --> 0:18:23,000
or meaning or significance.

319
0:18:23.843,000 --> 0:18:24,000
There would be no right or wrong

320
0:18:25.449,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth."

321
0:18:27.619,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Now, I just do not believe that.

322
0:18:29.552,000 --> 0:18:35,000
By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative

323
0:18:35.756,000 --> 0:18:36,000
to that very claim.

324
0:18:37.861,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.

325
0:18:41.29,000 --> 0:18:47,000
We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us.

326
0:18:47.548,000 --> 0:18:51,000
But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion.

327
0:18:51.833,000 --> 0:18:53,000
That's not what I'm really worried about.

328
0:18:54.65,000 --> 0:18:56,000
How about this: "God designed this planet's environment

329
0:18:57.603,000 --> 0:18:58,000
just so we could live in it."

330
0:19:00.213,000 --> 0:19:04,000
I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean

331
0:19:04.679,000 --> 0:19:06,000
that we don't have to do the sorts of things

332
0:19:07.323,000 --> 0:19:09,000
that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do.

333
0:19:09.735,000 --> 0:19:11,000
I am not happy with that sentiment at all.

334
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:16,000
And then I find this: "All the evidence available in the biological sciences

335
0:19:16.596,000 --> 0:19:19,000
supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole

336
0:19:20.304,000 --> 0:19:23,000
with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose,

337
0:19:23.607,000 --> 0:19:25,000
a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning

338
0:19:26.315,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and explanation in this central fact."

339
0:19:28.356,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist.

340
0:19:31.833,000 --> 0:19:34,000
And here, I think, "Wait a minute." I read this again.

341
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:37,000
I read it three or four times and I think,

342
0:19:37.063,000 --> 0:19:39,000
"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design?

343
0:19:39.631,000 --> 0:19:4,000
Is he endorsing creationism here?"

344
0:19:41.642,000 --> 0:19:42,000
And you can't tell.

345
0:19:42.901,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know,

346
0:19:45.03,000 --> 0:19:47,000
I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet."

347
0:19:47.451,000 --> 0:19:51,000
But then I read on, and I read this: "First, Noah had never seen rain,

348
0:19:51.559,000 --> 0:19:54,000
because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up."

349
0:19:56.614,000 --> 0:20:,000
I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false.

350
0:20:01.537,000 --> 0:20:04,000
And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet,

351
0:20:04.728,000 --> 0:20:07,000
after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet

352
0:20:08.475,000 --> 0:20:11,000
over millions of years,

353
0:20:11.631,000 --> 0:20:14,000
discourages people from scientific understanding.

354
0:20:14.842,000 --> 0:20:2,000
Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms

355
0:20:21.411,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.

356
0:20:25.541,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Here's one: "God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him

357
0:20:28.929,000 --> 0:20:3,000
in a way that makes your ministry unique.

358
0:20:30.998,000 --> 0:20:33,000
He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you."

359
0:20:37.808,000 --> 0:20:39,000
I think that's false.

360
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:42,000
Now, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical.

361
0:20:43.618,000 --> 0:20:46,000
Here's another one: "For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts.

362
0:20:47.221,000 --> 0:20:5,000
Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second."

363
0:20:50.964,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation

364
0:20:53.662,000 --> 0:20:54,000
where I would accept that.

365
0:20:55.067,000 --> 0:20:57,000
There might be some way of treating that as true.

366
0:20:58.511,000 --> 0:21:01,000
"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge,

367
0:21:01.843,000 --> 0:21:03,000
hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being --

368
0:21:04.522,000 --> 0:21:06,000
an inbuilt need to connect with God."

369
0:21:08.392,000 --> 0:21:1,000
Well, the sense of which I agree with him,

370
0:21:10.584,000 --> 0:21:12,000
except I think it has an evolutionary explanation.

371
0:21:12.988,000 --> 0:21:15,000
And what I find deeply troubling in this book

372
0:21:16.833,000 --> 0:21:19,000
is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral,

373
0:21:20.61,000 --> 0:21:22,000
if you want to have meaning in your life,

374
0:21:22.803,000 --> 0:21:24,000
you have to be an Intelligent Designer,

375
0:21:25.294,000 --> 0:21:28,000
you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection.

376
0:21:28.839,000 --> 0:21:29,000
And I think, on the contrary,

377
0:21:30.342,000 --> 0:21:32,000
that it is very important to solving the world's problems

378
0:21:33.307,000 --> 0:21:35,000
that we take evolutionary biology seriously.

379
0:21:37.427,000 --> 0:21:38,000
Whose truth are we going to listen to?

380
0:21:40.649,000 --> 0:21:42,000
Well, this is from "The Purpose Driven Life":

381
0:21:43.225,000 --> 0:21:46,000
"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life:

382
0:21:46.542,000 --> 0:21:47,000
the compass I rely on for direction,

383
0:21:48.305,000 --> 0:21:5,000
the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions,

384
0:21:51.146,000 --> 0:21:53,000
and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything."

385
0:21:54.458,000 --> 0:21:58,000
Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?

386
0:21:58.869,000 --> 0:22:,000
And here's one that does concern me.

387
0:22:02.463,000 --> 0:22:04,000
Remember I quoted him before with this line:

388
0:22:04.84,000 --> 0:22:07,000
"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense."

389
0:22:10.335,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And that's a problem.

390
0:22:14.843,000 --> 0:22:15,000
(Sighs)

391
0:22:15.867,000 --> 0:22:16,000
"Don't ever argue with the Devil.

392
0:22:17.535,000 --> 0:22:18,000
He's better at arguing than you are,

393
0:22:19.29,000 --> 0:22:21,000
having had thousands of years to practice."

394
0:22:21.7,000 --> 0:22:25,000
Now, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.

395
0:22:25.951,000 --> 0:22:26,000
It's an old move.

396
0:22:27.649,000 --> 0:22:29,000
It's a very clever adaptation of religions.

397
0:22:30.224,000 --> 0:22:33,000
It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.

398
0:22:35.546,000 --> 0:22:36,000
"You don't like my interpretation?

399
0:22:37.292,000 --> 0:22:38,000
You've got a reasonable objection to it?

400
0:22:39.268,000 --> 0:22:4,000
Don't listen, don't listen!

401
0:22:41.321,000 --> 0:22:42,000
That's the Devil speaking."

402
0:22:44.185,000 --> 0:22:49,000
This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship

403
0:22:49.81,000 --> 0:22:51,000
it seems to me that we want to have.

404
0:22:52.668,000 --> 0:22:54,000
I've got one more problem, then I'm through.

405
0:22:55.298,000 --> 0:22:59,000
And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.

406
0:23:00.593,000 --> 0:23:01,000
"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,

407
0:23:02.396,000 --> 0:23:04,000
'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples.

408
0:23:05.282,000 --> 0:23:08,000
Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,

409
0:23:08.521,000 --> 0:23:1,000
and teach them to do everything I've told you.'"

410
0:23:10.812,000 --> 0:23:13,000
The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world.

411
0:23:14.93,000 --> 0:23:18,000
We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so.

412
0:23:19.297,000 --> 0:23:21,000
Here's one, not as beautiful as the others;

413
0:23:21.647,000 --> 0:23:23,000
it simply shows the religions of the world.

414
0:23:25.066,000 --> 0:23:28,000
Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.

415
0:23:32.099,000 --> 0:23:36,000
Do we really want to commit ourselves

416
0:23:36.633,000 --> 0:23:4,000
to engulfing all the other religions,

417
0:23:41.577,000 --> 0:23:44,000
when their holy books are telling them,

418
0:23:44.967,000 --> 0:23:48,000
"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!"?

419
0:23:49.45,000 --> 0:23:55,000
It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship

420
0:23:55.811,000 --> 0:23:57,000
to get on for the future.

421
0:23:58.75,000 --> 0:24:02,000
I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently,

422
0:24:03,000 --> 0:24:05,000
in front of a church: "Good without God becomes zero."

423
0:24:05.691,000 --> 0:24:06,000
Sort of cute.

424
0:24:07.205,000 --> 0:24:09,000
A very clever little meme.

425
0:24:11.589,000 --> 0:24:16,000
I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is --

426
0:24:17.217,000 --> 0:24:19,000
not in this guise, but in general --

427
0:24:19.332,000 --> 0:24:22,000
is itself one of the main problems that we face.

428
0:24:22.609,000 --> 0:24:28,000
If you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged

429
0:24:29.304,000 --> 0:24:34,000
atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God.

430
0:24:35,000 --> 0:24:4,000
And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity

431
0:24:40.729,000 --> 0:24:41,000
instead of doing good works.

432
0:24:42.959,000 --> 0:24:45,000
So, I wish we could drop this meme.

433
0:24:46.578,000 --> 0:24:47,000
I wish this meme would go extinct.

434
0:24:48.595,000 --> 0:24:49,000
Thanks very much for your attention.

435
0:24:50.366,000 --> 0:24:52,000
(Applause)

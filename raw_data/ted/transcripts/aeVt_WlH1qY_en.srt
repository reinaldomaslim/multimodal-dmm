2
0:00:16.151,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to talk about the power of a word:

3
0:00:19.365,000 --> 0:00:22,000
jihad.

4
0:00:22.421,000 --> 0:00:26,000
To the vast majority of practicing Muslims,

5
0:00:26.777,000 --> 0:00:3,000
jihad is an internal struggle for the faith.

6
0:00:30.801,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin,

7
0:00:35.487,000 --> 0:00:37,000
temptation, lust, greed.

8
0:00:37.777,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It is a struggle to try and live a life

9
0:00:41.406,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.

10
0:00:48.104,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important

11
0:00:53.574,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.

12
0:00:59.432,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect,

13
0:01:03.178,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.

14
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And that's the reason why, for hundreds of years,

15
0:01:10.546,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad,

16
0:01:13.365,000 --> 0:01:15,000
their daughters as much as their sons, in the same way

17
0:01:15.887,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that, say, Christians name their daughters Grace,

18
0:01:19.709,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti,

19
0:01:23.677,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship.

20
0:01:29.149,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But there have always been, in Islam, a small group,

21
0:01:31.914,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a minority, who believe that jihad

22
0:01:34.383,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle

23
0:01:37.357,000 --> 0:01:43,000
against forces that would threaten the faith, or the faithul.

24
0:01:43.733,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And some of these people believe that in that struggle,

25
0:01:46.854,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it is sometimes okay to take up arms.

26
0:01:50.453,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And so the thousands of young Muslim men

27
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s

28
0:01:56.077,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country,

29
0:01:59.805,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in their minds they were fighting a jihad,

30
0:02:02.533,000 --> 0:02:04,000
they were doing jihad,

31
0:02:04.949,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and they named themselves the Mujahideen,

32
0:02:07.741,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad.

33
0:02:12.525,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And we forget this now, but back then

34
0:02:15.365,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America.

35
0:02:19.323,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking

36
0:02:21.821,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the good fight to the ungodly communists.

37
0:02:25.577,000 --> 0:02:27,000
America gave them weapons, gave them money,

38
0:02:27.622,000 --> 0:02:29,000
gave them support, encouragement.

39
0:02:30.621,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But within that group, a tiny, smaller group,

40
0:02:32.947,000 --> 0:02:35,000
a minority within a minority within a minority,

41
0:02:36.829,000 --> 0:02:38,000
were coming up with a new and dangerous

42
0:02:39.814,000 --> 0:02:41,000
conception of jihad,

43
0:02:42.633,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden,

44
0:02:47.942,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and he refined the idea.

45
0:02:49.442,000 --> 0:02:53,000
His idea of jihad was a global war of terror,

46
0:02:54.08,000 --> 0:02:56,000
primarily targeted at the far enemy,

47
0:02:56.59,000 --> 0:03:,000
at the crusaders from the West, against America.

48
0:03:00.989,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad

49
0:03:03.828,000 --> 0:03:05,000
were so horrendous, so monstrous,

50
0:03:06.508,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and had such great impact,

51
0:03:08.483,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that his definition was the one that stuck,

52
0:03:12.687,000 --> 0:03:13,000
not just here in the West.

53
0:03:13.966,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask.

54
0:03:17.825,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers

55
0:03:22.395,000 --> 0:03:27,000
were calling what they did jihad, then that's what jihad must mean.

56
0:03:27.605,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world,

57
0:03:30.862,000 --> 0:03:34,000
his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance.

58
0:03:35.533,000 --> 0:03:38,000
A year ago I was in Tunis, and I met the imam

59
0:03:38.885,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of a very small mosque, an old man.

60
0:03:40.825,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Fifteen years ago, he named his granddaughter Jihad,

61
0:03:44.79,000 --> 0:03:46,000
after the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that

62
0:03:47.757,000 --> 0:03:51,000
would inspire her to live a spiritual life.

63
0:03:52.189,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But he told me that after 9/11,

64
0:03:54.869,000 --> 0:03:56,000
he began to have second thoughts.

65
0:03:57.549,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He worried that if he called her by that name,

66
0:03:59.495,000 --> 0:04:01,000
especially outdoors, outside in public,

67
0:04:02.02,000 --> 0:04:07,000
he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad.

68
0:04:07.938,000 --> 0:04:09,000
On Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons

69
0:04:10.401,000 --> 0:04:14,000
trying to reclaim the meaning of the word,

70
0:04:14.818,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but his congregants, the people who came to his mosque,

71
0:04:18.557,000 --> 0:04:2,000
they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures

72
0:04:20.785,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.

73
0:04:26.527,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad,

74
0:04:29.553,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried

75
0:04:32.514,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention.

76
0:04:36.81,000 --> 0:04:39,000
He was wrong. Some people were paying attention,

77
0:04:40.082,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but for the wrong reasons.

78
0:04:41.988,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The United States, at this point, was putting pressure

79
0:04:44.762,000 --> 0:04:46,000
on all its Arab allies, including Tunisia,

80
0:04:47.201,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to stamp out extremism in their societies,

81
0:04:51.538,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs

82
0:04:55.005,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of the Tunisian intelligence service.

83
0:04:57.876,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They had never paid him any attention before --

84
0:04:59.332,000 --> 0:05:02,000
old man, small mosque --

85
0:05:02.557,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but now they began to pay visits,

86
0:05:04.767,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and sometimes they would drag him in for questions,

87
0:05:06.429,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and always the same question:

88
0:05:07.777,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad?

89
0:05:11.988,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons?

90
0:05:16.587,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Do you hate Americans?

91
0:05:18.652,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What is your connection to Osama bin Laden?"

92
0:05:22.772,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So to the Tunisian intelligence agency,

93
0:05:24.787,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and organizations like it all over the Arab world,

94
0:05:27.62,000 --> 0:05:31,000
jihad equaled extremism,

95
0:05:32.084,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized.

96
0:05:36.018,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That was the power of that word that he was able to do.

97
0:05:39.807,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.

98
0:05:45.529,000 --> 0:05:47,000
He told me that, of bin Laden's many crimes, this was,

99
0:05:48.444,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in his mind, one that didn't get enough attention,

100
0:05:51.516,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that he took this word, this beautiful idea.

101
0:05:55.314,000 --> 0:05:59,000
He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it

102
0:05:59.78,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and debased it and corrupted it

103
0:06:02.66,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and turned it into something it was never meant to be,

104
0:06:06.02,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and then persuaded all of us that it always was

105
0:06:11.697,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a global jihad.

106
0:06:14.339,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But the good news is

107
0:06:17.882,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that the global jihad is almost over, as bin Laden defined it.

108
0:06:23.661,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was dying well before he did,

109
0:06:26.219,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and now it's on its last legs.

110
0:06:28.528,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show

111
0:06:30.867,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that there is very little interest among Muslims

112
0:06:35.419,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in a global holy war against the West,

113
0:06:37.929,000 --> 0:06:4,000
against the far enemy.

114
0:06:41.243,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling.

115
0:06:45.453,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The supply of money — just as important, more important perhaps —

116
0:06:48.148,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling.

117
0:06:50.811,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The wealthy fanatics who were previously

118
0:06:53.619,000 --> 0:06:59,000
sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.

119
0:07:00.235,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What does that mean for us in the West?

120
0:07:01.668,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Does it mean we can break out the champagne,

121
0:07:05.387,000 --> 0:07:1,000
wash our hands of it, disengage, sleep easy at night?

122
0:07:10.615,000 --> 0:07:15,000
No. Disengagement is not an option,

123
0:07:15.699,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because if you let local jihad survive,

124
0:07:22.195,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it becomes international jihad.

125
0:07:24.979,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And so there's now a lot of different

126
0:07:27.66,000 --> 0:07:29,000
violent jihads all over the world.

127
0:07:30.196,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In Somalia, in Mali, in Nigeria,

128
0:07:32.483,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, there are groups that claim

129
0:07:37.634,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.

130
0:07:43.032,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They use his rhetoric.

131
0:07:44.548,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They even use the brand name he created for his jihad.

132
0:07:49.715,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,

133
0:07:53.873,000 --> 0:07:54,000
there's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,

134
0:07:55.502,000 --> 0:07:57,000
there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.

135
0:07:58.152,000 --> 0:08:,000
There are other groups -- in Nigeria, Boko Haram,

136
0:08:00.239,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in Somalia, al Shabaab -- and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.

137
0:08:06.352,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But if you look closely,

138
0:08:08.286,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they're not fighting a global jihad.

139
0:08:11.087,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They're fighting battles over much narrower issues.

140
0:08:15.173,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism,

141
0:08:19.542,000 --> 0:08:2,000
or it's a power struggle.

142
0:08:20.734,000 --> 0:08:21,000
More often than not, it's a power struggle

143
0:08:22.574,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in one country, or even a small region within one country.

144
0:08:26.17,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Occasionally they will go across a border,

145
0:08:29.134,000 --> 0:08:35,000
from Iraq to Syria, from Mali to Algeria,

146
0:08:35.413,000 --> 0:08:36,000
from Somalia to Kenya, but they're not fighting

147
0:08:37.293,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a global jihad against some far enemy.

148
0:08:42.334,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But that doesn't mean

149
0:08:45.421,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that we can relax.

150
0:08:47.748,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I was in Yemen recently, where -- it's the home

151
0:08:49.999,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of the last al Qaeda franchise

152
0:08:53.31,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that still aspires to attack America, attack the West.

153
0:08:57.422,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It's old school al Qaeda.

154
0:08:59.645,000 --> 0:09:,000
You may remember these guys.

155
0:09:00.832,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here,

156
0:09:03.513,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and they were using the Internet to try and instigate

157
0:09:06.462,000 --> 0:09:08,000
violence among American Muslims.

158
0:09:09.302,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But they have been distracted recently.

159
0:09:10.642,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Last year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen,

160
0:09:13.349,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and ran it, Taliban-style.

161
0:09:16.106,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And then the Yemeni military got its act together,

162
0:09:18.905,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and ordinary people rose up against these guys

163
0:09:22.222,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and drove them out, and since then, most of their activities,

164
0:09:25.508,000 --> 0:09:29,000
most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.

165
0:09:29.709,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So I think we've come to a point now where we can say

166
0:09:33.75,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that, just like all politics, all jihad is local.

167
0:09:37.246,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But that's still not reason for us to disengage,

168
0:09:41.718,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because we've seen that movie before, in Afghanistan.

169
0:09:45.463,000 --> 0:09:48,000
When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union,

170
0:09:49.262,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we disengaged.

171
0:09:51.958,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne,

172
0:09:59.047,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the Taliban had taken over in Kabul,

173
0:10:01.827,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and we said, "Local jihad, not our problem."

174
0:10:05.741,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar

175
0:10:08.467,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem.

176
0:10:11.003,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Local jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again.

177
0:10:17.284,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The good news is that it doesn't have to be.

178
0:10:20.891,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We know how to fight it now.

179
0:10:23.064,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We have the tools. We have the knowhow,

180
0:10:25.835,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and we can take the lessons we've learned

181
0:10:27.422,000 --> 0:10:3,000
from the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad,

182
0:10:31.323,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and apply those to local jihad.

183
0:10:34.803,000 --> 0:10:38,000
What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden:

184
0:10:39.595,000 --> 0:10:4,000
SEAL Team Six.

185
0:10:41.53,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Do we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?

186
0:10:45.992,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Who ended the global jihad?

187
0:10:49.355,000 --> 0:10:52,000
There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.

188
0:10:52.726,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Who killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.

189
0:10:57.004,000 --> 0:10:59,000
He probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement.

190
0:10:59.395,000 --> 0:11:03,000
In reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.

191
0:11:03.547,000 --> 0:11:05,000
He killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled

192
0:11:06.419,000 --> 0:11:1,000
the Muslim world with horror and revulsion,

193
0:11:10.603,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and what that meant was that his idea of jihad

194
0:11:13.796,000 --> 0:11:14,000
could never become mainstream.

195
0:11:15.375,000 --> 0:11:18,000
He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes

196
0:11:19.254,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of his own community.

197
0:11:23.315,000 --> 0:11:28,000
9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him.

198
0:11:28.423,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Who killed bin Ladenism? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it.

199
0:11:33.241,000 --> 0:11:36,000
He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq

200
0:11:36.434,000 --> 0:11:39,000
who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack

201
0:11:39.755,000 --> 0:11:45,000
not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites.

202
0:11:46.227,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam

203
0:11:50.195,000 --> 0:11:52,000
against the Western crusaders

204
0:11:53.038,000 --> 0:11:58,000
was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims.

205
0:11:58.712,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Who killed Osama bin Laden? The SEAL Team Six.

206
0:12:02.115,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Who killed bin Ladenism? Al Jazeera did,

207
0:12:04.823,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic,

208
0:12:09.883,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because they circumvented the old, state-owned

209
0:12:12.9,000 --> 0:12:15,000
television stations in a lot of these countries

210
0:12:16.395,000 --> 0:12:18,000
which were designed to keep information from people.

211
0:12:19.387,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Al Jazeera brought information to them, showed them

212
0:12:22.835,000 --> 0:12:25,000
what was being said and done in the name of their religion,

213
0:12:26.232,000 --> 0:12:31,000
exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda,

214
0:12:31.505,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and allowed them, gave them the information

215
0:12:33.411,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that allowed them to come to their own conclusions.

216
0:12:37.904,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Who killed bin Ladenism? The Arab Spring did,

217
0:12:41.24,000 --> 0:12:44,000
because it showed a way for young Muslims

218
0:12:44.704,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to bring about change

219
0:12:48.552,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in a manner that Osama bin Laden, with his

220
0:12:50.337,000 --> 0:12:53,000
limited imagination, could never have conceived.

221
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Who defeated the global jihad? The American military did,

222
0:12:57.398,000 --> 0:12:59,000
the American soldiers did, with their allies,

223
0:12:59.88,000 --> 0:13:04,000
fighting in faraway battlefields.

224
0:13:04.896,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And perhaps, a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it.

225
0:13:10.072,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So all these factors, and many more besides,

226
0:13:13.129,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we don't even fully understand some of them yet,

227
0:13:16.296,000 --> 0:13:18,000
these came together

228
0:13:19.129,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism,

229
0:13:22.92,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the global jihad, you needed this group effort.

230
0:13:26.768,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Now, not all of these things will work in local jihad.

231
0:13:28.848,000 --> 0:13:3,000
The American military is not going to march into Nigeria

232
0:13:31.77,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to take on Boko Haram,

233
0:13:34.379,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel

234
0:13:36.316,000 --> 0:13:4,000
into the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out.

235
0:13:40.85,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But many of these other factors that were in play

236
0:13:44.404,000 --> 0:13:49,000
are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done.

237
0:13:50.278,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We don't have to reinvent the wheel.

238
0:13:53.299,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed

239
0:13:56.77,000 --> 0:13:59,000
than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited.

240
0:14:00.346,000 --> 0:14:03,000
We don't have to go back to that.

241
0:14:03.962,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Satellite television and the Internet are informing

242
0:14:07.996,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways.

243
0:14:12.383,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And the Arab Spring has produced governments,

244
0:14:15.008,000 --> 0:14:18,000
many of them Islamist governments,

245
0:14:18.112,000 --> 0:14:2,000
who know that, for their own self-preservation,

246
0:14:21.077,000 --> 0:14:26,000
they need to take on the extremists in their midsts.

247
0:14:26.987,000 --> 0:14:28,000
We don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them,

248
0:14:29.842,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because they haven't really come to this place before.

249
0:14:35.088,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need

250
0:14:38.842,000 --> 0:14:4,000
we already have, and we are very good at giving:

251
0:14:41.641,000 --> 0:14:44,000
economic assistance, not just money, but expertise,

252
0:14:45.564,000 --> 0:14:47,000
technology, knowhow,

253
0:14:48.201,000 --> 0:14:52,000
private investment, fair terms of trade,

254
0:14:52.239,000 --> 0:14:56,000
medicine, education, technical support for training

255
0:14:56.449,000 --> 0:14:59,000
for their police forces to become more effective,

256
0:14:59.54,000 --> 0:15:03,000
for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient.

257
0:15:04.407,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We've got plenty of these things.

258
0:15:05.821,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Some of the other things that they need

259
0:15:08.114,000 --> 0:15:11,000
we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is.

260
0:15:11.569,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Time, patience, subtlety, understanding --

261
0:15:16.766,000 --> 0:15:18,000
these are harder to give.

262
0:15:18.808,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I live in New York now. Just this week,

263
0:15:21.185,000 --> 0:15:23,000
posters have gone up in subway stations in New York

264
0:15:23.723,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that describe jihad as savage.

265
0:15:29.449,000 --> 0:15:33,000
But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East,

266
0:15:33.802,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I have never been as optimistic as I am today

267
0:15:37.034,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that the gap between the Muslim world and the West

268
0:15:40.697,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is narrowing fast,

269
0:15:43.321,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and one of the many reasons for my optimism

270
0:15:44.994,000 --> 0:15:47,000
is that, because I know there are millions,

271
0:15:48.306,000 --> 0:15:51,000
hundreds of millions of people, Muslims like that old imam

272
0:15:52.129,000 --> 0:15:58,000
in Tunis, who are reclaiming this word

273
0:15:58.871,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and restoring to its original, beautiful purpose.

274
0:16:04.219,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Bin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated.

275
0:16:06.835,000 --> 0:16:1,000
His definition of jihad can now be expunged.

276
0:16:11.216,000 --> 0:16:15,000
To that jihad we can say, "Goodbye. Good riddance."

277
0:16:15.757,000 --> 0:16:21,000
To the real jihad we can say, "Welcome back. Good luck."

278
0:16:22.291,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Thank you. (Applause)

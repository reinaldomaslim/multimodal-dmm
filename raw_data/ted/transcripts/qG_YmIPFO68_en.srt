1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want to talk to you about the future of medicine.

2
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about the past.

3
0:00:21.08,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now, throughout much of the recent history of medicine,

4
0:00:24.72,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we've thought about illness and treatment

5
0:00:28.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in terms of a profoundly simple model.

6
0:00:31.96,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In fact, the model is so simple

7
0:00:34.68,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that you could summarize it in six words:

8
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:41,000
have disease, take pill, kill something.

9
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, the reason for the dominance of this model

10
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is of course the antibiotic revolution.

11
0:00:50.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Many of you might not know this, but we happen to be celebrating

12
0:00:53.68,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States.

13
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But what you do know

14
0:00:59.4,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative.

15
0:01:04.88,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Here you had a chemical, either from the natural world

16
0:01:08.76,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or artificially synthesized in the laboratory,

17
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and it would course through your body,

18
0:01:14.8,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it would find its target,

19
0:01:17.6,000 --> 0:01:18,000
lock into its target --

20
0:01:19.28,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a microbe or some part of a microbe --

21
0:01:21.52,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and then turn off a lock and a key

22
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:28,000
with exquisite deftness, exquisite specificity.

23
0:01:29.52,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And you would end up taking a previously fatal, lethal disease --

24
0:01:33.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis --

25
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and transforming that into a curable, or treatable illness.

26
0:01:42.08,000 --> 0:01:43,000
You have a pneumonia,

27
0:01:44.48,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you take penicillin,

28
0:01:45.88,000 --> 0:01:46,000
you kill the microbe

29
0:01:47.44,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and you cure the disease.

30
0:01:49.6,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So seductive was this idea,

31
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:56,000
so potent the metaphor of lock and key

32
0:01:56.76,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and killing something,

33
0:01:58.32,000 --> 0:02:,000
that it really swept through biology.

34
0:02:00.36,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It was a transformation like no other.

35
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And we've really spent the last 100 years

36
0:02:07.36,000 --> 0:02:1,000
trying to replicate that model over and over again

37
0:02:10.84,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in noninfectious diseases,

38
0:02:12.103,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease.

39
0:02:17.12,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And it's worked, but it's only worked partly.

40
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Let me show you.

41
0:02:22.8,000 --> 0:02:24,000
You know, if you take the entire universe

42
0:02:25.72,000 --> 0:02:28,000
of all chemical reactions in the human body,

43
0:02:29.24,000 --> 0:02:32,000
every chemical reaction that your body is capable of,

44
0:02:32.56,000 --> 0:02:35,000
most people think that that number is on the order of a million.

45
0:02:35.6,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Let's call it a million.

46
0:02:36.92,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And now you ask the question,

47
0:02:38.64,000 --> 0:02:4,000
what number or fraction of reactions

48
0:02:41.32,000 --> 0:02:42,000
can actually be targeted

49
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
by the entire pharmacopoeia, all of medicinal chemistry?

50
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That number is 250.

51
0:02:51.68,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The rest is chemical darkness.

52
0:02:54.24,000 --> 0:03:,000
In other words, 0.025 percent of all chemical reactions in your body

53
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:04,000
are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism.

54
0:03:05.68,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You know, if you think about human physiology

55
0:03:08.76,000 --> 0:03:11,000
as a vast global telephone network

56
0:03:12.24,000 --> 0:03:15,000
with interacting nodes and interacting pieces,

57
0:03:16.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
then all of our medicinal chemistry

58
0:03:19.8,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is operating on one tiny corner

59
0:03:22.08,000 --> 0:03:24,000
at the edge, the outer edge, of that network.

60
0:03:24.8,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry

61
0:03:28.64,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas

62
0:03:32.44,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who is tinkering with about 10 or 15 telephone lines.

63
0:03:36.88,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So what do we do about this idea?

64
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
What if we reorganized this approach?

65
0:03:44.08,000 --> 0:03:47,000
In fact, it turns out that the natural world

66
0:03:47.48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
gives us a sense of how one might think about illness

67
0:03:52.56,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in a radically different way,

68
0:03:54.24,000 --> 0:03:57,000
rather than disease, medicine, target.

69
0:03:59.08,000 --> 0:04:02,000
In fact, the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards,

70
0:04:02.48,000 --> 0:04:03,000
not downwards, but upwards,

71
0:04:04.36,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and we begin with a self-regulating, semi-autonomous unit called a cell.

72
0:04:11.64,000 --> 0:04:14,000
These self-regulating, semi-autonomous units

73
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:18,000
give rise to self-regulating, semi-autonomous units called organs,

74
0:04:19.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and these organs coalesce to form things called humans,

75
0:04:23.92,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and these organisms ultimately live in environments,

76
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which are partly self-regulating and partly semi-autonomous.

77
0:04:32.92,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What's nice about this scheme, this hierarchical scheme

78
0:04:35.76,000 --> 0:04:37,000
building upwards rather than downwards,

79
0:04:38.48,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is that it allows us to think about illness as well

80
0:04:41.88,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in a somewhat different way.

81
0:04:44.4,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Take a disease like cancer.

82
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Since the 1950s,

83
0:04:49.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we've tried rather desperately to apply this lock and key model to cancer.

84
0:04:54.991,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We've tried to kill cells

85
0:04:57.905,000 --> 0:05:01,000
using a variety of chemotherapies or targeted therapies,

86
0:05:02.276,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and as most of us know, that's worked.

87
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's worked for diseases like leukemia.

88
0:05:06.602,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's worked for some forms of breast cancer,

89
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach.

90
0:05:12.76,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it's only in the last 10 years or so

91
0:05:15.28,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that we've begun to think about using the immune system,

92
0:05:18.44,000 --> 0:05:21,000
remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum.

93
0:05:21.56,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It actually grows in a human organism.

94
0:05:23.64,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And could you use the organismal capacity,

95
0:05:25.96,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the fact that human beings have an immune system, to attack cancer?

96
0:05:29.127,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In fact, it's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer.

97
0:05:34.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And finally there's the level of the environment, isn't there?

98
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You know, we don't think of cancer as altering the environment.

99
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.

100
0:05:46.08,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's called a prison.

101
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You take loneliness, you take depression, you take confinement,

102
0:05:53.32,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and you add to that,

103
0:05:55.4,000 --> 0:05:57,000
rolled up in a little white sheet of paper,

104
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
one of the most potent neurostimulants that we know, called nicotine,

105
0:06:02.8,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know,

106
0:06:07.76,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and you have a pro-carcinogenic environment.

107
0:06:11.52,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But you can have anti-carcinogenic environments too.

108
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
There are attempts to create milieus,

109
0:06:16.72,000 --> 0:06:18,000
change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer, for instance.

110
0:06:20.44,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer.

111
0:06:23.88,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Or take another disease, like depression.

112
0:06:26.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Again, working upwards,

113
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
since the 1960s and 1970s, we've tried, again, desperately

114
0:06:33.04,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells --

115
0:06:37.24,000 --> 0:06:39,000
serotonin, dopamine --

116
0:06:39.44,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and tried to cure depression that way,

117
0:06:41.28,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and that's worked, but then that reached the limit.

118
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And we now know that what you really probably need to do

119
0:06:47.644,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is to change the physiology of the organ, the brain,

120
0:06:50.64,000 --> 0:06:52,000
rewire it, remodel it,

121
0:06:52.8,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and that, of course, we know study upon study has shown

122
0:06:55.4,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that talk therapy does exactly that,

123
0:06:57.139,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and study upon study has shown that talk therapy

124
0:06:59.419,000 --> 0:07:02,000
combined with medicines, pills,

125
0:07:02.56,000 --> 0:07:04,000
really is much more effective than either one alone.

126
0:07:05.84,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Can we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression?

127
0:07:09.44,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Can you lock out the signals that elicit depression?

128
0:07:13.52,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Again, moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization.

129
0:07:19.76,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What's really at stake perhaps here

130
0:07:22.48,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is not the medicine itself but a metaphor.

131
0:07:25.76,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Rather than killing something,

132
0:07:27.84,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases --

133
0:07:31.56,000 --> 0:07:34,000
kidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis --

134
0:07:35.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
maybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something.

135
0:07:38.676,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And that's the key, perhaps,

136
0:07:40.64,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to reframing our thinking about medicine.

137
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now, this idea of changing,

138
0:07:46.64,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of creating a perceptual shift, as it were,

139
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
came home to me to roost in a very personal manner about 10 years ago.

140
0:07:52.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
About 10 years ago -- I've been a runner most of my life --

141
0:07:55.12,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I went for a run, a Saturday morning run,

142
0:07:57.12,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move.

143
0:07:59.8,000 --> 0:08:01,000
My right knee was swollen up,

144
0:08:01.84,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone.

145
0:08:06.24,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs.

146
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I had an MRI the next week, and it looked like that.

147
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone

148
0:08:19.48,000 --> 0:08:22,000
had been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered.

149
0:08:22.92,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now, if you're looking at me and feeling sorry,

150
0:08:25.4,000 --> 0:08:26,000
let me tell you a few facts.

151
0:08:27.24,000 --> 0:08:31,000
If I was to take an MRI of every person in this audience,

152
0:08:31.44,000 --> 0:08:33,000
60 percent of you would show signs

153
0:08:33.52,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this.

154
0:08:36.32,000 --> 0:08:39,000
85 percent of all women by the age of 70

155
0:08:40.12,000 --> 0:08:43,000
would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration.

156
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:45,000
50 to 60 percent of the men in this audience

157
0:08:45.72,000 --> 0:08:46,000
would also have such signs.

158
0:08:47.08,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So this is a very common disease.

159
0:08:48.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Well, the second perk of being a physician

160
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments.

161
0:08:54.159,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So about 10 years ago we began,

162
0:08:56.4,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we brought this process into the laboratory,

163
0:08:58.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
and we began to do simple experiments,

164
0:09:00.88,000 --> 0:09:02,000
mechanically trying to fix this degeneration.

165
0:09:03.36,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals

166
0:09:08.2,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to try to reverse cartilage degeneration,

167
0:09:10.88,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process,

168
0:09:15.44,000 --> 0:09:16,000
essentially it came to naught.

169
0:09:17.24,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Nothing happened.

170
0:09:18.88,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And then about seven years ago, we had a research student from Australia.

171
0:09:23.68,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The nice thing about Australians

172
0:09:25.205,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down.

173
0:09:28.546,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:29.727,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And so Dan suggested to me, "You know, maybe it isn't a mechanical problem.

175
0:09:33.84,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Maybe it isn't a chemical problem. Maybe it's a stem cell problem."

176
0:09:39.76,000 --> 0:09:4,000
In other words, he had two hypotheses.

177
0:09:41.68,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Number one, there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell --

178
0:09:45.52,000 --> 0:09:48,000
a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton,

179
0:09:49.064,000 --> 0:09:51,000
bone, cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton,

180
0:09:51.62,000 --> 0:09:52,000
just like there's a stem cell in blood,

181
0:09:53.51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
just like there's a stem cell in the nervous system.

182
0:09:55.969,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And two, that maybe that, the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell

183
0:09:59.554,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is what's causing osteochondral arthritis, a very common ailment.

184
0:10:03.08,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So really the question was, were we looking for a pill

185
0:10:06.32,000 --> 0:10:08,000
when we should have really been looking for a cell.

186
0:10:08.96,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So we switched our models,

187
0:10:11.84,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and now we began to look for skeletal stem cells.

188
0:10:15.56,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And to cut again a long story short,

189
0:10:18.08,000 --> 0:10:2,000
about five years ago, we found these cells.

190
0:10:21.8,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They live inside the skeleton.

191
0:10:24.32,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Here's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them.

192
0:10:27.24,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The white stuff is bone,

193
0:10:29.2,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and these red columns that you see and the yellow cells

194
0:10:32.24,000 --> 0:10:35,000
are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell --

195
0:10:35.52,000 --> 0:10:38,000
columns of cartilage, columns of bone coming out of a single cell.

196
0:10:38.84,000 --> 0:10:41,000
These cells are fascinating. They have four properties.

197
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Number one is that they live where they're expected to live.

198
0:10:45.96,000 --> 0:10:47,000
They live just underneath the surface of the bone,

199
0:10:48.36,000 --> 0:10:49,000
underneath cartilage.

200
0:10:49.92,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You know, in biology, it's location, location, location.

201
0:10:52.564,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage.

202
0:10:56.84,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That's one.

203
0:10:58.12,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Here's an interesting property.

204
0:10:59.68,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton,

205
0:11:02.36,000 --> 0:11:04,000
you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory,

206
0:11:04.96,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and they are dying to form cartilage.

207
0:11:06.96,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Remember how we couldn't form cartilage for love or money?

208
0:11:09.706,000 --> 0:11:1,000
These cells are dying to form cartilage.

209
0:11:11.65,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They form their own furls of cartilage around themselves.

210
0:11:14.68,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They're also, number three,

211
0:11:16.32,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the most efficient repairers of fractures that we've ever encountered.

212
0:11:20.52,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This is a little bone, a mouse bone that we fractured

213
0:11:23.84,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and then let it heal by itself.

214
0:11:25.4,000 --> 0:11:28,000
These stem cells have come in and repaired, in yellow, the bone,

215
0:11:28.44,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in white, the cartilage, almost completely.

216
0:11:31.08,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye

217
0:11:34.64,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue

218
0:11:38.4,000 --> 0:11:39,000
coming into the area of a fracture,

219
0:11:40.28,000 --> 0:11:42,000
fixing it locally and then stopping their work.

220
0:11:43.28,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now, the fourth one is the most ominous,

221
0:11:45.64,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and that is that their numbers decline precipitously,

222
0:11:49.8,000 --> 0:11:53,000
precipitously, tenfold, fiftyfold, as you age.

223
0:11:54.52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And so what had happened, really,

224
0:11:56.12,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift.

225
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We had gone hunting for pills

226
0:12:01.76,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but we ended up finding theories.

227
0:12:04.28,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And in some ways

228
0:12:05.52,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea:

229
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
cells, organisms, environments,

230
0:12:11.08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because we were now thinking about bone stem cells,

231
0:12:13.68,000 --> 0:12:16,000
we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease.

232
0:12:17.84,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And then the next question was, are there organs?

233
0:12:20.15,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Can you build this as an organ outside the body?

234
0:12:22.413,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma?

235
0:12:26.28,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And perhaps most interestingly,

236
0:12:28.28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
can you ascend right up and create environments?

237
0:12:30.68,000 --> 0:12:33,000
You know, we know that exercise remodels bone,

238
0:12:33.76,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but come on, none of us is going to exercise.

239
0:12:36.2,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone

240
0:12:41.4,000 --> 0:12:45,000
so that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage?

241
0:12:46.24,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And perhaps more interesting, and more importantly,

242
0:12:48.645,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the question is, can you apply this model more globally outside medicine?

243
0:12:52.12,000 --> 0:12:56,000
What's at stake, as I said before, is not killing something,

244
0:12:56.2,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but growing something.

245
0:12:58.28,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And it raises a series of, I think, some of the most interesting questions

246
0:13:03.12,000 --> 0:13:05,000
about how we think about medicine in the future.

247
0:13:07.04,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Could your medicine be a cell and not a pill?

248
0:13:10.84,000 --> 0:13:12,000
How would we grow these cells?

249
0:13:13.24,000 --> 0:13:16,000
What we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells?

250
0:13:16.28,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We heard about the problems of unleashing growth.

251
0:13:20.2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Could we implant suicide genes into these cells

252
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to stop them from growing?

253
0:13:25.04,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Could your medicine be an organ that's created outside the body

254
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and then implanted into the body?

255
0:13:30.96,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Could that stop some of the degeneration?

256
0:13:33.72,000 --> 0:13:34,000
What if the organ needed to have memory?

257
0:13:35.649,000 --> 0:13:39,000
In cases of diseases of the nervous system some of those organs had memory.

258
0:13:40.44,000 --> 0:13:42,000
How could we implant those memories back in?

259
0:13:42.92,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Could we store these organs?

260
0:13:44.76,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being

261
0:13:47.927,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and put back?

262
0:13:50.52,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And perhaps most puzzlingly,

263
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
could your medicine be an environment?

264
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Could you patent an environment?

265
0:13:57.84,000 --> 0:14:,000
You know, in every culture,

266
0:14:01.32,000 --> 0:14:03,000
shamans have been using environments as medicines.

267
0:14:04.28,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Could we imagine that for our future?

268
0:14:08.08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I've talked a lot about models. I began this talk with models.

269
0:14:11.48,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So let me end with some thoughts about model building.

270
0:14:14.2,000 --> 0:14:16,000
That's what we do as scientists.

271
0:14:16.32,000 --> 0:14:19,000
You know, when an architect builds a model,

272
0:14:19.64,000 --> 0:14:22,000
he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature.

273
0:14:22.96,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But when a scientist is building a model,

274
0:14:25.88,000 --> 0:14:27,000
he or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor.

275
0:14:29.6,000 --> 0:14:32,000
He or she is trying to create a new way of seeing.

276
0:14:33.48,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The former is a scale shift. The latter is a perceptual shift.

277
0:14:38.92,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Now, antibiotics created such a perceptual shift

278
0:14:43.88,000 --> 0:14:46,000
in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored, distorted,

279
0:14:47.72,000 --> 0:14:5,000
very successfully, the way we've thought about medicine for the last hundred years.

280
0:14:52.4,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But we need new models to think about medicine in the future.

281
0:14:56.84,000 --> 0:14:57,000
That's what's at stake.

282
0:14:59.48,000 --> 0:15:02,000
You know, there's a popular trope out there

283
0:15:02.84,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that the reason we haven't had the transformative impact

284
0:15:06.84,000 --> 0:15:07,000
on the treatment of illness

285
0:15:08.84,000 --> 0:15:1,000
is because we don't have powerful-enough drugs,

286
0:15:11.72,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and that's partly true.

287
0:15:14.12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But perhaps the real reason is

288
0:15:15.64,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that we don't have powerful-enough ways of thinking about medicines.

289
0:15:20.56,000 --> 0:15:22,000
It's certainly true that

290
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
it would be lovely to have new medicines.

291
0:15:26.8,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's:

292
0:15:31.48,000 --> 0:15:34,000
mechanisms, models, metaphors.

293
0:15:35.32,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you.

294
0:15:36.68,000 --> 0:15:42,000
(Applause)

295
0:15:45.6,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Chris Anderson: I really like this metaphor.

296
0:15:49.04,000 --> 0:15:5,000
How does it link in?

297
0:15:50.6,000 --> 0:15:53,000
There's a lot of talk in technologyland

298
0:15:53.76,000 --> 0:15:55,000
about the personalization of medicine,

299
0:15:55.92,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future

300
0:15:59.36,000 --> 0:16:03,000
will be for you specifically, your genome, your current context.

301
0:16:03.88,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Does that apply to this model you've got here?

302
0:16:07.84,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Siddhartha Mukherjee: It's a very interesting question.

303
0:16:10.48,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We've thought about personalization of medicine

304
0:16:12.72,000 --> 0:16:13,000
very much in terms of genomics.

305
0:16:14.28,000 --> 0:16:16,000
That's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor,

306
0:16:16.88,000 --> 0:16:18,000
again, to use that same word, in medicine today,

307
0:16:19.88,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine.

308
0:16:23.64,000 --> 0:16:26,000
But of course the genome is just the bottom

309
0:16:26.76,000 --> 0:16:29,000
of a long chain of being, as it were.

310
0:16:30.6,000 --> 0:16:33,000
That chain of being, really the first organized unit of that, is the cell.

311
0:16:34.44,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So, if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way,

312
0:16:37.44,000 --> 0:16:39,000
we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies,

313
0:16:40.28,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and then personalizing organ or organismal therapies,

314
0:16:43.48,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment.

315
0:16:47.32,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So I think at every stage, you know --

316
0:16:50.44,000 --> 0:16:52,000
there's that metaphor, there's turtles all the way.

317
0:16:52.88,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Well, in this, there's personalization all the way.

318
0:16:55.285,000 --> 0:16:57,000
CA: So when you say medicine could be a cell

319
0:16:58.2,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and not a pill,

320
0:17:00.04,000 --> 0:17:02,000
you're talking about potentially your own cells.

321
0:17:02.32,000 --> 0:17:04,000
SM: Absolutely. CA: So converted to stem cells,

322
0:17:04.72,000 --> 0:17:08,000
perhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something, and prepared.

323
0:17:09.28,000 --> 0:17:11,000
SM: And there's no perhaps. This is what we're doing.

324
0:17:11.84,000 --> 0:17:14,000
This is what's happening, and in fact, we're slowly moving,

325
0:17:15.6,000 --> 0:17:18,000
not away from genomics, but incorporating genomics

326
0:17:19.44,000 --> 0:17:23,000
into what we call multi-order, semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,

327
0:17:24.2,000 --> 0:17:26,000
like cells, like organs, like environments.

328
0:17:26.829,000 --> 0:17:27,000
CA: Thank you so much.

329
0:17:28.227,000 --> 0:17:29,000
SM: Pleasure. Thanks.

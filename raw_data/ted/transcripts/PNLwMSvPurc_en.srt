2
0:00:13.698,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In February 2013, my wife and I moved to Singapore.

3
0:00:18.651,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Exactly at the same time,

4
0:00:20.254,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Uber has announced it started operations in the country.

5
0:00:23.536,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, my wife and I agree on a lot of things,

6
0:00:27.456,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but using Uber was definitely not one of them.

7
0:00:31.797,000 --> 0:00:33,000
While I was excited about the technology

8
0:00:33.847,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and how maybe we don't need to own cars anymore,

9
0:00:37.117,000 --> 0:00:42,000
she felt that every Uber car is here to steal jobs from taxi drivers.

10
0:00:44.519,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And Sarah was not the only one.

11
0:00:47.519,000 --> 0:00:5,000
As the Ubers, Airbnbs and Amazons of the world --

12
0:00:50.915,000 --> 0:00:52,000
what we call "online marketplaces" --

13
0:00:53.323,000 --> 0:00:56,000
as they started expanding their presence,

14
0:00:56.744,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we have heard, all of us, countless policymakers

15
0:01:00.053,000 --> 0:01:02,000
worried about how to deal with these new risks

16
0:01:02.744,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of job destruction, lower wages and tax leakage.

17
0:01:07.244,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We've also heard company leaders

18
0:01:09.551,000 --> 0:01:12,000
worried about aggressive competition from global platforms

19
0:01:12.916,000 --> 0:01:14,000
eating up their local businesses.

20
0:01:16.067,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And on the rational level, of course I understand.

21
0:01:19.75,000 --> 0:01:21,000
After all, this is basic supply and demand economics.

22
0:01:22.577,000 --> 0:01:24,000
If, in any market, you dramatically increase supply,

23
0:01:25.482,000 --> 0:01:28,000
you should expect prices, profitability and growth to go down

24
0:01:28.985,000 --> 0:01:29,000
for existing players.

25
0:01:31.371,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But in my personal experience,

26
0:01:33.49,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I've also seen the other side of the story.

27
0:01:36.615,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Where online marketplaces,

28
0:01:38.172,000 --> 0:01:41,000
like Gojek in Indonesia or Jumia in Africa,

29
0:01:41.885,000 --> 0:01:44,000
have helped their business ecosystems and the communities around them.

30
0:01:46.17,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The positive side I have seen

31
0:01:47.919,000 --> 0:01:51,000
demonstrated itself in a woman, a taxi driver in Egypt,

32
0:01:52.721,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that now had the opportunity to work

33
0:01:54.8,000 --> 0:01:56,000
without the harassment she faced in the taxi business.

34
0:01:57.601,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It demonstrated itself through a village in Kenya

35
0:02:02.686,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that got an economic boost,

36
0:02:04.371,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because the nearby beautiful but completely unknown lake

37
0:02:07.673,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is now becoming a national ecotourism spot.

38
0:02:12.276,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Online marketplaces will continue to grow.

39
0:02:15.347,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And they will transform the way we shop,

40
0:02:17.3,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the way we travel

41
0:02:18.506,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and the way we transact with each other.

42
0:02:20.561,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So we really need to understand

43
0:02:23.395,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where is the truth between those two stories.

44
0:02:26.736,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Should we expect more of the bright side

45
0:02:29.712,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or more of the dark and worrying side?

46
0:02:32.585,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And is there a way to get the first without getting the second?

47
0:02:36.839,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I believe there is.

48
0:02:38.514,000 --> 0:02:41,000
As a strategy consultant, I study businesses for a living.

49
0:02:42.069,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And as a mathematician at heart,

50
0:02:43.776,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I couldn't live with something and its opposite being equally true.

51
0:02:47.006,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So, I went back to fundamentals, and I asked the question:

52
0:02:51.339,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What do online marketplaces really do?

53
0:02:54.903,000 --> 0:02:55,000
What do they do?

54
0:02:57.347,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, at their core,

55
0:02:59.188,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they're doing something very simple.

56
0:03:01.583,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They match sellers and buyers.

57
0:03:04.044,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That's it.

58
0:03:05.52,000 --> 0:03:07,000
For drivers and passengers,

59
0:03:08.02,000 --> 0:03:1,000
you get Uber, Grab in Southeast Asia

60
0:03:10.427,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or DiDi in China.

61
0:03:12.688,000 --> 0:03:14,000
For matching merchants and consumers,

62
0:03:14.898,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you get Amazon, Alibaba or Jumia in Africa.

63
0:03:17.927,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And for housing, you get Airbnb;

64
0:03:20.268,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for fundraising, you get Kickstarter --

65
0:03:22.434,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the list goes on.

66
0:03:24.125,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What all these examples have in common

67
0:03:26.911,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is that they transition this basic functionality

68
0:03:29.474,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of matching sellers and buyers

69
0:03:31.149,000 --> 0:03:34,000
from the physical world to the digital world.

70
0:03:34.22,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And by doing so,

71
0:03:36.157,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they can find better matches,

72
0:03:37.992,000 --> 0:03:38,000
do it faster

73
0:03:39.18,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and ultimately, unlock more value for everyone.

74
0:03:43.847,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In fact, online marketplaces' core benefit

75
0:03:47.331,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is that they get us more from the same amount of effort.

76
0:03:51.958,000 --> 0:03:52,000
For example,

77
0:03:53.561,000 --> 0:03:55,000
if you're a taxi driver in San Francisco

78
0:03:55.958,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and you decide to work 10 hours per day,

79
0:03:59.609,000 --> 0:04:02,000
then you're actually having a paying passenger in your car

80
0:04:02.688,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for four hours out of the 10.

81
0:04:05.168,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If you take the same car and put it on a platform like Uber,

82
0:04:09.311,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you can have paying passengers

83
0:04:11.233,000 --> 0:04:13,000
for an additional one and a half hours.

84
0:04:13.446,000 --> 0:04:17,000
This is the same car becoming 40 percent more productive.

85
0:04:18.466,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And the same has been proven true for other online marketplaces.

86
0:04:22.188,000 --> 0:04:25,000
By design, they create more value for the economy.

87
0:04:28.339,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, we need to figure out who gets this additional value.

88
0:04:32.895,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You can give it to the drivers --

89
0:04:34.832,000 --> 0:04:35,000
more passengers, more income.

90
0:04:36.744,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You can give it to consumers, if you reduce prices.

91
0:04:39.784,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Or you can decide that the platform gets to keep all of it.

92
0:04:43.689,000 --> 0:04:45,000
What usually happens is that all three of them

93
0:04:46.173,000 --> 0:04:47,000
would somehow split it.

94
0:04:48.776,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But what about the rest of us?

95
0:04:52.149,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We can also be impacted

96
0:04:53.541,000 --> 0:04:55,000
without being on either sides of this business.

97
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If my neighbor decides to rent his apartment on Airbnb,

98
0:04:59.125,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we have more people coming in and out of the building,

99
0:05:02.341,000 --> 0:05:03,000
more noise than usual,

100
0:05:04.047,000 --> 0:05:08,000
then I'm getting an unpleasant side effect of this productivity magic.

101
0:05:09.389,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is what economists would call a "negative externality."

102
0:05:13.173,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The negative externality of Uber cars becoming more productive

103
0:05:16.823,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop

104
0:05:19.873,000 --> 0:05:22,000
by as much as 30 percent in New York, for example.

105
0:05:23.981,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This is the dark side.

106
0:05:26.307,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And this is what sparks street demonstrations

107
0:05:29.466,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and sometimes, sometimes, even violence.

108
0:05:33.323,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I profoundly believe this is avoidable.

109
0:05:35.942,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And it became clearer to me

110
0:05:37.442,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the more I have spent time in emerging markets.

111
0:05:40.569,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In fact, during my time in Singapore,

112
0:05:42.45,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I spent half of any given week traveling in the region,

113
0:05:45.592,000 --> 0:05:47,000
between Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia,

114
0:05:48.355,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and I became a user --

115
0:05:49.76,000 --> 0:05:5,000
actually, more of a fan --

116
0:05:51.339,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of online marketplaces that were not that well-known back then.

117
0:05:56.047,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But some of them made interesting strategic trade-offs

118
0:05:59.531,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that dramatically reduced their side effects,

119
0:06:02.048,000 --> 0:06:03,000
their externalities.

120
0:06:04.871,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Take Gojek, for example.

121
0:06:07.347,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They're basically Uber for motor bikes.

122
0:06:09.99,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They are one of the most liked online marketplaces in Indonesia,

123
0:06:15.383,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and this has a lot to do with the role they chose to play.

124
0:06:19.637,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Instead of picking a fight

125
0:06:20.915,000 --> 0:06:22,000
with every other transportation option out there,

126
0:06:23.637,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they choose to gradually integrate them within their own platform,

127
0:06:28.158,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so that without leaving the Gojek app,

128
0:06:30.944,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you can check the public transportation schedule

129
0:06:33.325,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and choose to take a bus for a long distance.

130
0:06:35.682,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Then, maybe, a motorbike or a traditional taxi

131
0:06:39.157,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that you can order and pay for from within the same app.

132
0:06:45.039,000 --> 0:06:46,000
If you look at Gojek today,

133
0:06:46.547,000 --> 0:06:49,000
nine out of 10 previous motor taxi drivers

134
0:06:49.579,000 --> 0:06:54,000
believe their quality of life has improved after joining the platform.

135
0:06:54.669,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And nine out of 10 consumers --

136
0:06:57.003,000 --> 0:06:58,000
nine out of 10 --

137
0:06:58.432,000 --> 0:07:03,000
believe that Gojek has a positive impact on society in general.

138
0:07:04.403,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now, this level of trust is what allowed Gojek to grow

139
0:07:08.6,000 --> 0:07:11,000
into what is today a super online marketplace for everything

140
0:07:12.403,000 --> 0:07:14,000
from food to grocery

141
0:07:14.585,000 --> 0:07:16,000
even massages and laundry pickups.

142
0:07:18.442,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It all came from a deliberate trade-off

143
0:07:21.942,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to be an orchestrator of a bigger ecosystem

144
0:07:24.674,000 --> 0:07:26,000
where others also have their role to play,

145
0:07:27.488,000 --> 0:07:29,000
instead of a single winner, a hero,

146
0:07:29.821,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that takes for himself what would, at the end, be a smaller pie.

147
0:07:35.046,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Another interesting example is Jumia.

148
0:07:37.506,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Jumia is the equivalent of Amazon in Africa.

149
0:07:40.768,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But they don't generate the same level of fear

150
0:07:43.577,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in the small-business community.

151
0:07:46.379,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And one of the reasons for that

152
0:07:48.165,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is because they have decided to actively invest

153
0:07:51.924,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in African entrepreneurs,

154
0:07:53.638,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to grow them into the digital age.

155
0:07:56.292,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now keep in mind,

156
0:07:57.506,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Jumia is operating in countries with some of the lowest digital literacy

157
0:08:01.641,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and digital connectivity scores in the world.

158
0:08:04.886,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now they could have dealt with that

159
0:08:06.942,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the usual way, through lobbying for reforms --

160
0:08:09.553,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and they probably do that --

161
0:08:11.45,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but they have also built Jumia University,

162
0:08:14.558,000 --> 0:08:15,000
an e-learning platform

163
0:08:15.807,000 --> 0:08:19,000
where merchants can come and learn basic digital and business skills.

164
0:08:21.085,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We have studied online marketplaces in Africa last year.

165
0:08:25.141,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And during that study, we have met one of Jumia's merchants.

166
0:08:29.085,000 --> 0:08:3,000
His name is Jomo.

167
0:08:30.498,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He was fired from his job in 2014,

168
0:08:33.95,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and at that time, he decided he wanted to become his own boss.

169
0:08:37.49,000 --> 0:08:38,000
He wanted to be independent.

170
0:08:39.228,000 --> 0:08:41,000
He also wanted to never be fired again.

171
0:08:43.362,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So at that time,

172
0:08:44.706,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Jomo had no clue what a business is.

173
0:08:47.172,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So he needed to go through a series of trainings

174
0:08:49.656,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to learn how to select products, how to price them

175
0:08:52.621,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and how to promote them online.

176
0:08:55.522,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Today, Jomo has a 10-employee online business.

177
0:08:59.807,000 --> 0:09:,000
And as of a few months ago,

178
0:09:01.807,000 --> 0:09:04,000
he just opened his very first brick-and-mortar shop

179
0:09:04.95,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in the suburbs of Nairobi.

180
0:09:07.252,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Now, through its university,

181
0:09:08.8,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Jumia has the potential of helping a huge number of Jomos.

182
0:09:13.373,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And we have estimated that together with other online marketplaces

183
0:09:16.728,000 --> 0:09:17,000
on the continent,

184
0:09:17.91,000 --> 0:09:21,000
they can generate three million additional jobs by 2025.

185
0:09:24.388,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And they would do that either directly,

186
0:09:26.499,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or through their impact on the wider community.

187
0:09:28.809,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And sometimes,

188
0:09:29.999,000 --> 0:09:31,000
taking that wider impact into consideration

189
0:09:32.78,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or forgetting about it

190
0:09:34.276,000 --> 0:09:35,000
can make or break a platform.

191
0:09:36.911,000 --> 0:09:39,000
To illustrate that, let's go back to Singapore.

192
0:09:39.943,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So, when we decided with my wife to leave the country last year,

193
0:09:44.665,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Uber decided to do the same.

194
0:09:47.117,000 --> 0:09:48,000
At the same time,

195
0:09:48.562,000 --> 0:09:52,000
again, we started to see that pattern,

196
0:09:53.135,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but maybe it's a coincidence.

197
0:09:56.053,000 --> 0:10:,000
In reality, Uber lost the ride-hailing battle

198
0:10:00.703,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to a Malaysian-born start-up called Grab.

199
0:10:04.616,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now, interestingly,

200
0:10:06.402,000 --> 0:10:09,000
my wife didn't have the same level of concerns with Grab,

201
0:10:09.955,000 --> 0:10:11,000
because when Grab started, it had a different name.

202
0:10:12.622,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It was called MyTeksi,

203
0:10:15.098,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and as the name suggests, it started as a platform for taxis.

204
0:10:21.521,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So when Grab started expanding the driver pool beyond taxis,

205
0:10:25.967,000 --> 0:10:27,000
it was seen as gradual and reasonable.

206
0:10:28.815,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They were also very careful while doing so.

207
0:10:32.188,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They thought of what kind of social safety net

208
0:10:35.003,000 --> 0:10:37,000
they should bring to all drivers.

209
0:10:37.149,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So they put in place special insurance packages

210
0:10:40.212,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and even financial education programs.

211
0:10:43.295,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, compare that with what happened in London,

212
0:10:48.08,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in New York, in Paris,

213
0:10:50.049,000 --> 0:10:53,000
where taxi drivers didn't feel that the platforms understood

214
0:10:53.97,000 --> 0:10:56,000
they had to pay 200,000 euros for their license --

215
0:10:57.331,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and mostly in loans.

216
0:10:59.482,000 --> 0:11:02,000
When you don't take that kind of social environmental information

217
0:11:03.473,000 --> 0:11:04,000
into account,

218
0:11:04.664,000 --> 0:11:05,000
you get strong reactions.

219
0:11:09.14,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I'm not trying to argue that the trade-offs

220
0:11:12.602,000 --> 0:11:15,000
by either Grab or Jumia or Gojek are risk-free.

221
0:11:16.903,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Did they slow down growth at some point, temporarily?

222
0:11:20.06,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Maybe.

223
0:11:21.243,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But look at them today.

224
0:11:22.53,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Gojek is worth 10 billion dollars.

225
0:11:26.569,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Jumia is one of only three unicorns in the whole of Africa.

226
0:11:31.752,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And Grab, well, they pushed out Uber

227
0:11:34.977,000 --> 0:11:36,000
out of the whole region of Southeast Asia.

228
0:11:38.712,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I also think these trade-offs have nothing specific to emerging markets.

229
0:11:43.65,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Amazon or Uber or others can learn from them

230
0:11:46.87,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and adapt them to their own realities.

231
0:11:50.443,000 --> 0:11:51,000
In the long run,

232
0:11:51.618,000 --> 0:11:53,000
this doesn't need to be a zero-sum game.

233
0:11:54.639,000 --> 0:11:55,000
In the long run --

234
0:11:55.814,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and this is maybe the Asian side of me speaking --

235
0:11:58.87,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it pays to be patient.

236
0:12:00.941,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It pays to reconsider your goal and your priorities

237
0:12:04.546,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in the light of a much bigger equation

238
0:12:06.942,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that includes you and your users, of course,

239
0:12:10.331,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but also it includes regulators,

240
0:12:13.335,000 --> 0:12:15,000
policymakers, your communities.

241
0:12:15.597,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And I would argue, above all,

242
0:12:17.93,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it includes the very businesses you are meant to disrupt.

243
0:12:21.684,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Thank you.

244
0:12:22.858,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

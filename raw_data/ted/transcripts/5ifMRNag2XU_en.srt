1
0:00:12.99,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi, kids.

2
0:00:14.539,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:16.099,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm 71.

4
0:00:18.683,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Applause)

5
0:00:20.778,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My husband is 76.

6
0:00:23.58,000 --> 0:00:26,000
My parents are in their late 90s,

7
0:00:27.04,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and Olivia, the dog, is 16.

8
0:00:29.74,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So let's talk about aging.

9
0:00:32.13,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Let me tell you how I feel

10
0:00:33.548,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when I see my wrinkles in the mirror

11
0:00:35.875,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I realize that some parts of me have dropped

12
0:00:39.2,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I can't find them down there.

13
0:00:41.832,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:42.97,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Mary Oliver says in one of her poems,

15
0:00:46.169,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Tell me, what is it that you plan to do

16
0:00:49.848,000 --> 0:00:52,000
with your one wild and precious life?"

17
0:00:53.531,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Me, I intend to live passionately.

18
0:00:57.834,000 --> 0:00:59,000
When do we start aging?

19
0:00:59.846,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Society decides when we are old,

20
0:01:02.233,000 --> 0:01:06,000
usually around 65, when we get Medicare,

21
0:01:06.464,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but we really start aging at birth.

22
0:01:09.23,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We are aging right now,

23
0:01:11.19,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and we all experience it differently.

24
0:01:14.383,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We all feel younger than our real age,

25
0:01:17.825,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because the spirit never ages.

26
0:01:19.996,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I am still 17.

27
0:01:23.291,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Sophia Loren. Look at her.

28
0:01:26.82,000 --> 0:01:28,000
She says that everything you see

29
0:01:29.693,000 --> 0:01:31,000
she owes to spaghetti.

30
0:01:31.976,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I tried it and gained 10 pounds

31
0:01:34.464,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in the wrong places.

32
0:01:36.566,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But attitude, aging is also attitude and health.

33
0:01:41.718,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But my real mentor in this journey of aging

34
0:01:45.418,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is Olga Murray.

35
0:01:46.959,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This California girl at 60

36
0:01:49.749,000 --> 0:01:52,000
started working in Nepal to save young girls

37
0:01:53.45,000 --> 0:01:55,000
from domestic bondage.

38
0:01:55.509,000 --> 0:01:59,000
At 88, she has saved 12,000 girls,

39
0:01:59.9,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and she has changed the culture in the country.

40
0:02:02.393,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Applause)

41
0:02:03.383,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Now it is illegal for fathers

42
0:02:06.83,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to sell their daughters into servitude.

43
0:02:09.986,000 --> 0:02:11,000
She has also founded orphanages

44
0:02:12.513,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and nutritional clinics.

45
0:02:14.543,000 --> 0:02:15,000
She is always happy

46
0:02:16.196,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and eternally young.

47
0:02:19.697,000 --> 0:02:23,000
What have I lost in the last decades?

48
0:02:23.725,000 --> 0:02:25,000
People, of course,

49
0:02:25.896,000 --> 0:02:28,000
places, and the boundless energy of my youth,

50
0:02:29.743,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and I'm beginning to lose independence,

51
0:02:31.588,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and that scares me.

52
0:02:33.973,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Ram Dass says that dependency hurts,

53
0:02:38.146,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but if you accept it, there is less suffering.

54
0:02:41.039,000 --> 0:02:43,000
After a very bad stroke,

55
0:02:43.175,000 --> 0:02:46,000
his ageless soul watches the changes

56
0:02:46.527,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in the body with tenderness,

57
0:02:48.788,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and he is grateful to the people who help him.

58
0:02:53.3,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What have I gained?

59
0:02:56.37,000 --> 0:03:,000
Freedom: I don't have to prove anything anymore.

60
0:03:00.431,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was,

61
0:03:02.996,000 --> 0:03:03,000
who I want to be,

62
0:03:04.126,000 --> 0:03:07,000
or what other people expect me to be.

63
0:03:07.99,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I don't have to please men anymore,

64
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
only animals.

65
0:03:14.888,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I keep telling my superego to back off

66
0:03:18.43,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and let me enjoy what I still have.

67
0:03:20.612,000 --> 0:03:22,000
My body may be falling apart,

68
0:03:22.671,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but my brain is not, yet.

69
0:03:26.125,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I love my brain.

70
0:03:28.172,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I feel lighter.

71
0:03:31.13,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I don't carry grudges, ambition, vanity,

72
0:03:36.407,000 --> 0:03:37,000
none of the deadly sins that are not even

73
0:03:38.262,000 --> 0:03:4,000
worth the trouble.

74
0:03:40.456,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's great to let go.

75
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I should have started sooner.

76
0:03:44.29,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I also feel softer

77
0:03:47.036,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because I'm not scared of being vulnerable.

78
0:03:51.06,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I don't see it as weakness anymore.

79
0:03:54.75,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I've gained spirituality.

80
0:03:57.274,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I'm aware that before,

81
0:03:59.197,000 --> 0:04:01,000
death was in the neighborhood.

82
0:04:01.493,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, it's next door, or in my house.

83
0:04:06.794,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I try to live mindfully

84
0:04:09.263,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and be present in the moment.

85
0:04:11.389,000 --> 0:04:12,000
By the way, the Dalai Lama

86
0:04:13.15,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is someone who has aged beautifully,

87
0:04:15.27,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate?

88
0:04:17.677,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:24.676,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Meditation helps.

90
0:04:27.206,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Video) Child: Ommm. Ommm. Ommm.

91
0:04:31.173,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Isabel Allende: Ommm. Ommm. There it is.

92
0:04:33.11,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And it's good to start early.

93
0:04:35.165,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You know, for a vain female like myself,

94
0:04:38.836,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it's very hard to age in this culture.

95
0:04:42.233,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Inside, I feel good, I feel charming, seductive, sexy.

96
0:04:46.958,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Nobody else sees that. (Laughter)

97
0:04:49.89,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'm invisible.

98
0:04:52.11,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I want to be the center of attention.

99
0:04:53.754,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I hate to be invisible.

100
0:04:56.812,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

101
0:04:58.893,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is Grace Dammann.

102
0:05:00.992,000 --> 0:05:02,000
She has been in a wheelchair for six years

103
0:05:03.415,000 --> 0:05:05,000
after a terrible car accident.

104
0:05:05.78,000 --> 0:05:08,000
She says that there is nothing more sensual

105
0:05:09.637,000 --> 0:05:1,000
than a hot shower,

106
0:05:11.137,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that every drop of water

107
0:05:12.934,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is a blessing to the senses.

108
0:05:16.144,000 --> 0:05:18,000
She doesn't see herself as disabled.

109
0:05:18.512,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In her mind, she's still surfing in the ocean.

110
0:05:22.518,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Ethel Seiderman, a feisty, beloved activist

111
0:05:27.152,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in the place where I live in California.

112
0:05:29.886,000 --> 0:05:32,000
She wears red patent shoes,

113
0:05:33.778,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and her mantra is that one scarf is nice

114
0:05:36.03,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but two is better.

115
0:05:37.815,000 --> 0:05:39,000
She has been a widow for nine years,

116
0:05:40.618,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but she's not looking for another mate.

117
0:05:42.65,000 --> 0:05:45,000
She says that there is only a limited number

118
0:05:45.735,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of ways you can screw —

119
0:05:47.985,000 --> 0:05:49,000
well, she says it in another way —

120
0:05:49.999,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and she has tried them all.

121
0:05:51.967,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:55.006,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I, on the other hand,

123
0:05:56.291,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas —

124
0:05:59.909,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter) —

125
0:06:01.187,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and my poor husband has to put up with it.

126
0:06:05.537,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So how can I stay passionate?

127
0:06:07.795,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I cannot will myself to be passionate at 71.

128
0:06:11.747,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I have been training for some time,

129
0:06:13.986,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and when I feel flat and bored, I fake it.

130
0:06:17.743,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Attitude, attitude.

131
0:06:20.409,000 --> 0:06:22,000
How do I train? I train by saying yes

132
0:06:23.143,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to whatever comes my way:

133
0:06:24.954,000 --> 0:06:26,000
drama, comedy, tragedy,

134
0:06:27.732,000 --> 0:06:29,000
love, death, losses.

135
0:06:30.724,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Yes to life.

136
0:06:32.806,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I train by trying to stay in love.

137
0:06:36.237,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It doesn't always work,

138
0:06:37.69,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but you cannot blame me for trying.

139
0:06:40.544,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And, on a final note,

140
0:06:43.043,000 --> 0:06:46,000
retirement in Spanish is jubilación.

141
0:06:47.03,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Jubilation. Celebration.

142
0:06:49.777,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We have paid our dues.

143
0:06:51.263,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We have contributed to society.

144
0:06:53.34,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now it's our time, and it's a great time.

145
0:06:56.673,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Unless you are ill or very poor,

146
0:06:59.71,000 --> 0:07:,000
you have choices.

147
0:07:01.231,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I have chosen to stay passionate,

148
0:07:03.884,000 --> 0:07:05,000
engaged with an open heart.

149
0:07:06.483,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I am working on it every day.

150
0:07:09.25,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Want to join me?

151
0:07:12.682,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Thank you.

152
0:07:14.345,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Applause)

153
0:07:19.644,000 --> 0:07:22,000
June Cohen: So Isabel — IA: Thank you.

154
0:07:23.1,000 --> 0:07:26,000
JC: First of all,

155
0:07:26.461,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I never like to presume to speak for the TED community,

156
0:07:29.21,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling

157
0:07:31.388,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we can all agree that you are still charming,

158
0:07:33.222,000 --> 0:07:34,000
seductive and sexy. Yes?

159
0:07:35.191,000 --> 0:07:37,000
IA: Aww, thank you. (Applause)

160
0:07:37.686,000 --> 0:07:39,000
JC: Hands down. IA: No, it's makeup.

161
0:07:40.172,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Moderator: Now, would it be awkward

162
0:07:41.612,000 --> 0:07:43,000
if I asked you a follow-up question about your erotic fantasies?

163
0:07:44.132,000 --> 0:07:45,000
IA: Oh, of course. About what?

164
0:07:45.81,000 --> 0:07:46,000

Moderator: About your erotic fantasies. IA: With Antonio Banderas.

166
0:07:49.847,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Moderator: I was just wondering if you have anything more to share.

IA: Well, one of them is that — (Laughter)

168
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:07:59,000
One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas

169
0:07:59.929,000 --> 0:08:01,000
on a Mexican tortilla,

170
0:08:02.862,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I slather him with guacamole and salsa,

171
0:08:06.552,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I roll him up, and I eat him. (Laughter)

172
0:08:10.051,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Thank you.

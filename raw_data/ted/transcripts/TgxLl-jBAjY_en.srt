1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Sixty-five million years ago, a very important

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and catastrophic event

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
changed the course of life on land.

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
are just the scum of the Earth on the land --

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the little bits of land floating around -- but they are important to us

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters.

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And these animals disappeared,

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and a separate life, mammals,

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
radiated out to take their place. And so, we know this

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in extraordinary detail. And so this is a core

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
from near Bermuda. We know that the tsunamis, the earthquakes,

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the things that we've experienced

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in the entire record of humankind history

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
can't really quite get around the kind of disaster

16
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that this represented for the Earth.

17
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So even before that impact was known,

18
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
even before scientists in general came to an agreement

19
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
over the theory of evolution,

20
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes

21
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
actually had divided Earth's life's history

22
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
into these two episodes:

23
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Mesozoic, the middle life, and the Cenozoic, the recent life.

24
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And as it turns out, it actually corresponds really nicely

25
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with geologic history.

26
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So we have a Mesozoic period,

27
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
an age of fragmentation,

28
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and a Cenozoic period, an age of reconnection --

29
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
South America to North America, India to Asia.

30
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And so my work, really, is trying to understand

31
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the character of that Mesozoic radiation

32
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
compared to the Cenozoic radiation

33
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals

34
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
about what life on drifting continents

35
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
really can tell us about evolution.

36
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The work immediately begs the question,

37
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Why didn't they go into the waters?"

38
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I mean, certainly mammals did. This is one example.

39
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
You can go outside -- see many other examples.

40
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Within five, 10 million years of the bolide impact

41
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we had a whole variety of animals going into the water. Why didn't they do that?

42
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size,

43
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and why didn't they burrow?

44
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Why didn't they do all these things, and if they didn't do all these things,

45
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
what kinds of animals were in those spaces?

46
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And if there were no animals in those spaces, what does that tell us

47
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about, you know, how evolution works on land?

48
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.

49
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size --

50
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the size you are when you inherit

51
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
a vacant ecospace

52
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
from whatever natural disaster.

53
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Looking at dinosaur evolution

54
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and studying it, digging it up for many years,

55
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I end up looking at the mammal radiation,

56
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology,

57
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
advancing by an order of magnitude.

58
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace,

59
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.

60
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You want to measure it by diversity?

61
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
You want to measure it by

62
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the time it took to reach maximum body size?

63
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Yes, they do have larger body size,

64
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but many of them are smaller,

65
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that.

66
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size.

67
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals

68
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to achieve maximum body size

69
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and invade all those habitats.

70
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So there's lessons to learn,

71
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and there's lessons to learn from the exception,

72
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made,

73
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and many other scholars have made around the world.

74
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This slide was shown before. This is the famous Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx.

75
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We now know this transition is the one time

76
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that dinosaurs actually went below

77
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that body size --

78
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we're going to see where they began in a minute --

79
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and it is the one time that they rapidly

80
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
invaded all the habitats

81
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in.

82
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They became marine. We now know them today

83
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
from the ice caps.

84
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
There's burrowing birds.

85
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They inhabit the trees at all body sizes,

86
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and, of course, they inhabit the land.

87
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series

88
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.

89
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx,

90
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and if you go to different layers, you find things

91
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between,

92
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs --

93
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or, more appropriately, feathers -- as to decide whether it's actually

94
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
a non-avian or an avian.

95
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It is the greatest transition that we have, actually,

96
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
on land from one habitat to another,

97
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
bar none,

98
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to understand how a bony,

99
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
fairly heavy, kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal

100
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
could make such a transition.

101
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It is really our greatest -- one of our greatest -- evolutionary sequences.

102
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, my work began at the beginning.

103
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution,

104
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I'd have to go back to those beds

105
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
where they had picked up fragments, go back to a time and a place

106
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
where the earliest dinosaurs existed.

107
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'd like to call for this little video clip

108
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to give you some idea of, sort of, what we face. Normally, we get asked a lot of questions:

109
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"Well, how do you find fossils in areas that look like this?"

110
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
If we could roll that first video clip.

111
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is sort of a nice helicopter ride

112
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
through those early beds,

113
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and they're located in Northeastern Argentina.

114
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And we're coming over a cliff, and at the top of that cliff,

115
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
dinosaurs had basically taken over.

116
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
At the bottom of the cliff, we find that they're rare as hens' teeth.

117
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That's where dinosaur origins is to be found: at the bottom of the cliff.

118
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You go into an area like this, you get a geologic map,

119
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
you get a topographic map,

120
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the best, most-inspired team you can bring to the area.

121
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And the rest is up to you. You've got to find fossils.

122
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that

123
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to get it out; you've got to climb those cliffs

124
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and find, really, everything that existed --

125
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
not just the dinosaurs, but the entire story. If you're lucky,

126
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and you dig a place like that,

127
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you actually find the ash bed to dig it, and we did.

128
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
228 million years old, we found

129
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
what really is the most primitive dinosaur:

130
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that's the Ur-dinosaur.

131
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
A three-and-a-half foot thing,

132
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
beautiful skull, predator,

133
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
meat-eater, a two-legged animal.

134
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know,

135
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or your kids know, at least, on four legs.

136
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is sort of a look at the skull,

137
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.

138
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It looks rather bird-like because it is.

139
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's bird-like and hollow.

140
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
A predator. Maybe 25 pounds,

141
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
or 10 kilograms.

142
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's where dinosaurs began. That's where the radiation began.

143
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That is 10 times larger

144
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
than the mammal radiation, which was a four-legged radiation.

145
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We are extremely dinosaur-like,

146
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and unusual in our two-legged approach to life.

147
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, if you want to understand what happened

148
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
then when the continents broke apart,

149
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers, as they are --

150
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
found themselves adrift. There's some missing puzzle pieces.

151
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents,

152
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because it was those continents that are least explored.

153
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally,

154
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you really have to force yourself to go down

155
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to the four corners of the Earth --

156
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Africa, India, Antarctica, Australia --

157
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and start putting together some of these pieces.

158
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I've been to some of those continents, but Africa was,

159
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in the words of Steven Pinker, was a blank slate, largely.

160
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle,

161
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock

162
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
if you could survive an expedition.

163
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
There's no roads into the Sahara. It's an enormous place.

164
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
To be able to excavate

165
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the 80 tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara

166
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and take them out, you really have to put together

167
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
an expedition team that can handle the conditions.

168
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Some of them are political. Many of them are physical.

169
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Some of them -- the most important -- are mental.

170
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions --

171
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
you have to drive into the desert,

172
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you will see landscapes in many cases --

173
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
you can see from what we've discovered --

174
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that nobody else has ever seen.

175
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And the kinds of teams they bring in?

176
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Well, they're

177
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
composed of

178
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
people who understand science as adventure with a purpose.

179
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They're usually students who've never seen a desert.

180
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Some of them are more experienced.

181
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport --

182
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
your job as a leader is to try to inspire them

183
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to do more work than they've ever done in their life

184
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
under conditions that they can't imagine.

185
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So, 125 degrees is normal.

186
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The ground surface at 150 -- typical.

187
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So, you can't leave your normal metal tools out

188
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes.

189
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu.

190
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You're really rubbing shoulders

191
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
with the world's last great nomadic people.

192
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
These are the Tuareg nomads, and they're living their lives

193
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
much as they have for centuries.

194
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground,

195
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and make them enter the pages of history.

196
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
To do that, you've got to actually transport them

197
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
thousands of miles out of the desert.

198
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We're talking about Ethiopia, but let's talk about Niger --

199
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or Niger, in our English language -- north of Nigeria --

200
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that's where this photograph was taken.

201
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Basically you're talking about a country that,

202
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
when we started working there, did not have container traffic.

203
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
You transported the bones out yourself

204
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
to the coast of Africa,

205
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
onto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara.

206
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
That's a 2,000 mile journey.

207
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So enormous excavations and a lot of work,

208
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs

209
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that you saw buried there -- 20 tons of material --

210
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we erect Jobaria,

211
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents.

212
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It really is a little bit out of place temporally.

213
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It looks nothing like what we would find

214
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
if we dug in contemporary beds in North America.

215
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble.

216
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And, you know, on and on --

217
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
a whole menagerie. When you pick up something like this --

218
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and some of you have had the chance to touch it --

219
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
this is a piece of history. You're touching something that's 110 million years old.

220
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This is a thumb claw. There it was, moments after it was discovered.

221
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It is an incredible view of life,

222
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and it really began when we began to understand

223
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
the depth of time.

224
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's only been with us for less than a century,

225
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and in that time, that fourth dimension,

226
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when radioactive dating came about, less than a century ago,

227
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and we could actually tell how old some of these things were,

228
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is probably the most profound transformation,

229
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because it changes the way we look at ourselves

230
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and the world dramatically.

231
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
When you pick up a piece of history like that,

232
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I think it can transform

233
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
kids that are possibly interested in science.

234
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That's the animal that thumb claw came from: Suchomimus.

235
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Here's some others.

236
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal.

237
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.

238
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It turns out to have a forebrain

239
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
one-fifteenth the size of a human.

240
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This was the cover of Science, because they thought

241
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that humans were more intelligent than these animals,

242
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but we can see by some in our administration

243
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that despite

244
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the enormous advantage in brain volume

245
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway,

246
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
smaller raptors.

247
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of --

248
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
all those small animals --

249
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
they all come from northern continents.

250
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent,

251
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and guess what? You start preparing it.

252
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It has no big claw on its hind foot. It doesn't look like a Velociraptor.

253
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's really a wholly separate radiation.

254
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So what we're trying to piece together here is a story.

255
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur

256
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that we reconstructed from Africa.

257
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Crocodiles, of course,

258
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet.

259
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And huge things -- I mean, this is a

260
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
lower jaw just laying there in the desert

261
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
of this enormous crocodile.

262
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus.

263
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws.

264
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We had to try and reconstruct this.

265
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles

266
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to understand how crocodiles scale.

267
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Could I have the second little video clip?

268
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Now, this field is just -- and, of course, science in general -- is just -- adventure.

269
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We had to find and measure

270
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the largest crocodiles living today.

271
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Narrator: ... as long as their boat.

272
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Man: Look at that set of choppers! Yeah, he's a big one.

273
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Narrator: If they can just land it,

274
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
this croc will provide useful data,

275
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
helping Paul in his quest to understand Sarcosuchus.

276
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Man: OK, hand me some more here. Man 2: OK.

277
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Narrator: It falls to Paul to cover its eyes.

278
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Man: Watch out! Watch out! No, no, no, no. You're going to have to get on the back legs.

279
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Man: I got the back legs.

280
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Man 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend.

281
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I've got it. I've got the back legs.

282
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Somebody get the front legs.

283
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Paul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there.

284
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Wow.

285
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Sixty-five. Wow.

286
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
That's a big skull.

287
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Narrator: Big, but less than half the size

288
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
of supercroc's skull.

289
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Man: Enormous. PS: You've got a ... 14-foot croc.

290
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Man: I knew it was big.

291
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
PS: Don't get off. You don't get off, but don't worry about me.

292
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Narrator: Paul has his data, so they decide

293
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to release the animal back into the river.

294
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
PS: Don't get off! Don't get off! Don't get off!

295
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Narrator: Paul has never seen a fossil do that.

296
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
PS: Okay, when I say three, we move.

297
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
One, two, three!

298
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Whoa!

299
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So -- there were --

300
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Applause)

301
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Well, you know, the -- the fossil record is truly amazing

302
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way.

303
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We proved with those measurements

304
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that crocodiles scaled isometrically.

305
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It depended on the shape of their skull, though,

306
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
so we had to actually get those measurements

307
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world

308
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile, probably a male.

309
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Anyway, you find other things, too.

310
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara

311
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site.

312
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We found this last year.

313
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Two hundred skeletons, tools, jewelry.

314
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
This is a ceremonial disk.

315
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara

316
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
5,000 years ago is been sitting out there

317
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
waiting for us to go back. So, really exciting.

318
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet.

319
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now, we normally think of Tibet as a highland.

320
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It's really an island continent.

321
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It was a precursor to India,

322
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
a messenger from Gondwana --

323
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
a lost paradise of dinosaurs

324
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
isolated for millions of years.

325
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
No one's found them. We know where they are,

326
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and we're going to go and get them next year.

327
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
They're only between 13 and 14,000 feet,

328
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
but if you go in the warm part of the year, it's O.K.

329
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Now, I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history

330
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
so that we can try to understand

331
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
some basic patterns of evolution.

332
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I've talked about a few of them. We really need to take that further.

333
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy

334
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that we've been compiling

335
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means.

336
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We can't predict, necessarily, what will happen in evolution,

337
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
but we can learn some of the rules of the game,

338
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and that's really what we're trying to do.

339
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
With regard to the biogeographic question,

340
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the Earth is dividing.

341
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
These are all landlubbing animals. There's a couple of choices.

342
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
You get divided, and a continent's division

343
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree,

344
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
or you're crafty, and you manage to escape

345
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
from one to the other and erase that division,

346
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
or you're living peacefully on each side,

347
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and on one side you just go extinct,

348
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and you survive on the other side and create a difference.

349
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other

350
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.

351
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And you take those four instances

352
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and you realize you have a complex problem.

353
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And so, in addition to digging, I think we have some answers

354
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
from the dinosaur record. I think these dinosaurs migrated --

355
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we call it dispersal -- around the globe, with the slightest land bridge.

356
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole,

357
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
to maintain similarity between continents.

358
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
But when they were divided, indeed they were divided,

359
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and we do see the continents

360
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
carving differences among dinosaurs.

361
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
But there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction.

362
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
We have downgraded this factor.

363
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It carves up the history of life,

364
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and gives us the differences that we see

365
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
in the dinosaur world towards the end,

366
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
right before the bolide impact.

367
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
The best way to test this is to actually create a model.

368
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
So if we move back, this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life.

369
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
I want to give you three dimensions.

370
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So you see the tree of life,

371
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but now I've added the dimension of area.

372
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time.

373
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Now we have divergence over time, but we've created the third dimension of area.

374
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
This is a computer program

375
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
which has three knobs.

376
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
We can control those things that we're worried about:

377
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
extinction, sampling, dispersal --

378
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
going from one area to another.

379
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And ultimately we can control the branching

380
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
to mimic what we think the continents were like,

381
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and run it a thousand times, so we can estimate the parameters,

382
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not,

383
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
at least to know the barriers of the problems. So that's a little bit about the science.

384
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here

385
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago,

386
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
which is related to the fact that I never --

387
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and actually, in talking to a lot of TEDsters,

388
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
there's a number of you out there -- I don't know that I'd get an answer

389
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
honestly, if I asked you to raise your hand,

390
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
but there are a number of you out there that started your

391
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
scientific, technical, entertainment career

392
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
as failures, by society's standards, as failures by schools.

393
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I was one of those. I was failed by my school -- my school failed me.

394
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Who's pointing fingers?

395
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Several teachers nearly killed me.

396
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I found myself in art.

397
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I was a total failure in school, not really headed to graduate high school.

398
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And I went on -- that's my first painting on canvas.

399
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I read a dictionary. I got into college.

400
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I became an artist. O.K., and started drawing.

401
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
It became abstract.

402
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I worked up a portfolio, and I was headed to New York.

403
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there.

404
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Something was going on in the background. I headed to New York to a studio.

405
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I took a side trip to the American Museum, and I never recovered.

406
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
But really it's the same discipline -- they're kindred disciplines.

407
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I mean, is there anything

408
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
that is not visualizing what can't be seen,

409
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it

410
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
that's out there, or seeing the distortion

411
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
that we try to see

412
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another?

413
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
This is a very extraordinarily visual.

414
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
I give you a human face because you're experts at that.

415
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs.

416
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
They're really kindred disciplines.

417
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
But what we're trying to create in Chicago

418
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
is a way to get,

419
0:18:29.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
collect together, those students

420
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
who are least represented in our science and technology spheres.

421
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
We all know, and there's been several allusions to it,

422
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
that we are failing in our ability to produce

423
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
enough scientists, engineers and technicians.

424
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
We've known that for a long time. We've gone through the Sputnik phase,

425
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and now, as you see the increase

426
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:5,000
in the pace of what we're doing,

427
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
it becomes even more prominent. Where are all these people going to come from?

428
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And a more general question for our society is,

429
0:18:55.33,000 --> 0:18:58,000
what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind?

430
0:18:58.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
What about all the kids like me that were in school --

431
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
kids like some of you out there --

432
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance

433
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:07,000
to participate in science and technology?

434
0:19:07.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Those are the questions I ask. And we talk about Ethiopia, and it's very important.

435
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
Niger is equally important, and I'm trying desperately

436
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
to do something in Niger.

437
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
They have an AIDS problem. I asked --

438
0:19:16.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
the U.S. State Department asked the government recently,

439
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:21,000
What do you want to do? And they gave them two problems.

440
0:19:21.33,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Dinosaurs was one of them.

441
0:19:23.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
Give us a museum of dinosaurs,

442
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and we will attract tourists, which is our number two industry.

443
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
And I hope to God the United States government, me, or TED,

444
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
or somebody helps us do that, because that would be an incredible thing for their country.

445
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
But when we look back at our own country, we're looking back at our cities,

446
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:4,000
the cities where most of you come from -- certainly the city I come from --

447
0:19:40.33,000 --> 0:19:42,000
there's legions of kids out there

448
0:19:42.33,000 --> 0:19:44,000
like these.

449
0:19:44.33,000 --> 0:19:47,000
And the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries --

450
0:19:47.33,000 --> 0:19:5,000
as to how we get these kids involved in science.

451
0:19:50.33,000 --> 0:19:52,000
We've started in Chicago

452
0:19:52.33,000 --> 0:19:54,000
an organization -- a non-profit organization --

453
0:19:54.33,000 --> 0:19:56,000
called Project Exploration.

454
0:19:56.33,000 --> 0:19:58,000
These are two kids from Project Exploration.

455
0:19:58.33,000 --> 0:20:,000
We met them in their early stages in high school. They were --

456
0:20:00.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
failing to poor students,

457
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and they are now -- one at the University of Chicago, another in Illinois.

458
0:20:06.33,000 --> 0:20:08,000
We've got students at Harvard. We're six years old.

459
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And we created a track record.

460
0:20:10.33,000 --> 0:20:13,000
Because when you go out there as a scholar, and you try to find out longitudinal studies,

461
0:20:13.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
track records like that, there essentially are very few, if none.

462
0:20:17.33,000 --> 0:20:21,000
So, we've created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation,

463
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
90 percent going to college, many first-generation,

464
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
90 percent of those choosing science as a career.

465
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:3,000
It's an impressive track record, and so we look back and we say,

466
0:20:30.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
well, we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start,

467
0:20:33.33,000 --> 0:20:36,000
but when we look back, there are theoretical movements in science education.

468
0:20:36.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
It's gone through science as an inquiry,

469
0:20:38.33,000 --> 0:20:4,000
which was a big advance,

470
0:20:41.33,000 --> 0:20:43,000
and Dewey back at Chicago --

471
0:20:43.33,000 --> 0:20:45,000
you learn by doing.

472
0:20:45.33,000 --> 0:20:5,000
To -- you learn by envisioning yourself

473
0:20:50.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
as a scientist,

474
0:20:52.33,000 --> 0:20:55,000
and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist.

475
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:20:57,000
The next step is to learn the capability

476
0:20:57.33,000 --> 0:21:,000
to make yourself a scientist.

477
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:02,000
You have to have those steps. If you have --

478
0:21:02.33,000 --> 0:21:04,000
It's easy to get kids interested in science.

479
0:21:04.33,000 --> 0:21:07,000
It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist,

480
0:21:07.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium

481
0:21:11.33,000 --> 0:21:13,000
and presenting something as a knowledgeable person,

482
0:21:13.33,000 --> 0:21:16,000
and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist

483
0:21:16.33,000 --> 0:21:19,000
and giving yourself the tools to pursue that.

484
0:21:19.33,000 --> 0:21:22,000
And so, that's what we're going to do. We're planning a permanent home in Chicago.

485
0:21:22.33,000 --> 0:21:24,000
We have lots of ideas, but I guarantee you this one thing --

486
0:21:24.33,000 --> 0:21:26,000
and I've talked to some people here at TED --

487
0:21:26.33,000 --> 0:21:28,000
it's not going to look like anything you've seen before.

488
0:21:28.33,000 --> 0:21:3,000
It's going to be part-school, part-museum hall,

489
0:21:30.33,000 --> 0:21:33,000
part-conservatory, part-zoo,

490
0:21:33.33,000 --> 0:21:36,000
and part of an answer to the problem

491
0:21:36.33,000 --> 0:21:37,000
of how you interest kids in science.

492
0:21:37.33,000 --> 0:21:4,000
Thank you very much.

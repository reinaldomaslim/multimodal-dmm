1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I feel incredibly lucky

2
0:00:15.56,000 --> 0:00:16,000
to be from a country

3
0:00:17.44,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that's generally considered to be the best place in the world

4
0:00:21.32,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to be a woman.

5
0:00:24.72,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In 1975, when I was seven years old,

6
0:00:28.48,000 --> 0:00:3,000
women in Iceland went on a strike.

7
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They did no work that day,

8
0:00:33.64,000 --> 0:00:35,000
whether they held professional jobs

9
0:00:36.44,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or had the work of the home.

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
They marched into the center of Reykjavík --

11
0:00:41.8,000 --> 0:00:43,000
90 percent of women participated --

12
0:00:44.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and peacefully and in solidarity

13
0:00:48.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
asked for equality.

14
0:00:51.72,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Nothing worked in Iceland that day,

15
0:00:54.8,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because nothing works when women are not at work.

16
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Applause)

17
0:01:05.8,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Five years later, Icelanders had the courage

18
0:01:09.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to be the first country in the world

19
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to democratically elect a woman as their president.

20
0:01:15.96,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I will never forget this day,

21
0:01:18.8,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that President Vigdís, as we know her by her first name,

22
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
stepped out on the balcony of her own home,

23
0:01:26.4,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won.

24
0:01:30.64,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Applause)

25
0:01:37.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This woman was an incredible role model

26
0:01:39.72,000 --> 0:01:43,000
for me and everyone growing up at that time,

27
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
including boys.

28
0:01:45.84,000 --> 0:01:49,000
She frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her

29
0:01:49.92,000 --> 0:01:51,000
after a couple of terms in office

30
0:01:51.96,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and asked, "Can boys really grow up to be president?"

31
0:01:55.88,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:58.04,000 --> 0:02:,000
Role models really matter,

33
0:02:00.84,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but even with such strong role models

34
0:02:03.68,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who I am so grateful for,

35
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
when I was encouraged to run for president,

36
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
my first reaction was, "Who am I to run for president?

37
0:02:14.24,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Who am I to be president?"

38
0:02:17.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It turns out that women

39
0:02:20.039,000 --> 0:02:22,000
are less likely to consider running than men.

40
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So a study done in the US in 2011

41
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:32,000
showed that 62 percent of men had considered running for office,

42
0:02:33.36,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but 45 percent of women.

43
0:02:36.12,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That's gap of 16 percentage points,

44
0:02:39.52,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and it's the same gap that existed a decade earlier.

45
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And it really is a shame,

46
0:02:46.32,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because I am so convinced that the world is in real need for women leaders

47
0:02:51.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and more principle-based leadership

48
0:02:53.44,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in general.

49
0:02:56.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So my decision to run

50
0:02:59.68,000 --> 0:03:02,000
ultimately came down to the fact

51
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that I felt

52
0:03:05.36,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that I had to do my bit,

53
0:03:09.64,000 --> 0:03:11,000
even if I had no political experience,

54
0:03:12.92,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to step up and try to be part of creating the world

55
0:03:17.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that will make sense and be sustainable

56
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for our kids,

57
0:03:21.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls

58
0:03:27.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to be all they can be.

59
0:03:31.08,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And it was the journey of my life.

60
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It was amazing.

61
0:03:39.04,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The journey started with potentially as many as 20 candidates.

62
0:03:43.6,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It boiled down to nine candidates qualifying,

63
0:03:47.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and ultimately the race came down to four of us,

64
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:52,000
three men and me.

65
0:03:53.04,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

66
0:03:59.76,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But that's not all the drama yet.

67
0:04:02.48,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You may think you have drama in the US,

68
0:04:04.76,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but I can --

69
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

70
0:04:08.28,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I can assure you we had our own drama in Iceland.

71
0:04:12.08,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So our sitting president of 20 years

72
0:04:15.04,000 --> 0:04:17,000
announced initially that he was not going to run,

73
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which is probably what gave rise

74
0:04:19.32,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to so many candidates considering running.

75
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Then later he changed his mind

76
0:04:25.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when our prime minister resigned

77
0:04:28.68,000 --> 0:04:31,000
following the infamous Panama Papers

78
0:04:31.959,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that implicated him and his family.

79
0:04:34.88,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And there was a popular protest in Iceland,

80
0:04:36.96,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader.

81
0:04:43.04,000 --> 0:04:46,000
A few days later, relations to his wife and her family's companies

82
0:04:47.04,000 --> 0:04:49,000
were also discovered in the Panama Papers,

83
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and so he withdrew from the race again.

84
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Before doing so, he said he was doing that

85
0:04:56.32,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because now there were two qualified men

86
0:05:00.28,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who he felt could fill his shoes running for office.

87
0:05:05.04,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So on May 9, 45 days before election day,

88
0:05:11.48,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it was not looking too good for me.

89
0:05:14.72,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I did not even make the graph in the newspaper.

90
0:05:18.08,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The polls had me at 1 percent,

91
0:05:21.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but that was still the highest

92
0:05:22.56,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that any woman announcing her candidacy had earned.

93
0:05:27.44,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So it would be an understatement to say that I had to work extremely hard

94
0:05:32.2,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to get my seat at the table

95
0:05:34.52,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and access to television,

96
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because the network decided that they would only include

97
0:05:40.44,000 --> 0:05:43,000
those with 2.5 percent or more in the polls

98
0:05:43.88,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in the first TV debate.

99
0:05:46.68,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I found out on the afternoon of the first TV debate

100
0:05:50.08,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that I would participate along with the three men,

101
0:05:53.84,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I found out on live TV

102
0:05:56.28,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent on the day of the first TV debate.

103
0:06:01.64,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

104
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So, challenges.

105
0:06:10.52,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The foremost challenges I had to face and overcome on this journey

106
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
had to do with media, muscle and money.

107
0:06:16.92,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Let's start with media.

108
0:06:18.76,000 --> 0:06:2,000
There are those who say gender doesn't matter

109
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
when it comes to media and politics.

110
0:06:22.92,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I can't say that I agree.

111
0:06:25.44,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media.

112
0:06:29.8,000 --> 0:06:32,000
As a matter of fact, the leading candidate appeared in broadcast media

113
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
87 times in the months leading up to the elections,

114
0:06:36.28,000 --> 0:06:38,000
whereas I appeared 31 times.

115
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And I am not saying media is doing this consciously.

116
0:06:43.88,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I think largely this has to do with unconscious bias,

117
0:06:46.8,000 --> 0:06:48,000
because in media, much like everywhere else,

118
0:06:50.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we have both conscious and unconscious bias,

119
0:06:54.12,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we need to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it.

120
0:06:58.6,000 --> 0:07:,000
When I finally got access to TV,

121
0:07:00.76,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the first question I got was, "Are you going to quit?"

122
0:07:05.72,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And that was a hard one.

123
0:07:08.36,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But of course, with 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the polls,

124
0:07:11.24,000 --> 0:07:12,000
maybe it's understandable.

125
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But media really matters, and every time I appeared on TV,

126
0:07:16.88,000 --> 0:07:19,000
we saw and experienced a rise in the polls,

127
0:07:20.12,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so I know firsthand how much this matters

128
0:07:22.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and why we have to talk about it.

129
0:07:25.08,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I was the only one out of the final four candidates

130
0:07:27.52,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that never got a front page interview.

131
0:07:29.84,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates

132
0:07:33.96,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and out of coverage about the elections.

133
0:07:36.64,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So I did face this,

134
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but I will say this to compliment the Icelandic media.

135
0:07:41.48,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit.

136
0:07:46.2,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Applause)

137
0:07:48.8,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So kudos to them.

138
0:07:51.64,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But there is another experience that's very important.

139
0:07:56.12,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I ran as an independent candidate,

140
0:07:58.4,000 --> 0:08:01,000
not with any political party or muscle behind me.

141
0:08:01.72,000 --> 0:08:03,000
That lack of experience

142
0:08:04.08,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and lack of access to resources

143
0:08:06.36,000 --> 0:08:09,000
probably came at a cost to our campaign,

144
0:08:09.4,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but it also allowed us to innovate and do politics differently.

145
0:08:14.04,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We ran a positive campaign,

146
0:08:17.88,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that.

147
0:08:23.48,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It may be the reason why I had less airtime on TV,

148
0:08:26.2,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because I wanted to show other contenders respect.

149
0:08:30.64,000 --> 0:08:32,000
When access to media proved to be so difficult,

150
0:08:33.64,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we ran our own media.

151
0:08:35.72,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I ran live Facebook sessions

152
0:08:37.6,000 --> 0:08:42,000
where I took questions from voters on anything and responded on the spot.

153
0:08:43.56,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And we put all the questions I got and all the answers on an open Facebook

154
0:08:47.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
because we thought transparency is important

155
0:08:50.96,000 --> 0:08:51,000
if you want to establish trust.

156
0:08:53.12,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And when reaching young voters proved to be challenging,

157
0:08:56.28,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I became a Snapchatter.

158
0:08:59.08,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I got young people to teach me how to do that,

159
0:09:01.56,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and I used every filter on Snapchat during the last part of the campaign.

160
0:09:06.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And I actually had to use a lot of humor and humility, as I was very bad at it.

161
0:09:12.08,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But we grew the following amongst young people by doing that.

162
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So it's possible to run a different type of campaign.

163
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But unfortunately, one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money.

164
0:09:25.6,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I am sad that it is that way, but it's true,

165
0:09:27.84,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and we had less financial resources than the other candidates.

166
0:09:32.76,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This probably was partly due to the fact

167
0:09:36.92,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that I think I had a harder time asking for financial support.

168
0:09:41.04,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And maybe I also had the ambition to do more with less.

169
0:09:46.44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Some would call that very womanly of me.

170
0:09:50.6,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But even with one third the media, one third the financial resources,

171
0:09:56.24,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and only an entrepreneurial team, but an amazing team,

172
0:09:59.8,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we managed to surprise everyone on election night,

173
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
when the first numbers came in.

174
0:10:06.68,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I surprised myself, as you may see in that photo.

175
0:10:09.32,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

176
0:10:11.6,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So the first numbers,

177
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I came in neck to neck to the leading candidate.

178
0:10:16.84,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Cheers)

179
0:10:24.52,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Well, too early, because I didn't quite pull that,

180
0:10:27.68,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but I came in second,

181
0:10:29.2,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and we went a long way from the one percent,

182
0:10:32.4,000 --> 0:10:33,000
with nearly a third of the vote,

183
0:10:34.4,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and we beat the polls by an unprecedented margin,

184
0:10:37.44,000 --> 0:10:4,000
or 10 percentage points above what the last poll came in at.

185
0:10:42.36,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Some people call me the real winner of the election because of this,

186
0:10:45.68,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and there are many people who encouraged me to run again.

187
0:10:49.52,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But what really makes me proud

188
0:10:52.12,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is to know that I earned

189
0:10:53.8,000 --> 0:10:57,000
proportionately higher percentage support from the young people,

190
0:10:58.52,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in 2040.

191
0:11:03.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

192
0:11:10.4,000 --> 0:11:11,000
She is 13,

193
0:11:12.96,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and she had never been on TV before.

194
0:11:15.4,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And on election day, I observed her on TV repeatedly,

195
0:11:19.68,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and she was smart, she was self-confident,

196
0:11:23.04,000 --> 0:11:26,000
she was sincere, and she was supportive of her mother.

197
0:11:26.44,000 --> 0:11:29,000
This was probably the highlight of my campaign.

198
0:11:29.64,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Applause)

199
0:11:36.6,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But there was another one.

200
0:11:38.44,000 --> 0:11:4,000
These are preschool girls out on a walk,

201
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and they found a poster of me on a bus stop,

202
0:11:43.2,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and they saw the need to kiss it.

203
0:11:45.44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Audience: Aw!

204
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This picture was really enough of a win for me.

205
0:11:51.28,000 --> 0:11:53,000
What we see, we can be.

206
0:11:54.48,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So screw fear and challenges.

207
0:11:57.36,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Applause)

208
0:11:59.76,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It matters that women run,

209
0:12:02.04,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and it's time for women to run for office,

210
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
be it the office of the CEO or the office of the president.

211
0:12:11.28,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I also managed to put an impression on your very own "New Yorker."

212
0:12:16.6,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I earned a new title, "A living emoji of sincerity."

213
0:12:20.72,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Cheers)

214
0:12:24.68,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It is possibly my proudest title yet,

215
0:12:29.56,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and the reason is that women too often get penalized

216
0:12:33.6,000 --> 0:12:36,000
for using what I call their emotional capital,

217
0:12:37.2,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but I know from experience that we become so good

218
0:12:41.12,000 --> 0:12:42,000
when we do just that.

219
0:12:42.84,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Applause)

220
0:12:47.72,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And we need more of that.

221
0:12:51.2,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We celebrated as if we had won on election night,

222
0:12:54.72,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because that's how we felt.

223
0:12:56.52,000 --> 0:13:,000
So you don't necessarily have to reach that office.

224
0:13:00.88,000 --> 0:13:01,000
You just have to go for it,

225
0:13:02.64,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and you, your family, your friends, everyone working with you,

226
0:13:05.72,000 --> 0:13:09,000
if you do it well, you will grow beyond anything you will experience before.

227
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So we had a good time,

228
0:13:14.44,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and I learned a lot on this journey,

229
0:13:17.12,000 --> 0:13:19,000
probably more lessons than I can share here

230
0:13:19.88,000 --> 0:13:2,000
in the time we have today.

231
0:13:21.68,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But rest assured, it was hard work.

232
0:13:25.2,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I lost a lot of sleep during those months.

233
0:13:28.8,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It took resilience and perseverance to not quit,

234
0:13:34.4,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but I learned something that I knew before on the one percent day,

235
0:13:38.68,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and that is that you can only be good

236
0:13:41.72,000 --> 0:13:44,000
when you are truly, authentically listening to your own voice

237
0:13:45.64,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and working in alignment with that.

238
0:13:49.08,000 --> 0:13:51,000
As a good sister of mine sometimes says,

239
0:13:51.72,000 --> 0:13:53,000
you may cheat on your intuition,

240
0:13:54.32,000 --> 0:13:56,000
but your intuition never cheats on you.

241
0:13:59.64,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I think it's also very important, and you all know this,

242
0:14:02.84,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that on any journey you go on,

243
0:14:04.44,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it's the team you take along.

244
0:14:06.56,000 --> 0:14:1,000
It's having people around you who share your values, your vision,

245
0:14:11.4,000 --> 0:14:13,000
but are different in every other way.

246
0:14:14.04,000 --> 0:14:16,000
That's the formula for success for me,

247
0:14:16.44,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and I am blessed with an amazing husband,

248
0:14:18.92,000 --> 0:14:19,000
here today,

249
0:14:21.08,000 --> 0:14:22,000
an incredible family --

250
0:14:22.84,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Applause)

251
0:14:24.8,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and great friends,

252
0:14:26.04,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena,

253
0:14:29.44,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible.

254
0:14:33.28,000 --> 0:14:36,000
As a matter of fact, the leading PR expert told me

255
0:14:36.48,000 --> 0:14:37,000
before I made my decision

256
0:14:38.24,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that I would do well to get seven percent.

257
0:14:41.64,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I appreciated his perspective, because he was probably right,

258
0:14:45.88,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and he was basing it on valuable experience.

259
0:14:48.08,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But on the one percent day,

260
0:14:49.44,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I decided here to show him that he was wrong.

261
0:14:54.32,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's very important to mention this, because I did lose a lot of sleep,

262
0:14:57.72,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and I worked hard, and so did the people with me.

263
0:15:00.44,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We can never go the distance if we forget to take care of ourselves.

264
0:15:04.56,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And it's two things that I think are very important in that,

265
0:15:07.44,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in surrounding yourself with people and practices that nourish you,

266
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
but it's equally important, maybe even more important,

267
0:15:13.8,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to have the courage to get rid of people and practices

268
0:15:17.56,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that take away your energy,

269
0:15:19.64,000 --> 0:15:22,000
including the wonderful bloggers and commentators.

270
0:15:24.2,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I took a lot of support from others in doing this,

271
0:15:27.2,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and I made the decision to go high when others went low,

272
0:15:31.28,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and that's partly how I kept my energy going throughout all of this.

273
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And when I lost my energy for a moment --

274
0:15:38.36,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and I did from time to time, it wasn't easy --

275
0:15:41.68,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I went back to why I decided to run,

276
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and how I had decided to run my own race.

277
0:15:49.52,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I called it a 4G campaign,

278
0:15:52.12,000 --> 0:15:54,000
the G's representing the Icelandic words.

279
0:15:54.92,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And the first one is called "Gagn."

280
0:15:57.08,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I ran to do good,

281
0:15:59.36,000 --> 0:16:,000
to be of service,

282
0:16:00.6,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and I wanted servant leadership

283
0:16:03.12,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to be at the center of how I worked and everybody else in the campaign.

284
0:16:07.52,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Second one is "Gleði," or joy.

285
0:16:10.24,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I decided to enjoy the journey.

286
0:16:12.36,000 --> 0:16:14,000
There was a lot to be taken out of the journey,

287
0:16:14.6,000 --> 0:16:16,000
no matter if the destination was reached or not.

288
0:16:17.24,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And I tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as well.

289
0:16:21.2,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Third is "Gagnsæi."

290
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I was open to any questions.

291
0:16:24.76,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I kept no secrets,

292
0:16:26.32,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and it was all open, on Facebook and websites.

293
0:16:29.44,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Because I think if you're choosing your president,

294
0:16:31.84,000 --> 0:16:33,000
you deserve answers to your questions.

295
0:16:34.84,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Last but not least,

296
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I don't need to explain that in this room,

297
0:16:39.56,000 --> 0:16:41,000
we ran on the principle of Girlpower.

298
0:16:42.48,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Cheers)

299
0:16:48.08,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I am incredibly glad

300
0:16:50.2,000 --> 0:16:52,000
that I had the courage to run,

301
0:16:52.44,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to risk failure but receive success

302
0:16:55.52,000 --> 0:16:56,000
on so many levels.

303
0:16:58.56,000 --> 0:17:01,000
I can't tell you that it was easy,

304
0:17:01.96,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but I can tell you,

305
0:17:04.08,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and I think my entire team will agree with me,

306
0:17:07.76,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that it was worth it.

307
0:17:10.6,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Thank you.

308
0:17:11.84,000 --> 0:17:12,000
(Applause)

309
0:17:13.56,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Thank you.

310
0:17:16.76,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Thank you.

311
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

312
0:17:26.92,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet.

313
0:17:29.88,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd.

314
0:17:33.839,000 --> 0:17:35,000
PM: I can't let you go without saying

315
0:17:35.96,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to Iceland

316
0:17:38.96,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and vote for you.

317
0:17:40.68,000 --> 0:17:42,000
But of course we probably can't vote there,

318
0:17:42.76,000 --> 0:17:44,000
but one thing we can get from Iceland

319
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and have always gotten is inspiration.

320
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975

321
0:17:51.2,000 --> 0:17:53,000
when all the Icelandic women walked out,

322
0:17:53.24,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and that really was a very big factor in launching the women's movement.

323
0:17:56.84,000 --> 0:17:59,000
You made a reference to it earlier. I'd love to bring the picture back up

324
0:18:00.32,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and just have us remember what it was like when a country came to a standstill.

325
0:18:04.56,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And then what you may not know

326
0:18:06.92,000 --> 0:18:1,000
because our American media did not report it,

327
0:18:10.96,000 --> 0:18:13,000
the Icelandic women walked out again on Monday. Right?

328
0:18:14.88,000 --> 0:18:16,000
HT: Yes, they did. PM: Can you tell us about that?

329
0:18:17.571,000 --> 0:18:19,000
HT: Yes, so 41 years after the original strike,

330
0:18:20.4,000 --> 0:18:23,000
we may be the best place in the world to be a woman,

331
0:18:23.68,000 --> 0:18:25,000
but our work isn't done.

332
0:18:26.04,000 --> 0:18:28,000
So at 2:38pm on Monday,

333
0:18:28.68,000 --> 0:18:29,000
women in Iceland left work,

334
0:18:30.4,000 --> 0:18:32,000
because that's when they had earned their day's salary.

335
0:18:33.32,000 --> 0:18:34,000
(Applause)

336
0:18:48.08,000 --> 0:18:5,000
What's really cool about this

337
0:18:50.48,000 --> 0:18:53,000
is that young women and men participated

338
0:18:54.2,000 --> 0:18:56,000
in greater numbers than before,

339
0:18:56.4,000 --> 0:18:59,000
because it is time that we close the pay gap.

340
0:19:02.72,000 --> 0:19:04,000
PM: So I'm not going to ask Halla to commit right now

341
0:19:05.6,000 --> 0:19:06,000
to what she's doing next,

342
0:19:06.88,000 --> 0:19:09,000
but I will say that you'd have a very large volunteer army

343
0:19:10.28,000 --> 0:19:12,000
should you decide to do that again.

344
0:19:12.72,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Thank you Halla.

345
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:15,000
HT: Thank you all.

346
0:19:15.44,000 --> 0:19:17,000
(Applause)

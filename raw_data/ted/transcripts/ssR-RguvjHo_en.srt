1
0:00:13.451,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I am an ideas activist.

2
0:00:18.075,000 --> 0:00:22,000
That means I fight for ideas I believe in

3
0:00:23.406,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to have their place in the sun,

4
0:00:25.772,000 --> 0:00:29,000
regardless of which side of the equator they were born.

5
0:00:30.946,000 --> 0:00:31,000
As well I should.

6
0:00:32.369,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I myself am from that part of the world

7
0:00:34.833,000 --> 0:00:38,000
often euphemistically referred to as either "the Global South"

8
0:00:38.905,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or "the developing world."

9
0:00:40.88,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But let's be blunt about it:

10
0:00:42.293,000 --> 0:00:45,000
when we say those words, what we really mean is the poor world --

11
0:00:46.064,000 --> 0:00:49,000
those corners of the world with ready-made containers

12
0:00:50.011,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for the hand-me-down ideas of other places and other people.

13
0:00:57.026,000 --> 0:01:,000
But I'm here to depart a little bit from the script

14
0:01:00.908,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and to try and convince you

15
0:01:03.182,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that these places are actually alive and bubbling with ideas.

16
0:01:07.401,000 --> 0:01:09,000
My real issue is: Where do I even start?

17
0:01:10.639,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So maybe Egypt, Alexandria,

18
0:01:15.147,000 --> 0:01:16,000
where we meet Rizwan.

19
0:01:17.076,000 --> 0:01:18,000
When he walks outside his souk,

20
0:01:18.831,000 --> 0:01:21,000
walks into a pharmacy for heart medicine

21
0:01:22.006,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that can prevent the blood in his arteries from clotting,

22
0:01:25.219,000 --> 0:01:26,000
he confronts the fact that,

23
0:01:28.508,000 --> 0:01:31,000
despite a growing epidemic

24
0:01:32.047,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that currently accounts for 82 percent of all deaths in Egypt,

25
0:01:37.811,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it is the medicines that can address these conditions

26
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that counterfeiters, ever the evil geniuses they are,

27
0:01:44.559,000 --> 0:01:45,000
have decided to target.

28
0:01:47.413,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Counterfeiters making knockoff medicines.

29
0:01:52.073,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Luckily for Rizwan,

30
0:01:54.158,000 --> 0:01:55,000
my team and I,

31
0:01:55.721,000 --> 0:01:59,000
working in partnership with the largest pharmaceutical company in Africa,

32
0:02:01.883,000 --> 0:02:06,000
have placed unique codes -- think of them like one-time passwords --

33
0:02:06.944,000 --> 0:02:1,000
on each pack of the best-selling heart medicine in Egypt.

34
0:02:12.421,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So when Rizwan buys heart medicine,

35
0:02:16.575,000 --> 0:02:19,000
he can key in these one-time passwords

36
0:02:19.869,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to a toll-free short code

37
0:02:21.765,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that we've set up on all the telecom companies in Egypt

38
0:02:26.744,000 --> 0:02:27,000
for free.

39
0:02:28.263,000 --> 0:02:3,000
He gets a message -- call it the message of life --

40
0:02:31.913,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which reassures him

41
0:02:34.083,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that this medicine is not one of the 12 percent of all medicines in Egypt

42
0:02:40.599,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that are counterfeits.

43
0:02:43.338,000 --> 0:02:45,000
From the gorgeous banks of the Nile,

44
0:02:45.923,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we glide into the beautiful Rift Valley of Kenya.

45
0:02:50.926,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In Narok Town, we meet Ole Lenku, salt-of-the-earth fellow.

46
0:02:54.908,000 --> 0:02:55,000
When he walks into an agrodealer's shop,

47
0:02:56.848,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all he wants is certified and proper cabbage seeds

48
0:03:00.554,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that, if he were to plant them,

49
0:03:02.267,000 --> 0:03:04,000
will yield a harvest rich enough

50
0:03:04.691,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that he can pay for the school fees of his children.

51
0:03:07.47,000 --> 0:03:08,000
That's all he wants.

52
0:03:09.25,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Unfortunately,

53
0:03:10.736,000 --> 0:03:12,000
by the reckoning of most international organizations,

54
0:03:13.659,000 --> 0:03:18,000
40 percent of all the seeds sold in Eastern and Southern Africa

55
0:03:18.701,000 --> 0:03:19,000
are of questionable quality,

56
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
sometimes outrightly fake.

57
0:03:22.836,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Luckily for Ole,

58
0:03:24.348,000 --> 0:03:27,000
once again, our team has been at work,

59
0:03:27.709,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and, working with the leading agriculture regulator in Kenya,

60
0:03:32.165,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we've digitized the entire certification process

61
0:03:35.594,000 --> 0:03:36,000
for seeds in that country,

62
0:03:37.096,000 --> 0:03:4,000
every seed -- millet, sorghum, maize --

63
0:03:41.109,000 --> 0:03:47,000
such that when Ole Lenku keys in a code on a packet of millet,

64
0:03:47.717,000 --> 0:03:51,000
he's able to retrieve a digital certificate

65
0:03:52.618,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that assures him that the seed is properly certified.

66
0:03:57.175,000 --> 0:04:,000
From Kenya, we head to Noida in India,

67
0:04:00.469,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where the irrepressible Ambika

68
0:04:02.665,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is holding on very fast to her dream of becoming an elite athlete,

69
0:04:07.752,000 --> 0:04:08,000
safe in the knowledge that

70
0:04:09.685,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because of our ingredients rating technology,

71
0:04:12.238,000 --> 0:04:14,000
she's not going to ingest something accidentally,

72
0:04:14.947,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which will mess up her doping tests

73
0:04:18.593,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and kick her out of the sports she loves.

74
0:04:23.084,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Finally, we alight in Ghana,

75
0:04:26.359,000 --> 0:04:27,000
my own home country,

76
0:04:28.146,000 --> 0:04:3,000
where another problem needs addressing --

77
0:04:30.984,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the problem of under-vaccination or poor-quality vaccination.

78
0:04:34.149,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You see, when you put some vaccines into the bloodstream of an infant,

79
0:04:39.647,000 --> 0:04:41,000
you are giving them a lifetime insurance

80
0:04:42.541,000 --> 0:04:45,000
against dangerous diseases that can cripple them or kill them.

81
0:04:46.554,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Sometimes, this is for a lifetime.

82
0:04:48.483,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The problem is that vaccines are delicate organisms really,

83
0:04:53.588,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and they need to be stored between two degrees and eight degrees.

84
0:04:57.449,000 --> 0:05:,000
And if you don't do that, they lose their potency,

85
0:05:00.601,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and they no longer confer the immunity

86
0:05:03.132,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the child deserves.

87
0:05:05.704,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Working with computer vision scientists,

88
0:05:08.465,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we've converted simple markers on the vials of vaccines

89
0:05:13.091,000 --> 0:05:15,000
into what you might regard as crude thermometers.

90
0:05:16.19,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So then, these patterns change slowly over time in response to temperature

91
0:05:19.793,000 --> 0:05:22,000
until they leave a distinct pattern on the surface of the vaccine,

92
0:05:23.499,000 --> 0:05:26,000
such that a nurse, with a scan of the phone,

93
0:05:26.952,000 --> 0:05:3,000
can detect if the vaccine was stored properly in the right temperature

94
0:05:31.135,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and therefore is still good for use

95
0:05:33.148,000 --> 0:05:35,000
before administering this to the child --

96
0:05:36.514,000 --> 0:05:38,000
literally securing the next generation.

97
0:05:39.207,000 --> 0:05:44,000
These are some of the solutions at work saving lives, redeeming societies,

98
0:05:45.106,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in these parts of the world.

99
0:05:46.832,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But I would remind you

100
0:05:48.492,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that there are powerful ideas behind them,

101
0:05:51.089,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and I'll recap a few.

102
0:05:52.78,000 --> 0:05:56,000
One, that social trust is not the same as interpersonal trust.

103
0:05:58.128,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Two, that the division between consumption and regulation

104
0:06:01.343,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in an increasingly interdependent world

105
0:06:03.595,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is no longer viable.

106
0:06:05.54,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And three, that decentralized autonomy,

107
0:06:08.101,000 --> 0:06:1,000
regardless of what our blockchain enthusiasts in the West --

108
0:06:11.047,000 --> 0:06:12,000
whom I respect a lot -- say,

109
0:06:12.415,000 --> 0:06:17,000
are not as important as reinforcing social accountability feedback loops.

110
0:06:17.579,000 --> 0:06:18,000
These are some of the ideas.

111
0:06:20.21,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now, every time I go somewhere and I give this speech

112
0:06:22.725,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and I make these comments and I provide these examples,

113
0:06:26.873,000 --> 0:06:28,000
people say, "If these ideas are so damn brilliant,

114
0:06:29.258,000 --> 0:06:3,000
why aren't they everywhere?

115
0:06:30.612,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I've never heard of them."

116
0:06:31.97,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I want to assure you,

117
0:06:34.219,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the reason why you have not heard of these ideas

118
0:06:36.571,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is exactly the point I made in the beginning.

119
0:06:40.142,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And that is that there are parts of the world

120
0:06:43.538,000 --> 0:06:45,000
whose good ideas simply don't scale

121
0:06:46.361,000 --> 0:06:48,000
because of the latitude on which they were born.

122
0:06:48.653,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I call that "mental latitude imperialism."

123
0:06:51.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:53.652,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That really is the reason.

125
0:06:55.465,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But you may counter and say, "Well, maybe it's an important problem,

126
0:06:58.713,000 --> 0:07:,000
but it's sort of an obscure problem in parts of the world.

127
0:07:01.476,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Why do you want to globalize such problems?

128
0:07:03.558,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I mean, they are better local."

129
0:07:05.094,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What if, in response, I told you

130
0:07:07.982,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that actually, underlying each of these problems that I've described

131
0:07:11.945,000 --> 0:07:13,000
is a fundamental issue of the breakdown of trust

132
0:07:14.415,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in markets and institutions,

133
0:07:16.114,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and that there's nothing more global, more universal, closer to you and I

134
0:07:19.595,000 --> 0:07:2,000
than the problem of trust.

135
0:07:21.502,000 --> 0:07:27,000
For example, a quarter of all the seafood marketed in the US is falsely labeled.

136
0:07:27.964,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So when you buy a tuna or salmon sandwich in Manhattan,

137
0:07:30.603,000 --> 0:07:33,000
you are eating something that could be banned for being toxic in Japan.

138
0:07:34.575,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Literally.

139
0:07:35.96,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Most of you have heard of a time when horsemeat was masquerading as beef

140
0:07:40.678,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in burger patties in Europe?

141
0:07:42.266,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You have.

142
0:07:43.456,000 --> 0:07:48,000
What you don't know is that a good chunk of these fake meat patties

143
0:07:49.195,000 --> 0:07:52,000
were also contaminated with cadmium, which can damage your kidneys.

144
0:07:53.145,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This was Europe.

145
0:07:55.026,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Many of you are aware of plane crashes and you worry about plane crashes,

146
0:07:58.582,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because every now and then, one of them intrudes into your consciousness.

147
0:08:02.261,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But I bet you don't know

148
0:08:04.237,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that a single investigation uncovered one million counterfeit incidents

149
0:08:08.583,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in the aeronautical supply chain in the US.

150
0:08:11.278,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So this is a global problem, full stop.

151
0:08:14.934,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's a global problem.

152
0:08:16.109,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The only reason we are not addressing it with the urgency it deserves

153
0:08:19.393,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is that the best solutions,

154
0:08:20.719,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the most advanced solutions, the most progressive solutions,

155
0:08:23.594,000 --> 0:08:26,000
are, unfortunately, in parts of the world where solutions don't scale.

156
0:08:26.972,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And that is why it is not surprising

157
0:08:28.739,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that attempts to create this same verification models for pharmaceuticals

158
0:08:32.22,000 --> 0:08:35,000
are now a decade behind in the USA and Europe,

159
0:08:35.602,000 --> 0:08:36,000
while it's already available in Nigeria.

160
0:08:37.571,000 --> 0:08:39,000
A decade, and costing a hundred times more.

161
0:08:39.703,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And that is why, when you walk into a Walgreens in New York,

162
0:08:42.557,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you cannot check the source of your medicine,

163
0:08:44.685,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but you can in Maiduguri in Northern Nigeria.

164
0:08:46.87,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That is the reality.

165
0:08:48.047,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

166
0:08:49.155,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That is the reality.

167
0:08:50.36,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:52.512,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So we go back to the issue of ideas.

169
0:08:55.222,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Remember, solutions are merely packaged ideas,

170
0:08:58.728,000 --> 0:09:,000
so it is the ideas that are most important.

171
0:09:00.87,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In a world where we marginalize the ideas of the Global South,

172
0:09:04.001,000 --> 0:09:08,000
we cannot create globally inclusive problem-solving models.

173
0:09:08.685,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now, you might say, "Well, that's bad,

174
0:09:11.689,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but in such a world where we have so many other problems,

175
0:09:16.003,000 --> 0:09:17,000
do we need another cause?"

176
0:09:17.557,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I say yes, we need another cause.

177
0:09:19.208,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Actually, that cause will surprise you: the cause of intellectual justice.

178
0:09:22.73,000 --> 0:09:25,000
You say, "What? Intellectual justice? In a world of human rights abuses?"

179
0:09:26.23,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And I explain this way:

180
0:09:27.617,000 --> 0:09:31,000
all the solutions to the other problems that affect us and confront us

181
0:09:31.967,000 --> 0:09:32,000
need solutions.

182
0:09:33.164,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So you need the best ideas to address them.

183
0:09:35.438,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And that is why today I ask you,

184
0:09:37.458,000 --> 0:09:4,000
can we all give it one time for intellectual justice?

185
0:09:42.034,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Applause)

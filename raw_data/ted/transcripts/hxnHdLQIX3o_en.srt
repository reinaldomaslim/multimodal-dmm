1
0:00:13.375,000 --> 0:00:16,000
This is an elementary school in Columbus, Ohio.

2
0:00:17.875,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And inside of this school there was a student named D.

3
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:24,000
When D started school here he was six years old:

4
0:00:24.833,000 --> 0:00:25,000
cute as a button,

5
0:00:26.125,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with a smile that brightened the entire room.

6
0:00:29.667,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But after a few months in school,

7
0:00:31.917,000 --> 0:00:32,000
D became angry,

8
0:00:33.792,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and that smile faded.

9
0:00:36.75,000 --> 0:00:39,000
D began to do things like flip tables,

10
0:00:40.25,000 --> 0:00:41,000
throw desks and chairs,

11
0:00:42.083,000 --> 0:00:43,000
yell at teachers,

12
0:00:43.625,000 --> 0:00:44,000
stand in windowsills,

13
0:00:45.375,000 --> 0:00:47,000
run in and out of the classroom

14
0:00:47.417,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and even running out of the school.

15
0:00:51.042,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Sometimes these fits of anger would put the entire school into lockdown mode

16
0:00:57.458,000 --> 0:00:59,000
until D could get himself back together,

17
0:01:00.375,000 --> 0:01:03,000
which could sometimes take over an hour.

18
0:01:05.042,000 --> 0:01:08,000
No one in the school knew how to help D.

19
0:01:09.75,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I know this because I was the principal at this school.

20
0:01:14.042,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And what I quickly and collectively learned with my staff

21
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was that this situation was more extreme

22
0:01:22.083,000 --> 0:01:24,000
than anything we had ever been trained for.

23
0:01:26.042,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Every time that D lashed out,

24
0:01:27.792,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I kept thinking to myself:

25
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what did I miss during my principal prep coursework?

26
0:01:33.958,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What am I supposed to do with a kid like D?

27
0:01:37.75,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And how am I going to stop him from impeding the learning

28
0:01:41.542,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of all the other students?

29
0:01:44.458,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And yet after we did everything that we thought we knew,

30
0:01:48.875,000 --> 0:01:49,000
such as talking to D

31
0:01:50.5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and taking away privileges

32
0:01:52.708,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and parent phone calls home,

33
0:01:55.292,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the only real option we had left to do was to kick him out,

34
0:01:59.25,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I knew that would not help him.

35
0:02:03.042,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This scenario is not unique to D.

36
0:02:06.167,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Students all over the world are struggling with their education.

37
0:02:10.833,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And though we didn't come up with a fail-safe solution,

38
0:02:14.917,000 --> 0:02:15,000
we did come up with a simple idea:

39
0:02:17.792,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that in order for kids like D to not only survive in school

40
0:02:21.542,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but to thrive,

41
0:02:23.292,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we somehow had to figure out a way

42
0:02:25.667,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to not only teach them how to read and write

43
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but also how to help them deal with and manage their own emotions.

44
0:02:33.125,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And in doing that, we were able to move our school

45
0:02:36.083,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from one of the lowest-performing schools in the state of Ohio,

46
0:02:39.083,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with an F rating,

47
0:02:40.417,000 --> 0:02:42,000
all the way up to a C in just a matter of a few years.

48
0:02:44.083,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So it might sound obvious, right?

49
0:02:46.5,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Of course teachers should be focused on the emotional well-being of their kids.

50
0:02:51.75,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But in reality,

51
0:02:53.417,000 --> 0:02:55,000
when you're in a classroom full of 30 students

52
0:02:55.875,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and one of them's throwing tables at you,

53
0:02:58.208,000 --> 0:03:,000
it's far easier to exclude that child

54
0:03:00.458,000 --> 0:03:02,000
than to figure out what's going on inside of his head.

55
0:03:04.167,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But what we learned about D,

56
0:03:05.833,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and for kids like D,

57
0:03:07.458,000 --> 0:03:11,000
was that small changes can make huge differences,

58
0:03:11.75,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and it's possible to start right now.

59
0:03:14.625,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You don't need bigger budgets or grand strategic plans,

60
0:03:18.5,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you simply need smarter ways of thinking about what you have

61
0:03:22.25,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and where you have it.

62
0:03:23.958,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In education, we tend to always look outside the box for answers,

63
0:03:28.5,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and we rarely spend enough time, money and effort

64
0:03:31.583,000 --> 0:03:33,000
developing what we already have inside the box.

65
0:03:34.583,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And this is how meaningful change can happen fast.

66
0:03:38.667,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So here's what I learned about D.

67
0:03:42.125,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I was wanting to dig a little bit deeper to figure out how he had become so angry.

68
0:03:47.375,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And what I learned was his father had left the home

69
0:03:50.958,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and his mother was working long shifts in order to support the family,

70
0:03:54.875,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which left no adult for D to connect with --

71
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
and he was in charge of taking care of his younger brother

72
0:04:00.75,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when he got home from school.

73
0:04:02.833,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Might I remind you that D was six years old?

74
0:04:08.417,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Can't say that I blame him for having some trouble

75
0:04:10.833,000 --> 0:04:12,000
transitioning into the school environment.

76
0:04:12.917,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But yet we had to figure out a way to help him with these big emotions

77
0:04:17.667,000 --> 0:04:2,000
all while teaching him core skills of reading and math.

78
0:04:21.208,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And three things helped us most.

79
0:04:23.958,000 --> 0:04:26,000
First, we had to figure out where he was struggling the most.

80
0:04:27.792,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And like most young kids,

81
0:04:29.416,000 --> 0:04:31,000
arrival at school can be a tough transition time

82
0:04:32.375,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as they're moving from a less structured home environment

83
0:04:35.708,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to a more structured school environment.

84
0:04:38.125,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So what we did for D was we created a calming area for him

85
0:04:41.583,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in our time-out room,

86
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which we had equipped with rocking chairs and soft cushions and books,

87
0:04:47.208,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we allowed D to go to this place in the morning,

88
0:04:50.25,000 --> 0:04:51,000
away from the other kids,

89
0:04:51.958,000 --> 0:04:55,000
allowing him time to transition back into the school environment

90
0:04:56.458,000 --> 0:04:58,000
on his own terms.

91
0:04:58.5,000 --> 0:05:,000
And as we began to learn more about D,

92
0:05:01.167,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we learned other strategies that helped him calm down.

93
0:05:04.25,000 --> 0:05:06,000
For example, D loved to help younger students,

94
0:05:07.208,000 --> 0:05:1,000
so we made him a kindergarten helper,

95
0:05:10.583,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and he went into the kindergarten classroom

96
0:05:12.833,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and taught students how to write their letters.

97
0:05:15.167,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And he was actually successful with a few of them

98
0:05:17.875,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that the teacher was unable to reach.

99
0:05:20.667,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And believe it or not,

100
0:05:22.333,000 --> 0:05:26,000
D actually helped calm some of those kindergarten students down,

101
0:05:27.167,000 --> 0:05:31,000
signalling to us that the influence of peers on behavior was far greater

102
0:05:31.667,000 --> 0:05:33,000
than anything we adults could ever do.

103
0:05:34.625,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We used humor and song with him.

104
0:05:37.375,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Yes, I know it sounds really silly

105
0:05:39.375,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that the principal and the teachers would actually laugh with kids,

106
0:05:42.667,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but you can imagine the shock on D's face

107
0:05:46.125,000 --> 0:05:5,000
when the principal's cracking a joke or singing a song from the radio station,

108
0:05:50.25,000 --> 0:05:52,000
which almost always ended in a laugh,

109
0:05:53.125,000 --> 0:05:55,000
shortening the length of his outburst

110
0:05:55.625,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and helping us to connect with him in his world.

111
0:05:59.542,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So I know some you are like,

112
0:06:01.75,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"It's really not practical to lay on this kind of special treatment

113
0:06:05.042,000 --> 0:06:06,000
for every student,"

114
0:06:06.833,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but we actually made it happen.

115
0:06:09.125,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Because once we figured out the tools and tactics that worked for D,

116
0:06:13.375,000 --> 0:06:16,000
our teachers were able to roll that out and use them with other students.

117
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We began to proactively address student behavior

118
0:06:20.375,000 --> 0:06:21,000
instead of simply react to it.

119
0:06:23.083,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Our teachers actually took time during the lesson plan

120
0:06:25.958,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to teach kids how to identify their feelings

121
0:06:28.75,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and appropriate, healthy coping strategies for dealing with them,

122
0:06:32.583,000 --> 0:06:33,000
such as counting to 10,

123
0:06:34.5,000 --> 0:06:35,000
grabbing a fidget spinner

124
0:06:35.833,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or taking a quick walk.

125
0:06:38.167,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We incorporated brain breaks throughout the day,

126
0:06:40.458,000 --> 0:06:41,000
allowing kids to sing songs,

127
0:06:42.375,000 --> 0:06:43,000
do yoga poses

128
0:06:43.667,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and participate in structured physical activities.

129
0:06:46.875,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And for those kids that struggle with sitting for long periods of time,

130
0:06:51.25,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we invested in flexible seating,

131
0:06:53.083,000 --> 0:06:56,000
such as rocking chairs and exercise bikes,

132
0:06:56.417,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and even floor elliptical machines,

133
0:06:58.333,000 --> 0:07:,000
allowing kids to pedal underneath their desks.

134
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:06,000
These changes encouraged kids to stay in the classroom,

135
0:07:06.25,000 --> 0:07:08,000
helping them to focus and learn.

136
0:07:09.25,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And when less kids are disrupting,

137
0:07:11.583,000 --> 0:07:12,000
all kids do better.

138
0:07:14.125,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And here's the magical thing:

139
0:07:16.5,000 --> 0:07:18,000
it didn't cost us a whole lot of extra money.

140
0:07:19.792,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We simply thought differently about what we had.

141
0:07:23.625,000 --> 0:07:27,000
For example, every public school has an instructional supply line.

142
0:07:29.25,000 --> 0:07:31,000
An instructional supply could be a book,

143
0:07:31.708,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it could be a whiteboard,

144
0:07:33.083,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it could be flexible seating,

145
0:07:34.875,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it could be a fidget spinner,

146
0:07:36.417,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it could even be painting the walls of a school a more calming color,

147
0:07:40.75,000 --> 0:07:41,000
allowing students to thrive.

148
0:07:44.042,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's not that we didn't invest in the academic tools --

149
0:07:46.875,000 --> 0:07:47,000
obviously --

150
0:07:48.5,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but we took the social tools seriously, too.

151
0:07:51.542,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And the results speak for themselves.

152
0:07:53.958,000 --> 0:07:56,000
By taking the emotional development of our kids seriously

153
0:07:57.25,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and helping them manage their emotions,

154
0:07:59.292,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we saw huge growth in our reading and math scores,

155
0:08:02.458,000 --> 0:08:05,000
far exceeding the one year of expected growth

156
0:08:05.667,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and outscoring many schools with our same demographic.

157
0:08:10.833,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The second thing we did to help our kids manage their emotions

158
0:08:13.792,000 --> 0:08:14,000
was we used leverage.

159
0:08:15.5,000 --> 0:08:17,000
As a not-so-funded public school,

160
0:08:18.458,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we didn't have the support staff

161
0:08:20.042,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to address the chaos that our kids might be facing at home,

162
0:08:23.25,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and we certainly weren't trained or funded to address it directly.

163
0:08:27.167,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So we started to reach out to local groups,

164
0:08:29.667,000 --> 0:08:3,000
community agencies,

165
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and even the Ohio State University.

166
0:08:34.333,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Our partnership with the Ohio State University

167
0:08:36.542,000 --> 0:08:37,000
afforded us college students

168
0:08:38.208,000 --> 0:08:39,000
not only studying education

169
0:08:40.125,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but also school psychology and school social work.

170
0:08:43.542,000 --> 0:08:45,000
These students were paired with our teachers

171
0:08:46.167,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to help our most struggling students.

172
0:08:48.417,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And everyone benefitted

173
0:08:50.167,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because our teachers got access to the latest college-level thinking,

174
0:08:54.292,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and those college students got real-world, life experiences

175
0:08:57.958,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in the classroom.

176
0:09:00.333,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Our partnership with our local Nationwide Children's Hospital

177
0:09:03.625,000 --> 0:09:06,000
afforded us -- they're building us a health clinic within our school,

178
0:09:07.25,000 --> 0:09:1,000
providing health and mental health resources for our students.

179
0:09:11.625,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And our kids benefitted from this, too.

180
0:09:14.375,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Our absences continued to go down,

181
0:09:17.5,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and our kids had access to counseling

182
0:09:20.542,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that they could access during the school day.

183
0:09:23.667,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And perhaps the biggest change was not in D or in the kids at all.

184
0:09:28.75,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It was in the adults in the room.

185
0:09:31.542,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Teachers are typically good

186
0:09:32.875,000 --> 0:09:35,000
at planning for and delivering academic instruction,

187
0:09:35.958,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but when you throw in disruptive behavior,

188
0:09:38.292,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it can feel completely outside the scope of the job.

189
0:09:41.917,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But by us taking the emotional development of our kids seriously,

190
0:09:45.583,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we moved from a philosophy of exclusion --

191
0:09:48.042,000 --> 0:09:49,000
you disrupt, get out --

192
0:09:49.708,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to one of trust and respect.

193
0:09:52.167,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It wasn't easy,

194
0:09:53.583,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but we felt at heart,

195
0:09:54.958,000 --> 0:09:56,000
it was a positive way to make change,

196
0:09:57.792,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I'm in awe at the teachers that took that leap with me.

197
0:10:01.458,000 --> 0:10:04,000
As part of our personal professional development plan,

198
0:10:04.5,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we studied the research of Dr. Bruce Perry

199
0:10:08.5,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and his research on the effects of different childhood experiences

200
0:10:12.375,000 --> 0:10:13,000
on the developing child's brain.

201
0:10:14.875,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And what we learned was that some of our students' experiences,

202
0:10:18.583,000 --> 0:10:2,000
such as an absent parent,

203
0:10:20.708,000 --> 0:10:21,000
chaotic home life,

204
0:10:22.042,000 --> 0:10:23,000
poverty and illness,

205
0:10:23.875,000 --> 0:10:26,000
create real trauma on developing brains.

206
0:10:27.083,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Yes, trauma.

207
0:10:29.208,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I know it's a very strong word,

208
0:10:30.958,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but it helped us to reframe and understand the behaviors that we were seeing.

209
0:10:35.75,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And those difficult home experiences

210
0:10:38.542,000 --> 0:10:41,000
created real barbed-wire barriers to learning,

211
0:10:42.208,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and we had to figure out a way over it.

212
0:10:45.042,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So our teachers continued to practice with lesson plans,

213
0:10:48.625,000 --> 0:10:5,000
doing shorter lesson plans with a single focus,

214
0:10:51.375,000 --> 0:10:52,000
allowing kids to engage,

215
0:10:53.25,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and continued to incorporate these movement breaks,

216
0:10:56.375,000 --> 0:11:01,000
allowing kids to jump up and down in class and dance for two minutes straight,

217
0:11:01.417,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because we learned that taking breaks helps the learner retain new information.

218
0:11:06.583,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And might I add that the "Cha-Cha Slide" provides a perfect short dance party.

219
0:11:10.792,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:12.583,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I saw teachers say, "What happened to you?"

221
0:11:15.25,000 --> 0:11:16,000
instead of "What's wrong with you?"

222
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
or "How can I help you?" instead of "Get out."

223
0:11:20.625,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And this investment in our kids made huge differences,

224
0:11:25.917,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and we continue to see rises in our academic scores.

225
0:11:30.917,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I'm happy to say that when D got to fourth grade,

226
0:11:33.375,000 --> 0:11:34,000
he rarely got into trouble.

227
0:11:34.958,000 --> 0:11:36,000
He became a leader in the school,

228
0:11:37.25,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and this behavior became contagious with other students.

229
0:11:41.083,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We saw and felt our school climate continue to improve,

230
0:11:45.083,000 --> 0:11:49,000
making it a happy and safe place not only for children

231
0:11:49.208,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but for adults,

232
0:11:50.542,000 --> 0:11:52,000
despite any outside influence.

233
0:11:53.5,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Fast-forward to today,

234
0:11:55.25,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I now work with an alternative education program

235
0:11:58.375,000 --> 0:11:59,000
with high school students

236
0:11:59.75,000 --> 0:12:01,000
who struggle to function in traditional high school setting.

237
0:12:03.542,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I recently reviewed some of their histories.

238
0:12:06.375,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Many of them are 17 to 18 years old,

239
0:12:09.5,000 --> 0:12:1,000
experimenting with drugs,

240
0:12:11.208,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in and out of the juvenile detention system

241
0:12:13.625,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and expelled from school.

242
0:12:15.875,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And what I discovered was that many of them exhibit the same behaviors

243
0:12:21.208,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that I saw in six-year-old D.

244
0:12:23.917,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So I can't help but wonder:

245
0:12:26.208,000 --> 0:12:3,000
if these kids would've learned healthy coping strategies early on

246
0:12:30.917,000 --> 0:12:31,000
when times get tough,

247
0:12:32.292,000 --> 0:12:35,000
would they now be able to survive in a regular high school?

248
0:12:36.208,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I can't say for sure,

249
0:12:38.042,000 --> 0:12:41,000
but I have to tell you I believe that it would've helped.

250
0:12:41.208,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And it's time for all of us to take the social and emotional development

251
0:12:44.667,000 --> 0:12:45,000
of our kids seriously.

252
0:12:47.458,000 --> 0:12:52,000
The time is now for us to step up and say what we need to do for our kids.

253
0:12:53.333,000 --> 0:12:56,000
If we teach kids how to read and write, and they graduate

254
0:12:57.167,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but yet they don't know how to manage emotions,

255
0:12:59.667,000 --> 0:13:01,000
what will our communities look like?

256
0:13:02.042,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I tell people:

257
0:13:03.333,000 --> 0:13:06,000
you can invest now or you will pay later.

258
0:13:07.125,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The time is now for us to invest in our kids.

259
0:13:10.583,000 --> 0:13:12,000
They're our future citizens,

260
0:13:12.708,000 --> 0:13:15,000
not just numbers that can or cannot pass a test.

261
0:13:16.708,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Thank you.

262
0:13:18.042,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause and cheers)

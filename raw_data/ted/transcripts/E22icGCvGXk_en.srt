1
0:00:12.466,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Four years ago today, exactly, actually,

2
0:00:14.563,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.

3
0:00:17.659,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine

4
0:00:21.779,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.

5
0:00:25.654,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My name's Tavi Gevinson, and

6
0:00:29.845,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the title of my talk is "Still Figuring It Out,"

7
0:00:32.985,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and the MS Paint quality of my slides

8
0:00:35.232,000 --> 0:00:38,000
was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,

9
0:00:38.544,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and has nothing to do with my inability

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to use PowerPoint. (Laughter)

11
0:00:43.505,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.

12
0:00:48.065,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about

13
0:00:50.936,000 --> 0:00:52,000
what makes a strong female character,

14
0:00:53.352,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and, you know, movies and TV shows,

15
0:00:55.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
these things have influence. My own website.

16
0:00:59.706,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So I think the question of what makes a strong female

17
0:01:02.497,000 --> 0:01:04,000
character often goes misinterpreted,

18
0:01:04.874,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen

19
0:01:08.167,000 --> 0:01:11,000
who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,

20
0:01:11.759,000 --> 0:01:13,000
like a Catwoman type,

21
0:01:14.352,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or she plays her sexuality up a lot,

22
0:01:18.23,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and it's seen as power.

23
0:01:19.422,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.

24
0:01:22.821,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They're completely flat,

25
0:01:24.549,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and they're basically cardboard characters.

26
0:01:27.033,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The problem with this is that then

27
0:01:28.866,000 --> 0:01:31,000
people expect women to be that easy to understand,

28
0:01:32.712,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and women are mad at themselves

29
0:01:35.039,000 --> 0:01:36,000
for not being that simple,

30
0:01:36.381,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when, in actuality, women are complicated,

31
0:01:39.338,000 --> 0:01:42,000
women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy,

32
0:01:42.736,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but because people are crazy,

33
0:01:44.488,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and women happen to be people. (Laughter)

34
0:01:48.15,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So the flaws are the key.

35
0:01:50.435,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm not the first person to say this.

36
0:01:52.278,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What makes a strong female character

37
0:01:54.326,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,

38
0:01:59.23,000 --> 0:02:,000
who is maybe not immediately likable,

39
0:02:01.214,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but eventually relatable.

40
0:02:03.676,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I don't like to acknowledge a problem

41
0:02:05.145,000 --> 0:02:07,000
without also acknowledging those who work to fix it,

42
0:02:07.811,000 --> 0:02:1,000
so just wanted to acknowledge shows like "Mad Men,"

43
0:02:10.878,000 --> 0:02:12,000
movies like "Bridesmaids," whose female characters

44
0:02:13.758,000 --> 0:02:17,000
or protagonists are complex, multifaceted.

45
0:02:17.889,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO

46
0:02:22.105,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that premiers next month, "Girls,"

47
0:02:24.296,000 --> 0:02:26,000
she said she wanted to start it because she felt that

48
0:02:26.813,000 --> 0:02:28,000
every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,

49
0:02:29.801,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and that feels accurate for all people,

50
0:02:32.009,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but you don't see women represented like that as much.

51
0:02:34.673,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Congrats, guys. (Laughs)

52
0:02:38.257,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types

53
0:02:41.96,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of women who are not represented that way,

54
0:02:44.496,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and one group that we'll focus on today are teens,

55
0:02:46.952,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because I think teenagers are especially contradictory

56
0:02:50.232,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and still figuring it out,

57
0:02:53.272,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and in the '90s there was "Freaks and Geeks"

58
0:02:56.621,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and "My So-Called Life," and their characters,

59
0:02:59.4,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase,

60
0:03:02.056,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I mean, the whole premise of the shows

61
0:03:04.744,000 --> 0:03:07,000
were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,

62
0:03:08.19,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but those shows only lasted a season each,

63
0:03:11.288,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.

64
0:03:16.25,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) —

65
0:03:22.636,000 --> 0:03:23,000
around the time when I was,

66
0:03:24.108,000 --> 0:03:26,000
when I started watching those TV shows.

67
0:03:26.75,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I was ending middle school, starting high school --

68
0:03:28.945,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I'm a sophomore now —

69
0:03:31.209,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and I was trying to reconcile

70
0:03:33.965,000 --> 0:03:35,000
all of these differences that you're told you can't be

71
0:03:36.624,000 --> 0:03:37,000
when you're growing up as a girl.

72
0:03:37.971,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You can't be smart and pretty.

73
0:03:40.591,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.

74
0:03:43.414,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake

75
0:03:47.308,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of what other people, usually men, will think of you.

76
0:03:50.341,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So I was trying to figure all that out,

77
0:03:53.312,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and I felt a little confused,

78
0:03:56.613,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I said so on my blog,

79
0:03:58.355,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and I said that I wanted to start

80
0:04:02.54,000 --> 0:04:04,000
a website for teenage girls

81
0:04:05.044,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that was not this kind of one-dimensional

82
0:04:08.482,000 --> 0:04:1,000
strong character empowerment thing

83
0:04:11.186,000 --> 0:04:13,000
because I think one thing that can be very alienating

84
0:04:14.176,000 --> 0:04:16,000
about a misconception of feminism is that

85
0:04:16.808,000 --> 0:04:19,000
girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to

86
0:04:20.403,000 --> 0:04:22,000
being perfectly consistent in your beliefs,

87
0:04:22.894,000 --> 0:04:25,000
never being insecure, never having doubts,

88
0:04:26.305,000 --> 0:04:28,000
having all of the answers. And this is not true,

89
0:04:29.207,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling

90
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
became easier once I understood that feminism

91
0:04:37.019,000 --> 0:04:39,000
was not a rulebook but a discussion,

92
0:04:39.206,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a conversation, a process,

93
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year

94
0:04:44.501,000 --> 0:04:47,000
when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit

95
0:04:47.851,000 --> 0:04:49,000
on the illustration front since.

96
0:04:49.954,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But, yeah.

97
0:04:53.944,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication

98
0:04:58.343,000 --> 0:05:,000
for teenage girls and ask people to submit

99
0:05:00.832,000 --> 0:05:02,000
their writing, their photography, whatever,

100
0:05:02.952,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to be a member of our staff.

101
0:05:04.603,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I got about 3,000 emails.

102
0:05:07.527,000 --> 0:05:09,000
My editorial director and I went through them and

103
0:05:10.199,000 --> 0:05:13,000
put together a staff of people,

104
0:05:13.202,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and we launched last September.

105
0:05:15.802,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,

106
0:05:18.157,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,

107
0:05:21.511,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to

108
0:05:24.24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
give girls the answers, and not even give them permission

109
0:05:28.199,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to find the answers themselves,

110
0:05:30.773,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but hopefully inspire them to understand that

111
0:05:32.941,000 --> 0:05:33,000
they can give themselves that permission,

112
0:05:34.664,000 --> 0:05:36,000
they can ask their own questions, find their own answers,

113
0:05:37.548,000 --> 0:05:39,000
all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it

114
0:05:40.299,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a nice place for all of that to be figured out.

115
0:05:45.642,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I'm not saying, "Be like us,"

116
0:05:47.577,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and "We're perfect role models," because we're not,

117
0:05:49.945,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but we just want to help represent girls

118
0:05:55.057,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in a way that shows those different dimensions.

119
0:05:58.078,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I mean, we have articles called

120
0:06:01.872,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"

121
0:06:05.054,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but we also have articles like,

122
0:06:07.021,000 --> 0:06:1,000
oops -- I'm figuring it out!

123
0:06:10.982,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Ha ha. (Laughter)

124
0:06:13.508,000 --> 0:06:16,000
If you use that, you can get away with anything.

125
0:06:17.306,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We also have articles called

126
0:06:18.497,000 --> 0:06:21,000
"How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."

127
0:06:22.003,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So all of that being said, I still really appreciate

128
0:06:25.036,000 --> 0:06:28,000
those characters in movies and

129
0:06:29.003,000 --> 0:06:3,000
articles like that on our site,

130
0:06:30.816,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that aren't just about being totally powerful,

131
0:06:34.059,000 --> 0:06:37,000
maybe finding your acceptance with yourself

132
0:06:37.109,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.

133
0:06:42.668,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So what I you to take away from my talk,

134
0:06:46.286,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.

135
0:06:50.508,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)

136
0:06:53.882,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Because my favorite thing about her,

137
0:06:56.761,000 --> 0:06:59,000
other than, like, everything, is that

138
0:06:59.821,000 --> 0:07:01,000
she is very -- has always been

139
0:07:02.229,000 --> 0:07:04,000
unapologetically present on stage,

140
0:07:05.134,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and unapologetic about her flaws

141
0:07:07.941,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings

142
0:07:12.079,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and she makes you listen to them and think about them,

143
0:07:15.671,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.

144
0:07:17.053,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Thank you. (Applause)

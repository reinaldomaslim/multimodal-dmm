(Guitar)

2
0:00:29.878,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Singing)

3
0:00:30.881,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Rollercoaster,

4
0:00:34.971,000 --> 0:00:36,000
carousel.

5
0:00:40.472,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Where the highs are heaven,

6
0:00:43.332,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but the lows,

7
0:00:44.441,000 --> 0:00:46,000
oh, they can be hell.

8
0:00:47.03,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You can grab the ring,

9
0:00:50.806,000 --> 0:00:53,000
you can ring that bell,

10
0:00:54.241,000 --> 0:00:58,000
when the ride is over,

11
0:00:58.59,000 --> 0:00:59,000
you can never tell.

12
0:01:03.835,000 --> 0:01:06,000
People tell you this one thing --

13
0:01:07.678,000 --> 0:01:09,000
will make your life complete.

14
0:01:10.361,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So you,

15
0:01:11.791,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you give it everything you got

16
0:01:14.328,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and you wind up on the street.

17
0:01:19.545,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Then one day you wake up,

18
0:01:23.529,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and they tell you "you're a queen,"

19
0:01:27.478,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but then you find that someone else

20
0:01:31.285,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is pulling on the strings.

21
0:01:33.462,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Rollercoaster,

22
0:01:37.722,000 --> 0:01:39,000
carousel.

23
0:01:43.008,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Where the highs are heaven,

24
0:01:45.825,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but the lows,

25
0:01:46.901,000 --> 0:01:48,000
oh, they can be hell.

26
0:01:49.54,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You can grab the ring,

27
0:01:53.126,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you can ring that bell,

28
0:01:56.597,000 --> 0:02:,000
when the ride is over,

29
0:02:00.861,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you can never tell.

30
0:02:05.963,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The one you love,

31
0:02:07.332,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they love you --

32
0:02:08.381,000 --> 0:02:09,000
oh yeah --

33
0:02:10.012,000 --> 0:02:13,000
until the end of time.

34
0:02:13.901,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But lose your edge or lose your cool,

35
0:02:16.521,000 --> 0:02:19,000
they will drop you like a dime.

36
0:02:21.538,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Everyone is crowding 'round

37
0:02:25.5,000 --> 0:02:28,000
when fortune is your friend.

38
0:02:29.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
When your luck is running out,

39
0:02:33.215,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you're all alone again.

40
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Rollercoaster,

41
0:02:39.615,000 --> 0:02:42,000
carousel.

42
0:02:44.762,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Where the highs are heaven

43
0:02:47.723,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but the lows,

44
0:02:48.903,000 --> 0:02:5,000
oh, they can be hell.

45
0:02:51.239,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You can grab the ring,

46
0:02:54.953,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you can ring that bell,

47
0:02:58.349,000 --> 0:03:02,000
when the ride is over

48
0:03:02.583,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you can never tell.

49
0:03:07.984,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Well, maybe I'm just cynical,

50
0:03:11.868,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and all these words are lies,

51
0:03:15.858,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but experience keeps telling me

52
0:03:18.649,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that the cautious one is wise.

53
0:03:23.668,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But caution makes you hesitate,

54
0:03:27.524,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and hesitate you're lost,

55
0:03:31.422,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so take your opportunities

56
0:03:35.329,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and never count the cost.

57
0:03:37.509,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Rollercoaster,

58
0:03:41.559,000 --> 0:03:44,000
carousel.

59
0:03:46.987,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Where the highs are heaven,

0:03:49.671,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but the lows,

61
0:03:51.041,000 --> 0:03:53,000
oh, they can be hell.

62
0:03:53.309,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You can grab the ring,

63
0:03:56.771,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you can ring that bell,

64
0:04:00.257,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when the ride is over --

65
0:04:02.791,000 --> 0:04:03,000
over, over,

66
0:04:04.564,000 --> 0:04:07,000
you can never, ever tell.

67
0:04:08.381,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Rollercoaster,

68
0:04:12.224,000 --> 0:04:15,000

69
0:04:16.099,000 --> 0:04:17,000
rollercoaster,

70
0:04:17.914,000 --> 0:04:19,000
yeah, yeah, yeah,

71
0:04:20.017,000 --> 0:04:23,000
carousel.

72
0:04:23.947,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Carousel,

73
0:04:27.731,000 --> 0:04:31,000
carousel,

74
0:04:31.781,000 --> 0:04:34,000

79
0:04:53.785,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Thank you so much.

Thank you.

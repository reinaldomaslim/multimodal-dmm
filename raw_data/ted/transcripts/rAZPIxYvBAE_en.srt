1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I spend most of my time

2
0:00:16.8,000 --> 0:00:17,000
thinking about little girls,

3
0:00:20.28,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which is kind of a weird thing for a grown man in our society to say.

4
0:00:25.08,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But I do. I spend most of my time thinking about little girls,

5
0:00:28.04,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I think it's primarily because I have one.

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This one's mine, and I think you would really like her.

7
0:00:34.24,000 --> 0:00:36,000
She is smart and funny

8
0:00:36.72,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and kind to people and a good friend.

9
0:00:39.96,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But when I talk about my daughter, the word I find myself saying most

10
0:00:44.36,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is "athlete."

11
0:00:46.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
My kid's athletic.

12
0:00:48.24,000 --> 0:00:5,000
She is strong and fast

13
0:00:50.8,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and has great balance and good body control.

14
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
She is a three-time, back-to-back-to-back state champion

15
0:00:57.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in Shaolin Kempo.

16
0:00:59.08,000 --> 0:01:02,000
At nine years old, she is already halfway to a black belt.

17
0:01:02.8,000 --> 0:01:03,000
My daughter is athletic.

18
0:01:04.6,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, when a man who is six feet two and 265 pounds stands in front of you

19
0:01:08.8,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and says his daughter is athletic,

20
0:01:10.56,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you might think that's a reflection of him.

21
0:01:12.8,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It is not.

22
0:01:14.04,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:15.52,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My wife in high school was a two-time all-state soccer player

24
0:01:18.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and a two-time all-state volleyball player,

25
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I played "Dungeons and Dragons."

26
0:01:23.28,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And that is why,

27
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:26,000
although my daughter is an athlete,

28
0:01:27.36,000 --> 0:01:3,000
she's also a huge nerd, which I love.

29
0:01:30.56,000 --> 0:01:32,000
She walks around our house in a cloak of flames

30
0:01:33.2,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that she made herself.

31
0:01:35.4,000 --> 0:01:36,000
She sits on the Iron Throne --

32
0:01:37.4,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:39.2,000 --> 0:01:41,000
even though she has never seen "Game of Thrones,"

34
0:01:41.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
primarily because we are not the worst parents who ever lived.

35
0:01:45.44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But she knows there's someone called the Mother of Dragons,

36
0:01:48.24,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and she calls herself that and she loves it.

37
0:01:50.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
She's a huge comic book fan.

38
0:01:52.08,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Right now, her favorite character is Groot.

39
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
She loves Groot.

40
0:01:55.4,000 --> 0:01:56,000
She adores The Incredible Hulk.

41
0:01:58.08,000 --> 0:02:,000
But my daughter really at heart,

42
0:02:00.28,000 --> 0:02:03,000
her thing is Star Wars.

43
0:02:03.32,000 --> 0:02:04,000
My kid is a Jedi.

44
0:02:05.56,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Although some days she's also a Sith,

45
0:02:07.36,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which is a choice that I can respect.

46
0:02:10.6,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:11.72,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But here's the question that I have to ask.

48
0:02:14.4,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Why is it that when my daughter dresses up,

49
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:18,000
whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk,

50
0:02:19.32,000 --> 0:02:22,000
whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul,

51
0:02:22.88,000 --> 0:02:25,000
why is every character she dresses up as a boy?

52
0:02:28.32,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And where are all the female superheroes?

53
0:02:30.36,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And that is not actually the question,

54
0:02:32.24,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because there's plenty of female superheroes.

55
0:02:34.4,000 --> 0:02:37,000
My question really is, where is all the female superhero stuff?

56
0:02:38.64,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Where are the costumes? Where are the toys?

57
0:02:41.6,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Because every day when my daughter plays when she dresses up,

58
0:02:45.36,000 --> 0:02:46,000
she's learning stuff

59
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
through a process that, in my own line of work,

60
0:02:50.4,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as a professor of media studies,

61
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we refer to as public pedagogy.

62
0:02:53.96,000 --> 0:02:58,000
That is, it is how societies are taught ideologies.

63
0:02:59.2,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's how you learned what it meant to be a man or a woman,

64
0:03:01.96,000 --> 0:03:03,000
what it meant to behave yourself in public,

65
0:03:04.56,000 --> 0:03:06,000
what it meant to be a patriot and have good manners.

66
0:03:07.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's all the constituent social relations that make us up as a people.

67
0:03:11.2,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's, in short, how we learn what we know about other people

68
0:03:15.24,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and about the world.

69
0:03:17.04,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But we live in a 100-percent media-saturated society.

70
0:03:21.52,000 --> 0:03:24,000
What that means is that every single aspect of your human existence

71
0:03:25.04,000 --> 0:03:27,000
outside of your basic bodily functions

72
0:03:27.44,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is in some way touched by media.

73
0:03:29.92,000 --> 0:03:31,000
From the car that you drive to the food that you eat

74
0:03:32.4,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to the clothes that you wear

75
0:03:33.8,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to the way you construct your relationships

76
0:03:35.84,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to the very language you use to formulate thought --

77
0:03:38.96,000 --> 0:03:41,000
all of that is in some way mediated.

78
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So the answer in our society

79
0:03:44.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to how do we learn what we know about other people and about the world

80
0:03:47.59,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is largely through media.

81
0:03:50.88,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well, there's a wrinkle in that,

82
0:03:53.04,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in that our society,

83
0:03:54.84,000 --> 0:03:59,000
media don't simply exist as information distribution technologies and devices.

84
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They also exist as corporate entities.

85
0:04:03.04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And when the distribution of information is tied to financial gain,

86
0:04:08.88,000 --> 0:04:09,000
there's a problem.

87
0:04:11.08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
How big of a problem?

88
0:04:12.52,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Well think about this:

89
0:04:13.76,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in 1983, 90 percent of American media were owned by 50 companies.

90
0:04:20.52,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In any market, 50 companies doing something is a lot of companies.

91
0:04:24.84,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's a lot of different worldviews.

92
0:04:26.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,

93
0:04:31.48,000 --> 0:04:32,000
six companies.

94
0:04:32.839,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They are NBCUniversal Comcast, AOL Time Warner,

95
0:04:36.64,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the Walt Disney Company, News Corp, Viacom and the CBS Corporation.

96
0:04:42.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
These six companies produce nine out of every 10 movies you watch,

97
0:04:46.48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
nine out of every 10 television shows, nine out of every 10 songs,

98
0:04:49.96,000 --> 0:04:5,000
nine out of every 10 books.

99
0:04:51.76,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So my question to you is,

100
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
if six companies control 90 percent of American media,

101
0:04:57.4,000 --> 0:05:02,000
how much influence do you think they have over what you're allowed to see every day?

102
0:05:03.88,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Because in media studies,

103
0:05:05.28,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we spend a lot of time saying that media can't tell us what to think,

104
0:05:08.56,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and they can't; they're terrible at that.

105
0:05:10.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But that's not their job.

106
0:05:12.24,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Media don't tell us what to think.

107
0:05:14.2,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Media tell us what to think about.

108
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They control the conversation,

109
0:05:18.88,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and in controlling the conversation,

110
0:05:20.64,000 --> 0:05:23,000
they don't have to get you to think what they want you to think.

111
0:05:23.68,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They'll just get you thinking about the things they want you to think about,

112
0:05:27.28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and more importantly, not thinking about things they don't want you to think about.

113
0:05:31.2,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They control the conversation.

114
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
How does this work in practice?

115
0:05:34.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Let's just take one of those companies.

116
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We'll do an easy one.

117
0:05:38.04,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Let's talk about the Walt Disney Company for a second.

118
0:05:40.6,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The reason why I always pick the Walt Disney Company is this.

119
0:05:43.52,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Is there a single person in this room who has never seen a Disney movie?

120
0:05:46.96,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Look around. Exactly.

121
0:05:49.72,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I picked Disney because they have what we call 100 percent penetration

122
0:05:53.4,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in our society.

123
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Every single person has been exposed to Disney,

124
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so it's an easy one for me to use.

125
0:05:59.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Since 1937, Disney has made most of its money selling princesses to girls.

126
0:06:04.32,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's made a huge chunk of its money.

127
0:06:06.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Unless, of course, the princess your daughter is interested in,

128
0:06:09.44,000 --> 0:06:1,000
as my daughter is, is this one.

129
0:06:11.88,000 --> 0:06:13,000
See, in 2012,

130
0:06:14.2,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Disney purchased LucasFilm for the sum of four billion dollars,

131
0:06:18.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and immediately they flooded the Disney stores with Han Solo

132
0:06:22.68,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and Yoda

133
0:06:26.04,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and not Princess Leia.

134
0:06:27.92,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Why? Because this princess messes up the public pedagogy

135
0:06:31.36,000 --> 0:06:32,000
for these princesses.

136
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So Disney did not put Princess Leia merchandise in the store,

137
0:06:36.72,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and when people went to Disney and said,

138
0:06:38.68,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"Hey, where's all the Princess Leia stuff?"

139
0:06:40.72,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Disney said, "We have no intention

140
0:06:42.4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of putting Princess Leia merchandise in the store."

141
0:06:44.84,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And fans were angry and they took to Twitter

142
0:06:46.96,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.

143
0:06:49.08,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And Disney said, "Wait, that's not what we meant.

144
0:06:51.52,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What we meant was,

145
0:06:53.2,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we don't have any Princess Leia merchandise yet, but we will."

146
0:06:56.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And that was in 2012, and it is 2015,

147
0:07:00.32,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and if you go to the Disney Store, as I recently have,

148
0:07:02.876,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and look for Princess Leia merchandise,

149
0:07:04.765,000 --> 0:07:07,000
do you know how many Princess Leia items there are in the Disney Store?

150
0:07:08.124,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Zero, because Disney has no intention of putting Princess Leia in the store.

151
0:07:11.728,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And we shouldn't be surprised because we found out that was their policy

152
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
when they bought Marvel in 2009

153
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.

154
0:07:22.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Because when you make a lot of money selling princesses to girls,

155
0:07:25.52,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you also kind of want to make money from boys.

156
0:07:27.92,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And so what better to sell boys than superheroes?

157
0:07:30.4,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So now Disney had access to Captain America and to Thor,

158
0:07:33.4,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The Incredible Hulk,

159
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they had access even

160
0:07:37.56,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to a group of superheroes no one had ever even heard of.

161
0:07:40.32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That's how good Marvel was at selling superheroes.

162
0:07:43.48,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Last year, they released a film called "Guardians of the Galaxy."

163
0:07:46.92,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's a film that absolutely should not work.

164
0:07:49.84,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Nobody knew who they were except for comic book nerds like me.

165
0:07:53.68,000 --> 0:07:55,000
One of the characters is a talking tree.

166
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
One of the characters is an anthropomorphic raccoon.

167
0:07:58.48,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It should not work.

168
0:07:59.96,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And they made a killing off of "Guardians of the Galaxy."

169
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This character here in the middle, her name is Gamora.

170
0:08:05.72,000 --> 0:08:06,000
She's played by Zoe Saldana,

171
0:08:07.6,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and she is strong and smart and fast and fights like a ninja,

172
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and she is played by a beautiful black woman,

173
0:08:13.44,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and my daughter fell in love with her.

174
0:08:15.64,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So like any good nerd dad, I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff,

175
0:08:19.88,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and when I got to the store, I learned a very interesting thing.

176
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,

177
0:08:25.76,000 --> 0:08:26,000
well, Gamora's not on it.

178
0:08:28.24,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They probably should have marketed this as "some" of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

179
0:08:32.08,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox, she wasn't on it,

181
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt,

182
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
she wasn't on it.

183
0:08:40.56,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And as a matter of fact,

184
0:08:42.48,000 --> 0:08:44,000
if I went to the store, as I did,

185
0:08:44.72,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and looked at the display,

186
0:08:46.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
you would find a small picture of Gamora right here,

187
0:08:49.08,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but if you look at any of the actual merchandise on that shelf,

188
0:08:52.84,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Gamora is not on any of it.

189
0:08:55.44,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now, I could have taken to Twitter with the hashtag #WheresGamora,

190
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:02,000
like millions of fans did across the world,

191
0:09:02.32,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but the truth was I wasn't even really that surprised,

192
0:09:06.44,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because I was there when Disney had released "The Avengers."

193
0:09:10.4,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And just this year, we got a new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron,"

194
0:09:13.76,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and we were very excited,

195
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because there was not one but two female superheroes,

196
0:09:17.52,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.

197
0:09:19.52,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And we were very excited.

198
0:09:20.84,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But here's the real thing about this.

199
0:09:23.08,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Even though Scarlett Johansson,

200
0:09:24.88,000 --> 0:09:27,000
who is one of the most popular actresses in America, plays Black Widow,

201
0:09:28.36,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and Black Widow is the star

202
0:09:29.72,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of not one, not two, but five different Marvel movies,

203
0:09:34.72,000 --> 0:09:38,000
there is not a single piece of Black Widow merchandise available.

204
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Not one.

205
0:09:40.76,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And if you go to the Disney store and look for a Black Widow costume,

206
0:09:44.04,000 --> 0:09:47,000
what you will find, is you will find Captain America and The Incredible Hulk.

207
0:09:47.68,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You will find Iron Man and Thor.

208
0:09:49.28,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You will even find War Machine,

209
0:09:50.8,000 --> 0:09:52,000
who isn't even really in the movie that long.

210
0:09:53.6,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Who you will not find is Black Widow.

211
0:09:56.04,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And I could have gone to Twitter with the hashtag, as many people did,

212
0:09:59.6,000 --> 0:10:,000
# WheresNatasha.

213
0:10:01.4,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But I'm tired of doing that.

214
0:10:03.76,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I'm tired of having to do that.

215
0:10:05.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
All over the country right now,

216
0:10:07.12,000 --> 0:10:1,000
there are kids playing with the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set,

217
0:10:10.6,000 --> 0:10:13,000
where Captain America rides a motorcycle out of a moving jet

218
0:10:14.6,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and it's really awesome.

219
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You know how awesome it is?

220
0:10:17.52,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So awesome that when it happened in the movie,

221
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
it was Black Widow that did it.

222
0:10:22.4,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Not only has she been erased,

223
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but she has been replaced with a male figure.

224
0:10:31.64,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And so what is this teaching us?

225
0:10:34.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I mean, over the next five years,

226
0:10:36.64,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Disney and Warner Bros. and a bunch of movie studios

227
0:10:40.36,000 --> 0:10:43,000
are going to release over 30 feature-length films

228
0:10:43.8,000 --> 0:10:44,000
with comic book characters,

229
0:10:45.28,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and of those 30 feature-length films,

230
0:10:47.68,000 --> 0:10:51,000
exactly two of them will have female solo leads.

231
0:10:52.6,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Two.

232
0:10:53.84,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now, there will be females in the rest of these movies,

233
0:10:56.72,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but they will be sidekicks, they will be love interests,

234
0:10:59.4,000 --> 0:11:,000
they will be members of teams.

235
0:11:00.853,000 --> 0:11:01,000
They will not be the main character.

236
0:11:02.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And if what we learn, what we know

237
0:11:04.96,000 --> 0:11:07,000
about other people and about the world we learn through media,

238
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
then these companies are teaching my daughter that even if she is strong

239
0:11:11.56,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and smart and fast and fights like a ninja,

240
0:11:14.8,000 --> 0:11:17,000
all four of which are true of her,

241
0:11:17.88,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it doesn't matter.

242
0:11:19.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
She will either be ignored like Gamora

243
0:11:22.08,000 --> 0:11:24,000
or erased and replaced with a boy

244
0:11:24.76,000 --> 0:11:25,000
like Black Widow.

245
0:11:26.92,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And it's not fair.

246
0:11:28.6,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's not fair to her and it's not fair to your sons and daughters either.

247
0:11:32.68,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But here's the thing:

248
0:11:33.96,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I'm raising a little girl, and she has a little tomboy in her,

249
0:11:37.28,000 --> 0:11:39,000
which by the way is a terrible thing to call a girl.

250
0:11:39.8,000 --> 0:11:42,000
What that basically is saying is, those traits that define you,

251
0:11:43.04,000 --> 0:11:44,000
they're not really yours,

252
0:11:44.28,000 --> 0:11:46,000
they're just on loan to you for a little while from boys.

253
0:11:47.56,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But do you know how much grief she's going to take in her life

254
0:11:50.88,000 --> 0:11:51,000
for having a little tomboy in her?

255
0:11:53.32,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Zero. None.

256
0:11:55.32,000 --> 0:11:56,000
People will think it's cute.

257
0:11:56.72,000 --> 0:11:58,000
They'll call her feisty, because in our society,

258
0:11:59.36,000 --> 0:12:01,000
adding so-called male traits to girls

259
0:12:01.8,000 --> 0:12:04,000
is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.

260
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.

261
0:12:08.4,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Mike is a little boy in Florida. He's 11 years old,

262
0:12:11.36,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and the thing that he loves most in the world

263
0:12:13.52,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is a show called "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,"

264
0:12:16.48,000 --> 0:12:19,000
like millions of other children across America.

265
0:12:19.56,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now, the show is marketed to girls ages five to nine,

266
0:12:23.08,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but there are millions of boys

267
0:12:25.44,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and grown men

268
0:12:27.24,000 --> 0:12:29,000
who enjoy "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic."

269
0:12:29.64,000 --> 0:12:3,000
They have a club.

270
0:12:30.88,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They call themselves Bronies,

271
0:12:32.76,000 --> 0:12:35,000
pony bros, guys who like ponies.

272
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I happen to be one of them.

273
0:12:37.92,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And what are Mike and myself

274
0:12:41.48,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and millions of other boys and men learning in this feminine,

275
0:12:44.362,000 --> 0:12:46,000
sissified world of "My Little Pony?"

276
0:12:47.24,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Well, they're learning to study hard and to work hard and to party hard

277
0:12:52.12,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and to look good and to feel good

278
0:12:54.2,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and to do good,

279
0:12:55.76,000 --> 0:13:,000
and heaven preserve us from teaching these wussified concepts to boys.

280
0:13:00.88,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So the other kids in his neighborhood pick on Mike and they beat him up

281
0:13:04.84,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and they make fun of him,

282
0:13:06.12,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and at 11 years old, Mike goes home,

283
0:13:08.6,000 --> 0:13:1,000
finds a belt, wraps it around his neck,

284
0:13:10.96,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and hangs himself from the top bunk of his bed.

285
0:13:13.76,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Because we have developed a society

286
0:13:16.36,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in which you would rather be dead as a boy than thought of as liking stuff for girls.

287
0:13:22.28,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And that is not Mike's fault. That is our fault.

288
0:13:25.48,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We have failed him.

289
0:13:27.8,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We have failed our children.

290
0:13:30.12,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And we have to do better for them.

291
0:13:32.08,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We have to stop making it so that the only female superheroes

292
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
appear on shirts that are pink and cut for girls.

293
0:13:38.84,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We have to stop.

294
0:13:40.08,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And when I was putting this together, people said to me,

295
0:13:42.92,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"Well, that's never going to happen." And I said, "Oh really?"

296
0:13:45.88,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Because just this year, Target announced

297
0:13:47.84,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that they were going to stop gendering their toy aisles.

298
0:13:51.2,000 --> 0:13:52,000
They were going to mix it up.

299
0:13:52.64,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Now, before we break our shoulders patting Target on the back,

300
0:13:56.24,000 --> 0:13:57,000
just this week they released a shirt

301
0:13:58.2,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in which one of the most iconic scenes in "Star Wars: A New Hope"

302
0:14:01.44,000 --> 0:14:03,000
where Princess Leia stands up to the Dark Lord of the Sith,

303
0:14:04.44,000 --> 0:14:05,000
was released on a t-shirt

304
0:14:05.68,000 --> 0:14:07,000
in which she's mysteriously replaced by Luke.

305
0:14:07.96,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So let's don't pat ourselves on the back too much.

306
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Just this week also,

307
0:14:12.52,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Disney announced it was no longer going to gender its Halloween costumes,

308
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:18,000
which I say, "Thank you, Disney,

309
0:14:18.8,000 --> 0:14:2,000
except the only costumes you make are of male superheroes,

310
0:14:21.56,000 --> 0:14:23,000
so does it matter who you have wearing them?"

311
0:14:25.04,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie,

312
0:14:27.28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
announced they're going to release a line of DC superhero girls.

313
0:14:30.76,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And the funny thing is,

314
0:14:32.04,000 --> 0:14:33,000
they met with girls

315
0:14:33.48,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and asked them what they wanted to see in dolls,

316
0:14:35.88,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and you can see, they have calves

317
0:14:38.28,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and elbows that bend so they can do superhero stuff.

318
0:14:41.88,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And please buy them.

319
0:14:43.44,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And don't just buy them for your daughters,

320
0:14:45.48,000 --> 0:14:46,000
buy them for your sons.

321
0:14:46.84,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Because it's important that boys play with and as female superheroes

322
0:14:51.8,000 --> 0:14:54,000
just as my daughter plays with and as male superheroes.

323
0:14:55.8,000 --> 0:14:56,000
As a matter of fact, what I would love

324
0:14:57.68,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is a world in which every person who goes to the store

325
0:15:00.28,000 --> 0:15:02,000
goes with a little flowchart in their head

326
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
of whether or not they should buy this toy for a boy or a girl,

327
0:15:06.12,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and it's a real simple flowchart because it only has one question on it.

328
0:15:09.525,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It says, "Is this toy operated with your genitals?"

329
0:15:12.6,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Laughter)

330
0:15:14.88,000 --> 0:15:15,000
If the answer is yes,

331
0:15:17.8,000 --> 0:15:18,000
then that is not a toy for children.

332
0:15:19.64,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Laughter)

333
0:15:22.76,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And if the answer is no,

334
0:15:25.96,000 --> 0:15:27,000
then it's for boys and girls.

335
0:15:28.2,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It's really simple.

336
0:15:29.72,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Because today is about the future of the future, and in my future,

337
0:15:33.72,000 --> 0:15:36,000
boys and girls are equally respected,

338
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:41,000
equally valued, and most importantly, equally represented.

339
0:15:42.52,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Thank you.

340
0:15:43.76,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Applause)

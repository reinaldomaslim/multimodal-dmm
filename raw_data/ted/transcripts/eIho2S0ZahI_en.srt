1
0:00:13.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The human voice:

2
0:00:16.07,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's the instrument we all play.

3
0:00:18.61,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.

4
0:00:21.093,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you."

5
0:00:23.94,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And yet many people have the experience

6
0:00:25.822,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that when they speak, people don't listen to them.

7
0:00:28.21,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And why is that?

8
0:00:29.346,000 --> 0:00:32,000
How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?

9
0:00:33.485,000 --> 0:00:34,000
What I'd like to suggest,

10
0:00:34.821,000 --> 0:00:36,000
there are a number of habits that we need to move away from.

11
0:00:37.69,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.

12
0:00:41.444,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,

13
0:00:43.876,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.

14
0:00:49.132,000 --> 0:00:51,000
First, gossip.

15
0:00:51.989,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.

16
0:00:54.7,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well

17
0:00:56.82,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.

18
0:01:01.771,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Second, judging.

19
0:01:03.515,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We know people who are like this in conversation,

20
0:01:05.923,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it's very hard to listen to somebody

21
0:01:07.879,000 --> 0:01:11,000
if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.

22
0:01:12.029,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Third, negativity.

23
0:01:14.447,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You can fall into this.

24
0:01:15.759,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative,

25
0:01:18.82,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and it's hard to listen.

26
0:01:20.166,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I remember one day, I said to her, "It's October 1 today,"

27
0:01:22.923,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"

28
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:27.262,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.

30
0:01:29.635,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:30.931,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And another form of negativity, complaining.

32
0:01:33.475,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, this is the national art of the U.K.

33
0:01:37.542,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's our national sport.

34
0:01:38.977,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything,

35
0:01:42.435,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but actually, complaining is viral misery.

36
0:01:44.555,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.

37
0:01:48.292,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Excuses.

38
0:01:50.048,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We've all met this guy.

39
0:01:51.396,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Maybe we've all been this guy.

40
0:01:52.996,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Some people have a blamethrower.

41
0:01:55.49,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They just pass it on to everybody else

42
0:01:57.718,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and don't take responsibility for their actions,

43
0:02:00.046,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.

44
0:02:02.982,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,

45
0:02:04.804,000 --> 0:02:07,000
embroidery, exaggeration.

46
0:02:08.21,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It demeans our language, actually, sometimes.

47
0:02:10.638,000 --> 0:02:13,000
For example, if I see something that really is awesome,

48
0:02:13.93,000 --> 0:02:14,000
what do I call it?

49
0:02:15.22,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:17.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying,

51
0:02:21.3,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.

52
0:02:24.323,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And finally, dogmatism.

53
0:02:27.688,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The confusion of facts with opinions.

54
0:02:31.323,000 --> 0:02:32,000
When those two things get conflated,

55
0:02:33.262,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you're listening into the wind.

56
0:02:34.763,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true.

57
0:02:38.454,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's difficult to listen to that.

58
0:02:40.547,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking.

59
0:02:43.588,000 --> 0:02:45,000
These are things I think we need to avoid.

60
0:02:46.021,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But is there a positive way to think about this?

61
0:02:48.89,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Yes, there is.

62
0:02:50.458,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations,

63
0:02:55.974,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that we can stand on if we want our speech

64
0:02:58.42,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to be powerful and to make change in the world.

65
0:03:02.288,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Fortunately, these things spell a word.

66
0:03:04.523,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The word is "hail," and it has a great definition as well.

67
0:03:07.619,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky

68
0:03:10.287,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and hits you on the head.

69
0:03:11.575,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I'm talking about this definition,

70
0:03:13.219,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to greet or acclaim enthusiastically,

71
0:03:15.04,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which is how I think our words will be received

72
0:03:17.307,000 --> 0:03:18,000
if we stand on these four things.

73
0:03:18.903,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So what do they stand for?

74
0:03:20.425,000 --> 0:03:21,000
See if you can guess.

75
0:03:22.32,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The H, honesty, of course,

76
0:03:25.283,000 --> 0:03:27,000
being true in what you say, being straight and clear.

77
0:03:28.254,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The A is authenticity, just being yourself.

78
0:03:32.295,000 --> 0:03:35,000
A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth,

79
0:03:35.505,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which I think is a lovely way to put it.

80
0:03:37.443,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The I is integrity, being your word,

81
0:03:40.079,000 --> 0:03:41,000
actually doing what you say,

82
0:03:41.867,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and being somebody people can trust.

83
0:03:44.358,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And the L is love.

84
0:03:47.13,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I don't mean romantic love,

85
0:03:49.251,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons.

86
0:03:52.66,000 --> 0:03:55,000
First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want.

87
0:03:56.074,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning.

88
0:03:58.663,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Perhaps that's not necessary.

89
0:04:02.021,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing.

90
0:04:05.379,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But also, if you're really wishing somebody well,

91
0:04:08.474,000 --> 0:04:1,000
it's very hard to judge them at the same time.

92
0:04:11.111,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.

93
0:04:15.31,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So hail.

94
0:04:16.91,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Also, now that's what you say,

95
0:04:18.667,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and it's like the old song, it is what you say,

96
0:04:20.935,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it's also the way that you say it.

97
0:04:22.638,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You have an amazing toolbox.

98
0:04:24.41,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This instrument is incredible,

99
0:04:26.27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened.

100
0:04:29.81,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now

101
0:04:32.431,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and just pull a few tools out

102
0:04:33.855,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that you might like to take away and play with,

103
0:04:36.118,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which will increase the power of your speaking.

104
0:04:38.442,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Register, for example.

105
0:04:39.986,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time,

106
0:04:44.18,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but there's a register in between.

107
0:04:46.234,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I'm not going to get very technical about this

108
0:04:48.419,000 --> 0:04:49,000
for any of you who are voice coaches.

109
0:04:50.205,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You can locate your voice, however.

110
0:04:51.942,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference.

111
0:04:54.824,000 --> 0:04:55,000
If I go down here in my throat,

112
0:04:56.332,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which is where most of us speak from most of the time.

113
0:04:58.985,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But if you want weight,

114
0:05:00.642,000 --> 0:05:02,000
you need to go down here to the chest.

115
0:05:03.12,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You hear the difference?

116
0:05:04.73,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true,

117
0:05:08.77,000 --> 0:05:1,000
because we associate depth with power

118
0:05:11.738,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and with authority.

119
0:05:14.445,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That's register.

120
0:05:16.134,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Then we have timbre.

121
0:05:17.501,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It's the way your voice feels.

122
0:05:19.27,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Again, the research shows

123
0:05:20.626,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm,

124
0:05:24.424,000 --> 0:05:25,000
like hot chocolate.

125
0:05:26.635,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world,

126
0:05:29.923,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because you can train.

127
0:05:31.365,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Go and get a voice coach.

128
0:05:32.609,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And there are amazing things you can do

129
0:05:34.491,000 --> 0:05:36,000
with breathing, with posture, and with exercises

130
0:05:36.921,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to improve the timbre of your voice.

131
0:05:39.435,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Then prosody. I love prosody.

132
0:05:41.227,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This is the sing-song, the meta-language

133
0:05:43.403,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that we use in order to impart meaning.

134
0:05:45.477,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's root one for meaning in conversation.

135
0:05:48.315,000 --> 0:05:52,000
People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to

136
0:05:52.395,000 --> 0:05:54,000
if they don't have any prosody at all.

137
0:05:54.611,000 --> 0:05:56,000
That's where the word "monotonic" comes from,

138
0:05:57.586,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or monotonous, monotone.

139
0:06:00.306,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in,

140
0:06:03.603,000 --> 0:06:05,000
where every sentence ends as if it were a question

141
0:06:06.323,000 --> 0:06:08,000
when it's actually not a question, it's a statement?

142
0:06:08.824,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:11.154,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And if you repeat that one,

144
0:06:12.74,000 --> 0:06:15,000
it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody,

145
0:06:16.108,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which I think is a shame,

146
0:06:17.994,000 --> 0:06:18,000
so let's try and break that habit.

147
0:06:21.315,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Pace.

148
0:06:22.418,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I can get very excited by saying something really quickly,

149
0:06:25.203,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or I can slow right down to emphasize,

150
0:06:28.579,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.

151
0:06:34.555,000 --> 0:06:37,000
There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there?

152
0:06:38.561,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.

153
0:06:41.833,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It can be very powerful.

154
0:06:43.823,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Of course, pitch often goes along with pace

155
0:06:46.151,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch.

156
0:06:48.795,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Where did you leave my keys?

157
0:06:50.383,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys?

158
0:06:52.487,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.

159
0:06:56.156,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And finally, volume.

160
0:06:58.402,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Loud) I can get really excited by using volume.

161
0:07:01.803,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.

162
0:07:03.98,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet.

163
0:07:08.707,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Some people broadcast the whole time.

164
0:07:10.527,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Try not to do that.

165
0:07:11.9,000 --> 0:07:12,000
That's called sodcasting,

166
0:07:13.752,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:15.445,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately.

168
0:07:20.013,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Not nice.

169
0:07:21.115,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Of course, where this all comes into play most of all

170
0:07:23.671,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is when you've got something really important to do.

171
0:07:26.199,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people.

172
0:07:29.651,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It might be proposing marriage,

173
0:07:31.539,000 --> 0:07:34,000
asking for a raise, a wedding speech.

174
0:07:34.693,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Whatever it is, if it's really important,

175
0:07:36.699,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox

176
0:07:40.472,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and the engine that it's going to work on,

177
0:07:42.509,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and no engine works well without being warmed up.

178
0:07:45.604,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Warm up your voice.

179
0:07:47.482,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Actually, let me show you how to do that.

180
0:07:49.557,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Would you all like to stand up for a moment?

181
0:07:52.536,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I'm going to show you

182
0:07:53.691,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.

183
0:07:58.925,000 --> 0:08:,000
Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these.

184
0:08:01.859,000 --> 0:08:03,000
First, arms up, deep breath in,

185
0:08:04.662,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.

186
0:08:07.764,000 --> 0:08:08,000
One more time.

187
0:08:09.392,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Ahhhh, very good.

188
0:08:12.39,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now we're going to warm up our lips,

189
0:08:14.132,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,

190
0:08:16.484,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.

191
0:08:19.436,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And now, brrrrrrrrrr,

192
0:08:22.876,000 --> 0:08:23,000
just like when you were a kid.

193
0:08:24.426,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive.

194
0:08:26.853,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We're going to do the tongue next

195
0:08:28.528,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

196
0:08:32.85,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Beautiful. You're getting really good at this.

197
0:08:35.065,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.

198
0:08:37.955,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That's like champagne for the tongue.

199
0:08:40.171,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Finally, and if I can only do one,

200
0:08:42.491,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the pros call this the siren.

201
0:08:44.298,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's really good. It starts with "we" and goes to "aw."

202
0:08:46.942,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The "we" is high, the "aw" is low.

203
0:08:48.586,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.

204
0:08:54.706,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause.

205
0:08:56.969,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Take a seat, thank you.

206
0:08:58.238,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

207
0:08:59.712,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Next time you speak, do those in advance.

208
0:09:02.336,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Now let me just put this in context to close.

209
0:09:04.976,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This is a serious point here.

210
0:09:07.272,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This is where we are now, right?

211
0:09:09.103,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We speak not very well

212
0:09:10.768,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to people who simply aren't listening

213
0:09:12.636,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics.

214
0:09:15.555,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I have talked about that on this stage in different phases.

215
0:09:18.798,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What would the world be like

216
0:09:20.432,000 --> 0:09:21,000
if we were speaking powerfully

217
0:09:22.152,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to people who were listening consciously

218
0:09:24.208,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in environments which were actually fit for purpose?

219
0:09:27.602,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Or to make that a bit larger,

220
0:09:30.585,000 --> 0:09:31,000
what would the world be like

221
0:09:31.943,000 --> 0:09:33,000
if we were creating sound consciously

222
0:09:34.31,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and consuming sound consciously

223
0:09:36.343,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and designing all our environments

224
0:09:38.07,000 --> 0:09:39,000
consciously for sound?

225
0:09:39.547,000 --> 0:09:42,000
That would be a world that does sound beautiful,

226
0:09:42.671,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and one where understanding would be the norm,

227
0:09:46.582,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and that is an idea worth spreading.

228
0:09:49.255,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Thank you.

229
0:09:50.411,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Applause)

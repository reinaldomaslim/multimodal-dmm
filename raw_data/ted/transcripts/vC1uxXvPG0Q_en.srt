0:00:12.875,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Design is a slippery and elusive phenomenon,

2
0:00:15.921,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which has meant different things at different times.

3
0:00:19.206,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common:

4
0:00:23.498,000 --> 0:00:24,000
they began with a dream.

5
0:00:25.679,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And the bolder the dream,

6
0:00:27.141,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it.

7
0:00:30.806,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And this is why the greatest designers are almost always

8
0:00:34.724,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades.

9
0:00:38.787,000 --> 0:00:4,000
This has been the case throughout history,

10
0:00:41.594,000 --> 0:00:44,000
all the way back to the year 300 BC,

11
0:00:45.539,000 --> 0:00:48,000
when a 13-year-old became the king

12
0:00:48.682,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of a remote, very poor and very small Asian country.

13
0:00:53.475,000 --> 0:00:56,000
He dreamt of acquiring land, riches and power

14
0:00:56.984,000 --> 0:00:57,000
through military conquest.

15
0:00:58.675,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And his design skills --

16
0:01:00.082,000 --> 0:01:01,000
improbable though it sounds --

17
0:01:01.929,000 --> 0:01:04,000
would be essential in enabling him to do so.

18
0:01:05.605,000 --> 0:01:06,000
At the time,

19
0:01:06.779,000 --> 0:01:09,000
all weapons were made by hand to different specifications.

20
0:01:10.213,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle,

21
0:01:13.543,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they wouldn't necessarily be able to fire another archer's arrows

22
0:01:17.49,000 --> 0:01:18,000
from their bow.

23
0:01:19.362,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This of course meant that they would be less effective in combat

24
0:01:22.947,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and very vulnerable, too.

25
0:01:25.339,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Ying solved this problem

26
0:01:26.965,000 --> 0:01:3,000
by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically,

27
0:01:31.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so they were interchangeable.

28
0:01:32.835,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And he did the same for daggers, axes, spears, shields

29
0:01:36.861,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and every other form of weaponry.

30
0:01:40.002,000 --> 0:01:43,000
His formidably equipped army won batter after battle,

31
0:01:43.932,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and within 15 years,

32
0:01:45.746,000 --> 0:01:48,000
his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering

33
0:01:48.928,000 --> 0:01:5,000
all its larger, richer, more powerful neighbors,

34
0:01:51.777,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to found the mighty Chinese Empire.

35
0:01:55.041,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now, no one, of course,

36
0:01:56.594,000 --> 0:01:59,000
would have thought of describing Ying Zheng as a designer at the time --

37
0:02:00.396,000 --> 0:02:01,000
why would they?

38
0:02:01.628,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively

39
0:02:05.455,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but with tremendous ingenuity

40
0:02:07.439,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to achieve his ends.

41
0:02:09.631,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And so did another equally improbable, accidental designer,

42
0:02:14.195,000 --> 0:02:17,000
who was also not above using violence to get what he wanted.

43
0:02:18.376,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This was Edward Teach, better known as the British pirate, Blackbeard.

44
0:02:24.012,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This was the golden age of piracy,

45
0:02:26.301,000 --> 0:02:29,000
where pirates like Teach were terrorizing the high seas.

46
0:02:29.998,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Colonial trade was flourishing,

47
0:02:31.991,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and piracy was highly profitable.

48
0:02:34.276,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils,

49
0:02:39.139,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they needed to attack their enemies so brutally

50
0:02:43.79,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that they would surrender on sight.

51
0:02:45.607,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So in other words,

52
0:02:46.782,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they could take the ships without wasting ammunition,

53
0:02:49.352,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or incurring casualties.

54
0:02:51.417,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So Edward Teach redesigned himself as Blackbeard

55
0:02:55.106,000 --> 0:02:57,000
by playing the part of a merciless brute.

56
0:02:57.794,000 --> 0:03:01,000
He wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height.

57
0:03:01.843,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face.

58
0:03:05.362,000 --> 0:03:08,000
He slung braces of pistols on either shoulder.

59
0:03:08.933,000 --> 0:03:11,000
He even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight,

60
0:03:12.855,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack.

61
0:03:17.009,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And like many pirates of that era,

62
0:03:19.605,000 --> 0:03:21,000
he flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols

63
0:03:22.518,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones,

64
0:03:26.002,000 --> 0:03:31,000
because those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries,

65
0:03:31.717,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that their meaning was instantly recognizable,

66
0:03:34.603,000 --> 0:03:37,000
even in the lawless, illiterate world of the high seas:

67
0:03:38.167,000 --> 0:03:4,000
surrender or you'll suffer.

68
0:03:40.667,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So of course, all his sensible victims surrendered on sight.

69
0:03:44.646,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Put like that,

70
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it's easy to see why Edward Teach and his fellow pirates

71
0:03:50.699,000 --> 0:03:54,000
could be seen as pioneers of modern communications design,

72
0:03:55.198,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and why their deadly symbol --

73
0:03:57.146,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:58.232,000 --> 0:03:59,000
there's more --

75
0:03:59.407,000 --> 0:04:01,000
why their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones

76
0:04:02.416,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was a precursor of today's logos,

77
0:04:04.73,000 --> 0:04:07,000
rather like the big red letters standing behind me,

78
0:04:08.101,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but of course with a different message.

79
0:04:10.304,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:11.332,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Yet design was also used to nobler ends

81
0:04:14.366,000 --> 0:04:18,000
by an equally brilliant and equally improbable designer,

82
0:04:18.604,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the 19th-century British nurse, Florence Nightingale.

83
0:04:22.464,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone.

84
0:04:27.367,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Nightingale was born into a rather grand, very wealthy British family,

85
0:04:31.807,000 --> 0:04:35,000
who were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals

86
0:04:35.872,000 --> 0:04:36,000
during the Crimean War.

87
0:04:37.963,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Once there, she swiftly realized

88
0:04:40.316,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that more patients were dying of infections that they caught there,

89
0:04:43.953,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in the filthy, fetid wards,

90
0:04:45.945,000 --> 0:04:46,000
than they were of battle wounds.

91
0:04:47.722,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So she campaigned for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics

92
0:04:52.032,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to be designed and built.

93
0:04:54.389,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Back in Britain,

94
0:04:55.598,000 --> 0:04:56,000
she mounted another campaign,

95
0:04:57.112,000 --> 0:04:59,000
this time for civilian hospitals,

96
0:04:59.194,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them.

97
0:05:03.496,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The Nightingale ward, as it is called,

98
0:05:06.272,000 --> 0:05:09,000
dominated hospital design for decades to come,

99
0:05:09.976,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and elements of it are still used today.

100
0:05:13.834,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But by then,

101
0:05:15.113,000 --> 0:05:18,000
design was seen as a tool of the Industrial Age.

102
0:05:18.165,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It was formalized and professionalized,

103
0:05:20.915,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but it was restricted to specific roles

104
0:05:23.432,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals

105
0:05:26.534,000 --> 0:05:28,000
rather than being used intuitively,

106
0:05:28.833,000 --> 0:05:32,000
as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard and Ying Zheng had done.

107
0:05:33.412,000 --> 0:05:34,000
By the 20th century,

108
0:05:34.906,000 --> 0:05:37,000
this commercial ethos was so powerful,

109
0:05:37.943,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that any designers who deviated from it

110
0:05:40.491,000 --> 0:05:43,000
risked being seen as cranks or subversives.

111
0:05:44.538,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now among them is one of my great design heroes,

112
0:05:48.378,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.

113
0:05:50.93,000 --> 0:05:52,000
He was the Hungarian artist and designer

114
0:05:53.721,000 --> 0:05:57,000
whose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life

115
0:05:58.001,000 --> 0:05:59,000
were so powerful

116
0:05:59.191,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that they still influence the design of the digital images

117
0:06:02.515,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we see on our phone and computer screens.

118
0:06:05.658,000 --> 0:06:09,000
He radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany,

119
0:06:10.379,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him

120
0:06:13.15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
when he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later.

121
0:06:18.194,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Moholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever,

122
0:06:22.432,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but his approach to design was too experimental,

123
0:06:26.183,000 --> 0:06:29,000
as was his insistence on seeing it, as he put it,

124
0:06:29.691,000 --> 0:06:33,000
as an attitude, not a profession to be in tune with the times.

125
0:06:34.782,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And sadly, the same applied

126
0:06:36.659,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to another design maverick: Richard Buckminster Fuller.

127
0:06:41.167,000 --> 0:06:44,000
He was yet another brilliant design visionary

128
0:06:44.881,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and design activist,

129
0:06:46.322,000 --> 0:06:5,000
who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society

130
0:06:50.91,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in such a forward-thinking way

131
0:06:52.814,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism

132
0:06:56.178,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in design in the 1920s.

133
0:06:59.632,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Now he, despite his efforts,

134
0:07:02.109,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment,

135
0:07:06.866,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and admittedly,

136
0:07:08.058,000 --> 0:07:09,000
some of his experiments failed,

137
0:07:09.875,000 --> 0:07:11,000
like the flying car that never got off the ground.

138
0:07:12.893,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And yet, the geodesic dome,

139
0:07:14.965,000 --> 0:07:17,000
his design formula to build an emergency shelter

140
0:07:18.313,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from scraps of wood, metal, plastic,

141
0:07:21.018,000 --> 0:07:24,000
bits of tree, old blankets, plastic sheeting --

142
0:07:24.288,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just about anything that's available at the time --

143
0:07:27.059,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design,

144
0:07:30.654,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and has provided sorely needed refuge

145
0:07:33.341,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to many, many people in desperate circumstances

146
0:07:36.588,000 --> 0:07:37,000
ever since.

147
0:07:38.446,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers

148
0:07:42.508,000 --> 0:07:43,000
like Bucky and Moholy

149
0:07:44.384,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that drew me to design.

150
0:07:46.681,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent.

151
0:07:50.741,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs,

152
0:07:54.183,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields.

153
0:07:58.033,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But I picked design,

154
0:07:59.801,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal

155
0:08:03.533,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to improve our quality of life.

156
0:08:07.755,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.

157
0:08:10.357,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Applause)

158
0:08:12.045,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And greatly as I admire the achievements of professional designers,

159
0:08:16.477,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which have been extraordinary and immense,

160
0:08:19.096,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I also believe

161
0:08:20.581,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that design benefits hugely from the originality,

162
0:08:24.098,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the lateral thinking

163
0:08:25.44,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades.

164
0:08:29.683,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And we're living at a remarkable moment in design,

165
0:08:33.653,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together.

166
0:08:38.481,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Because even very basic advances in digital technology

167
0:08:42.796,000 --> 0:08:46,000
have enabled them to operate increasingly independently,

168
0:08:47.104,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in or out of a commercial context,

169
0:08:49.542,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives.

170
0:08:54.615,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So in theory,

171
0:08:56.285,000 --> 0:09:01,000
basic platforms like crowdfunding, cloud computing, social media

172
0:09:01.596,000 --> 0:09:04,000
are giving greater freedom to professional designers

173
0:09:05.064,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and giving more resources for the improvisational ones,

174
0:09:08.573,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and hopefully,

175
0:09:09.754,000 --> 0:09:11,000
a more receptive response to their ideas.

176
0:09:12.671,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now, some of my favorite examples of this are in Africa,

177
0:09:16.862,000 --> 0:09:18,000
where a new generation of designers

178
0:09:19.013,000 --> 0:09:22,000
are developing incredible Internet of Things technologies

179
0:09:22.582,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream of improving healthcare

180
0:09:27.21,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in countries where more people now have access to cell phones

181
0:09:30.782,000 --> 0:09:32,000
than to clean, running water.

182
0:09:32.991,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And among them is Arthur Zang.

183
0:09:35.642,000 --> 0:09:37,000
He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer

184
0:09:38.536,000 --> 0:09:42,000
who has a adapted a tablet computer into the Cardiopad,

185
0:09:42.705,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a mobile heart-monitoring device.

186
0:09:45.152,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote, rural areas.

187
0:09:49.517,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The data is then sent on a cellular network

188
0:09:52.187,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to well-equipped hospitals hundreds of miles away

189
0:09:55.241,000 --> 0:09:56,000
for analysis.

190
0:09:56.441,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And if any problems are spotted by the specialists there,

191
0:09:59.77,000 --> 0:10:02,000
a suitable course of treatment is recommended.

192
0:10:03.018,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And this of course saves many patients

193
0:10:05.353,000 --> 0:10:1,000
from making long, arduous, expensive and often pointless journeys

194
0:10:10.582,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to those hospitals,

195
0:10:11.924,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and makes it much, much likelier

196
0:10:14.227,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that their hearts will actually be checked.

197
0:10:17.298,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Arthur Zang started working on the Cardiopad eight years ago,

198
0:10:20.644,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in his final year at university.

199
0:10:23.391,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But he failed to persuade any conventional sources

200
0:10:26.83,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to give him investment to get the project off the ground.

201
0:10:30.281,000 --> 0:10:31,000
He posted the idea on Facebook,

202
0:10:32.178,000 --> 0:10:34,000
where a Cameroonian government official saw it

203
0:10:34.858,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and managed to secure a government grant for him.

204
0:10:38.119,000 --> 0:10:41,000
He's now developing not only the Cardiopad,

205
0:10:41.179,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but other mobile medical devices to treat different conditions.

206
0:10:45.831,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And he isn't alone,

207
0:10:47.501,000 --> 0:10:51,000
because there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers

208
0:10:52.448,000 --> 0:10:55,000
who are also pursuing extraordinary projects of their own.

209
0:10:56.364,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And I'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them.

210
0:10:59.934,000 --> 0:11:01,000
One is Peek Vision.

211
0:11:02.213,000 --> 0:11:05,000
This is a group of doctors and designers in Kenya,

212
0:11:05.312,000 --> 0:11:08,000
who've developed an Internet of Things technology of their own,

213
0:11:08.545,000 --> 0:11:1,000
as a portable eye examination kit.

214
0:11:11.639,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Then there's Gabriel Maher,

215
0:11:13.585,000 --> 0:11:15,000
who is developing a new design language

216
0:11:15.683,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities,

217
0:11:20.827,000 --> 0:11:22,000
without recourse to traditional stereotypes.

218
0:11:23.736,000 --> 0:11:27,000
All of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams,

219
0:11:28.027,000 --> 0:11:3,000
by the making the most of their newfound freedom,

220
0:11:30.677,000 --> 0:11:32,000
with the discipline of professional designers

221
0:11:33.599,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades.

222
0:11:36.525,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And we all stand to benefit.

223
0:11:38.611,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Thank you.

224
0:11:39.798,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Applause)

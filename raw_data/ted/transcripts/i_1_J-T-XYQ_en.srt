1
0:00:12.539,000 --> 0:00:18,000
greetings Ted community so good to see

2
0:00:15.43,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you welcome to the latest of our daily

3
0:00:18.91,000 --> 0:00:23,000
live conversations in these weird days

4
0:00:22.029,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of the virus good to have you with us

5
0:00:24.519,000 --> 0:00:29,000
whether you're getting isolated at home

6
0:00:27.609,000 --> 0:00:29,000
maybe with with a loved one or with

7
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
family

8
0:00:30.25,000 --> 0:00:35,000
maybe you're by yourself maybe you have

9
0:00:32.23,000 --> 0:00:37,000
symptoms our hearts go out to you maybe

10
0:00:35.89,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you've lost someone maybe you know

11
0:00:38.19,000 --> 0:00:43,000
medical workers on the front line and

12
0:00:40.78,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you're worried for them or maybe you

13
0:00:43.54,000 --> 0:00:47,000
think this whole thing as a pumped-up

14
0:00:45.969,000 --> 0:00:49,000
panic by the media whoever you are

15
0:00:48.28,000 --> 0:00:51,000
you're welcome here for for this next

16
0:00:50.559,000 --> 0:00:55,000
hour I think it's an important

17
0:00:52.239,000 --> 0:00:59,000
conversation you know every morning I I

18
0:00:56.129,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the first news headline I look at it's

19
0:00:59.71,000 --> 0:01:04,000
not a headline it's it's a graph there's

20
0:01:02.32,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a site war domitor dot info that has

21
0:01:05.259,000 --> 0:01:09,000
grass side I want to show you the the

22
0:01:06.85,000 --> 0:01:1,000
graph for that today here's it looks

23
0:01:09.369,000 --> 0:01:12,000
like I don't if you can do this I hope

24
0:01:11.44,000 --> 0:01:17,000
you like the super high-tech production

25
0:01:12.7,000 --> 0:01:19,000
values here by the way that is not a

26
0:01:18.25,000 --> 0:01:23,000
pretty graph that is what exponential

27
0:01:19.929,000 --> 0:01:25,000
growth looks like more than sixty

28
0:01:23.259,000 --> 0:01:3,000
thousand new cases outside China today

29
0:01:26.14,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and in the last two that you know that

30
0:01:30.58,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in the whole time in China this was

31
0:01:32.229,000 --> 0:01:34,000
raging

32
0:01:32.709,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they notched up about eighty thousand

33
0:01:34.75,000 --> 0:01:39,000
cases on the official numbers the world

34
0:01:38.41,000 --> 0:01:42,000
outside China in the last two days said

35
0:01:40.209,000 --> 0:01:47,000
one over a hundred thousand cases and

36
0:01:43.319,000 --> 0:01:49,000
u.s. is now number one the more the

37
0:01:47.56,000 --> 0:01:51,000
nation when this was supposed to go away

38
0:01:49.45,000 --> 0:01:52,000
pretty quickly now has more cases in

39
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
anywhere else in the loss of my

40
0:01:53.229,000 --> 0:01:59,000
eighty-five thousand and growing fast

41
0:01:54.7,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and New York where I'm sitting where the

42
0:01:59.319,000 --> 0:02:04,000
whole ten team is based is the epicenter

43
0:02:02.289,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in the US so it's a scary time to be

44
0:02:05.289,000 --> 0:02:08,000
here in New York there's some truly

45
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
horrible stories coming out of some of

46
0:02:08.679,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the hospitals that are in danger of

47
0:02:10.69,000 --> 0:02:16,000
getting overrun huge efforts being made

48
0:02:13.9,000 --> 0:02:18,000
there but and of course many other parts

49
0:02:17.17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of the world we've we've we've heard

50
0:02:19.27,000 --> 0:02:23,000
some of the darker

51
0:02:20.13,000 --> 0:02:26,000
boys that are out there so it's you know

52
0:02:23.52,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it's it's an alarming time I'd like

53
0:02:26.19,000 --> 0:02:29,000
anyone who looks at the numbers

54
0:02:27.51,000 --> 0:02:31,000
understands what exponential growth is

55
0:02:30.09,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it's an alarming time there'll be days

56
0:02:31.65,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in the coming couple weeks where sixty

57
0:02:34.83,000 --> 0:02:4,000
thousand new cases in a day will seem

58
0:02:36.63,000 --> 0:02:43,000
wonderfully good news and I wasn't going

59
0:02:41.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to go higher and and so I suspect we're

60
0:02:44.55,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in this for a long time to go basically

61
0:02:48.81,000 --> 0:02:52,000
for many of us just our lives completely

62
0:02:51.81,000 --> 0:02:54,000
different from what they normally are

63
0:02:53.07,000 --> 0:02:58,000
many of us isolated in some form or

64
0:02:55.47,000 --> 0:03:,000
other at home and in a way we're the

65
0:02:58.56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
lucky ones as others who can't afford to

66
0:03:00.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
do that we're having to go out the works

67
0:03:02.52,000 --> 0:03:06,000
somehow makes some kind of living and in

68
0:03:05.82,000 --> 0:03:1,000
doing so may feel that they're putting

69
0:03:07.23,000 --> 0:03:12,000
themselves at at risk though you know

70
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
these are hard our days and we're gonna

71
0:03:12.78,000 --> 0:03:17,000
have to get used to a bunch of new ways

72
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to be a new ways to connect with each

73
0:03:18.15,000 --> 0:03:21,000
other because we can't actually be

74
0:03:19.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
isolated we're human beings we're social

75
0:03:21.51,000 --> 0:03:26,000
species we have to connect with other

76
0:03:23.34,000 --> 0:03:28,000
people we just have to and thankfully

77
0:03:26.55,000 --> 0:03:29,000
there are many ways that it is still

78
0:03:28.62,000 --> 0:03:31,000
possible to do that many beautiful ways

79
0:03:30.39,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and ways that we're discovering and

80
0:03:31.83,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we're going to spend this hour devoted

81
0:03:33.84,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to that and thinking about that I like

82
0:03:36.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to invite on my car's Whitney Pennington

83
0:03:39.9,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Rogers that's currently fair's curator

84
0:03:42.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Whitney hello how are you I'm doing okay

85
0:03:47.04,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'm doing okay and I'm really looking

86
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:53,000
forward to hearing more about what

87
0:03:51.84,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you've shared just how we can and really

88
0:03:53.37,000 --> 0:03:57,000
stay connected which i think is so

89
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:58,000
important for us and so you know where

90
0:03:57.87,000 --> 0:04:,000
we're bringing you an interview today

91
0:03:59.34,000 --> 0:04:02,000
with Priya Parker she's the author of

92
0:04:01.11,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the art of gathering and her work really

93
0:04:03.209,000 --> 0:04:08,000
focuses on how we can develop and and

94
0:04:05.54,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and really sustain those meaningful

95
0:04:08.459,000 --> 0:04:12,000
connections and she's sharing some

96
0:04:10.86,000 --> 0:04:15,000
insight onto how we can continue to have

97
0:04:13.11,000 --> 0:04:18,000
gatherings that are intentional and add

98
0:04:16.739,000 --> 0:04:2,000
great value to our lives during the

99
0:04:18.57,000 --> 0:04:24,000
pandemic as Chris mentioned you know on

100
0:04:21.209,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the point of connection we had some

101
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:28,000
connectivity issues that would have made

102
0:04:26.94,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it really challenging for us to invite

103
0:04:29.58,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Priya to do this interview live so we

104
0:04:31.68,000 --> 0:04:34,000
pre-recorded it

105
0:04:33.54,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and you know we really are looking

106
0:04:35.19,000 --> 0:04:4,000
forward to seeing what you all share

107
0:04:38.07,000 --> 0:04:43,000
about your own experiences with creating

108
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
these connections and so we stopped took

109
0:04:43.41,000 --> 0:04:46,000
a lot of value from this and look

110
0:04:45.15,000 --> 0:04:49,000
forward to hearing what your thoughts

111
0:04:46.68,000 --> 0:04:52,000
are and hope that this is something that

112
0:04:49.89,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you enjoy listening to well thank you

113
0:04:52.74,000 --> 0:04:56,000
especially given the comp special

114
0:04:55.68,000 --> 0:04:58,000
accommodations you had to make thank you

115
0:04:56.88,000 --> 0:05:,000
so much for for making the time for this

116
0:04:58.71,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I you know I think especially about

117
0:05:00.93,000 --> 0:05:05,000
having as we're having a conversation

118
0:05:01.95,000 --> 0:05:08,000
about connection this feels somehow

119
0:05:05.94,000 --> 0:05:12,000
really really related and relevant it

120
0:05:09.81,000 --> 0:05:13,000
seems like it makes a lot of sense that

121
0:05:13.14,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you know we're talking about how we can

122
0:05:14.61,000 --> 0:05:19,000
have connections in these trying times

123
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and create creative ways to do that and

124
0:05:19.92,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I think Before we jump into this

125
0:05:21.6,000 --> 0:05:24,000
conversation a little bit more I'd love

126
0:05:23.49,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to just talk a little bit first about

127
0:05:24.87,000 --> 0:05:27,000
your own background so you are the

128
0:05:27.51,000 --> 0:05:3,000
author of a book called the art of

129
0:05:28.68,000 --> 0:05:32,000
gathering and you know you think a lot

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
about how we can have meaningful

131
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
connections create meaningful gatherings

132
0:05:36.06,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but you're not an event planner so I'd

133
0:05:38.55,000 --> 0:05:41,000
love to hear a little bit more about the

134
0:05:40.2,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the lens through which you approach

135
0:05:42.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
gathering sure so I'm a group conflict

136
0:05:47.52,000 --> 0:05:52,000
resolution facilitator I'm trained in

137
0:05:50.28,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the methodology of group dialogue so

138
0:05:52.83,000 --> 0:05:55,000
basically how do you bring together a

139
0:05:54.45,000 --> 0:05:58,000
group of people three or more though I'm

140
0:05:56.82,000 --> 0:06:,000
often doing it with 12 people or 40

141
0:05:58.89,000 --> 0:06:02,000
people or 300 people in a room and have

142
0:06:01.35,000 --> 0:06:04,000
meaningful conversation meaningful

143
0:06:03.42,000 --> 0:06:06,000
dialogue that actually creates a

144
0:06:05.13,000 --> 0:06:08,000
different outcome for that community

145
0:06:06.57,000 --> 0:06:1,000
based on how you structure the

146
0:06:08.13,000 --> 0:06:13,000
conversation and I wrote this book the

147
0:06:11.1,000 --> 0:06:16,000
art of gathering in part because I was

148
0:06:13.64,000 --> 0:06:18,000
frustrated by kind of what popular

149
0:06:17.07,000 --> 0:06:21,000
culture tells us about what creates

150
0:06:18.75,000 --> 0:06:22,000
magic between people which if you kind

151
0:06:21.27,000 --> 0:06:24,000
of boil it down very simply it's like if

152
0:06:23.01,000 --> 0:06:26,000
you get the things right if you get the

153
0:06:24.81,000 --> 0:06:28,000
fish knives right or if you get the food

154
0:06:26.88,000 --> 0:06:29,000
right or if you get the tablecloth right

155
0:06:28.95,000 --> 0:06:32,000
everything else will take care of itself

156
0:06:30.6,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that that magic will happen through

157
0:06:33.06,000 --> 0:06:36,000
people because of the luck of their

158
0:06:34.62,000 --> 0:06:38,000
chemistry and I know as a trained

159
0:06:36.96,000 --> 0:06:4,000
facilitator that that's just not true

160
0:06:39.45,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and going to gathering after gathering

161
0:06:41.58,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in all types of contexts at schools and

162
0:06:44.34,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the public square

163
0:06:46.169,000 --> 0:06:54,000
you know conferences birthday parties I

164
0:06:50.11,000 --> 0:06:56,000
would get really frustrated seeing hosts

165
0:06:54.729,000 --> 0:06:57,000
take a lot of time and a lot of care and

166
0:06:56.8,000 --> 0:07:,000
a lot of love pouring their time and

167
0:06:58.66,000 --> 0:07:03,000
energy into broadly stuff that doesn't

168
0:07:01.449,000 --> 0:07:06,000
really matter or at least doesn't

169
0:07:04.3,000 --> 0:07:08,000
actually make connection and intimacy

170
0:07:06.91,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and meaning and transformation among

171
0:07:08.86,000 --> 0:07:12,000
people it creates beauty but it doesn't

172
0:07:11.229,000 --> 0:07:16,000
necessarily create connection and I

173
0:07:13.63,000 --> 0:07:17,000
wanted to bring the facilitators lens to

174
0:07:16.63,000 --> 0:07:19,000
how anybody regardless of where you are

175
0:07:18.61,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you don't need a fancy house you don't

176
0:07:19.9,000 --> 0:07:23,000
need the right fish knives you don't

177
0:07:22.09,000 --> 0:07:27,000
need a specific you know computer

178
0:07:23.919,000 --> 0:07:29,000
program how anybody can create meaning

179
0:07:27.37,000 --> 0:07:31,000
with the people in their lives any and

180
0:07:30.46,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you know at work at home and their

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
community or in the public square that's

182
0:07:36.07,000 --> 0:07:39,000
great and it seems like you know that's

183
0:07:38.38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
something that now more than ever we

184
0:07:39.699,000 --> 0:07:42,000
need to be really thoughtful about that

185
0:07:41.289,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and I'm curious you know you started to

186
0:07:43.18,000 --> 0:07:46,000
talk about this a little bit about

187
0:07:44.71,000 --> 0:07:47,000
people really focusing more on visually

188
0:07:46.69,000 --> 0:07:51,000
what these gatherings look like I mean

189
0:07:48.669,000 --> 0:07:53,000
do you feel like collectively we really

190
0:07:52.3,000 --> 0:07:56,000
struggled with how to create meaningful

191
0:07:54.039,000 --> 0:08:,000
gatherings even before we got to this

192
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:08:03,000
moment with the coronavirus I think that

193
0:08:00.82,000 --> 0:08:06,000
many of our gatherings aren't up to

194
0:08:03.55,000 --> 0:08:08,000
snuff in terms of being memorable and

195
0:08:06.82,000 --> 0:08:1,000
transformative to the people in them and

196
0:08:09.19,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I think this is for a lot of different

197
0:08:11.38,000 --> 0:08:15,000
reasons I think one of the things that I

198
0:08:13.12,000 --> 0:08:18,000
studied worse were rituals that actually

199
0:08:15.789,000 --> 0:08:22,000
create transformation in people and and

200
0:08:18.99,000 --> 0:08:24,000
powerful rituals tend to be specific and

201
0:08:23.25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
specificity tends to come from sub

202
0:08:25.81,000 --> 0:08:31,000
communities so for example like 2

203
0:08:29.02,000 --> 0:08:34,000
million Romanian red thread tying

204
0:08:32.08,000 --> 0:08:36,000
ceremonies was a very specific ceremony

205
0:08:34.539,000 --> 0:08:37,000
from with them for a very specific

206
0:08:36.159,000 --> 0:08:4,000
community or javanese like tooth filing

207
0:08:38.349,000 --> 0:08:42,000
ceremonies where where there's a

208
0:08:40.3,000 --> 0:08:44,000
specific act and the people part of that

209
0:08:42.88,000 --> 0:08:46,000
gathering or part of that community

210
0:08:44.64,000 --> 0:08:48,000
understands like the symbolic act of

211
0:08:47.23,000 --> 0:08:51,000
each thing they worship the same God

212
0:08:49.51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they eat the same things they dress in

213
0:08:51.7,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the same way and as we've become

214
0:08:54.209,000 --> 0:08:58,000
globalized and diverse and and you know

215
0:08:57.79,000 --> 0:09:,000
modern in

216
0:08:58.66,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in a lot of different ways I would argue

217
0:09:00.82,000 --> 0:09:03,000
all good things

218
0:09:01.93,000 --> 0:09:05,000
many of our gatherings in part to try to

219
0:09:04.27,000 --> 0:09:08,000
not offend one another or assume that we

220
0:09:06.73,000 --> 0:09:1,000
share the same beliefs have become vague

221
0:09:08.62,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and diluted and so part of what we're

222
0:09:11.71,000 --> 0:09:17,000
struggling with even well before this

223
0:09:14.17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
with this pandemic is when people are

224
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:22,000
coming together to mark a specific

225
0:09:20.05,000 --> 0:09:26,000
occasion or to meet in a specific way we

226
0:09:23.65,000 --> 0:09:27,000
tend to under structure and under give

227
0:09:26.86,000 --> 0:09:28,000
less context and under host our

228
0:09:28.45,000 --> 0:09:31,000
gatherings in a way that actually

229
0:09:29.74,000 --> 0:09:36,000
creates meaning among people who don't

230
0:09:31.63,000 --> 0:09:39,000
all share the same beliefs that's great

231
0:09:37.51,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I mean and I think that it's now that we

232
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are in this moment and we're spending so

233
0:09:42.4,000 --> 0:09:46,000
much more time apart from one another

234
0:09:43.72,000 --> 0:09:48,000
physically it seems like you know

235
0:09:46.93,000 --> 0:09:5,000
thinking about how we can stay in touch

236
0:09:49.03,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and how we can stay connected in a

237
0:09:51.46,000 --> 0:09:56,000
meaningful way that that creates of

238
0:09:54.58,000 --> 0:09:59,000
course a new challenge but it sounds

239
0:09:56.77,000 --> 0:10:,000
like it's much more than just staying in

240
0:09:59.86,000 --> 0:10:02,000
touch with each other

241
0:10:00.88,000 --> 0:10:05,000
so I mean how should we change the lens

242
0:10:03.01,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of how we think about gatherings now

243
0:10:06.37,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that we are in this in this moment with

244
0:10:08.53,000 --> 0:10:15,000
this pandemic so we don't know how long

245
0:10:12.37,000 --> 0:10:17,000
this will last and and the biggest

246
0:10:15.73,000 --> 0:10:19,000
mistake we make whether you're gathering

247
0:10:18.07,000 --> 0:10:23,000
online or off is we tend to assume that

248
0:10:20.53,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the purpose is obvious we tend to assume

249
0:10:23.32,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that if you're having a work meeting

250
0:10:24.31,000 --> 0:10:28,000
it's to discuss work or if you're having

251
0:10:26.29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a birthday party it's to mark a birthday

252
0:10:28.9,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and in this time specifically the

253
0:10:33.01,000 --> 0:10:37,000
biggest way to actually create a

254
0:10:34.78,000 --> 0:10:38,000
meaningful gathering for your community

255
0:10:37.15,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is to first ask what is the need like

256
0:10:39.43,000 --> 0:10:42,000
what is the need for this specific

257
0:10:41.44,000 --> 0:10:44,000
community at this specific moment in

258
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:47,000
time and one of the things I've been

259
0:10:45.07,000 --> 0:10:48,000
watching is as as you know gathering

260
0:10:47.11,000 --> 0:10:51,000
after gathering is getting postponed or

261
0:10:48.64,000 --> 0:10:52,000
canceled the ones that are trying to

262
0:10:51.28,000 --> 0:10:58,000
figure out how to make they're off on

263
0:10:53.59,000 --> 0:11:,000
offline Gathering online need to pause

264
0:10:59.11,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and actually ask given this new reality

265
0:11:01.48,000 --> 0:11:05,000
what is the need my community now needs

266
0:11:04.03,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and not assume that the gathering online

267
0:11:06.46,000 --> 0:11:1,000
should look exactly the same way as it

268
0:11:08.589,000 --> 0:11:11,000
did offline just sticking a video camera

269
0:11:10.69,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in front of one another

270
0:11:12.32,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I knew you know if you're a teacher and

271
0:11:15.23,000 --> 0:11:19,000
you're trying to figure out how to teach

272
0:11:16.67,000 --> 0:11:2,000
a course that is you know you have

273
0:11:19.52,000 --> 0:11:23,000
always taught with people physically

274
0:11:21.44,000 --> 0:11:25,000
your students physically in the room to

275
0:11:24.29,000 --> 0:11:29,000
actually pause and not say is my purpose

276
0:11:26.42,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to teach math perhaps your the purpose

277
0:11:29.57,000 --> 0:11:34,000
now for the next multiple weeks is to

278
0:11:32.21,000 --> 0:11:36,000
give confidence to your children to your

279
0:11:34.91,000 --> 0:11:38,000
students to keep trying through the

280
0:11:36.8,000 --> 0:11:4,000
mechanism of math I mean I'm kind of

281
0:11:39.53,000 --> 0:11:43,000
making this up here but part of what the

282
0:11:41.78,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the key of all of these gatherings is

283
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
we're coming together to make them

284
0:11:45.29,000 --> 0:11:49,000
meaningful is to actually pause and to

285
0:11:47.69,000 --> 0:11:5,000
not assume we know what the need is or

286
0:11:49.37,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we know what the purpose is and to begin

287
0:11:51.29,000 --> 0:11:55,000
by asking first for the specific

288
0:11:53.75,000 --> 0:11:56,000
community for my family or my friends or

289
0:11:55.67,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for my cousins or for my group of

290
0:11:57.71,000 --> 0:12:04,000
activists or for my board members or for

291
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
my neighbors this week this day what is

292
0:12:04.82,000 --> 0:12:07,000
it that we most need and how might we

293
0:12:06.47,000 --> 0:12:1,000
gather around that or for some people

294
0:12:08.72,000 --> 0:12:11,000
who are getting zoomed out you know zoom

295
0:12:10.61,000 --> 0:12:13,000
caught resumed call after zoom call the

296
0:12:12.47,000 --> 0:12:15,000
need might actually be to cancel a

297
0:12:13.94,000 --> 0:12:2,000
gathering so I'm not saying gather more

298
0:12:16.22,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I'm saying gather better and it seems

299
0:12:21.65,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that doing that also would be different

300
0:12:23.93,000 --> 0:12:29,000
for those people who maybe we're living

301
0:12:27.32,000 --> 0:12:31,000
with or you know are isolating with and

302
0:12:29.99,000 --> 0:12:33,000
those who are not actually physically

303
0:12:31.73,000 --> 0:12:35,000
spending time with so I guess how should

304
0:12:34.91,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we think about those connections

305
0:12:36.35,000 --> 0:12:42,000
differently yeah it's a great question

306
0:12:39.41,000 --> 0:12:45,000
so you know most many of us are

307
0:12:43.03,000 --> 0:12:48,000
isolating with family members or

308
0:12:45.47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
roommates or partners some of us are

309
0:12:48.35,000 --> 0:12:53,000
alone and most of us are also finding

310
0:12:51.2,000 --> 0:12:55,000
ways to be connected with those were not

311
0:12:53.54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
with so I'll sirs first start with the

312
0:12:55.37,000 --> 0:13:,000
communities that we're that you're if

313
0:12:56.96,000 --> 0:13:,000
you're isolating within which is a

314
0:13:00.5,000 --> 0:13:03,000
couple of things you know in conflict

315
0:13:01.76,000 --> 0:13:04,000
resolution one of the first one of the

316
0:13:03.68,000 --> 0:13:06,000
first things you do as a as a

317
0:13:05.24,000 --> 0:13:09,000
facilitator is is create ground rules

318
0:13:07.58,000 --> 0:13:11,000
you know I think of as EA's every

319
0:13:09.8,000 --> 0:13:14,000
gathering as an opportunity for an

320
0:13:11.87,000 --> 0:13:16,000
interruption and we right now are in the

321
0:13:14.839,000 --> 0:13:18,000
greatest moment of global interruption

322
0:13:17.21,000 --> 0:13:21,000
we faced in a long time and one of the

323
0:13:19.67,000 --> 0:13:22,000
opportunities for an interruption that

324
0:13:21.32,000 --> 0:13:25,000
this allows is when for those that

325
0:13:23.51,000 --> 0:13:26,000
you're you know quarantine

326
0:13:26.06,000 --> 0:13:29,000
whether they're the people you normally

327
0:13:27.379,000 --> 0:13:31,000
live with regularly live with or whether

328
0:13:29.72,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that you have you're an adult and you've

329
0:13:31.55,000 --> 0:13:36,000
gone home to your you know your adult

330
0:13:34.399,000 --> 0:13:38,000
parents and you're renegotiating what it

331
0:13:37.519,000 --> 0:13:39,000
actually looks like to live together

332
0:13:38.899,000 --> 0:13:41,000
during this period when you weren't

333
0:13:40.31,000 --> 0:13:44,000
expecting it is to actually first pause

334
0:13:42.68,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and let's create some ground rules you

335
0:13:44.689,000 --> 0:13:47,000
don't have to call it that but for some

336
0:13:46.879,000 --> 0:13:48,000
ground rules they say how do we want to

337
0:13:48.41,000 --> 0:13:51,000
live together how do we want to be

338
0:13:49.85,000 --> 0:13:52,000
together do we want to have specific

339
0:13:51.699,000 --> 0:13:55,000
evenings a week where we come together

340
0:13:53.629,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and we have dinner and are the rest of

341
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the week we're on our own how do we want

342
0:13:57.589,000 --> 0:14:,000
to actually share food and to not assume

343
0:13:59.839,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that you kind of have to be together the

344
0:14:01.31,000 --> 0:14:06,000
whole time all the time but to actually

345
0:14:03.079,000 --> 0:14:08,000
have clear honest conversations to

346
0:14:06.56,000 --> 0:14:11,000
navigate both physical and psychological

347
0:14:08.509,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and interconnected space together and

348
0:14:11.81,000 --> 0:14:15,000
then and then once you've done that I

349
0:14:13.819,000 --> 0:14:17,000
think the the second thing around those

350
0:14:16.759,000 --> 0:14:19,000
who are isolating and creating

351
0:14:18.439,000 --> 0:14:22,000
meaningful gatherings together at home

352
0:14:19.91,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is to really think about you know there

353
0:14:22.569,000 --> 0:14:26,000
there's this in my in my book I talk

354
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
about the Passover principle which is

355
0:14:26.72,000 --> 0:14:29,000
the first question I'm not Jewish but

356
0:14:28.449,000 --> 0:14:32,000
studied many different types of

357
0:14:30.29,000 --> 0:14:35,000
gatherings in my research and one of the

358
0:14:32.48,000 --> 0:14:37,000
questions that that the Jews ask during

359
0:14:35.839,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Passover Seder the first question is

360
0:14:37.85,000 --> 0:14:42,000
roughly translated as how is this night

361
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
different than all other nights and I

362
0:14:43.25,000 --> 0:14:47,000
think that that is a question that is so

363
0:14:45.11,000 --> 0:14:48,000
powerful and is applicable to every

364
0:14:47.42,000 --> 0:14:5,000
gathering you've ever hosted

365
0:14:48.86,000 --> 0:14:51,000
so as you're home with your family or

366
0:14:51.29,000 --> 0:14:54,000
with your friends or with your partner

367
0:14:52.189,000 --> 0:14:56,000
to begin to ask how do you begin to mark

368
0:14:54.74,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the days so that they don't all blend in

369
0:14:56.809,000 --> 0:14:59,000
with each other you know what is Tuesday

370
0:14:59.029,000 --> 0:15:02,000
evening how do you want to come together

371
0:15:00.199,000 --> 0:15:06,000
could you you know set up a list of

372
0:15:02.6,000 --> 0:15:07,000
questions of questions you would never

373
0:15:06.589,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you know typically ask one another at a

374
0:15:08.3,000 --> 0:15:12,000
normal evening but how do you actually

375
0:15:10.91,000 --> 0:15:13,000
come together and answer the you know

376
0:15:12.98,000 --> 0:15:17,000
thirty four questions to fall in love

377
0:15:14.42,000 --> 0:15:2,000
with anybody questions or or find a way

378
0:15:18.5,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to have conversations with your parents

379
0:15:20.629,000 --> 0:15:25,000
or with your grandparents that that

380
0:15:22.399,000 --> 0:15:26,000
normal times don't allow for and then to

381
0:15:25.73,000 --> 0:15:28,000
your second point around how do we

382
0:15:27.319,000 --> 0:15:34,000
create meaning or connection with those

383
0:15:28.91,000 --> 0:15:36,000
who with whom or not with there are you

384
0:15:34.61,000 --> 0:15:38,000
know melot's sort of the same question

385
0:15:37.61,000 --> 0:15:4,000
which is map out your community

386
0:15:39.11,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and ask what is what do they need and

387
0:15:41.029,000 --> 0:15:46,000
what do you need and in some cases it

388
0:15:43.94,000 --> 0:15:47,000
might be just a simple kind of passive

389
0:15:46.37,000 --> 0:15:5,000
experiencing something together through

390
0:15:48.31,000 --> 0:15:52,000
connecting and kind of sync watching

391
0:15:50.66,000 --> 0:15:54,000
something so like the Metropolitan Opera

392
0:15:52.79,000 --> 0:15:56,000
every night is doing live streams of

393
0:15:55.43,000 --> 0:16:,000
their operas around you know online

394
0:15:57.519,000 --> 0:16:01,000
there's many types of cultural and art

395
0:16:00.95,000 --> 0:16:03,000
institutions that are actually making

396
0:16:02.24,000 --> 0:16:06,000
free a lot of their content and so at

397
0:16:04.49,000 --> 0:16:07,000
kind of a low participation rate but

398
0:16:07.19,000 --> 0:16:09,000
just kind of wanting to do something

399
0:16:08.36,000 --> 0:16:11,000
together the equivalent of going to

400
0:16:09.86,000 --> 0:16:13,000
watch the movies you can actually sync

401
0:16:11.72,000 --> 0:16:15,000
watch these things together at a higher

402
0:16:14.48,000 --> 0:16:18,000
level of engagement one of the forms of

403
0:16:16.37,000 --> 0:16:2,000
meaning-making is to actually think

404
0:16:19.19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
about what are the conversations or how

405
0:16:21.35,000 --> 0:16:25,000
do you want to engage with one another

406
0:16:22.67,000 --> 0:16:28,000
through either a shared activity or or

407
0:16:26.06,000 --> 0:16:33,000
or sharing activity over this course of

408
0:16:29.06,000 --> 0:16:35,000
time I went in 2012 Bruce Springsteen

409
0:16:33.68,000 --> 0:16:36,000
gave this amazing talk at South by

410
0:16:35.24,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Southwest where he basically kind of

411
0:16:37.31,000 --> 0:16:43,000
gave his a musical autobiography so like

412
0:16:41.42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
the songs that most shaped him as a

413
0:16:43.459,000 --> 0:16:46,000
seven year old as a 13 year old as a 19

414
0:16:45.62,000 --> 0:16:48,000
year old as a 23 year old it's one of

415
0:16:47.36,000 --> 0:16:49,000
the most amazing speeches you can ever

416
0:16:48.769,000 --> 0:16:52,000
read and you can you can look it online

417
0:16:50.089,000 --> 0:16:55,000
actually this is like what a nerd I am I

418
0:16:53.06,000 --> 0:16:57,000
like read through the speech and then

419
0:16:55.13,000 --> 0:16:58,000
just played the song on each song and

420
0:16:57.14,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Spotify to kind of like have the

421
0:16:58.73,000 --> 0:17:02,000
experience and I was telling this to a

422
0:17:01.519,000 --> 0:17:04,000
friend and he said why don't we do that

423
0:17:02.99,000 --> 0:17:07,000
as a circle of friends

424
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
over a series of dinners we you know in

425
0:17:08.209,000 --> 0:17:11,000
my case is a group of friends who know

426
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
each other pretty well and we can kind

427
0:17:11.63,000 --> 0:17:15,000
of get into the same rut when we hang

428
0:17:13.459,000 --> 0:17:17,000
out it's great but it was a sort of this

429
0:17:16.22,000 --> 0:17:19,000
idea of an interruption in the way that

430
0:17:17.99,000 --> 0:17:2,000
how do we actually have a different kind

431
0:17:19.309,000 --> 0:17:24,000
of conversation and so we made up the

432
0:17:21.439,000 --> 0:17:27,000
rules and we called it seven songs and

433
0:17:24.35,000 --> 0:17:29,000
the invitation was that each friend each

434
0:17:27.679,000 --> 0:17:32,000
person gets one evening one dinner one

435
0:17:30.14,000 --> 0:17:35,000
salon where they come and they bring the

436
0:17:33.169,000 --> 0:17:36,000
seven songs that most shaped them over

437
0:17:35.15,000 --> 0:17:38,000
the course of their life their their

438
0:17:36.559,000 --> 0:17:4,000
full life and the rest of us would agree

439
0:17:38.84,000 --> 0:17:42,000
to kind of listen to them and also to

440
0:17:40.76,000 --> 0:17:45,000
the songs and there's no reason you

441
0:17:43.28,000 --> 0:17:47,000
couldn't do that virtually and so when I

442
0:17:45.77,000 --> 0:17:48,000
say create meaning together you know

443
0:17:47.54,000 --> 0:17:51,000
meaning is created through specificity

444
0:17:49.76,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and structure and

445
0:17:52.49,000 --> 0:17:56,000
a specific purpose and so in this moment

446
0:17:54.92,000 --> 0:17:57,000
a time when we're not sure how long will

447
0:17:56.69,000 --> 0:17:59,000
be social distancing or at least

448
0:17:58.04,000 --> 0:18:03,000
physically distancing to find really

449
0:18:00.14,000 --> 0:18:05,000
interesting forms of interruptions among

450
0:18:03.5,000 --> 0:18:06,000
friends and families to say how do we

451
0:18:05.6,000 --> 0:18:09,000
actually want to use this time together

452
0:18:07.22,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and to have perhaps conversations that

453
0:18:09.77,000 --> 0:18:15,000
we typically wouldn't have in this kind

454
0:18:11.96,000 --> 0:18:17,000
of different moment well I love that I

455
0:18:16.46,000 --> 0:18:19,000
love how it seems like there's so many

456
0:18:18.11,000 --> 0:18:21,000
ways that we can take the events that we

457
0:18:20.059,000 --> 0:18:23,000
already have there are the ways that

458
0:18:21.62,000 --> 0:18:25,000
we've already been connecting and I

459
0:18:23.78,000 --> 0:18:27,000
really just modify them and adapt them

460
0:18:25.67,000 --> 0:18:3,000
to this situation that we're living in

461
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
so one thing I'm curious about you you

462
0:18:30.92,000 --> 0:18:33,000
sort of mention this at the beginning of

463
0:18:32.36,000 --> 0:18:35,000
your response and thinking about the

464
0:18:34.37,000 --> 0:18:37,000
ground rules um I'd love to talk a

465
0:18:36.32,000 --> 0:18:38,000
little bit too about you know what might

466
0:18:38.12,000 --> 0:18:4,000
some of those ground rules look like

467
0:18:39.29,000 --> 0:18:43,000
when we're thinking about how we're

468
0:18:40.67,000 --> 0:18:45,000
connecting and gathering with folks you

469
0:18:43.52,000 --> 0:18:46,000
know as you mentioned in some cases

470
0:18:45.679,000 --> 0:18:49,000
where maybe you're isolating together

471
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
but maybe that whole living experience

472
0:18:49.91,000 --> 0:18:53,000
is different that if you're maybe an

473
0:18:52.309,000 --> 0:18:55,000
adult child who's moving home you know

474
0:18:54.59,000 --> 0:18:58,000
what is what does that look like how do

475
0:18:56.24,000 --> 0:19:,000
you have create those ground rules so

476
0:18:59.03,000 --> 0:19:02,000
that you can connect to meaningfully

477
0:19:00.95,000 --> 0:19:03,000
gather meaningfully in a space that

478
0:19:02.48,000 --> 0:19:09,000
maybe is very different from what your

479
0:19:04.55,000 --> 0:19:12,000
living situation was like before ground

480
0:19:10.04,000 --> 0:19:15,000
rules help us create a common social

481
0:19:13.13,000 --> 0:19:18,000
contract to be able to enjoy each other

482
0:19:16.01,000 --> 0:19:21,000
so the first thing is people often think

483
0:19:18.5,000 --> 0:19:23,000
like little rules but actually there are

484
0:19:21.77,000 --> 0:19:25,000
implicit norms that were sort of

485
0:19:23.51,000 --> 0:19:27,000
navigating implicitly around each other

486
0:19:25.97,000 --> 0:19:3,000
and often fights come up because our

487
0:19:28.22,000 --> 0:19:33,000
norms clash or expectations clash and so

488
0:19:31.21,000 --> 0:19:36,000
before even having a conversation around

489
0:19:33.47,000 --> 0:19:38,000
sort of ground rules to answer questions

490
0:19:36.53,000 --> 0:19:41,000
together like how do we want to think

491
0:19:39.2,000 --> 0:19:44,000
about who uses what space when and

492
0:19:42.17,000 --> 0:19:46,000
depending on the physical infrastructure

493
0:19:44.48,000 --> 0:19:48,000
of your house that might be rotating

494
0:19:47.059,000 --> 0:19:51,000
through there might be one room and one

495
0:19:48.89,000 --> 0:19:52,000
office and then six different people

496
0:19:51.59,000 --> 0:19:55,000
wanting to use it it might be who gets

497
0:19:53.51,000 --> 0:19:59,000
to use the kitchen at different times so

498
0:19:56.059,000 --> 0:20:02,000
so norms around physical space asking

499
0:19:59.51,000 --> 0:20:03,000
questions around are there times where

500
0:20:02.51,000 --> 0:20:05,000
we would like to actually like how much

501
0:20:04.25,000 --> 0:20:08,000
together time do each want or need

502
0:20:06.41,000 --> 0:20:1,000
how much like a part time do we each

503
0:20:08.81,000 --> 0:20:11,000
want or need I know that in some

504
0:20:11.06,000 --> 0:20:13,000
families and extended families there's

505
0:20:12.71,000 --> 0:20:14,000
sort of this norm that when you come

506
0:20:13.94,000 --> 0:20:16,000
together whether it's Thanksgiving or

507
0:20:15.62,000 --> 0:20:18,000
whether it's you know Easter or Passover

508
0:20:17.29,000 --> 0:20:2,000
there's a sense that well we're never

509
0:20:19.34,000 --> 0:20:22,000
actually together so you kind of do

510
0:20:20.93,000 --> 0:20:23,000
everything together all day long right

511
0:20:22.73,000 --> 0:20:27,000
you eat every meal together you can and

512
0:20:24.22,000 --> 0:20:29,000
yeah it's easy to kind of get fall back

513
0:20:27.74,000 --> 0:20:31,000
into the routine of what it's like when

514
0:20:29.9,000 --> 0:20:33,000
you suddenly go home but this time is

515
0:20:32.24,000 --> 0:20:36,000
very different than that and so part of

516
0:20:34.88,000 --> 0:20:36,000
this is sort of zooming back and

517
0:20:36.32,000 --> 0:20:4,000
particularly with adult children within

518
0:20:37.73,000 --> 0:20:42,000
their parents to begin to ask what are

519
0:20:41.18,000 --> 0:20:44,000
all of our individual and connecting

520
0:20:42.8,000 --> 0:20:46,000
collective needs and then how do we

521
0:20:44.63,000 --> 0:20:48,000
begin to navigate navigate an orient

522
0:20:46.97,000 --> 0:20:51,000
around this around this this moment

523
0:20:49.57,000 --> 0:20:55,000
other types of conversations to ask to

524
0:20:52.49,000 --> 0:20:57,000
have potential years financially are we

525
0:20:55.85,000 --> 0:20:58,000
sharing costs around certain things how

526
0:20:58.04,000 --> 0:21:02,000
do we think about if somebody wants to

527
0:20:59.57,000 --> 0:21:03,000
spend money on something that's shared

528
0:21:02.09,000 --> 0:21:05,000
and somebody else's want to have it like

529
0:21:03.74,000 --> 0:21:07,000
how do we want to think about that

530
0:21:05.63,000 --> 0:21:1,000
what are you know rules around

531
0:21:08.39,000 --> 0:21:12,000
quarantine you know this is also this is

532
0:21:11,000 --> 0:21:14,000
an inherently relational disease right

533
0:21:13.22,000 --> 0:21:17,000
that's what a pandemic is and so what

534
0:21:14.93,000 --> 0:21:21,000
are the rules around which we agree to

535
0:21:17.93,000 --> 0:21:25,000
enter or exit or procure food and and to

536
0:21:22.07,000 --> 0:21:27,000
basically you know relationships many of

537
0:21:26.03,000 --> 0:21:29,000
us are being put into a situation that

538
0:21:27.35,000 --> 0:21:32,000
we weren't expecting and one of the best

539
0:21:29.66,000 --> 0:21:33,000
ways again to begin to navigate that and

540
0:21:32.42,000 --> 0:21:35,000
not just have it be a defensive time but

541
0:21:34.43,000 --> 0:21:37,000
a generative time or a creative time

542
0:21:36.29,000 --> 0:21:39,000
with those with whom you're sharing

543
0:21:37.43,000 --> 0:21:41,000
space is to talk about it early and

544
0:21:39.32,000 --> 0:21:43,000
often and begin to hear about what are

545
0:21:41.75,000 --> 0:21:44,000
again what our individual needs what our

546
0:21:43.37,000 --> 0:21:5,000
collective needs and you can also make

547
0:21:44.84,000 --> 0:21:54,000
it fun but this is you know living

548
0:21:50.69,000 --> 0:21:57,000
together creates a context in which it's

549
0:21:54.95,000 --> 0:21:59,000
better to talk about how you want to

550
0:21:57.74,000 --> 0:22:01,000
navigate it first and and not just kind

551
0:22:00.11,000 --> 0:22:02,000
of the hygiene of it but also then how

552
0:22:01.94,000 --> 0:22:03,000
do we want to actually come together

553
0:22:03.08,000 --> 0:22:08,000
during this time and use it differently

554
0:22:04.52,000 --> 0:22:09,000
I love that and I mean I guess also in

555
0:22:08.75,000 --> 0:22:11,000
thinking about it from the work

556
0:22:09.92,000 --> 0:22:13,000
perspective you talked about you know

557
0:22:11.87,000 --> 0:22:14,000
not getting zoomed out but maybe it's

558
0:22:14.36,000 --> 0:22:16,000
the reverse it sounds like where you

559
0:22:15.56,000 --> 0:22:18,000
might come from a space where you're

560
0:22:17.09,000 --> 0:22:19,000
constantly seeing your co-workers in

561
0:22:19.13,000 --> 0:22:22,000
person

562
0:22:19.52,000 --> 0:22:24,000
day to day for those people who are

563
0:22:22.22,000 --> 0:22:27,000
working remotely now and the dynamic of

564
0:22:25.01,000 --> 0:22:29,000
how you gather in those situations also

565
0:22:27.23,000 --> 0:22:32,000
seem like they might change and benefit

566
0:22:29.42,000 --> 0:22:33,000
from some rules around what those

567
0:22:32.54,000 --> 0:22:35,000
gatherings look like you know I guess

568
0:22:34.37,000 --> 0:22:38,000
what are some unique things that you

569
0:22:35.93,000 --> 0:22:4,000
think people might face in their work

570
0:22:38.42,000 --> 0:22:44,000
lives as a result of social distancing

571
0:22:41.21,000 --> 0:22:46,000
when it comes to gathering absolutely I

572
0:22:44.9,000 --> 0:22:48,000
think it raises an entire new set of

573
0:22:46.82,000 --> 0:22:5,000
questions I mean to be clear there have

574
0:22:49.52,000 --> 0:22:52,000
been MIT there are many global companies

575
0:22:51.38,000 --> 0:22:54,000
that have already been distributed have

576
0:22:53.21,000 --> 0:22:58,000
been doing distributing distributive

577
0:22:55.13,000 --> 0:23:01,000
teaming for for you know decades the

578
0:22:59,000 --> 0:23:05,000
disabled community has very interesting

579
0:23:01.97,000 --> 0:23:05,000
and has long been advocating for you

580
0:23:05.06,000 --> 0:23:08,000
know simple things like live-streaming

581
0:23:06.68,000 --> 0:23:1,000
let alone thinking about digital

582
0:23:08.33,000 --> 0:23:13,000
participatory ways of coming together so

583
0:23:11.24,000 --> 0:23:17,000
this is not new for everybody and it's

584
0:23:13.67,000 --> 0:23:18,000
new and this scale for most of us and I

585
0:23:17.57,000 --> 0:23:21,000
think some of the things that these that

586
0:23:19.22,000 --> 0:23:23,000
that you know the sort of the first week

587
0:23:21.68,000 --> 0:23:26,000
or at least in the u.s. contacts but you

588
0:23:23.51,000 --> 0:23:29,000
know the cycles of weeks is it's putting

589
0:23:27.35,000 --> 0:23:32,000
us in a situation where all of a sudden

590
0:23:29.75,000 --> 0:23:37,000
questions of intimacy come up so for

591
0:23:32.78,000 --> 0:23:39,000
example for many of us were where we're

592
0:23:37.79,000 --> 0:23:41,000
showing sides of ourselves this this is

593
0:23:40.13,000 --> 0:23:46,000
an example of that that we wouldn't

594
0:23:42.47,000 --> 0:23:48,000
normally share and in a work context

595
0:23:47.12,000 --> 0:23:5,000
that could be that could be meaning

596
0:23:48.89,000 --> 0:23:5,000
having your colleagues see your kitchen

597
0:23:50.27,000 --> 0:23:53,000
or that could be having your colleagues

598
0:23:51.62,000 --> 0:23:54,000
see your child or your dog or whatever

599
0:23:53.6,000 --> 0:23:56,000
it is that typically you would actually

600
0:23:55.25,000 --> 0:23:59,000
in a work context have the power to

601
0:23:57.2,000 --> 0:24:01,000
choose to show and so I think the

602
0:23:59.33,000 --> 0:24:03,000
questions of intimacy are ones that are

603
0:24:01.34,000 --> 0:24:05,000
going to come up and I and you know

604
0:24:03.44,000 --> 0:24:06,000
intimacy for intimacy sake particularly

605
0:24:05.57,000 --> 0:24:08,000
in a power context isn't necessarily a

606
0:24:07.37,000 --> 0:24:1,000
good thing

607
0:24:08.57,000 --> 0:24:12,000
but within within a conscious set up

608
0:24:10.85,000 --> 0:24:13,000
intimacy to actually bring people into

609
0:24:12.89,000 --> 0:24:15,000
this moment together and not pretend

610
0:24:14.54,000 --> 0:24:18,000
that it this isn't strange is also

611
0:24:16.52,000 --> 0:24:2,000
helpful so for example questions that

612
0:24:19.4,000 --> 0:24:22,000
team leaders and people hosting calls

613
0:24:21.08,000 --> 0:24:24,000
should think about is do you purposely

614
0:24:22.85,000 --> 0:24:25,000
want to have people actually just have a

615
0:24:24.62,000 --> 0:24:29,000
white background in the back as a

616
0:24:26.42,000 --> 0:24:32,000
relative equaliser or do you want to

617
0:24:30.53,000 --> 0:24:32,000
purposely invite people to put the

618
0:24:32.69,000 --> 0:24:34,000
camera and

619
0:24:33.38,000 --> 0:24:37,000
of a part of their home that is

620
0:24:34.94,000 --> 0:24:38,000
meaningful to them and one isn't right

621
0:24:38.09,000 --> 0:24:41,000
or wrong but just to be really

622
0:24:39.71,000 --> 0:24:41,000
thoughtful about what are you asking

623
0:24:41.15,000 --> 0:24:44,000
people to share and what are you asking

624
0:24:42.5,000 --> 0:24:47,000
people to hide or allowing them to keep

625
0:24:44.48,000 --> 0:24:48,000
for themselves we have different spaces

626
0:24:47.539,000 --> 0:24:5,000
for different reasons and that's a good

627
0:24:48.86,000 --> 0:24:51,000
thing and so part of what's happening in

628
0:24:51.11,000 --> 0:24:54,000
this moment is when you're allowing

629
0:24:52.37,000 --> 0:24:56,000
because the technology that we have is

630
0:24:54.289,000 --> 0:24:58,000
is penetrating into spaces that usually

631
0:24:57.02,000 --> 0:25:02,000
we have more choice whether or not we

632
0:24:58.61,000 --> 0:25:03,000
want to share and so it sounds like a

633
0:25:02.48,000 --> 0:25:05,000
big part of that it's just it's really

634
0:25:04.19,000 --> 0:25:07,000
just having those conversations with

635
0:25:05.99,000 --> 0:25:11,000
each other about what makes the most

636
0:25:07.76,000 --> 0:25:13,000
sense for that particular group that and

637
0:25:12.35,000 --> 0:25:15,000
I think the host and particularly the

638
0:25:13.76,000 --> 0:25:17,000
person who has power in the context you

639
0:25:15.89,000 --> 0:25:19,000
know to really think about what is the

640
0:25:17.929,000 --> 0:25:21,000
purpose of this gathering who needs to

641
0:25:20.299,000 --> 0:25:23,000
be there and what is the need that we're

642
0:25:22.52,000 --> 0:25:25,000
trying to fulfill and how do I

643
0:25:23.929,000 --> 0:25:28,000
temporarily equalize people so the role

644
0:25:26.179,000 --> 0:25:3,000
of a host I believe has has you have

645
0:25:29.27,000 --> 0:25:32,000
three roles as a host the first is to

646
0:25:31.1,000 --> 0:25:34,000
connect people to the purpose of the

647
0:25:32.9,000 --> 0:25:36,000
meeting and to each other

648
0:25:34.549,000 --> 0:25:38,000
the second is to protect them from each

649
0:25:36.95,000 --> 0:25:4,000
other and the third is to temporarily

650
0:25:39.23,000 --> 0:25:43,000
equalize them and in some context

651
0:25:41.809,000 --> 0:25:44,000
temporarily equalizing people might mean

652
0:25:43.61,000 --> 0:25:46,000
showing your background and in other

653
0:25:45.32,000 --> 0:25:48,000
context temporarily equalizing them

654
0:25:47.059,000 --> 0:25:51,000
means don't show the background because

655
0:25:48.98,000 --> 0:25:53,000
of the stark difference or imbalance

656
0:25:51.23,000 --> 0:25:56,000
between the people in the room and I

657
0:25:54.11,000 --> 0:25:58,000
think part of like the responsibility to

658
0:25:56.9,000 --> 0:26:,000
host the gathering should not fall

659
0:25:58.429,000 --> 0:26:03,000
equally across the spectrum of power and

660
0:26:01.73,000 --> 0:26:04,000
so a boss should really think about what

661
0:26:03.74,000 --> 0:26:06,000
is needed and how do I set my people up

662
0:26:05.6,000 --> 0:26:09,000
so that they're so that they're able to

663
0:26:07.36,000 --> 0:26:11,000
focus on the need at hand you know I'll

664
0:26:10.19,000 --> 0:26:13,000
take one more second and just say I

665
0:26:11.96,000 --> 0:26:15,000
think another question that's coming up

666
0:26:13.34,000 --> 0:26:16,000
quite often is when do you cancel when

667
0:26:15.98,000 --> 0:26:2,000
do you postpone and when do you just

668
0:26:17.27,000 --> 0:26:23,000
bring it on zoom' and again for a host

669
0:26:21.35,000 --> 0:26:24,000
to say for the person who's really

670
0:26:24.08,000 --> 0:26:28,000
thinking about the need of the community

671
0:26:25.22,000 --> 0:26:3,000
to say well what is it that is essential

672
0:26:28.34,000 --> 0:26:31,000
in this moment in time and who needs to

673
0:26:30.409,000 --> 0:26:33,000
be a part of that and to not assume that

674
0:26:32.179,000 --> 0:26:37,000
every person has to be part of every

675
0:26:33.74,000 --> 0:26:38,000
zoom meeting but also to not assume that

676
0:26:37.299,000 --> 0:26:41,000
that everything that you were going to

677
0:26:39.559,000 --> 0:26:42,000
do anyway still needs to happen there

678
0:26:41.69,000 --> 0:26:44,000
was a there was a I think it became a

679
0:26:43.34,000 --> 0:26:46,000
New Yorker cartoon but a joke going

680
0:26:45.29,000 --> 0:26:48,000
around that said something like

681
0:26:47,000 --> 0:26:5,000
I guess that I guess that work meeting

682
0:26:48.92,000 --> 0:26:52,000
really could have just been put in an

683
0:26:50.42,000 --> 0:26:54,000
email so there will be some gatherings

684
0:26:53.21,000 --> 0:26:56,000
that are canceled and like we will be

685
0:26:54.95,000 --> 0:26:57,000
better for it and then there will all be

686
0:26:56.99,000 --> 0:27:01,000
other gatherings that are invented and

687
0:26:58.46,000 --> 0:27:04,000
we will be better for it I love that and

688
0:27:02,000 --> 0:27:06,000
I just love how there is this is such a

689
0:27:04.58,000 --> 0:27:07,000
creative poem and it sounds like and and

690
0:27:06.35,000 --> 0:27:09,000
I'm curious I mean you already shared

691
0:27:07.94,000 --> 0:27:11,000
some examples of ways that you can turn

692
0:27:10.1,000 --> 0:27:14,000
some of the meetings and gatherings that

693
0:27:12.41,000 --> 0:27:16,000
you've already had and sort of adapt

694
0:27:14.81,000 --> 0:27:18,000
them to this moment but I'd love to hear

695
0:27:16.55,000 --> 0:27:2,000
- you know what are some I guess unique

696
0:27:18.98,000 --> 0:27:21,000
ways that you think really it just

697
0:27:20.99,000 --> 0:27:23,000
applies to the moment we're living in

698
0:27:22.7,000 --> 0:27:27,000
that this is the kind of gathering that

699
0:27:24.56,000 --> 0:27:29,000
only can happen as we're all you know

700
0:27:28.22,000 --> 0:27:33,000
spending so much time apart as we're all

701
0:27:29.9,000 --> 0:27:34,000
connecting virtually or however whatever

702
0:27:33.29,000 --> 0:27:37,000
the circumstance is you know what what

703
0:27:35.57,000 --> 0:27:43,000
our gatherings that feel really unique

704
0:27:37.76,000 --> 0:27:45,000
to this moment um one of the ones that

705
0:27:44.45,000 --> 0:27:49,000
I've been watching that's been written

706
0:27:46.07,000 --> 0:27:54,000
about a lot is a DJ called d-nice last

707
0:27:49.85,000 --> 0:27:55,000
Wednesday he started basically like

708
0:27:54.38,000 --> 0:27:58,000
DJing sets from 6:00 p.m. to midnight

709
0:27:56.51,000 --> 0:28:02,000
six hours at a time Eastern Standard

710
0:27:58.76,000 --> 0:28:03,000
Time and Friday night and Friday night a

711
0:28:02.81,000 --> 0:28:07,000
number of kind of famous artists joined

712
0:28:04.52,000 --> 0:28:09,000
to you know joined the party and then

713
0:28:08.15,000 --> 0:28:11,000
Saturday night it just kind of took off

714
0:28:10.16,000 --> 0:28:13,000
in this in this kind of electric way

715
0:28:12.11,000 --> 0:28:17,000
over a hundred thousand people joined

716
0:28:14,000 --> 0:28:2,000
through Instagram Live and at some point

717
0:28:17.71,000 --> 0:28:22,000
like people from all around the world

718
0:28:20.66,000 --> 0:28:24,000
but also a lot of political leaders in

719
0:28:22.88,000 --> 0:28:25,000
the u.s. like kind of joined and came in

720
0:28:24.83,000 --> 0:28:27,000
came out Bernie Sanders came in

721
0:28:26.3,000 --> 0:28:32,000
Elizabeth Warren made a cameo Michelle

722
0:28:28.25,000 --> 0:28:34,000
Obama came in and and you know that kind

723
0:28:32.72,000 --> 0:28:36,000
of collective moment of people all

724
0:28:34.97,000 --> 0:28:38,000
dancing in their own like living room

725
0:28:37.55,000 --> 0:28:41,000
wherever they are but being able to come

726
0:28:39.89,000 --> 0:28:45,000
into a virtual Club you know it reminded

727
0:28:42.53,000 --> 0:28:48,000
me of studio 54 Andy Warhol was was once

728
0:28:46.4,000 --> 0:28:52,000
asked about his like red in the red rope

729
0:28:48.85,000 --> 0:28:53,000
and why he like referred to like that

730
0:28:53.03,000 --> 0:28:57,000
the you know it was like a dictatorship

731
0:28:54.8,000 --> 0:28:59,000
to get in like no one could get in and

732
0:28:57.86,000 --> 0:29:,000
he is he said it's a dictatorship at the

733
0:29:00.5,000 --> 0:29:02,000
door

734
0:29:00.94,000 --> 0:29:08,000
so we can have a democracy on the dance

735
0:29:03.28,000 --> 0:29:11,000
floor and Dean Isis like experiment to

736
0:29:09.82,000 --> 0:29:14,000
me was that except it didn't need to be

737
0:29:12.16,000 --> 0:29:16,000
a dictatorship at the door and I think

738
0:29:15.37,000 --> 0:29:18,000
that is unique to this time it was a

739
0:29:17.05,000 --> 0:29:21,000
democracy at the door and it was a

740
0:29:18.79,000 --> 0:29:22,000
democracy on the dance floor and I think

741
0:29:21.16,000 --> 0:29:25,000
people are experimenting in all sorts of

742
0:29:23.35,000 --> 0:29:28,000
ways of how they can meaningfully gather

743
0:29:25.62,000 --> 0:29:3,000
there's there's a work context which a

744
0:29:28.78,000 --> 0:29:33,000
lot of people I think most of us have

745
0:29:31.24,000 --> 0:29:36,000
lost unexpected forms of income by

746
0:29:34.24,000 --> 0:29:38,000
actually having to not you know be able

747
0:29:36.73,000 --> 0:29:39,000
to provide a service in person that's

748
0:29:38.59,000 --> 0:29:41,000
particularly true of in-person gathering

749
0:29:40.6,000 --> 0:29:44,000
based businesses like restaurants or

750
0:29:42.43,000 --> 0:29:48,000
in-person speed-dating companies you

751
0:29:45.37,000 --> 0:29:51,000
know yoga instructors all types of

752
0:29:49.12,000 --> 0:29:54,000
people who rely on in-person connections

753
0:29:51.37,000 --> 0:29:56,000
to to you know for their livelihood and

754
0:29:55.06,000 --> 0:29:59,000
I think one one thing that you're seeing

755
0:29:57.01,000 --> 0:30:,000
is people who kind of always in the back

756
0:29:59.44,000 --> 0:30:02,000
of their head thought yeah I should

757
0:30:00.82,000 --> 0:30:03,000
probably have you know Instagram live

758
0:30:02.98,000 --> 0:30:06,000
sessions I should probably figure out

759
0:30:04.57,000 --> 0:30:09,000
how to do this online this is kind of a

760
0:30:07.72,000 --> 0:30:12,000
forcing mechanism to do that and you can

761
0:30:10.27,000 --> 0:30:15,000
see every day experiments with from

762
0:30:13.27,000 --> 0:30:19,000
dance studios like forward forward

763
0:30:15.94,000 --> 0:30:22,000
spaces to you know

764
0:30:19.57,000 --> 0:30:25,000
virtual choirs rehearsing I think

765
0:30:22.96,000 --> 0:30:27,000
they're called the sofa singers you know

766
0:30:26.2,000 --> 0:30:3,000
every every week once a week on Sundays

767
0:30:28.69,000 --> 0:30:31,000
there's there Casper Turk you'll is

768
0:30:30.46,000 --> 0:30:34,000
having something called Sunday

769
0:30:31.99,000 --> 0:30:35,000
sing-alongs the resistent revival chorus

770
0:30:34.6,000 --> 0:30:38,000
is doing is also experimenting with how

771
0:30:36.76,000 --> 0:30:39,000
can they also have you know chorus

772
0:30:39.01,000 --> 0:30:42,000
rehearsals choir rehearsals but also

773
0:30:40.54,000 --> 0:30:43,000
have others participate people are

774
0:30:42.4,000 --> 0:30:44,000
trying a lot of radical experiments

775
0:30:43.96,000 --> 0:30:46,000
around how do you actually be together

776
0:30:45.37,000 --> 0:30:5,000
apart and how do we use these

777
0:30:47.62,000 --> 0:30:52,000
technologies to do it I had a friend who

778
0:30:50.41,000 --> 0:30:54,000
texted me a picture of she threw a

779
0:30:52.84,000 --> 0:30:58,000
surprise birthday party for her mother

780
0:30:55.06,000 --> 0:31:,000
over unzoom and to me it was also you

781
0:30:58.9,000 --> 0:31:,000
know we're experimenting how to get

782
0:31:00.37,000 --> 0:31:03,000
online in part this is an

783
0:31:01.84,000 --> 0:31:04,000
intergenerational experiment

784
0:31:03.76,000 --> 0:31:07,000
so in that case most of her mother's

785
0:31:05.74,000 --> 0:31:09,000
friends weren't on zoom' and so part of

786
0:31:07.99,000 --> 0:31:11,000
the act of love was her having to go and

787
0:31:1,000 --> 0:31:13,000
like getting each friend and texting

788
0:31:12.19,000 --> 0:31:15,000
them and explain them how to down

789
0:31:13.46,000 --> 0:31:17,000
the app and then getting online and then

790
0:31:15.529,000 --> 0:31:19,000
having her mother's partner say hey

791
0:31:17.99,000 --> 0:31:2,000
honey you know come walk over here in

792
0:31:19.7,000 --> 0:31:21,000
the laptop I think there's a show I

793
0:31:21.23,000 --> 0:31:23,000
think you might want to watch and she

794
0:31:22.46,000 --> 0:31:24,000
walks over and then he you know opens up

795
0:31:23.96,000 --> 0:31:25,000
the screen and every all of her friends

796
0:31:25.429,000 --> 0:31:29,000
are sitting there on these tiny little

797
0:31:26.63,000 --> 0:31:31,000
squares saying surprise and so I think

798
0:31:30.08,000 --> 0:31:35,000
we're experimenting around how do we

799
0:31:32.45,000 --> 0:31:36,000
actually be together apart in a moment

800
0:31:35.179,000 --> 0:31:38,000
where we have some of the technology

801
0:31:36.919,000 --> 0:31:38,000
that other generations couldn't have

802
0:31:38.21,000 --> 0:31:42,000
imagined but we haven't necessarily

803
0:31:39.679,000 --> 0:31:44,000
thought about using it in this way hmm

804
0:31:43,000 --> 0:31:47,000
that's that's great I mean and I think

805
0:31:45.35,000 --> 0:31:49,000
that that makes me wonder too just what

806
0:31:47.99,000 --> 0:31:5,000
does this mean for the future you know

807
0:31:49.429,000 --> 0:31:52,000
when we come out of this do you think

808
0:31:51.62,000 --> 0:31:54,000
that this there's going to be a real

809
0:31:53.27,000 --> 0:32:,000
shift in the way we think about how we

810
0:31:55.429,000 --> 0:32:03,000
gather I hope so I think that there will

811
0:32:00.559,000 --> 0:32:05,000
be some gatherings that will go by the

812
0:32:03.83,000 --> 0:32:07,000
wayside I think some some work meetings

813
0:32:06.2,000 --> 0:32:11,000
that are cancelled that nobody misses

814
0:32:08.059,000 --> 0:32:13,000
and but we're kind of too weak so we

815
0:32:11.51,000 --> 0:32:14,000
were too weak to end before or for

816
0:32:13.64,000 --> 0:32:16,000
political reasons we'll go and no one

817
0:32:15.38,000 --> 0:32:19,000
will mention them again and we will be

818
0:32:17.299,000 --> 0:32:22,000
better for it I think that there will be

819
0:32:19.7,000 --> 0:32:23,000
certain gatherings that will be

820
0:32:22.76,000 --> 0:32:25,000
preserved or come back you know kind of

821
0:32:24.59,000 --> 0:32:28,000
in full force because we realized how

822
0:32:26.48,000 --> 0:32:3,000
much we value those gatherings there was

823
0:32:29.45,000 --> 0:32:33,000
a beautiful piece a couple of days ago

824
0:32:31.37,000 --> 0:32:35,000
it I think it was a video that went

825
0:32:34.25,000 --> 0:32:37,000
viral online

826
0:32:36.22,000 --> 0:32:4,000
and then I believe the New York Times

827
0:32:38.21,000 --> 0:32:41,000
wrote about it of the Irish week and

828
0:32:40.429,000 --> 0:32:44,000
there's certain you know there are

829
0:32:41.929,000 --> 0:32:45,000
certain communities that already have as

830
0:32:45.02,000 --> 0:32:49,000
I said at the beginning of this call

831
0:32:46.899,000 --> 0:32:5,000
deeply powerful embedded rituals and

832
0:32:49.94,000 --> 0:32:52,000
specific sub communities and there are

833
0:32:51.62,000 --> 0:32:54,000
certain there are certain communities

834
0:32:53.149,000 --> 0:32:58,000
that actually are very sophisticated

835
0:32:55.12,000 --> 0:32:59,000
collective gatherers and and the Irish

836
0:32:58.25,000 --> 0:33:01,000
wake is you know is one of those

837
0:33:00.02,000 --> 0:33:03,000
examples of people actually coming

838
0:33:01.52,000 --> 0:33:05,000
physically together people marking

839
0:33:03.77,000 --> 0:33:07,000
marking death and also remembering and

840
0:33:06.289,000 --> 0:33:1,000
singing songs together and and and you

841
0:33:08.299,000 --> 0:33:14,000
know actually gathering around the wake

842
0:33:11.27,000 --> 0:33:17,000
and in a moment where because of

843
0:33:14.659,000 --> 0:33:18,000
physical distancing that's no longer you

844
0:33:17.299,000 --> 0:33:22,000
know possible one family created this

845
0:33:19.279,000 --> 0:33:24,000
this ritual this idea that as they drove

846
0:33:22.49,000 --> 0:33:24,000
their their mother's body to the

847
0:33:24.35,000 --> 0:33:27,000
graveyard

848
0:33:25.37,000 --> 0:33:3,000
neighbors came out and stood six feet

849
0:33:27.89,000 --> 0:33:32,000
apart to basically pay their respects

850
0:33:30.74,000 --> 0:33:35,000
and I think that's a you know it's an

851
0:33:33.74,000 --> 0:33:39,000
exist a beautiful example of a temporary

852
0:33:36.7,000 --> 0:33:41,000
invention of how do we remember and how

853
0:33:40.37,000 --> 0:33:44,000
do we think about honoring because the

854
0:33:42.08,000 --> 0:33:46,000
the the desire and the need is so deep

855
0:33:44.57,000 --> 0:33:49,000
that even if we can't do it in the way

856
0:33:46.91,000 --> 0:33:52,000
that we usually do it we can actually

857
0:33:49.58,000 --> 0:33:54,000
invent ways that still allow for that

858
0:33:52.99,000 --> 0:33:57,000
collective witnessing and marking and

859
0:33:55.309,000 --> 0:34:,000
holding to happen and then I think that

860
0:33:58.25,000 --> 0:34:02,000
after I think a big change after this

861
0:34:00.62,000 --> 0:34:04,000
this period this pandemic is our

862
0:34:02.6,000 --> 0:34:07,000
assumption of what we can do virtually

863
0:34:04.9,000 --> 0:34:09,000
and and what what do we actually crave

864
0:34:08.51,000 --> 0:34:12,000
to be together and want to do together

865
0:34:10.399,000 --> 0:34:14,000
and then what actually is okay to do

866
0:34:12.95,000 --> 0:34:16,000
apart and I think will become much more

867
0:34:14.629,000 --> 0:34:18,000
sophisticated and using tools that have

868
0:34:17,000 --> 0:34:21,000
you know that are that are popping up in

869
0:34:18.71,000 --> 0:34:22,000
all sorts of context digital tools to be

870
0:34:21.169,000 --> 0:34:24,000
able to do certain things apart and then

871
0:34:22.94,000 --> 0:34:27,000
I think we will also be very very

872
0:34:24.71,000 --> 0:34:29,000
grateful to be back together again well

873
0:34:28.34,000 --> 0:34:32,000
it's really nice I mean because you

874
0:34:29.81,000 --> 0:34:35,000
don't sound fearful I I guess that this

875
0:34:33.23,000 --> 0:34:37,000
moment is going to ruin the way that we

876
0:34:35.84,000 --> 0:34:38,000
stay connected it sounds like you you

877
0:34:37.34,000 --> 0:34:4,000
have a really optimistic approach to

878
0:34:39.5,000 --> 0:34:43,000
this and that in many ways it sounds

879
0:34:41.21,000 --> 0:34:47,000
like it might be a good thing that we're

880
0:34:43.76,000 --> 0:34:47,000
kind of going through this I wouldn't

881
0:34:47.389,000 --> 0:34:5,000
say it's a good thing that we're going

882
0:34:48.44,000 --> 0:34:55,000
through this I think that this is a yes

883
0:34:51.2,000 --> 0:34:57,000
in a global crisis I think that I and I

884
0:34:56.21,000 --> 0:34:59,000
think that like any pandemic this will

885
0:34:58.19,000 --> 0:35:01,000
this affects different communities

886
0:35:00.08,000 --> 0:35:05,000
differently I think that this is very

887
0:35:02.15,000 --> 0:35:08,000
dangerous for for communities that are

888
0:35:05.6,000 --> 0:35:1,000
already isolated I think that this will

889
0:35:08.9,000 --> 0:35:13,000
exacerbate social and economic

890
0:35:10.75,000 --> 0:35:17,000
inequality as it already is and I think

891
0:35:14.87,000 --> 0:35:17,000
you know I there's been a discussion you

892
0:35:17.9,000 --> 0:35:2,000
know we are we are in a gathering

893
0:35:18.83,000 --> 0:35:21,000
recession and I think the question is

894
0:35:20.93,000 --> 0:35:24,000
whether or not we can stave off the

895
0:35:22.58,000 --> 0:35:26,000
loneliness boom if we can do things that

896
0:35:25.25,000 --> 0:35:31,000
allow us that even during this time a

897
0:35:27.02,000 --> 0:35:34,000
very dire straits if we can find

898
0:35:31.67,000 --> 0:35:36,000
inventive ways to still to still get

899
0:35:34.67,000 --> 0:35:37,000
through this together and I think in any

900
0:35:37.31,000 --> 0:35:39,000
I think

901
0:35:38.31,000 --> 0:35:41,000
a massive interruption and anytime

902
0:35:40.14,000 --> 0:35:44,000
there's a massive interruption it allows

903
0:35:42.18,000 --> 0:35:46,000
all of us to pause and to ask the

904
0:35:44.82,000 --> 0:35:48,000
questions well why do we do this in the

905
0:35:46.68,000 --> 0:35:5,000
first place and I think that's powerful

906
0:35:49.49,000 --> 0:35:52,000
thank you and thank you for clarifying

907
0:35:51.51,000 --> 0:35:55,000
of course I agree that I don't think

908
0:35:53.19,000 --> 0:35:58,000
this is a good thing but I instead meant

909
0:35:56.07,000 --> 0:36:,000
an opportunity it seems like it presents

910
0:35:58.35,000 --> 0:36:04,000
an opportunity for us to to reflect and

911
0:36:00.9,000 --> 0:36:06,000
that seems to be a positive element of

912
0:36:04.71,000 --> 0:36:09,000
this so thank you for that and you know

913
0:36:07.56,000 --> 0:36:12,000
I think I'd like I'll just also oh go

914
0:36:10.14,000 --> 0:36:15,000
ahead Priya sorry I'll just say one more

915
0:36:12.66,000 --> 0:36:16,000
thing I think um the way we gather is

916
0:36:16.01,000 --> 0:36:22,000
contagious

917
0:36:17.25,000 --> 0:36:24,000
meaning we define how and what we gather

918
0:36:22.17,000 --> 0:36:26,000
around if somebody all of a sudden

919
0:36:24.75,000 --> 0:36:27,000
decides to have a birthday party in a

920
0:36:26.4,000 --> 0:36:29,000
very different way not only is it kind

921
0:36:28.56,000 --> 0:36:31,000
of fun and interesting for the people in

922
0:36:30.21,000 --> 0:36:34,000
that birthday party but every guest

923
0:36:32.1,000 --> 0:36:36,000
leaves thinking huh maybe I could do my

924
0:36:34.68,000 --> 0:36:37,000
birthday party a different way or huh

925
0:36:36.45,000 --> 0:36:39,000
maybe a few no doesn't have to look that

926
0:36:38.4,000 --> 0:36:42,000
way or huh maybe a meeting doesn't have

927
0:36:40.2,000 --> 0:36:44,000
to look that way and you know one of the

928
0:36:42.96,000 --> 0:36:46,000
things that's contagious during this

929
0:36:44.55,000 --> 0:36:49,000
time also is its courage and one of the

930
0:36:47.88,000 --> 0:36:5,000
reasons I love collecting all of these

931
0:36:49.59,000 --> 0:36:52,000
different stories and inventions of how

932
0:36:51.45,000 --> 0:36:55,000
people are coming together and being

933
0:36:52.83,000 --> 0:36:57,000
extraordinarily creative about it is is

934
0:36:55.86,000 --> 0:36:59,000
in part to give each other ideas and

935
0:36:57.96,000 --> 0:37:01,000
inspiration and one of the things I

936
0:37:00.6,000 --> 0:37:04,000
would I would ask if you know those who

937
0:37:02.49,000 --> 0:37:06,000
are watching to send me the examples

938
0:37:04.98,000 --> 0:37:06,000
that you're seeing and particularly the

939
0:37:06.51,000 --> 0:37:1,000
examples that you're creating yourself

940
0:37:07.71,000 --> 0:37:11,000
because it actually gives us us hope and

941
0:37:10.62,000 --> 0:37:15,000
ideas of how we can all do this

942
0:37:12.15,000 --> 0:37:17,000
differently I actually send out a weekly

943
0:37:15.96,000 --> 0:37:18,000
newsletter of examples from around the

944
0:37:18.09,000 --> 0:37:22,000
world of how we're actually gathering

945
0:37:19.62,000 --> 0:37:23,000
together apart and and you know I don't

946
0:37:22.86,000 --> 0:37:25,000
know if the you know if you can its

947
0:37:24.21,000 --> 0:37:28,000
Priya Parker calm if you want to send me

948
0:37:26.43,000 --> 0:37:29,000
emails or examples of gathering ideas

949
0:37:28.8,000 --> 0:37:32,000
that you've been seeing that I've been

950
0:37:30.03,000 --> 0:37:35,000
that have been moving because we all

951
0:37:33.17,000 --> 0:37:37,000
decide how we want to gather and we

952
0:37:35.88,000 --> 0:37:4,000
inspire each other by trying to do it

953
0:37:37.62,000 --> 0:37:41,000
differently that's great skree and that

954
0:37:40.98,000 --> 0:37:43,000
sounds like you know thinking about

955
0:37:42.36,000 --> 0:37:45,000
resources folks might look for if they

956
0:37:44.79,000 --> 0:37:46,000
just you know decide they want to try

957
0:37:46.05,000 --> 0:37:49,000
and implement some of these examples you

958
0:37:47.61,000 --> 0:37:49,000
shared or some of the things you've

959
0:37:49.26,000 --> 0:37:52,000
suggested

960
0:37:50.4,000 --> 0:37:54,000
that seems like that's a great way for

961
0:37:52.26,000 --> 0:37:56,000
them to to do some of that so thank you

962
0:37:54.599,000 --> 0:37:59,000
you know I'd love to we had some

963
0:37:57.24,000 --> 0:38:02,000
audience members who sent in questions

964
0:37:59.91,000 --> 0:38:03,000
in advance to aspirin so I'd love to

965
0:38:02.94,000 --> 0:38:06,000
dive into a few of those which I think

966
0:38:04.44,000 --> 0:38:09,000
might be really interesting so one

967
0:38:07.799,000 --> 0:38:11,000
question from our audience was what tips

968
0:38:10.079,000 --> 0:38:14,000
would you offer to meaningfully engage

969
0:38:12,000 --> 0:38:16,000
with family or friends who can't access

970
0:38:14.25,000 --> 0:38:18,000
vigils that virtual spaces excuse me

971
0:38:16.47,000 --> 0:38:2,000
like grandparents those who might have

972
0:38:18.75,000 --> 0:38:23,000
disabilities or impairments or those who

973
0:38:21.329,000 --> 0:38:25,000
just may not have connectivity strong

974
0:38:23.789,000 --> 0:38:26,000
connectivity issues in terms of internet

975
0:38:25.47,000 --> 0:38:28,000
and phone

976
0:38:26.849,000 --> 0:38:33,000
how could you stay connected with those

977
0:38:28.47,000 --> 0:38:36,000
those folks it's a beautiful question a

978
0:38:34.49,000 --> 0:38:39,000
couple of things one is if they have a

979
0:38:36.66,000 --> 0:38:42,000
phone line and that's a big if but if

980
0:38:39.75,000 --> 0:38:45,000
they have a phone line a landline ways

981
0:38:42.69,000 --> 0:38:47,000
to one regularly call and create some

982
0:38:45.839,000 --> 0:38:49,000
kind of moment that they look forward to

983
0:38:48.24,000 --> 0:38:52,000
there are other types of rituals from

984
0:38:50.76,000 --> 0:38:54,000
other communities I've been told that

985
0:38:52.829,000 --> 0:38:56,000
German theater groups have a practice

986
0:38:55.529,000 --> 0:39:01,000
where they come together and read a book

987
0:38:57.27,000 --> 0:39:01,000
aloud like one book aloud until they're

988
0:39:01.589,000 --> 0:39:03,000
done with it

989
0:39:02.25,000 --> 0:39:06,000
so like over the course of 15 hours

990
0:39:04.19,000 --> 0:39:07,000
communities come together and one person

991
0:39:06.779,000 --> 0:39:09,000
reads a chapter and you pass it around

992
0:39:08.13,000 --> 0:39:11,000
and you eat and you you know drink and

993
0:39:10.289,000 --> 0:39:15,000
you can and you basically read an entire

994
0:39:11.579,000 --> 0:39:18,000
book together and you know somebody you

995
0:39:15.51,000 --> 0:39:2,000
can absolutely do that by like dialing

996
0:39:18.63,000 --> 0:39:22,000
and the person who's who's who can't

997
0:39:20.73,000 --> 0:39:26,000
necessarily zoom in but to read together

998
0:39:23.52,000 --> 0:39:27,000
on the phone if you if four communities

999
0:39:27.21,000 --> 0:39:32,000
are for people who are completely

1000
0:39:28.41,000 --> 0:39:34,000
isolated digitally or through technology

1001
0:39:32.24,000 --> 0:39:37,000
to find ways at least for the time being

1002
0:39:35.099,000 --> 0:39:39,000
to you know to send them to send them

1003
0:39:37.89,000 --> 0:39:4,000
letters like one of the things we're

1004
0:39:39.27,000 --> 0:39:43,000
starting to see is to go back to things

1005
0:39:41.64,000 --> 0:39:46,000
like why we why we knit why we make

1006
0:39:44.099,000 --> 0:39:49,000
bread why we learn to create the things

1007
0:39:46.89,000 --> 0:39:51,000
that we do without the help from you

1008
0:39:49.14,000 --> 0:39:55,000
know the outside world and to find ways

1009
0:39:52.23,000 --> 0:39:59,000
to to perhaps pass objects or passed

1010
0:39:55.38,000 --> 0:40:01,000
letters but for those who you know if

1011
0:39:59.64,000 --> 0:40:02,000
there's no way in and no way out I think

1012
0:40:01.47,000 --> 0:40:03,000
that's one of the communities that I was

1013
0:40:02.789,000 --> 0:40:07,000
talking about that's actually

1014
0:40:04.23,000 --> 0:40:09,000
you know that's a very high risk so

1015
0:40:08.34,000 --> 0:40:12,000
another really great question we had was

1016
0:40:09.63,000 --> 0:40:14,000
how can you get a sense for the feel the

1017
0:40:13.02,000 --> 0:40:17,000
energy in the room when we're not

1018
0:40:14.91,000 --> 0:40:18,000
physically in the same space what are

1019
0:40:17.16,000 --> 0:40:22,000
some ways that we can recreate that

1020
0:40:19.83,000 --> 0:40:26,000
those connections and that bond when

1021
0:40:23.07,000 --> 0:40:3,000
we're connecting from apart this is one

1022
0:40:27.66,000 --> 0:40:32,000
of the harder parts about being apart

1023
0:40:30.109,000 --> 0:40:36,000
because we have to at some level created

1024
0:40:33.359,000 --> 0:40:37,000
in our mind psychologically together and

1025
0:40:36.33,000 --> 0:40:39,000
then also create that physical feeling

1026
0:40:38.16,000 --> 0:40:41,000
you know with one's own body without

1027
0:40:40.26,000 --> 0:40:44,000
actually sharing space with others

1028
0:40:42.03,000 --> 0:40:47,000
around the room so a couple of tips the

1029
0:40:44.55,000 --> 0:40:49,000
first is give your gathering a name and

1030
0:40:47.66,000 --> 0:40:51,000
you know don't just call it meeting or

1031
0:40:49.98,000 --> 0:40:53,000
don't just call it birthday party you

1032
0:40:52.56,000 --> 0:40:57,000
know call or dinner party call it the

1033
0:40:54.81,000 --> 0:41:01,000
worn out mom's hootenanny or call it the

1034
0:40:58.26,000 --> 0:41:06,000
seventh song salon or call it the you

1035
0:41:02.7,000 --> 0:41:08,000
know dance until you drop disco I mean

1036
0:41:06.9,000 --> 0:41:1,000
again I'm making this up but but part of

1037
0:41:09.57,000 --> 0:41:13,000
what names do is that they're acts of

1038
0:41:11.67,000 --> 0:41:15,000
social priming to get people actually

1039
0:41:13.98,000 --> 0:41:17,000
into a specific psychological and

1040
0:41:15.869,000 --> 0:41:19,000
physical space and so give your

1041
0:41:18.24,000 --> 0:41:21,000
gathering a name the gathering starts

1042
0:41:19.89,000 --> 0:41:21,000
from the moment of discovery meaning

1043
0:41:21.33,000 --> 0:41:24,000
from the moment that the guest actually

1044
0:41:22.71,000 --> 0:41:26,000
understands oh this is something I

1045
0:41:24.69,000 --> 0:41:28,000
attend look forward to the second is

1046
0:41:27.3,000 --> 0:41:3,000
half people bring some kind of physical

1047
0:41:29.04,000 --> 0:41:32,000
object or show some kind of physical

1048
0:41:30.9,000 --> 0:41:34,000
object on their side of the screen

1049
0:41:32.9,000 --> 0:41:36,000
whether it's starting with you know

1050
0:41:35.52,000 --> 0:41:39,000
asking everybody to bring a vessel with

1051
0:41:37.859,000 --> 0:41:41,000
a favorite drink inside depending on

1052
0:41:39.96,000 --> 0:41:42,000
your time zone and then share a story

1053
0:41:41.94,000 --> 0:41:45,000
about where they got that coffee mug

1054
0:41:43.29,000 --> 0:41:47,000
from third is and this sounds kind of

1055
0:41:46.68,000 --> 0:41:5,000
simple but remind people that they have

1056
0:41:48.21,000 --> 0:41:52,000
a body meaning like they themselves have

1057
0:41:50.76,000 --> 0:41:54,000
a body and that could mean that could

1058
0:41:52.859,000 --> 0:41:56,000
happen in a number of different ways but

1059
0:41:54.98,000 --> 0:42:,000
whether it means having them actually be

1060
0:41:57.68,000 --> 0:42:02,000
showing they're like more of than just

1061
0:42:01.17,000 --> 0:42:05,000
their head but actually for like the

1062
0:42:02.85,000 --> 0:42:06,000
intent you know the entire torso though

1063
0:42:05.82,000 --> 0:42:09,000
that also Again's go if you remember the

1064
0:42:07.53,000 --> 0:42:11,000
early part around intimacy you decide

1065
0:42:10.41,000 --> 0:42:15,000
what you're what you're optimizing for

1066
0:42:12.38,000 --> 0:42:17,000
and invite people to also bring a

1067
0:42:15.42,000 --> 0:42:2,000
physical object and put it within the

1068
0:42:17.76,000 --> 0:42:21,000
within the frame of the video a couple

1069
0:42:20.67,000 --> 0:42:22,000
we also we may not be able to be

1070
0:42:22.08,000 --> 0:42:25,000
physically together but audio is a

1071
0:42:23.64,000 --> 0:42:27,000
really powerful connector and so whether

1072
0:42:25.859,000 --> 0:42:29,000
it's playing a song or inviting somebody

1073
0:42:28.38,000 --> 0:42:32,000
to choose a favorite song that they want

1074
0:42:30.21,000 --> 0:42:34,000
to share at the group or some kind of

1075
0:42:32.97,000 --> 0:42:37,000
again audio response to begin a to begin

1076
0:42:35.16,000 --> 0:42:41,000
a a moment with can also kind of just

1077
0:42:38.369,000 --> 0:42:43,000
help you unify people but the the feel

1078
0:42:41.88,000 --> 0:42:44,000
of the physical connection being in the

1079
0:42:43.83,000 --> 0:42:46,000
group being in a room is one of those

1080
0:42:45.51,000 --> 0:42:52,000
things that I think we will be deeply

1081
0:42:47.4,000 --> 0:42:55,000
craving after this period and you know

1082
0:42:53.25,000 --> 0:42:57,000
you talked a lot about the workplace you

1083
0:42:55.74,000 --> 0:42:58,000
talked a lot about home and another

1084
0:42:58.02,000 --> 0:43:01,000
really great question that we have from

1085
0:42:59.369,000 --> 0:43:05,000
our audience is about the number of

1086
0:43:01.41,000 --> 0:43:07,000
children and students who are now you

1087
0:43:05.52,000 --> 0:43:09,000
know learning remotely and and what are

1088
0:43:07.56,000 --> 0:43:11,000
some tips I think for educators and even

1089
0:43:09.99,000 --> 0:43:14,000
for parents to try and create these

1090
0:43:12.54,000 --> 0:43:16,000
meaningful gatherings for for children

1091
0:43:15.71,000 --> 0:43:2,000
yep

1092
0:43:17.15,000 --> 0:43:25,000
so first is particularly an educator to

1093
0:43:21.359,000 --> 0:43:28,000
really ask what is the deepest need now

1094
0:43:25.8,000 --> 0:43:3,000
what is it that I'm trying to teach my

1095
0:43:28.41,000 --> 0:43:35,000
students and at the deeper level like

1096
0:43:31.619,000 --> 0:43:37,000
what is the purpose of this class and I

1097
0:43:35.57,000 --> 0:43:4,000
use the example of my my mother-in-law

1098
0:43:38.58,000 --> 0:43:46,000
who's an educator and she's a ceramics

1099
0:43:41.13,000 --> 0:43:48,000
teacher she she so she teaches in a form

1100
0:43:46.619,000 --> 0:43:49,000
that is deeply physical right and you

1101
0:43:48.54,000 --> 0:43:53,000
actually need certain materials a kiln

1102
0:43:50.609,000 --> 0:43:57,000
you know clay and she now has to figure

1103
0:43:54.51,000 --> 0:44:01,000
out how to teach ceramics for the next

1104
0:43:58.109,000 --> 0:44:03,000
many weeks you know virtually and so she

1105
0:44:01.71,000 --> 0:44:04,000
paused and she said what is the purpose

1106
0:44:03.57,000 --> 0:44:09,000
of my class is it to teach students

1107
0:44:05.609,000 --> 0:44:11,000
ceramics and she realized no ceramics is

1108
0:44:09.81,000 --> 0:44:12,000
her medium but the deeper purpose is

1109
0:44:12.27,000 --> 0:44:16,000
twofold

1110
0:44:12.99,000 --> 0:44:18,000
one is to is to help her students her

1111
0:44:16.83,000 --> 0:44:21,000
art students have a relationship with

1112
0:44:19.47,000 --> 0:44:23,000
three multi-dimensional art so not just

1113
0:44:22.08,000 --> 0:44:26,000
flat art not just photography or

1114
0:44:23.82,000 --> 0:44:28,000
painting but multi-dimensional and then

1115
0:44:26.76,000 --> 0:44:31,000
the second is she told me the other day

1116
0:44:28.89,000 --> 0:44:32,000
it's to give her

1117
0:44:32.28,000 --> 0:44:36,000
students a sense that they can create

1118
0:44:33.87,000 --> 0:44:37,000
something from nothing and so she

1119
0:44:36.72,000 --> 0:44:39,000
thought about it and in her case what

1120
0:44:38.46,000 --> 0:44:41,000
she decided to do over the course of the

1121
0:44:40.26,000 --> 0:44:45,000
next multiple weeks is change her

1122
0:44:42.06,000 --> 0:44:47,000
curriculum to teach these two lessons

1123
0:44:45.66,000 --> 0:44:5,000
through paper mache and found objects in

1124
0:44:47.82,000 --> 0:44:52,000
the home and I love this example in part

1125
0:44:51.21,000 --> 0:44:54,000
because for each of us whatever we're

1126
0:44:53.55,000 --> 0:44:56,000
trying to do as educators or parents is

1127
0:44:55.05,000 --> 0:44:58,000
to pause and to ask like what is the

1128
0:44:56.76,000 --> 0:44:59,000
need of these students or was the need

1129
0:44:58.44,000 --> 0:45:01,000
of these children now and to look at the

1130
0:45:00.21,000 --> 0:45:04,000
people in front of you but to also ask

1131
0:45:02.16,000 --> 0:45:06,000
your own deeper mission or purpose is

1132
0:45:04.23,000 --> 0:45:09,000
like why do I do this and given the

1133
0:45:06.33,000 --> 0:45:12,000
constraints now how do i how should i

1134
0:45:09.24,000 --> 0:45:14,000
structure this gathering now given these

1135
0:45:12.57,000 --> 0:45:16,000
new constraints so that i can still

1136
0:45:14.73,000 --> 0:45:22,000
achieve my purpose but the activity may

1137
0:45:17.43,000 --> 0:45:26,000
actually look very different it's great

1138
0:45:23.66,000 --> 0:45:27,000
and you know I mean I think also and

1139
0:45:26.73,000 --> 0:45:29,000
you've talked you've touched on some of

1140
0:45:27.99,000 --> 0:45:31,000
this too like great smaller ways that

1141
0:45:30.69,000 --> 0:45:35,000
you can sort of break the ice with folks

1142
0:45:32.88,000 --> 0:45:38,000
and and really find a path into these

1143
0:45:36.27,000 --> 0:45:41,000
great connections virtually and apart

1144
0:45:38.97,000 --> 0:45:42,000
and and so somebody asked you know that

1145
0:45:41.79,000 --> 0:45:44,000
they said they're organizing a digital

1146
0:45:43.2,000 --> 0:45:47,000
birthday party and they were just

1147
0:45:44.91,000 --> 0:45:48,000
curious for ways to bring people look

1148
0:45:47.7,000 --> 0:45:5,000
together who maybe don't know one

1149
0:45:48.96,000 --> 0:45:52,000
another so how can you connect with with

1150
0:45:51.54,000 --> 0:45:55,000
people who you had no connection with

1151
0:45:53.22,000 --> 0:45:58,000
before before entering these digital

1152
0:45:56.22,000 --> 0:46:,000
these digital events and gatherings I

1153
0:45:58.76,000 --> 0:46:02,000
actually think this is an opportunity

1154
0:46:01.2,000 --> 0:46:04,000
where virtual gatherings connect can

1155
0:46:03.39,000 --> 0:46:06,000
help depending on how you structure it

1156
0:46:05.01,000 --> 0:46:08,000
so at many birthday parties people come

1157
0:46:07.11,000 --> 0:46:1,000
together and don't know each other and

1158
0:46:08.64,000 --> 0:46:11,000
leave not knowing each other I mean

1159
0:46:10.23,000 --> 0:46:14,000
memories and hello or met one person out

1160
0:46:12.12,000 --> 0:46:16,000
of like 40 people they don't know but I

1161
0:46:14.4,000 --> 0:46:18,000
actually think in a context where you

1162
0:46:16.17,000 --> 0:46:22,000
kind of have to like play turbo host

1163
0:46:19.35,000 --> 0:46:24,000
this is an opportunity and an excuse to

1164
0:46:22.8,000 --> 0:46:25,000
have people actually meaningfully

1165
0:46:24.48,000 --> 0:46:27,000
participate and get to know each other

1166
0:46:26.01,000 --> 0:46:29,000
in a way that they may not otherwise so

1167
0:46:27.66,000 --> 0:46:29,000
a couple of examples if it's a birthday

1168
0:46:29.73,000 --> 0:46:32,000
party

1169
0:46:30.5,000 --> 0:46:35,000
virtual birthday party to invite each

1170
0:46:32.79,000 --> 0:46:39,000
guest to bring with them like a sweet a

1171
0:46:36.42,000 --> 0:46:45,000
drink a hat of their choice and a story

1172
0:46:40.41,000 --> 0:46:47,000
of of a value or a quality or a tray

1173
0:46:46.2,000 --> 0:46:51,000
that the birthday girl a birthday boy

1174
0:46:47.88,000 --> 0:46:54,000
hold and how they know that and invite

1175
0:46:51.93,000 --> 0:46:55,000
each person to share story you know and

1176
0:46:55.53,000 --> 0:46:58,000
again you're gonna have to have like a

1177
0:46:56.82,000 --> 0:47:,000
chief like birthday facilitator and it

1178
0:46:59.19,000 --> 0:47:02,000
shouldn't be the birthday girl or boy to

1179
0:47:01.38,000 --> 0:47:04,000
actually you know when you ask people's

1180
0:47:03.15,000 --> 0:47:06,000
stories that relate to the person

1181
0:47:04.65,000 --> 0:47:07,000
they're interesting not just because

1182
0:47:06.21,000 --> 0:47:09,000
you're saying oh this person's so great

1183
0:47:07.71,000 --> 0:47:11,000
or but it's actually giving a lot of

1184
0:47:09.75,000 --> 0:47:13,000
people context about the person but also

1185
0:47:11.91,000 --> 0:47:15,000
about your relationship to them and so

1186
0:47:14.339,000 --> 0:47:18,000
find ways to have people come together

1187
0:47:16.26,000 --> 0:47:21,000
and each have a moment to share

1188
0:47:18.72,000 --> 0:47:23,000
something related to the person but

1189
0:47:21.81,000 --> 0:47:25,000
again through a story not necessarily

1190
0:47:24.24,000 --> 0:47:28,000
advice or an opinion because stories

1191
0:47:26.04,000 --> 0:47:31,000
have legs stories are easy to listen to

1192
0:47:28.619,000 --> 0:47:36,000
stories also have a lot of data in them

1193
0:47:31.44,000 --> 0:47:39,000
that very few other vessels do that's

1194
0:47:37.38,000 --> 0:47:41,000
really great this has been so wonderful

1195
0:47:40.02,000 --> 0:47:45,000
pre I feel like I I know that I'm really

1196
0:47:42.24,000 --> 0:47:47,000
excited to try some of these these tools

1197
0:47:45.51,000 --> 0:47:49,000
and tips that you've offered and these

1198
0:47:47.82,000 --> 0:47:51,000
suggestions I think will really help

1199
0:47:49.89,000 --> 0:47:53,000
assisting a lot of people through these

1200
0:47:52.26,000 --> 0:47:57,000
next few weeks and months and beyond as

1201
0:47:54.359,000 --> 0:47:58,000
we come out of this so I you know I

1202
0:47:57.329,000 --> 0:48:01,000
think before we end I just love to give

1203
0:47:59.099,000 --> 0:48:04,000
you an opportunity to to share any sort

1204
0:48:01.65,000 --> 0:48:06,000
of parting thoughts you have about your

1205
0:48:04.349,000 --> 0:48:08,000
really big takeaways from what we should

1206
0:48:07.079,000 --> 0:48:12,000
take from this moment as we think about

1207
0:48:09,000 --> 0:48:15,000
connecting in meaningful ways I think

1208
0:48:12.96,000 --> 0:48:16,000
that we are all in the neck in the

1209
0:48:15.15,000 --> 0:48:18,000
coming weeks and months going to be

1210
0:48:17.04,000 --> 0:48:21,000
hosts of many new types of gatherings

1211
0:48:19.02,000 --> 0:48:24,000
and guests of many two new types of

1212
0:48:21.089,000 --> 0:48:26,000
gatherings and as we do have an

1213
0:48:24.45,000 --> 0:48:28,000
opportunity in each of these moments to

1214
0:48:26.19,000 --> 0:48:3,000
not go on autopilot which is often one

1215
0:48:28.8,000 --> 0:48:32,000
of the dangers of our in-person

1216
0:48:31.109,000 --> 0:48:35,000
gatherings and to ask for every

1217
0:48:33.21,000 --> 0:48:37,000
gathering like why are we doing this do

1218
0:48:35.25,000 --> 0:48:39,000
we still need to do this now what is

1219
0:48:37.319,000 --> 0:48:42,000
essential to preserve and how do we give

1220
0:48:39.48,000 --> 0:48:44,000
life to it in this new medium I think to

1221
0:48:42.569,000 --> 0:48:45,000
think about power dynamics and to ask

1222
0:48:44.609,000 --> 0:48:47,000
what are you actually asking of people

1223
0:48:46.38,000 --> 0:48:51,000
in this moment and is it you know is it

1224
0:48:48.48,000 --> 0:48:54,000
too much this this this pandemic will

1225
0:48:51.69,000 --> 0:48:56,000
weigh on us in different ways unequally

1226
0:48:55.38,000 --> 0:48:59,000
and so as you're beginning to think

1227
0:48:57.21,000 --> 0:49:,000
about how and what do we mark

1228
0:48:59.73,000 --> 0:49:03,000
how do you ask and what do you expect

1229
0:49:01.14,000 --> 0:49:08,000
from different people given given a very

1230
0:49:03.93,000 --> 0:49:09,000
difficult and dire time and and again

1231
0:49:08.52,000 --> 0:49:12,000
I'll say what I said earlier which is we

1232
0:49:10.35,000 --> 0:49:15,000
really inspire each other through

1233
0:49:12.63,000 --> 0:49:19,000
through specific examples of invention

1234
0:49:15.54,000 --> 0:49:2,000
and so too as you as you as you try out

1235
0:49:19.65,000 --> 0:49:22,000
new things and and also in the work

1236
0:49:21.39,000 --> 0:49:24,000
context as you think about what is it

1237
0:49:23.13,000 --> 0:49:27,000
that actually makes meetings work and

1238
0:49:24.72,000 --> 0:49:28,000
meaningful experimenting with shortening

1239
0:49:27.18,000 --> 0:49:3,000
the time of meetings experimenting with

1240
0:49:29.13,000 --> 0:49:32,000
spending more time on checking in and

1241
0:49:30.78,000 --> 0:49:33,000
perhaps only having meetings for

1242
0:49:32.46,000 --> 0:49:35,000
decision-making and not doing meetings

1243
0:49:34.14,000 --> 0:49:37,000
for anything else like to actually start

1244
0:49:36.21,000 --> 0:49:39,000
really sharing lessons with one another

1245
0:49:37.83,000 --> 0:49:42,000
and to please share your examples with

1246
0:49:40.2,000 --> 0:49:45,000
me because I learn every time I hear of

1247
0:49:43.74,000 --> 0:49:46,000
ways that wherever people are in the

1248
0:49:45.96,000 --> 0:49:48,000
world they're inventing new ways of

1249
0:49:47.43,000 --> 0:49:54,000
coming together in ways that communities

1250
0:49:49.5,000 --> 0:49:56,000
need thank you so much Priya this has

1251
0:49:55.02,000 --> 0:49:59,000
been wonderful and I really appreciate

1252
0:49:56.52,000 --> 0:50:01,000
you taking the time to chat and sending

1253
0:49:59.46,000 --> 0:50:03,000
best wishes to you and all of your loved

1254
0:50:02.07,000 --> 0:50:06,000
ones to stay safe and healthy during

1255
0:50:04.26,000 --> 0:50:09,000
this time thank you thank you so much

1256
0:50:06.42,000 --> 0:50:09,000
for having me and be well

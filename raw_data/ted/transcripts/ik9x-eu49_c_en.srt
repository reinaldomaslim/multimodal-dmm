1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was asked to come here and speak about creation.

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I can -- in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which I call "creativity."

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Creativity is how we cope with creation.

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,

7
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
creativity is always meaningful.

8
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:56,000
See, for instance, in this picture.

9
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture,

10
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.

11
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:11,000
When you think about -- you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.

12
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.

13
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I just did things.

14
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was,

15
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and tried to maintain that persona -- I became creative.

16
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly --

17
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties --

18
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
they followed a straight line that brings me to the point

19
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that actually I'm talking to you at this moment.

20
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Though it's actually true, you know,

21
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.

22
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.

23
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s

24
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
under a climate of political distress,

25
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way --

26
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in a sort of a semiotic black market.

27
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You couldn't really say what you wanted to say;

28
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you had to invent ways of doing it.

29
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You didn't trust information very much.

30
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That led me to another step of why I'm here today,

31
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is because I really liked media of all kinds.

32
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.

33
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
My first job in Brazil

34
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:27,000
was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards,

35
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.

36
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It was very -- actually, it was a very good study,

37
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and got me a job in an ad agency.

38
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And they also decided that I had to --

39
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.

40
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And another point -- why I'm here --

41
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy,

42
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life,

43
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
picked the thing -- didn't have any friends.

44
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.

45
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.

46
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.

47
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) --

48
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car,

49
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun --

50
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I don't know why he had a gun --

51
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.

52
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me.

53
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.

54
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry

55
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.

56
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983,

57
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today:

58
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause)

59
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.

60
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach.

61
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do --

62
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials,

63
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter)

64
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know,

65
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
they would only let me do other things.

66
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.

67
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The first works were actually objects.

68
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.

69
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I called them relics.

70
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983.

71
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This is the clown skull.

72
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers.

73
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter)

74
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is the Ashanti joystick.

75
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.

76
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:56,000
A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.

77
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The rocking podium. (Laughter)

78
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter)

79
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks,

80
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee;

81
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the coffee was actually pre-Columbian.

82
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The Bonsai table.

83
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.

84
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.

85
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I wanted to take that into the realm of images,

86
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.

87
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I decided to do work with clouds.

88
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Because clouds can mean anything you want.

89
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way,

90
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so something that would mean at the same time

91
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands --

92
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.

93
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But I was still, you know -- this is a kitty cloud.

94
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They're called "Equivalents," after Alfred Stieglitz's work.

95
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:13,000
"The Snail."

96
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But I was still working with sculpture,

97
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.

98
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:19,000
"The Teapot."

99
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I had a chance to go to Florence, in -- I think it was '94,

100
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise."

101
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And he did something that was very tricky.

102
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
He put together two different media from different periods of time.

103
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief,

104
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.

105
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And it's totally overkill.

106
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And your eye doesn't know which level to read.

107
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And you become trapped into this kind of representation.

108
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So I decided to make these very simple renderings,

109
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that at first they are taken as a line drawing --

110
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire.

111
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The idea was to -- because everybody overlooks white -- like pencil drawings, you know?

112
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And they would look at it -- "Ah, it's a pencil drawing."

113
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.

114
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It had a physicality,

115
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative

116
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that goes this way, towards the image. So this is "Monkey with Leica."

117
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"Relaxation."

118
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"Fiat Lux."

119
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And the same way the history of representation

120
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.

121
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I wanted to deal with other subjects.

122
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I started taking that into the realm of landscape,

123
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.

124
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread,"

125
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.

126
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
These always end up being a photograph at the end,

127
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
or more like an etching in this case.

128
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So this is a lighthouse.

129
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This is "6,500 Yards," after Corot. "9,000 Yards," after Gerhard Richter.

130
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.

131
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points,

132
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:27,000
like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.

133
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,

134
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and I did work and play with them.

135
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I got some photographs from them.

136
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Upon my arrival in New York, I decided --

137
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they were children of sugar plantation workers.

138
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.

139
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
These are -- (Applause) --

140
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Thank you. This is "Valentina, the Fastest."

141
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It was just the name of the child,

142
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.

143
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"Valicia."

144
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"Jacynthe."

145
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But another layer of representation was still introduced.

146
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures,

147
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I realized that I could add still another thing

148
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I was trying to make a subject --

149
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:25,000
something that would interfere with the themes,

150
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:29,000
so chocolate is very good, because it has --

151
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:34,000
it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.

152
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And so I decided to make these pictures,

153
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.

154
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."

155
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.

156
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And Jackson Pollock also.

157
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting,

158
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because, you know, you go to that --

159
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,

160
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:03,000
like a face, goes into becoming just a texture.

161
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"Paparazzi."

162
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.

163
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.

164
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And you render this with the most non-specific material,

165
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which is dust itself.

166
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.

167
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.

168
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This is Richard Serra.

169
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.

170
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?

171
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I realized that I never worked with color,

172
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:53,000
because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.

173
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But once they're applied to numeric structure,

174
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
then you can feel more comfortable.

175
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.

176
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They end up being very large pictures,

177
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and I photographed with a very large camera --

178
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
an 8x10 camera.

179
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So you can see the surface of every single swatch --

180
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
like in this picture of Chuck Close.

181
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.

182
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts --

183
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,

184
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
which is the bit map.

185
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks."

186
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:38,000
This is something I used to do as a joke --

187
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:43,000
you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" --

188
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.

189
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.

190
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship

191
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
between the model and the original.

192
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.

193
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking.

194
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions,

195
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
being 150 meters away.

196
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now I would do very small ones, which would be like --

197
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but under the same light, and I would show them together,

198
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.

199
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.

200
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I was more interested in the things in between,

201
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.

202
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.

203
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is a pipe.

204
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:47,000
A hanger.

205
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And this is another thing that I did -- you know working

206
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
-- everybody loves to watch somebody draw,

207
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in --

208
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:02,000
a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.

209
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And I love this work,

210
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:1,000
because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.

211
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest -- an early interest -- in theater,

212
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that's justified on this thing.

213
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,

214
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.

215
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And in this, you'd have like a --

216
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:28,000
something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.

217
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So they're like perfect actors.

218
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:37,000
My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.

219
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars

220
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear,"

221
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,

222
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.

223
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:59,000
On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think --

224
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and I went to a warehouse in Queens

225
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group.

226
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy --

227
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
his name was Joey Grimaldi --

228
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:14,000
he impersonated the Moorish general

229
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
-- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,

230
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so --

231
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
plumber, general, plumber, general --

232
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:27,000
so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.

233
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
See, I think it's not really about impression,

234
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
making people fall for a really perfect illusion,

235
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:42,000
as much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.

236
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Because it's not about fooling somebody,

237
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:

238
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
how much you want to be fooled.

239
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:54,000
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.

240
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Well, I think that's it.

241
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:57,000
My time is nearly up.

242
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Thank you very much.

0:00:13.564,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What you're doing,

3
0:00:15.335,000 --> 0:00:17,000
right now, at this very moment,

4
0:00:18.139,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is killing you.

5
0:00:20.159,000 --> 0:00:22,000
More than cars or the Internet

6
0:00:22.914,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or even that little mobile device we keep talking about,

7
0:00:25.683,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the technology you're using the most almost every day

8
0:00:28.574,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is this, your tush.

9
0:00:31.78,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day,

10
0:00:34.909,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.

11
0:00:38.407,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Sitting is so incredibly prevalent,

12
0:00:40.272,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we don't even question how much we're doing it,

13
0:00:42.249,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and because everyone else is doing it,

14
0:00:45.191,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.

15
0:00:47.965,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In that way, sitting has become

16
0:00:50.277,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the smoking of our generation.

17
0:00:54.181,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Of course there's health consequences to this,

18
0:00:56.609,000 --> 0:00:58,000
scary ones, besides the waist.

19
0:00:59.39,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Things like breast cancer and colon cancer

20
0:01:03.042,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are directly tied to our lack of physical [activity],

21
0:01:06.331,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Ten percent in fact, on both of those.

22
0:01:08.963,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Six percent for heart disease,

23
0:01:10.483,000 --> 0:01:12,000
seven percent for type 2 diabetes,

24
0:01:12.506,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which is what my father died of.

25
0:01:15.286,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, any of those stats should convince each of us

26
0:01:17.347,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to get off our duff more,

27
0:01:18.966,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but if you're anything like me, it won't.

28
0:01:21.736,000 --> 0:01:24,000
What did get me moving was a social interaction.

29
0:01:24.964,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Someone invited me to a meeting,

30
0:01:26.272,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but couldn't manage to fit me in

31
0:01:27.445,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said,

32
0:01:30.283,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"

33
0:01:34.108,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It seemed kind of odd to do,

34
0:01:36.155,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking,

35
0:01:38.265,000 --> 0:01:39,000
"I have to be the one to ask the next question,"

36
0:01:40.029,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because I knew I was going to huff and puff

37
0:01:43.185,000 --> 0:01:45,000
during this conversation.

38
0:01:45.369,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.

39
0:01:48.499,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So instead of going to coffee meetings

40
0:01:50.145,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings,

41
0:01:52.373,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I ask people to go on a walking meeting,

42
0:01:55.403,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.

43
0:01:59.342,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's changed my life.

44
0:02:01.771,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But before that, what actually happened was,

45
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I used to think about it as,

46
0:02:05.982,000 --> 0:02:06,000
you could take care of your health,

47
0:02:07.678,000 --> 0:02:09,000
or you could take care of obligations,

48
0:02:10.202,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and one always came at the cost of the other.

49
0:02:14.007,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later,

50
0:02:17.139,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I've learned a few things.

51
0:02:18.512,000 --> 0:02:19,000
First, there's this amazing thing

52
0:02:20.386,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about actually getting out of the box

53
0:02:23.111,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that leads to out-of-the-box thinking.

54
0:02:25.085,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.

55
0:02:29.51,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And second, and probably the more reflective one,

56
0:02:32.53,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is just about how much each of us

57
0:02:34.825,000 --> 0:02:36,000
can hold problems in opposition

58
0:02:37.289,000 --> 0:02:38,000
when they're really not that way.

59
0:02:39.264,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And if we're going to solve problems

60
0:02:40.972,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and look at the world really differently,

61
0:02:42.57,000 --> 0:02:44,000
whether it's in governance or business

62
0:02:44.699,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or environmental issues, job creation,

63
0:02:47.561,000 --> 0:02:49,000
maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems

64
0:02:50.224,000 --> 0:02:52,000
as having both things be true.

65
0:02:52.426,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Because it was when that happened

66
0:02:54.349,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with this walk-and-talk idea

67
0:02:55.804,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that things became doable and sustainable and viable.

68
0:02:59.763,000 --> 0:03:,000
So I started this talk talking about the tush,

69
0:03:01.743,000 --> 0:03:05,000
so I'll end with the bottom line, which is,

70
0:03:05.753,000 --> 0:03:06,000
walk and talk.

71
0:03:07.384,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Walk the talk.

72
0:03:08.667,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking,

73
0:03:12.335,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and in the way that you do,

74
0:03:13.931,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.

75
0:03:17.459,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Thank you.

76
0:03:19.186,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Applause)

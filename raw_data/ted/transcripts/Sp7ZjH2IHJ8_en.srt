1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to go right into the slides.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is that I do just very straight stuff.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And my ideas are --

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in my head, anyway -- they're very logical

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or I really do solve their problems,

9
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
because usually they seem to like it.

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Let me go right into the slides.

11
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Can you turn off the light? Down.

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I like to be in the dark.

13
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here.

14
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Anyway, I did this house in Santa Monica,

16
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it got a lot of notoriety.

17
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In fact, it appeared in a porno comic book,

18
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
which is the slide on the right.

19
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This is in Venice.

21
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I just show it because I want you to know

22
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm concerned about context.

23
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
On the left-hand side,

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I had the context of those little houses,

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.

26
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context

27
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they look really weird,

28
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and my premise is that they make a lot more sense

29
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when they're photographed or seen in that space.

30
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And then, once I deal with the context,

31
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene,

32
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as I hope you'll find that slide on the right.

33
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.

34
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.

35
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And we continue to work with this client.

36
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The building on the right at the top is now under construction.

37
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down,

38
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
finally, and several small classrooms will be placed

39
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
along this avenue that we've created, this campus.

40
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And it all related to the clients and the students

41
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.

42
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They wanted a sense of place.

43
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space

44
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.

45
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And it was my theory, or my point of view,

46
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that one didn't upstage the neighborhood --

47
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
one made accommodations.

48
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,

49
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
whether they were buildings I liked or not.

50
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In the '60s I started working with paper furniture

51
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.

52
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.

53
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And the success of it threw me for a loop.

54
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I couldn't deal with the success of furniture --

55
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I wasn't secure enough as an architect --

56
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.

57
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, nobody would like this.

59
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture,

60
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.

61
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And after we failed, I just kept failing.

62
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

63
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The piece on the left --

64
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and that ultimately led to the piece on the right --

65
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
happened when the kid that was working on this

66
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up

67
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to put it in the wastebasket.

68
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And I put a piece of tape around it,

69
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
as you see there, and realized you could sit on it,

70
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.

71
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So, it was an accidental discovery.

72
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I got into fish.

73
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

74
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo --

75
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,

76
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.

77
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so I started making these funny things.

78
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger --

79
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
as the one glass at the Walker.

80
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything

81
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and tried to translate what I was learning

82
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
about the form of the fish and the movement.

83
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it --

84
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
accidental, again --

85
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,

86
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.

87
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I did this building in Japan.

88
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I was taken out to dinner after the contract

89
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
for this little restaurant was signed.

90
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.

91
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And after I got -- I was really drunk --

92
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I was asked to do some sketches on napkins.

93
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

94
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And I made some sketches on napkins --

95
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.

96
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And the client said, "Why no fish?"

97
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.

98
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Three weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings

99
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
saying we'd won the competition.

100
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form,

102
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because they're so beautiful -- perfect --

103
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
into a building or object like this.

104
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,

105
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
told me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.

106
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But he was right -- I couldn't do the tail.

107
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.

108
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It was pretty hard.

109
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.

110
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I put them together, and you walk between them.

111
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It was a dialog with the context again.

112
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now, if you saw a picture of this

113
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
as it was published in Architectural Record --

114
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they didn't show the context, so you would think,

115
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
"God, what a pushy guy this is."

116
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here

117
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
looking for this restaurant.

118
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Couldn't find it.

119
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So ...

120
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Laughter)

121
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
As for craft and technology and all those things

122
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.

123
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This was built in six months.

124
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The way we sent drawings to Japan:

125
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,

126
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.

127
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.

128
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And when I got there, everything was perfect --

129
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
except the tail.

130
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.

131
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.

132
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.

133
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,

134
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.

135
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.

136
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.

137
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And so we built a temporary building -- I'm getting good at temporary --

138
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and we put a conference room in that's a fish.

139
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.

140
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother

141
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home,

142
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.

143
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I played with it in the evening.

144
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.

145
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And the next night, we had gefilte fish.

146
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

147
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices

148
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and I made a pedestal for a sculpture.

149
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.

150
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's,

151
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and I put the fish in.

152
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It was a joke.

153
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

154
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.

155
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We've been friends for a long time.

156
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And we've started to work on things.

157
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
A few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy,

158
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
called "Il Corso del Coltello" -- the Swiss Army knife.

159
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And most of the imagery is --

160
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

161
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Claes', but those two little boys are my sons,

162
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and they were Claes' assistants in the play.

163
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
He was the Swiss Army knife.

164
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter,

165
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I was Frankie P. Toronto.

166
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
P for Palladio.

167
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Dressed up like the AT&T building by Claes --

168
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

169
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
with a fish hat.

170
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The highlight of the performance was at the end.

171
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife,

172
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
which I get credit for participating in.

173
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg.

174
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I had nothing to do with it.

175
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The only thing I did was, I made it possible for them

176
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal,

177
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because I love sailing.

178
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

179
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We made it into a sailing craft.

180
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing.

181
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture,

182
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when things are made in such great quantities,

183
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
absorbed in such great quantities,

184
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and there's so much denial about them.

185
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
People hate it.

186
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture --

187
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it's one of those materials.

188
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
And I'm always drawn to that.

189
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link,

190
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
which nobody will forgive me for.

191
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.

192
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And that chain link is really expensive.

193
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's in perspective and everything.

194
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer.

195
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And you can see, we started making a building together.

196
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Of course, the milk can is his.

197
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But we were trying to collide our ideas,

198
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to put objects next to each other.

199
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life.

200
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together.

201
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building

202
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
on this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing,

203
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and you entered in the middle.

204
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.

205
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And he pushed that.

206
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And one day I had a -- oh, well, the other way.

207
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there,

208
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and I could never get rid of them after that.

209
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible

210
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
when he sent me the first model of the real proposal.

211
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It made my building look sick.

212
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And it was this interaction between

213
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.

214
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It led to the building on the left.

215
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know,

216
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
leaving out the -- what the hell.

217
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I use a lot of metal in my work,

218
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and I have a hard time connecting with the craft.

219
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The whole thing about my house,

220
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the whole use of rough carpentry and everything,

221
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
was the frustration with the crafts available.

222
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I said, "If I can't get the craft that I want,

223
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I'll use the craft I can get."

224
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
There were plenty of models for that,

225
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists

226
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.

227
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building

228
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that was a sculpture.

229
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And it was all of one material,

230
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.

231
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The metalworkers, for the most part,

232
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.

233
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit

234
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington,

235
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and I did it on the condition that they become my partners

236
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.

237
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And it's working very well

238
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.

239
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I just tell the stories.

240
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people

241
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that are so important to the realization of architecture.

242
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller, in Sacramento.

243
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And it's just a complex of factory buildings.

244
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place --

245
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
a people place.

246
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say,

247
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but it is real that they wanted to have a central place

248
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come

249
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and where the people working would interact.

250
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
So it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.

251
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It's copper and galvanize.

252
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I used the galvanize and copper

253
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
in a very light gauge, so it would buckle.

254
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.

255
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect,

256
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.

257
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And they end up looking like stone.

258
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
This is the central area.

259
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
There's a ramp.

260
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.

261
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job.

262
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning,

263
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.

264
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because these were ideas that we were talking about,

265
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
building things next to each other, making --

266
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
it's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.

267
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And so Stanley did the little dome thing.

268
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And we did it over the phone and by fax.

269
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
He would send me a fax and show me something.

270
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.

271
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.

272
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I don't want the tower."

273
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So he came back with a simpler building,

274
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
but he put some funny details on it,

275
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and he moved it closer to my building.

276
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And so I decided to put him in a depression.

277
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.

278
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax,

279
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.

280
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.

281
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And so then I put this big billboard behind it.

282
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And I call it, "David and Goliath."

283
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And that's my cafeteria.

284
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
In Boston, we had that old building on the left.

285
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
It was a very prominent building off the freeway,

286
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up

287
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood,

288
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
which had these cornices, projecting cornices.

289
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Mine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper,

290
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.

291
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Instead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.

292
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
We redid the side of the building

293
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.

294
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved,

295
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
because they have very strict kind of design guideline,

296
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.

297
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper

298
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and making panels and fitting it tightly

299
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
into the fabric of the existing building.

300
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
In Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival,

301
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
I did the Hollywood sign going and coming,

302
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
made a building out of it, and they built it.

303
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
I flew in one night and took this picture.

304
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.

305
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica --

306
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
a little shopping center.

307
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa,

308
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:54,000
in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.

309
0:19:54.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
It's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.

310
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
And the shape fit perfectly.

311
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
I just joined the points.

312
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.

313
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon --

314
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and so it was an opportunity that I seized,

315
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.

316
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:34,000
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.

317
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
This is a small house somewhere.

318
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.

319
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
It's in the West Valley.

320
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
And we started with the stream

321
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:57,000
and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake.

322
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
These are the models.

323
0:21:03.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
The reality, with the lake --

324
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:1,000
the workmanship is pretty bad.

325
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.

326
0:21:16.16,000 --> 0:21:2,000
When you have to do something really cheaply,

327
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.

328
0:21:36.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is --

329
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:45,000
you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom,

330
0:21:45.16,000 --> 0:21:47,000
which is on the right.

331
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
It's kind of like a whole built town.

332
0:22:00.16,000 --> 0:22:07,000
I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale.

333
0:22:07.16,000 --> 0:22:11,000
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.

334
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:2,000
This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.

335
0:22:22.16,000 --> 0:22:26,000
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it.

336
0:22:26.16,000 --> 0:22:28,000
He was too busy.

337
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:32,000
He didn't recommend me, by the way.

338
0:22:32.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
(Laughter)

339
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:4,000
We ended up having to make it a sculpture, because the dilemma was,

340
0:22:40.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?

341
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:47,000
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?

342
0:22:47.16,000 --> 0:22:49,000
Etc. etc.

343
0:22:49.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
You've got the idea.

344
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:53,000
And so we finally ended up making it.

345
0:22:53.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
These people are art collectors.

346
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:22:59,000
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural

347
0:22:59.16,000 --> 0:23:04,000
from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.

348
0:23:07.16,000 --> 0:23:12,000
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.

349
0:23:12.16,000 --> 0:23:18,000
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply --

350
0:23:18.16,000 --> 0:23:22,000
it's that formed lumber from Finland.

351
0:23:22.16,000 --> 0:23:25,000
We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.

352
0:23:25.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
I keep trying to make it work.

353
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:3,000
In this case we learned how to detail it.

354
0:23:33.16,000 --> 0:23:4,000
In Cleveland, there's Burnham Mall, on the left.

355
0:23:40.16,000 --> 0:23:42,000
It's never been finished.

356
0:23:42.16,000 --> 0:23:47,000
Going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.

357
0:23:47.16,000 --> 0:23:53,000
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.

358
0:23:53.16,000 --> 0:23:55,000
There's a railroad track.

359
0:23:55.16,000 --> 0:24:,000
This is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.

360
0:24:00.16,000 --> 0:24:04,000
And the centerline of the mall goes out.

361
0:24:04.16,000 --> 0:24:09,000
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built,

362
0:24:09.16,000 --> 0:24:11,000
and so we followed.

363
0:24:11.16,000 --> 0:24:13,000
Sohio is on the axis here,

364
0:24:13.16,000 --> 0:24:16,000
and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.

365
0:24:16.16,000 --> 0:24:18,000
And this is our building,

366
0:24:18.16,000 --> 0:24:22,000
which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.

367
0:24:22.16,000 --> 0:24:27,000
We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.

368
0:24:33.16,000 --> 0:24:37,000
The health club is fastened to the garage

369
0:24:37.16,000 --> 0:24:4,000
with a C-clamp, for Cleveland.

370
0:24:40.16,000 --> 0:24:42,000
(Laughter)

371
0:24:42.16,000 --> 0:24:44,000
You drive down.

372
0:24:44.16,000 --> 0:24:47,000
So it's about a 10-story C-clamp.

373
0:24:47.16,000 --> 0:24:5,000
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,

374
0:24:50.16,000 --> 0:24:54,000
and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.

375
0:24:54.16,000 --> 0:24:57,000
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.

376
0:24:58.16,000 --> 0:25:,000
And this would be a hotel.

377
0:25:00.16,000 --> 0:25:02,000
So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it,

378
0:25:02.16,000 --> 0:25:06,000
and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings

379
0:25:06.16,000 --> 0:25:11,000
by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.

380
0:25:22.16,000 --> 0:25:24,000
It's hard to do high-rise.

381
0:25:24.16,000 --> 0:25:27,000
I feel much more comfortable down here.

382
0:25:28.16,000 --> 0:25:31,000
This is a piece of property in Brentwood.

383
0:25:31.16,000 --> 0:25:37,000
And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house --

384
0:25:37.16,000 --> 0:25:4,000
I designed a house for myself

385
0:25:40.16,000 --> 0:25:45,000
that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard --

386
0:25:45.16,000 --> 0:25:5,000
and the owner of this lot worked for me

387
0:25:50.16,000 --> 0:25:52,000
and built that actual model on the left.

388
0:25:52.16,000 --> 0:25:54,000
And she came back,

389
0:25:54.16,000 --> 0:25:58,000
I guess wealthier or something -- something happened --

390
0:25:58.16,000 --> 0:26:04,000
and asked me to design a house for her on this site.

391
0:26:06.16,000 --> 0:26:11,000
And following that basic idea of the village,

392
0:26:11.16,000 --> 0:26:13,000
we changed it as we got into it.

393
0:26:13.16,000 --> 0:26:18,000
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end --

394
0:26:18.16,000 --> 0:26:21,000
here you see on the photographs of the site --

395
0:26:21.16,000 --> 0:26:25,000
slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms

396
0:26:25.16,000 --> 0:26:3,000
like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,

397
0:26:30.16,000 --> 0:26:33,000
which I designed like a kind of a barge,

398
0:26:33.16,000 --> 0:26:35,000
looking like a boat.

399
0:26:37.16,000 --> 0:26:42,000
And that's it, built.

400
0:26:44.16,000 --> 0:26:48,000
The dome was a request from the client.

401
0:26:48.16,000 --> 0:26:5,000
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.

402
0:26:50.16,000 --> 0:26:52,000
She didn't care where.

403
0:26:52.16,000 --> 0:26:54,000
When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope --

404
0:26:54.16,000 --> 0:26:56,000
I mean, I haven't slept in it yet.

405
0:26:57.16,000 --> 0:27:01,000
I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there,

406
0:27:01.16,000 --> 0:27:09,000
but she said I didn't have to do that.

407
0:27:09.16,000 --> 0:27:12,000
But when you're in that room,

408
0:27:12.16,000 --> 0:27:16,000
you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.

409
0:27:16.16,000 --> 0:27:18,000
And it's very private.

410
0:27:18.16,000 --> 0:27:21,000
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.

411
0:27:21.16,000 --> 0:27:26,000
And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room,

412
0:27:26.16,000 --> 0:27:28,000
and one on the other side.

413
0:27:31.16,000 --> 0:27:33,000
These aren't focused very well.

414
0:27:33.16,000 --> 0:27:37,000
I don't know how to do it from here.

415
0:27:37.16,000 --> 0:27:4,000
Focus the one on the right.

416
0:27:41.16,000 --> 0:27:43,000
It's up there.

417
0:27:43.16,000 --> 0:27:46,000
Left -- it's my right.

418
0:27:47.16,000 --> 0:27:53,000
Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.

419
0:27:53.16,000 --> 0:27:55,000
That's the living room.

420
0:27:55.16,000 --> 0:27:57,000
Servants' quarters.

421
0:27:57.16,000 --> 0:28:01,000
A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.

422
0:28:01.16,000 --> 0:28:06,000
And then you enter into the living room and then so on.

423
0:28:11.16,000 --> 0:28:13,000
This is the bedroom.

424
0:28:13.16,000 --> 0:28:15,000
You come down from this level along the stairway,

425
0:28:15.16,000 --> 0:28:18,000
and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.

426
0:28:18.16,000 --> 0:28:2,000
And the bed is back in this space,

427
0:28:20.16,000 --> 0:28:23,000
with windows looking out onto the lake.

428
0:28:23.16,000 --> 0:28:28,000
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground

429
0:28:28.16,000 --> 0:28:32,000
and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.

430
0:28:32.16,000 --> 0:28:37,000
The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.

431
0:28:41.16,000 --> 0:28:46,000
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land --

432
0:28:46.16,000 --> 0:28:52,000
it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas

433
0:28:52.16,000 --> 0:28:58,000
and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion

434
0:28:58.16,000 --> 0:29:,000
with a high space in it.

435
0:29:05.16,000 --> 0:29:08,000
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis

436
0:29:08.16,000 --> 0:29:1,000
with the dining room table.

437
0:29:12.16,000 --> 0:29:16,000
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.

438
0:29:17.16,000 --> 0:29:19,000
But the idea is, the windows are all placed

439
0:29:19.16,000 --> 0:29:23,000
so you see pieces of the house outside.

440
0:29:23.16,000 --> 0:29:27,000
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up --

441
0:29:27.16,000 --> 0:29:29,000
and it will be very private.

442
0:29:29.16,000 --> 0:29:32,000
And you feel like you're in your own kind of village.

443
0:29:37.16,000 --> 0:29:42,000
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney.

444
0:29:42.16,000 --> 0:29:45,000
We're doing some work for him.

445
0:29:45.16,000 --> 0:29:5,000
And this is in Anaheim, California, and it's a freeway building.

446
0:29:50.16,000 --> 0:29:54,000
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour,

447
0:29:54.16,000 --> 0:29:56,000
and there's another bridge here.

448
0:29:56.16,000 --> 0:29:58,000
And you're through this room in a split second,

449
0:29:58.16,000 --> 0:30:,000
and the building will sort of reflect that.

450
0:30:00.16,000 --> 0:30:03,000
On the backside, it's much more humane -- entrance,

451
0:30:03.16,000 --> 0:30:05,000
dining hall, etc.

452
0:30:05.16,000 --> 0:30:1,000
And then this thing here -- I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear

453
0:30:10.16,000 --> 0:30:13,000
the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.

454
0:30:14.16,000 --> 0:30:18,000
Kind of a fun thing to do.

455
0:30:20.16,000 --> 0:30:24,000
I'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,

456
0:30:24.16,000 --> 0:30:27,000
which is an office building for a furniture company.

457
0:30:27.16,000 --> 0:30:3,000
And we struggled with the image.

458
0:30:30.16,000 --> 0:30:33,000
These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture

459
0:30:33.16,000 --> 0:30:38,000
to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,

460
0:30:38.16,000 --> 0:30:42,000
then people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,

461
0:30:42.16,000 --> 0:30:44,000
but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building."

462
0:30:44.16,000 --> 0:30:48,000
So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,

463
0:30:48.16,000 --> 0:30:52,000
and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them

464
0:30:52.16,000 --> 0:30:56,000
so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.

465
0:30:56.16,000 --> 0:31:,000
And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of

466
0:31:00.16,000 --> 0:31:03,000
interaction between these pieces.

467
0:31:04.16,000 --> 0:31:08,000
This is in Paris, along the Seine.

468
0:31:08.16,000 --> 0:31:12,000
Palais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.

469
0:31:12.16,000 --> 0:31:16,000
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.

470
0:31:16.16,000 --> 0:31:19,000
There's a new library across the river.

471
0:31:19.16,000 --> 0:31:23,000
And back in here, in this already treed park,

472
0:31:23.16,000 --> 0:31:27,000
we're doing a very dense building called the American Center,

473
0:31:27.16,000 --> 0:31:34,000
which has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum,

474
0:31:34.16,000 --> 0:31:38,000
restaurants and all kinds of -- it's a very dense program --

475
0:31:38.16,000 --> 0:31:41,000
bookstores, etc.

476
0:31:41.16,000 --> 0:31:43,000
In a very tight, small --

477
0:31:43.16,000 --> 0:31:46,000
this is the ground level.

478
0:31:46.16,000 --> 0:31:49,000
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up

479
0:31:49.16,000 --> 0:31:53,000
by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.

480
0:31:53.16,000 --> 0:31:55,000
They call it the plan coupe.

481
0:31:55.16,000 --> 0:32:01,000
And I struggled with that thing --

482
0:32:01.16,000 --> 0:32:03,000
how to get around the corner.

483
0:32:03.16,000 --> 0:32:06,000
These are the models for it.

484
0:32:06.16,000 --> 0:32:09,000
I showed you the other model, the one --

485
0:32:14.16,000 --> 0:32:17,000
this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing --

486
0:32:17.16,000 --> 0:32:23,000
so I understood the problem.

487
0:32:23.16,000 --> 0:32:27,000
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it?

488
0:32:27.16,000 --> 0:32:3,000
Apartments, etc.

489
0:32:30.16,000 --> 0:32:32,000
And these are the kind of study models we did.

490
0:32:32.16,000 --> 0:32:36,000
And the one on the left is pretty awful.

491
0:32:36.16,000 --> 0:32:41,000
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.

492
0:32:41.16,000 --> 0:32:48,000
But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece

493
0:32:48.16,000 --> 0:32:51,000
worked frontally to this, parallel to this street,

494
0:32:51.16,000 --> 0:32:53,000
and also parallel to here.

495
0:32:53.16,000 --> 0:32:57,000
And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,

496
0:32:57.16,000 --> 0:33:03,000
kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.

497
0:33:03.16,000 --> 0:33:06,000
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater, etc.

498
0:33:06.16,000 --> 0:33:1,000
So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,

499
0:33:10.16,000 --> 0:33:12,000
except for this metal piece.

500
0:33:12.16,000 --> 0:33:15,000
And it faces into a park.

501
0:33:15.16,000 --> 0:33:2,000
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.

502
0:33:23.16,000 --> 0:33:27,000
On the side facing the street it's much more normal,

503
0:33:27.16,000 --> 0:33:33,000
except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,

504
0:33:33.16,000 --> 0:33:37,000
these housing units made a gesture to the corner.

505
0:33:46.16,000 --> 0:33:51,000
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.

506
0:33:51.16,000 --> 0:33:53,000
If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.

507
0:33:53.16,000 --> 0:33:55,000
I don't know what to do.

508
0:33:58.16,000 --> 0:34:01,000
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me

509
0:34:01.16,000 --> 0:34:03,000
to do a house for him in the Hamptons.

510
0:34:03.16,000 --> 0:34:05,000
And it's got a fish.

511
0:34:05.16,000 --> 0:34:08,000
And I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish."

512
0:34:08.16,000 --> 0:34:11,000
It's like a drug addict.

513
0:34:11.16,000 --> 0:34:13,000
I say, "I'm not going to do it anymore -- I don't want to do it anymore --

514
0:34:13.16,000 --> 0:34:15,000
I'm not going to do it."

515
0:34:15.16,000 --> 0:34:17,000
And then I do it.

516
0:34:17.16,000 --> 0:34:18,000
(Laughter)

517
0:34:18.16,000 --> 0:34:19,000
There it is.

518
0:34:19.16,000 --> 0:34:2,000
But it's the living room.

519
0:34:20.16,000 --> 0:34:22,000
And this piece here is --

520
0:34:22.16,000 --> 0:34:24,000
I don't know what it is.

521
0:34:24.16,000 --> 0:34:26,000
I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget

522
0:34:26.16,000 --> 0:34:29,000
so we could take something out.

523
0:34:29.16,000 --> 0:34:37,000
(Applause)

524
0:34:37.16,000 --> 0:34:41,000
This is Euro Disney, and I've worked with all of the guys

525
0:34:41.16,000 --> 0:34:43,000
that presented to you earlier.

526
0:34:44.16,000 --> 0:34:46,000
We've had a lot of fun working together.

527
0:34:46.16,000 --> 0:34:5,000
I think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me,

528
0:34:50.16,000 --> 0:34:53,000
but somehow we all manage to work together,

529
0:34:53.16,000 --> 0:34:57,000
and I think, productively.

530
0:34:57.16,000 --> 0:34:59,000
So far.

531
0:34:59.16,000 --> 0:35:02,000
This is a shopping thing.

532
0:35:02.16,000 --> 0:35:05,000
You come into the Magic Kingdom

533
0:35:05.16,000 --> 0:35:09,000
and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.

534
0:35:09.16,000 --> 0:35:12,000
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall,

535
0:35:12.16,000 --> 0:35:15,000
with a rodeo and restaurants.

536
0:35:15.16,000 --> 0:35:18,000
And another restaurant.

537
0:35:18.16,000 --> 0:35:23,000
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull,

538
0:35:23.16,000 --> 0:35:26,000
I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station,

539
0:35:26.16,000 --> 0:35:28,000
to the route of the train.

540
0:35:28.16,000 --> 0:35:31,000
It looks like it's kind of been there,

541
0:35:31.16,000 --> 0:35:35,000
and then crashed all these simpler forms into it.

542
0:35:35.16,000 --> 0:35:41,000
The light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a

543
0:35:41.16,000 --> 0:35:44,000
kind of light ceiling.

544
0:35:52.16,000 --> 0:35:56,000
In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel,

545
0:35:56.16,000 --> 0:36:,000
we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.

546
0:36:00.16,000 --> 0:36:03,000
And I tried to -- there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here,

547
0:36:03.16,000 --> 0:36:06,000
there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here --

548
0:36:06.16,000 --> 0:36:1,000
I tried to make a relationship urbanistically.

549
0:36:10.16,000 --> 0:36:13,000
And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed --

550
0:36:13.16,000 --> 0:36:17,000
but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.

551
0:36:17.16,000 --> 0:36:22,000
And as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces

552
0:36:22.16,000 --> 0:36:27,000
accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.

553
0:36:32.16,000 --> 0:36:35,000
It's plaster and just zinc.

554
0:36:35.16,000 --> 0:36:38,000
And you wonder, if this is a museum,

555
0:36:38.16,000 --> 0:36:4,000
what it's going to be like inside?

556
0:36:40.16,000 --> 0:36:44,000
If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything,

557
0:36:44.16,000 --> 0:36:46,000
and just wait.

558
0:36:46.16,000 --> 0:36:51,000
I'm so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful.

559
0:36:51.16,000 --> 0:36:56,000
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.

560
0:36:59.16,000 --> 0:37:04,000
It's actually basically three square rooms

561
0:37:04.16,000 --> 0:37:06,000
with a couple of skylights and stuff.

562
0:37:06.16,000 --> 0:37:09,000
And from the building in the back, you see it as

563
0:37:09.16,000 --> 0:37:12,000
an iceberg floating by in the hills.

564
0:37:15.16,000 --> 0:37:18,000
I know I'm over time.

565
0:37:33.16,000 --> 0:37:36,000
See, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.

566
0:37:36.16,000 --> 0:37:4,000
So it's pretty quiet inside.

567
0:37:43.16,000 --> 0:37:47,000
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall.

568
0:37:47.16,000 --> 0:37:51,000
It's a complicated project.

569
0:37:51.16,000 --> 0:37:53,000
It has a chamber hall.

570
0:37:53.16,000 --> 0:37:57,000
It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built

571
0:37:57.16,000 --> 0:38:,000
with a lot of love and tears and caring.

572
0:38:00.16,000 --> 0:38:05,000
And it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,

573
0:38:05.16,000 --> 0:38:12,000
that we would make a compositional relationship between us

574
0:38:13.16,000 --> 0:38:16,000
that would strengthen both of us.

575
0:38:16.16,000 --> 0:38:18,000
And the plan of this -- it's a concert hall.

576
0:38:18.16,000 --> 0:38:21,000
This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.

577
0:38:21.16,000 --> 0:38:23,000
There's commercial at the ground floor.

578
0:38:23.16,000 --> 0:38:27,000
These are offices, which, really, in the competition,

579
0:38:27.16,000 --> 0:38:29,000
we didn't have to design.

580
0:38:29.16,000 --> 0:38:33,000
But finally, there's a hotel there.

581
0:38:33.16,000 --> 0:38:38,000
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,

582
0:38:38.16,000 --> 0:38:42,000
composing these elevations together and relating them

583
0:38:42.16,000 --> 0:38:47,000
to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA, etc.

584
0:38:51.16,000 --> 0:38:56,000
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,

585
0:38:56.16,000 --> 0:39:,000
which led to this compartmentalized scheme,

586
0:39:00.16,000 --> 0:39:04,000
which we found out after the competition would not work at all.

587
0:39:04.16,000 --> 0:39:09,000
But everybody liked these forms and liked the space,

588
0:39:09.16,000 --> 0:39:11,000
and so that's one of the problems of a competition.

589
0:39:11.16,000 --> 0:39:17,000
You have to then try and get that back in some way.

590
0:39:17.16,000 --> 0:39:21,000
And we studied many models.

591
0:39:21.16,000 --> 0:39:23,000
This was our original model.

592
0:39:23.16,000 --> 0:39:27,000
These were the three buildings that were the ideal --

593
0:39:27.16,000 --> 0:39:3,000
the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.

594
0:39:30.16,000 --> 0:39:33,000
Everybody liked the surround.

595
0:39:33.16,000 --> 0:39:36,000
Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,

596
0:39:36.16,000 --> 0:39:39,000
and it has more seats than any of these

597
0:39:39.16,000 --> 0:39:41,000
because it has double balconies.

598
0:39:41.16,000 --> 0:39:44,000
Our client doesn't want balconies, so --

599
0:39:44.16,000 --> 0:39:46,000
and when we met our new acoustician, he told us

600
0:39:46.16,000 --> 0:39:49,000
this was the right shape or this was the right shape.

601
0:39:49.16,000 --> 0:39:53,000
And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy

602
0:39:53.16,000 --> 0:40:01,000
of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.

603
0:40:01.16,000 --> 0:40:03,000
We finally settled on a shape that was

604
0:40:03.16,000 --> 0:40:06,000
the proportion of the Concertgebouw

605
0:40:06.16,000 --> 0:40:11,000
with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said

606
0:40:11.16,000 --> 0:40:14,000
were crucial to this and later decided they weren't,

607
0:40:14.16,000 --> 0:40:16,000
but now we have them.

608
0:40:16.16,000 --> 0:40:18,000
(Laughter)

609
0:40:18.16,000 --> 0:40:23,000
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural

610
0:40:23.16,000 --> 0:40:29,000
and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.

611
0:40:29.16,000 --> 0:40:31,000
That's the idea.

612
0:40:31.16,000 --> 0:40:37,000
And the corners would have skylights

613
0:40:37.16,000 --> 0:40:41,000
and these columns would be structural.

614
0:40:41.16,000 --> 0:40:44,000
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a

615
0:40:44.16,000 --> 0:40:47,000
kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,

616
0:40:47.16,000 --> 0:40:49,000
and create intimacy.

617
0:40:49.16,000 --> 0:40:54,000
Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being --

618
0:40:54.16,000 --> 0:41:,000
and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.

619
0:41:00.16,000 --> 0:41:05,000
We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,

620
0:41:05.16,000 --> 0:41:08,000
and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.

621
0:41:08.16,000 --> 0:41:1,000
But you get the sense of the hall in section.

622
0:41:10.16,000 --> 0:41:16,000
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.

623
0:41:16.16,000 --> 0:41:18,000
In this case we're opening it back up

624
0:41:18.16,000 --> 0:41:21,000
and getting skylights in the four corners.

625
0:41:21.16,000 --> 0:41:24,000
And so it will be quite a different shape.

626
0:41:28.16,000 --> 0:41:3,000
(Laughter)

627
0:41:30.16,000 --> 0:41:35,000
The original building, because it was frog-like,

628
0:41:35.16,000 --> 0:41:38,000
fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.

629
0:41:38.16,000 --> 0:41:41,000
When you get into a box, it's harder to do it -- and here we are,

630
0:41:41.16,000 --> 0:41:43,000
struggling with how to put the hotel in.

631
0:41:43.16,000 --> 0:41:46,000
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.

632
0:41:46.16,000 --> 0:41:49,000
I just stuck it on there.

633
0:41:49.16,000 --> 0:41:54,000
But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it

634
0:41:54.16,000 --> 0:41:56,000
and struggle with it and cut it away.

635
0:41:56.16,000 --> 0:41:58,000
And of course it's not going to look like that,

636
0:41:58.16,000 --> 0:42:03,000
but it is the crazy way I tend to work.

637
0:42:03.16,000 --> 0:42:06,000
And then finally, in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture

638
0:42:06.16,000 --> 0:42:12,000
at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower, the highest building in L.A.

639
0:42:12.16,000 --> 0:42:15,000
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs.

640
0:42:15.16,000 --> 0:42:19,000
And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake.

641
0:42:19.16,000 --> 0:42:2,000
(Laughter)

642
0:42:20.16,000 --> 0:42:23,000
It's a public space, and I made it kind of a garden structure,

643
0:42:23.16,000 --> 0:42:25,000
and you can go in it.

644
0:42:25.16,000 --> 0:42:28,000
It's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there,

645
0:42:28.16,000 --> 0:42:31,000
and it works much better than a fish.

646
0:42:31.16,000 --> 0:42:36,000
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that,

647
0:42:36.16,000 --> 0:42:39,000
at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by

648
0:42:39.16,000 --> 0:42:41,000
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

649
0:42:41.16,000 --> 0:42:44,000
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,

650
0:42:44.16,000 --> 0:42:48,000
non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.

651
0:42:48.16,000 --> 0:42:54,000
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,

652
0:42:54.16,000 --> 0:43:02,000
perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of

653
0:43:02.16,000 --> 0:43:07,000
a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit --

654
0:43:07.16,000 --> 0:43:09,000
this is the beach and the harbor out in front,

655
0:43:09.16,000 --> 0:43:13,000
and this is really a shopping center with department stores.

656
0:43:13.16,000 --> 0:43:15,000
And we split these bridges.

657
0:43:15.16,000 --> 0:43:17,000
Originally, this was all solid with a hole in it.

658
0:43:17.16,000 --> 0:43:22,000
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of

659
0:43:22.16,000 --> 0:43:24,000
a foreground for this hotel.

660
0:43:24.16,000 --> 0:43:27,000
We showed this to the hotel people the other day,

661
0:43:27.16,000 --> 0:43:32,000
and they were terrified and said that nobody would come

662
0:43:32.16,000 --> 0:43:37,000
to the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.

663
0:43:37.16,000 --> 0:43:4,000
(Laughter)

664
0:43:46.16,000 --> 0:43:48,000
And finally, I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger.

665
0:43:48.16,000 --> 0:43:5,000
I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here,

666
0:43:50.16,000 --> 0:43:54,000
but this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.

667
0:43:54.16,000 --> 0:43:58,000
A little studio -- and it's sadly for sale.

668
0:43:58.16,000 --> 0:44:,000
Time goes on.

669
0:44:00.16,000 --> 0:44:07,000
And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.

670
0:44:07.16,000 --> 0:44:1,000
He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves,

671
0:44:10.16,000 --> 0:44:12,000
and I did the rest of it.

672
0:44:12.16,000 --> 0:44:16,000
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.

673
0:44:16.16,000 --> 0:44:17,000
It should have been the other way around --

674
0:44:17.16,000 --> 0:44:19,000
the food should have been good first.

675
0:44:19.16,000 --> 0:44:2,000
It didn't work.

676
0:44:20.16,000 --> 0:44:21,000
Thank you very much.

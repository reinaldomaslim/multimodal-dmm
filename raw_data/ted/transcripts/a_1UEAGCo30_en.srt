1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Tom Green: That's a 4chan thing.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
These kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and they like to say funny words

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
like "barrel roll."

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's a video game move from "Star Fox."

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"Star Fox 20"? (Assistant: "Star Fox 64.")

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Tom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"4chan!"

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Christopher Poole: When I was 15,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I found this website called Futaba Channel.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
That format of forum, at that time,

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
was not well-known outside of Japan.

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I stuck it up for my friends to use.

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, six and a half years later,

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
over seven million people are using it,

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
contributing over 700,000 posts per day.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And we've gone from one board

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to 48 boards.

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is what it looks like.

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So, what's unique about the site

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is that it's anonymous,

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and it has no memory.

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
These things that we're used to with forums

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
don't exist on 4chan.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And that's led to this

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What the site's known for,

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because it has this environment,

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is it's fostered the creation of a lot of

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats --

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
just silly pictures of cats with text.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And this resonates with millions of people, apparently,

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because there are tens of thousands of these,

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and there is a whole blogging empire now

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
dedicated to pictures like these.

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
these past two years ...

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Rickroll was this bait and switch,

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
really simple, classic bait and switch.

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Somebody says they're linking to something interesting,

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And it got big enough to the point where

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
millions of people on television.

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site.

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the ones I've just shown you,

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but every day, every month,

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
people are producing thousands of these.

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So does a site like this have rules?

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which are more-or-less ignored by the community.

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And so they've come up with their own set of rules,

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the "Rules of the Internet."

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Rule one is you don't talk about /b/.

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Two is you do not talk about /b/.

67
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And this one's kind of interesting:

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."

69
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I will spare you that slide.

71
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I assure you, it is very true.

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
/b/ is the first board we started with,

73
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and it is, in many ways,

74
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the beating heart of the website.

75
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It is where a third of all the traffic is going.

76
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And /b/ is known for,

77
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
more than anything,

78
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
not just the memes they've created, but the exploits.

79
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and that was the Time 100 poll.

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So somebody at Time, at the magazine,

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
thought it would be fun to nominate me

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
for this thing they did last year.

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And so they placed me on it,

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the Internet got wind of it. My community

86
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
decided they wanted me to win it.

87
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.

88
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.

89
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So they broke that poll.

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I ended up on top.

92
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I ended up at this really fancy party.

93
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But that's not what's interesting about this.

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list;

95
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
they were actually --

96
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed

97
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
all of the top 21 places

98
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME."

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The amount of time and effort that went into that

101
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is absolutely incredible.

102
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And "marble cake" is significant because

103
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.

104
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Anonymous is this group of people

105
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that protested, very famously,

106
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Scientology.

107
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The story is,

108
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.

109
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.

110
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so these people, over 7,000 people,

111
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
less than one month later,

112
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
organized in a hundred cities around the globe and --

113
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
this is L.A. --

114
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
protested the Church of Scientology,

115
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and they have continued to do so,

116
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
now, two full years after the fact.

117
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They are still protesting.

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group

120
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that's come out of the site.

121
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And last, I'm going to show you the example,

122
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the story of Dusty the cat.

123
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat.

124
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This young man

125
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
posted a video

126
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of him abusing his cat on YouTube.

127
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And, you know, this didn't sit well with people,

128
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and so there was this outpouring of support

129
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for people to do something about this.

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So what they did is they -- I mean, they put CSI to shame here --

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the Internet detectives came out.

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They matched, they found his MySpace.

133
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.

134
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Within 24 hours,

135
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
they had his name,

136
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and within 48 hours, he was arrested.

137
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

138
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And so, what I think is really intriguing

139
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about a community like 4chan

140
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is just that it's this open place.

141
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.

142
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And sites like it are kind of

143
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
going the way of the dinosaur right now.

144
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They're endangered because we're moving

145
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
towards social networking.

146
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We're moving towards persistent identity.

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We're moving towards,

148
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
you know, a lack of privacy, really.

149
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so,

150
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
moving towards those things, we're losing something valuable.

151
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Thank you.

152
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

153
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

154
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Got a couple questions for you.

155
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down?

156
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
CP: You're lucky that this is not

157
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
being streamed to them live right now.

158
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
CA: Well, you never know. Some of them --

159
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
we've got people in 75 countries out there watching.

160
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Don't tell.

161
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But seriously,

162
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
this issue on anonymity is --

163
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I mean, you made the case there.

164
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything,

165
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
all the rules gone.

166
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.

167
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I'm just curious whether you

168
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
sometimes lie awake in the night

169
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
worrying that you've opened Pandora's box.

170
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
CP: Yes and no.

171
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I mean, for as much good

172
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that kind of comes out of this environment,

173
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
there is plenty of bad.

174
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
There are plenty of downsides.

175
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But I think that the greater good

176
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is being served here by just allowing people --

177
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
there are very few places, now, where you can go

178
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and not have identity, to be completely anonymous

179
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and say whatever you'd like.

180
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.

181
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line.

182
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But I think it's important to have these places.

183
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
When I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place,

184
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
this outlet, where I can come after work

185
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and be myself."

186
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
CA: But words, saying things,

187
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.

188
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And if you cut the link between what is said

189
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and any attribution back to you,

190
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I mean, surely there are huge risks with that.

191
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
CP: There are, certainly.

192
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But --

193
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
CA: Tell me about what -- I mean, I think you asked the board

194
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
what you might say at TED, right?

195
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
CP: Yeah, I posted a thread

196
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
on Sunday.

197
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And within 24 hours,

198
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it had over 12,000 responses.

199
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And the thing is,

200
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I didn't make it into that presentation

201
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.

202
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

203
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
99 percent of it is just,

204
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
would have been, you know, bleeped out.

205
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But there were some good things that came out of that too.

206
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Love and peace were mentioned.

208
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
CA: Love and peace were mentioned,

209
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
kind of with quote marks around them, right?

210
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.

211
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
CA: And that content is all off the board now.

212
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there?

213
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
CP: I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days.

214
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It went up to about 16,000 posts,

215
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and now it has been taken off.

216
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
CA: Okay, well.

217
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended

218
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.

219
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Chris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue.

220
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You've got this surprising

221
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
semi-underground influence,

222
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but it's not making you a lot of money, yet.

223
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What's the commercial picture here?

224
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
CP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't

225
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
much of one, I guess.

226
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The site has adult content on it.

227
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it,

228
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
just in terms of language alone.

229
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed

230
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
any hope of making lots of money.

231
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
CA: But you still live at home, right?

232
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
CP: I actually moved out recently.

233
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
CA: That's very cool.

234
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

235
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
CP: I got out of Mom's, and I'm back in school right now.

236
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
CA: But what conversations did you or do you

237
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
have with your mother about 4chan?

238
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
CP: At first, very kind of pained,

239
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
awkward conversations.

240
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.

241
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But my parents -- I think part of why

242
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
they kind of are able to appreciate it

243
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is because they don't understand it.

244
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
CA: And they were probably pleased to see you

246
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
on top of the Time poll.

247
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
CP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though.

248
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

249
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
CA: And so, in 10 years' time,

250
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
what do you picture yourself doing?

251
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
CP: That's a good question.

252
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
As I said, I just went back to school,

253
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and I am considering

254
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
majoring in urban studies

255
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and then going on to urban planning,

256
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities

257
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and trying to adapt that

258
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to a physical community.

259
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
CA: Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.

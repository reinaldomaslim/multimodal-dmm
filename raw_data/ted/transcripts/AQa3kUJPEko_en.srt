1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So today I'm going to talk to you

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about the rise of collaborative consumption.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm going to explain what it is

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes --

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that this isn't a flimsy idea,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or a short-term trend,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but a powerful cultural and economic force

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
reinventing not just what we consume,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but how we consume.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Hands up -- how many of you

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
lying around your house

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that you probably won't use again,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Can't see all the hands,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but it looks like all of you, right?

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
On our shelves at home,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we have a box set of the DVD series "24,"

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
season six to be precise.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now my husband, Chris, and I

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
love this show.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you don't really want to watch it again,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So there it sits on our shelves

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
obsolete to us,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but with immediate latent value to someone else.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I lived in New York for 10 years,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So how easily could I swap

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
our unwanted copy of "24"

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now you may have noticed

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is like an online dating service

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for all your unwanted media.

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What it does is use the Internet

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
to create an infinite marketplace

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to match person A's "haves"

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
with person C's "wants,"

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
whatever they may be.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The other week, I went on one of these sites,

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
appropriately called Swaptree,

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and there were over 59,300 items

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that I could instantly swap

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for my copy of "24."

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Lo and behold,

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
who wanted swap his or her

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"like new" copy of "Sex and the City"

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for my copy of "24."

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So in other words, what's happening here

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is that Swaptree

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in approximately 60 seconds.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because it knows the way of the item.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now there are layers of technical wonder

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
behind sites such as Swaptree,

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but that's not my interest,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and nor is swap trading, per se.

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
My passion, and what I've spent the last few years

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
dedicated to researching,

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
inherent in these systems.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
When you think about it,

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
whose real name I didn't know

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and without any money changing hands.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
happen successfully,

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and the one percent that receive a negative rating,

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it's for relatively minor reasons,

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
like the item didn't arrive on time.

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So what's happening here?

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
An extremely powerful dynamic

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that has huge commercial and cultural implications

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is at play.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Namely, that technology

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is enabling

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
trust between strangers.

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We now live in a global village

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
where we can mimic the ties

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that used to happen face to face,

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but on a scale and in ways

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that have never been possible before.

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So what's actually happening

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is that social networks and real-time technologies

97
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
are taking us back.

98
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We're bartering, trading,

99
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
swapping, sharing,

100
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but they're being reinvented

101
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
into dynamic and appealing forms.

102
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
What I find fascinating

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is that we've actually wired our world to share,

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
whether that's our neighborhood, our school,

105
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
our office, or our Facebook network,

106
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and that's creating an economy

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of "what's mine is yours."

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
From the mighty eBay,

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the grandfather of exchange marketplaces,

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to car-sharing companies such as GoGet,

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,

112
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to social lending platforms such as Zopa,

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that will take anyone in this audience

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with 100 dollars to lend,

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we're sharing and collaborating again

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in ways that I believe

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
are more hip than hippie.

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now before I dig into the different systems

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of collaborative consumption,

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I'd like to try and answer the question

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that every author rightfully gets asked,

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which is, where did this idea come from?

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but actually it was a complicated web

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
of seemingly disconnected ideas.

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Over the next minute,

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of all the dots that went on in my head.

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The first thing I began to notice:

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
how many big concepts were emerging --

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --

135
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
around how ridiculously easy it is

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to form groups for a purpose.

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And linked to this crowd mania

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
were examples all around the world --

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
from the election of a president

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
on what the power of numbers could achieve.

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Now, you know when you learn a new word,

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and then you start to see that word everywhere?

144
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's what happened to me

145
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
when I noticed that we are moving

146
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
from passive consumers

147
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to creators,

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to highly enabled collaborators.

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What's happening

150
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is the Internet is removing the middleman,

151
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
so that anyone from a T-shirt designer

152
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to a knitter

153
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
can make a living selling peer-to-peer.

154
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And the ubiquitous force

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of this peer-to-peer revolution

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.

157
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I mean, it's amazing to think

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that, in every single minute of this speech,

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
25 hours

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of YouTube video will be loaded.

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now what I find fascinating about these examples

162
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is how they're actually tapping into

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
our primate instincts.

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I mean, we're monkeys,

165
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.

166
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And we were doing so for thousands of years,

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
whether it's when we hunted in packs,

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
or farmed in cooperatives,

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
before this big system called hyper-consumption came along

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we built these fences

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and created out own little fiefdoms.

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But things are changing,

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and one of the reasons why

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is the digital natives, or Gen-Y.

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They're growing up sharing --

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
files, video games, knowledge.

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's second nature to them.

178
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --

179
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
are like foot soldiers,

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."

181
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The reason why it's happening so fast

182
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is because of mobile collaboration.

183
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We now live in a connected age

184
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
from a small device in our hands.

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
All of this was going through my head

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
towards the end of 2008,

188
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
when, of course, the great financial crash happened.

189
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and he poignantly commented

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that 2008 is when we hit a wall,

192
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
when Mother Nature and the market

193
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
both said, "No more."

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now we rationally know

195
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that an economy built on hyper-consumption

196
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.

197
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.

198
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So all of this is a lot of twittering, right?

199
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,

200
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
until actually I realized it was happening

201
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
because of four key drivers.

202
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community,

203
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.

204
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and real-time technologies,

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
fundamentally changing the way we behave.

207
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.

208
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And four, a global recession

209
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that has fundamentally shocked

210
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
consumer behaviors.

211
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
These four drivers

212
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
are fusing together

213
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and creating the big shift --

214
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
away from the 20th century,

215
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
defined by hyper-consumption,

216
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
towards the 21st century,

217
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
defined by collaborative consumption.

218
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I generally believe we're at an inflection point

219
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
where the sharing behaviors --

220
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
through sites such as Flickr and Twitter

221
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that are becoming second nature online --

222
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.

223
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed

224
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to the way we grow food,

225
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we are consuming and collaborating once again.

226
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I

227
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
have actually gathered thousands of examples

228
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
from all around the world of collaborative consumption.

229
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And although they vary enormously

230
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in scale, maturity and purpose,

231
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
when we dived into them,

232
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.

233
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The first is redistribution markets.

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree,

235
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item

236
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and move it from where it's not needed

237
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to somewhere, or someone, where it is.

238
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
reduce, reuse, recycle, repair

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and redistribute --

241
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because they stretch the life cycle of a product

242
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and thereby reduce waste.

243
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The second is collaborative lifestyles.

244
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This is the sharing of resources

245
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
of things like money, skills and time.

246
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I bet, in a couple of years,

247
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that phrases like "coworking"

248
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and "couchsurfing" and "time banks"

249
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.

250
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles

251
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is called Landshare.

252
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It's a scheme in the U.K.

253
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that matches Mr. Jones,

254
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
with some spare space in his back garden,

255
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.

256
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Together they grow their own food.

257
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,

258
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
you wonder why it's never been done before.

259
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now, the third system

260
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is product-service systems.

261
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product --

262
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
what it does for you --

263
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
without needing to own the product outright.

264
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This idea is particularly powerful

265
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
for things that have

266
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
high-idling capacity.

267
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And that can be anything from baby goods

268
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to fashions to --

269
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
how many of you have a power drill,

270
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
own a power drill? Right.

271
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes

272
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in its entire lifetime.

273
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

274
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's kind of ridiculous, right?

275
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.

276
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

277
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Applause)

278
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So why don't you rent the drill,

279
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people

280
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and make some money from it?

281
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
These three systems are coming together,

282
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
allowing people to share resources

283
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
without sacrificing their lifestyles,

284
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
or their cherished personal freedoms.

285
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I'm not asking people

286
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to share nicely in the sandpit.

287
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So I want to just give you an example

288
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
of how powerful collaborative consumption can be

289
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to change behaviors.

290
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The average car

291
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.

292
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Yet, that car sits idle

293
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
for 23 hours a day.

294
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So when you consider these two facts,

295
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it starts to make a little less sense

296
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that we have to own one outright.

297
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So this is where car-sharing companies

298
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
such as Zipcar and GoGet come in.

299
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
In 2009,

300
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Zipcar took 250 participants

301
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
from across 13 cities --

302
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and they're all self-confessed car addicts

303
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and car-sharing rookies --

304
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and got them to surrender their keys for a month.

305
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Instead, these people had to walk,

306
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
bike, take the train,

307
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
or other forms of public transport.

308
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
They could only use their Zipcar membership

309
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
when absolutely necessary.

310
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The results of this challenge after just one month

311
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
was staggering.

312
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost

313
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
just from the extra exercise.

314
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But my favorite statistic

315
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is that 100

316
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
out of the 250 participants

317
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
did not want their keys back.

318
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
In other words, the car addicts

319
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
had lost their urge to own.

320
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now products-service systems have been around for years.

321
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Just think of libraries and laundrettes.

322
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But I think they're entering a new age,

323
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because technology makes sharing

324
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
frictionless and fun.

325
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times

326
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that said, "Sharing is to ownership

327
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
what the iPod is to the 8-track,

328
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
what solar power is to the coal mine."

329
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I believe also, our generation,

330
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
our relationship to satisfying what we want

331
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is far less tangible

332
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
than any other previous generation.

333
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.

334
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I don't want a clunky answering machine;

335
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I want the message it saves.

336
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.

337
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
In other words, I don't want stuff;

338
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.

339
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
This is fueling a massive shift

340
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
from where usage trumps possessions --

341
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,

342
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
"where access is better than ownership."

343
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Now as our possessions

344
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
dematerialize into the cloud,

345
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
a blurry line is appearing

346
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
between what's mine, what's yours,

347
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and what's ours.

348
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
I want to give you one example

349
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that shows how fast this evolution is happening.

350
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
This represents an eight-year time span.

351
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We've gone from traditional car-ownership

352
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,

353
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to ride-sharing platforms that match rides

354
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,

355
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
where you can actually make money

356
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day

357
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to your neighbor.

358
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Now all of these systems

359
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
require a degree of trust,

360
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and the cornerstone to this working

361
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
is reputation.

362
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Now in the old consumer system,

363
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
our reputation didn't matter so much,

364
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
because our credit history was far more important

365
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that any kind of peer-to-peer review.

366
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.

367
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
With every spammer we flag,

368
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
with every idea we post, comment we share,

369
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
we're actually signaling how well we collaborate,

370
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and whether we can or can't be trusted.

371
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Let's go back to my first example,

372
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Swaptree.

373
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I can see that Rondoron

374
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
has completed 553 trades

375
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
with a 100 percent success rate.

376
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
In other words, I can trust him or her.

377
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Now mark my words,

378
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
it's only a matter of time

379
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search

380
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and see a cumulative picture

381
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
of our reputation capital.

382
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And this reputation capital

383
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
will determine our access to collaborative consumption.

384
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It's a new social currency, so to speak,

385
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that could become as powerful as our credit rating.

386
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Now as a closing thought,

387
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I believe we're actually in a period

388
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
where we're waking up

389
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
from this humongous hangover

390
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
of emptiness and waste,

391
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and we're taking a leap

392
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to create a more sustainable system

393
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
built to serve our innate needs

394
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
for community and individual identity.

395
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I believe it will be referred to

396
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
as a revolution, so to speak --

397
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
when society, faced with great challenges,

398
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
made a seismic shift

399
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
from individual getting and spending

400
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
towards a rediscovery of collective good.

401
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.

402
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.

403
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Because I really believe

404
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
it can disrupt outdated modes of business,

405
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
help us leapfrog

406
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption

407
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and teach us when enough really is enough.

408
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Thank you very much.

409
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Applause)

If you look at a carpenter, they have a toolbox;

3
0:00:14.762,000 --> 0:00:15,000
a dentist, they have their drills.

4
0:00:16.522,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In our era and the type of work most of us are doing,

5
0:00:19.212,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the tool we most need is actually centered

6
0:00:21.912,000 --> 0:00:24,000
around being able to give and receive feedback well.

7
0:00:25.211,000 --> 0:00:27,000
[The Way We Work]

8
0:00:29.612,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Humans have been talking about feedback for centuries.

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In fact, Confucius, way back in 500 BC,

10
0:00:35.286,000 --> 0:00:38,000
talked about how important it is to be able to say difficult messages well.

11
0:00:39.042,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But to be honest, we're still pretty bad at it.

12
0:00:41.802,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In fact, a recent Gallup survey found

13
0:00:44.102,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that only 26 percent of employees strongly agree

14
0:00:48.242,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that the feedback they get actually improves their work.

15
0:00:51.632,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Those numbers are pretty dismal.

16
0:00:53.222,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So what's going on?

17
0:00:54.748,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The way that most people give their feedback

18
0:00:56.844,000 --> 0:00:57,000
actually isn't brain-friendly.

19
0:00:58.322,000 --> 0:01:,000
People fall into one of two camps.

20
0:01:00.522,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Either they're of the camp that is very indirect and soft

21
0:01:04.172,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and the brain doesn't even recognize that feedback is being given

22
0:01:07.467,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or it's just simply confused,

23
0:01:09.202,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or they fall into the other camp of being too direct,

24
0:01:11.962,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and with that, it tips the other person into the land of being defensive.

25
0:01:16.472,000 --> 0:01:18,000
There's this part of the brain called the amygdala,

26
0:01:18.962,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and it's scanning at all times to figure out

27
0:01:21.108,000 --> 0:01:23,000
whether the message has a social threat attached to it.

28
0:01:23.902,000 --> 0:01:25,000
With that, we'll move forward to defensiveness,

29
0:01:26.363,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we'll move backwards in retreat,

30
0:01:28.332,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and what happens is the feedback giver then starts to disregulate as well.

31
0:01:32.602,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They add more ums and ahs and justifications,

32
0:01:35.372,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the whole thing gets wonky really fast.

33
0:01:38.452,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It doesn't have to be this way.

34
0:01:39.953,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I and my team have spent many years going into different companies

35
0:01:43.342,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and asking who here is a great feedback giver.

36
0:01:46.652,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Anybody who's named again and again,

37
0:01:48.662,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we actually bring into our labs to see what they're doing differently.

38
0:01:52.544,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And what we find is that there's a four-part formula

39
0:01:55.642,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that you can use to say any difficult message well.

40
0:01:58.662,000 --> 0:02:,000
OK, are you ready for it? Here we go.

41
0:02:00.695,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The first part of the formula is what we call the micro-yes.

42
0:02:03.782,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Great feedback givers begin their feedback

43
0:02:06.132,000 --> 0:02:09,000
by asking a question that is short but important.

44
0:02:09.932,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It lets the brain know that feedback is actually coming.

45
0:02:13.652,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It would be something, for example, like,

46
0:02:15.681,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"Do you have five minutes to talk about how that last conversation went"

47
0:02:19.125,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or "I have some ideas for how we can improve things.

48
0:02:21.592,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Can I share them with you?"

49
0:02:22.938,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This micro-yes question does two things for you.

50
0:02:25.222,000 --> 0:02:27,000
First of all, it's going to be a pacing tool.

51
0:02:27.633,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It lets the other person know that feedback is about to be given.

52
0:02:30.972,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the second thing it does is it creates a moment of buy-in.

53
0:02:34.172,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I can say yes or no to that yes or no question.

54
0:02:36.912,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And with that, I get a feeling of autonomy.

55
0:02:39.312,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The second part of the feedback formula is going to be giving your data point.

56
0:02:43.094,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Here, you should name specifically what you saw or heard,

57
0:02:46.392,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and cut out any words that aren't objective.

58
0:02:49.312,000 --> 0:02:51,000
There's a concept we call blur words.

59
0:02:51.692,000 --> 0:02:54,000
A blur word is something that can mean different things to different people.

60
0:02:55.374,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Blur words are not specific.

61
0:02:56.952,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So for example, if I say "You shouldn't be so defensive"

62
0:03:00.421,000 --> 0:03:01,000
or "You could be more proactive."

63
0:03:02.442,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What we see great feedback givers doing differently

64
0:03:04.962,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is they'll convert their blur words into actual data points.

65
0:03:08.292,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So for example, instead of saying,

66
0:03:10.692,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"You aren't reliable,"

67
0:03:12.242,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we would say, "You said you'd get that email to me by 11,

68
0:03:15.882,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I still don't have it yet."

69
0:03:17.392,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Specificity is also important when it comes to positive feedback,

70
0:03:20.882,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and the reason for that is that we want to be able to specify exactly

71
0:03:24.402,000 --> 0:03:27,000
what we want the other person to increase or diminish.

72
0:03:27.982,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And if we stick with blur words,

73
0:03:29.592,000 --> 0:03:31,000
they actually won't have any clue particularly

74
0:03:31.806,000 --> 0:03:33,000
what to do going forward to keep repeating that behavior.

75
0:03:34.552,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The third part of the feedback formula is the impact statement.

76
0:03:37.552,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Here, you name exactly how that data point impacted you.

77
0:03:40.512,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So, for example, I might say, "Because I didn't get the message,

78
0:03:43.592,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I was blocked on my work and couldn't move forward"

79
0:03:46.082,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or "I really liked how you added those stories,

80
0:03:48.442,000 --> 0:03:5,000
because it helped me grasp the concepts faster."

81
0:03:50.872,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It gives you a sense of purpose

82
0:03:52.373,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and meaning and logic between the points,

83
0:03:55.192,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which is something the brain really craves.

84
0:03:57.542,000 --> 0:04:,000
The fourth part of the feedback formula is a question.

85
0:04:01.122,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Great feedback givers wrap their feedback message with a question.

86
0:04:05.362,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They'll ask something like,

87
0:04:06.672,000 --> 0:04:07,000
"Well, how do you see it?"

88
0:04:08.092,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Or "This is what I'm thinking we should do,

89
0:04:10.892,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but what are your thoughts on it?"

90
0:04:12.612,000 --> 0:04:15,000
What it does is it creates commitment rather than just compliance.

91
0:04:15.892,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It makes the conversation no longer be a monologue,

92
0:04:18.762,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but rather becomes a joint problem-solving situation.

93
0:04:22.482,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But there's one last thing.

94
0:04:23.792,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Great feedback givers not only can say messages well,

95
0:04:26.732,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but also, they ask for feedback regularly.

96
0:04:29.392,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In fact, our research on perceived leadership

97
0:04:31.711,000 --> 0:04:34,000
shows that you shouldn't wait for feedback to be given to you --

98
0:04:35.372,000 --> 0:04:36,000
what we call push feedback --

99
0:04:37.282,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but rather, you should actively ask for feedback,

100
0:04:39.962,000 --> 0:04:4,000
what we call pulling feedback.

101
0:04:41.772,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Pulling feedback establishes you as a continual learner

102
0:04:45.262,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and puts the power in your hands.

103
0:04:47.432,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The most challenging situations

104
0:04:49.109,000 --> 0:04:51,000
are actually the ones that call for the most skillful feedback.

105
0:04:52.112,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But it doesn't have to be hard.

106
0:04:53.832,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now that you know this four-part formula,

107
0:04:55.832,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you can mix and match it to make it work for any difficult conversation.

1
0:00:12.498,000 --> 0:00:14,000
One summer afternoon in 2013,

2
0:00:15.118,000 --> 0:00:18,000
DC police detained, questioned and searched a man

3
0:00:18.27,000 --> 0:00:21,000
who appeared suspicious and potentially dangerous.

4
0:00:22.136,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This wasn't what I was wearing the day of the detention, to be fair,

5
0:00:25.605,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but I have a picture of that as well.

6
0:00:27.452,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I know it's very frightening -- try to remain calm.

7
0:00:30.172,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:31.289,000 --> 0:00:33,000
At this time, I was interning

9
0:00:33.735,000 --> 0:00:35,000
at the Public Defender Service in Washington DC,

10
0:00:36.491,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I was visiting a police station for work.

11
0:00:38.934,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was on my way out,

12
0:00:40.118,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and before I could make it to my car,

13
0:00:42.134,000 --> 0:00:44,000
two police cars pulled up to block my exit,

14
0:00:44.459,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and an officer approached me from behind.

15
0:00:46.814,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He told me to stop, take my backpack off

16
0:00:49.11,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and put my hands on the police car parked next to us.

17
0:00:52.62,000 --> 0:00:54,000
About a dozen officers then gathered near us.

18
0:00:55.639,000 --> 0:00:56,000
All of them had handguns,

19
0:00:56.91,000 --> 0:00:57,000
some had assault rifles.

20
0:00:58.274,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They rifled through my backpack.

21
0:01:00.032,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They patted me down.

22
0:01:01.461,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They took pictures of me spread on the police car,

23
0:01:03.846,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and they laughed.

24
0:01:05.026,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And as all this was happening --

25
0:01:06.59,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as I was on the police car trying to ignore the shaking in my legs,

26
0:01:09.864,000 --> 0:01:11,000
trying to think clearly about what I should do --

27
0:01:12.223,000 --> 0:01:13,000
something stuck out to me as odd.

28
0:01:14.246,000 --> 0:01:15,000
When I look at myself in this photo,

29
0:01:16.264,000 --> 0:01:17,000
if I were to describe myself,

30
0:01:18.123,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I think I'd say something like,

31
0:01:19.934,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"19-year-old Indian male, bright T-shirt, wearing glasses."

32
0:01:25.347,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But they weren't including any of these details.

33
0:01:27.652,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Into their police radios as they described me,

34
0:01:29.926,000 --> 0:01:31,000
they kept saying, "Middle Eastern male with a backpack.

35
0:01:32.582,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Middle Eastern male with a backpack."

36
0:01:34.635,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And this description carried on into their police reports.

37
0:01:38.239,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I never expected to be described by my own government in these terms:

38
0:01:42.869,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"lurking,"

39
0:01:45.121,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"nefarious,"

40
0:01:47.652,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"terrorist."

41
0:01:48.836,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And the detention dragged on like this.

42
0:01:50.803,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They sent dogs trained to smell explosives to sweep the area I'd been in.

43
0:01:54.705,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They called the federal government to see if I was on any watch lists.

44
0:01:58.156,000 --> 0:02:,000
They sent a couple of detectives to cross-examine me on why,

45
0:02:01.031,000 --> 0:02:03,000
if I claimed I had nothing to hide,

46
0:02:03.171,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I wouldn't consent to a search of my car.

47
0:02:05.241,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I could see they weren't happy with me,

48
0:02:07.326,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but I felt I had no way of knowing what they'd want to do next.

49
0:02:10.433,000 --> 0:02:12,000
At one point, the officer who patted me down

50
0:02:13.354,000 --> 0:02:16,000
scanned the side of the police station to see where the security camera was

51
0:02:16.908,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to see how much of this was being recorded.

52
0:02:19.804,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And when he did that,

53
0:02:20.996,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it really sank in how completely I was at their mercy.

54
0:02:24.49,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I think we're all normalized from a young age

55
0:02:26.937,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to the idea of police officers and arrests and handcuffs,

56
0:02:30.714,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so it's easy to forget how demeaning and coercive a thing it is

57
0:02:34.68,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to seize control over another person's body.

58
0:02:37.609,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I know it sounds like the point of my story

59
0:02:39.678,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is how badly treated I was because of my race --

60
0:02:42.144,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and yes, I don't think I would've been detained if I were white.

61
0:02:45.288,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But actually, what I have in mind today is something else.

62
0:02:48.051,000 --> 0:02:5,000
What I have in mind is how much worse things might've been

63
0:02:50.793,000 --> 0:02:51,000
if I weren't affluent.

64
0:02:51.981,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I mean, they thought I might be trying to plant an explosive,

65
0:02:54.923,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and they investigated that possibility for an hour and a half,

66
0:02:58.116,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but I was never put in handcuffs,

67
0:02:59.852,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I was never taken to a jail cell.

68
0:03:01.888,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I think if I were from one of Washington DC's poor communities of color,

69
0:03:05.972,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and they thought I was endangering officers' lives,

70
0:03:08.419,000 --> 0:03:09,000
things might've ended differently.

71
0:03:10.064,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And in fact, in our system, I think it's better to be an affluent person

72
0:03:13.492,000 --> 0:03:15,000
suspected of trying to blow up a police station

73
0:03:15.804,000 --> 0:03:16,000
than it is to be a poor person

74
0:03:17.495,000 --> 0:03:19,000
who's suspected of much, much less than this.

75
0:03:20.176,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I want to give you an example from my current work.

76
0:03:23.129,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Right now, I'm working at a civil rights organization in DC,

77
0:03:26.403,000 --> 0:03:28,000
called Equal Justice Under Law.

78
0:03:28.759,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Let me start by asking you all a question.

79
0:03:31.692,000 --> 0:03:33,000
How many of you have ever gotten a parking ticket in your life?

80
0:03:34.703,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Raise your hand.

81
0:03:35.891,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Yeah. So have I.

82
0:03:37.861,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And when I had to pay it,

83
0:03:39.218,000 --> 0:03:41,000
it felt annoying and it felt bad,

84
0:03:41.273,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but I paid it and I moved on.

85
0:03:43.213,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well.

86
0:03:46.436,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But what would happen if you couldn't afford the amount on the ticket

87
0:03:50.747,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and your family doesn't have the money either, what happens then?

88
0:03:53.941,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well, one thing that's not supposed to happen under the law is,

89
0:03:56.956,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you're not supposed to be arrested and jailed

90
0:03:59.084,000 --> 0:04:01,000
simply because you can't afford to pay.

91
0:04:01.204,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That's illegal under federal law.

92
0:04:03.032,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But that's what local governments across the country are doing

93
0:04:05.984,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to people who are poor.

94
0:04:07.165,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And so many of our lawsuits at Equal Justice Under Law

95
0:04:10.109,000 --> 0:04:12,000
target these modern-day debtors' prisons.

96
0:04:13.591,000 --> 0:04:15,000
One of our cases is against Ferguson, Missouri.

97
0:04:16.336,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And I know when I say Ferguson,

98
0:04:18.184,000 --> 0:04:2,000
many of you will think of police violence.

99
0:04:20.306,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But today I want to talk about a different aspect

100
0:04:22.617,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of the relationship between their police force and their citizens.

101
0:04:26.107,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Ferguson was issuing an average of over two arrest warrants,

102
0:04:29.665,000 --> 0:04:31,000
per person, per year,

103
0:04:31.696,000 --> 0:04:33,000
mostly for unpaid debt to the courts.

104
0:04:34.816,000 --> 0:04:38,000
When I imagine what that would feel like if, every time I left my house,

105
0:04:38.863,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there was a chance a police officer would run my license plate,

106
0:04:41.987,000 --> 0:04:42,000
see a warrant for unpaid debt,

107
0:04:43.702,000 --> 0:04:45,000
seize my body they way the did in DC

108
0:04:45.856,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and then take me to a jail cell,

109
0:04:47.797,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I feel a little sick.

110
0:04:50.658,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I've met many of the people in Ferguson who have experienced this,

111
0:04:53.838,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I've heard some of their stories.

112
0:04:55.649,000 --> 0:04:56,000
In Ferguson's jail,

113
0:04:57.041,000 --> 0:05:,000
in each small cell, there's a bunk bed and a toilet,

114
0:05:00.174,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but they'd pack four people into each cell.

115
0:05:02.5,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So there'd be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor,

116
0:05:05.639,000 --> 0:05:07,000
one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet,

117
0:05:08.59,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which was never cleaned.

118
0:05:09.774,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,

119
0:05:11.961,000 --> 0:05:14,000
so the floor and the walls were lined with blood and mucus.

120
0:05:15.908,000 --> 0:05:16,000
No water to drink,

121
0:05:17.082,000 --> 0:05:19,000
except coming out of a spigot connected to the toilet.

122
0:05:19.81,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The water looked and tasted dirty,

123
0:05:21.554,000 --> 0:05:22,000
there was never enough food,

124
0:05:23.093,000 --> 0:05:24,000
never any showers,

125
0:05:24.665,000 --> 0:05:26,000
women menstruating without any hygiene products,

126
0:05:27.479,000 --> 0:05:28,000
no medical attention whatsoever.

127
0:05:29.197,000 --> 0:05:31,000
When I asked a woman about medical attention,

128
0:05:31.401,000 --> 0:05:33,000
she laughed, and she said, "Oh, no, no.

129
0:05:33.82,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The only attention you get from the guards in there is sexual."

130
0:05:37.658,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So, they'd take the debtors to this place and they'd say,

131
0:05:40.402,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"We're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt."

132
0:05:43.962,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And if you could -- if you could call a family member

133
0:05:46.616,000 --> 0:05:48,000
who could somehow come up with some money,

134
0:05:48.781,000 --> 0:05:49,000
then maybe you were out.

135
0:05:50.198,000 --> 0:05:52,000
If it was enough money, you were out.

136
0:05:52.381,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But if it wasn't, you'd stay there for days or weeks,

137
0:05:55.723,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and every day the guards would come down to the cells

138
0:05:58.533,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and haggle with the debtors about the price of release that day.

139
0:06:02.445,000 --> 0:06:06,000
You'd stay until, at some point, the jail would be booked to capacity,

140
0:06:06.591,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and they'd want to book someone new in.

141
0:06:08.565,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And at that point, they'd think,

142
0:06:10.15,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"OK, it's unlikely this person can come up with the money,

143
0:06:12.929,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it's more likely this new person will."

144
0:06:14.813,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You're out, they're in, and the machine kept moving like that.

145
0:06:17.815,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I met a man who,

146
0:06:19.865,000 --> 0:06:23,000
nine years ago, was arrested for panhandling in a Walgreens.

147
0:06:24.156,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He couldn't afford his fines and his court fees from that case.

148
0:06:28.236,000 --> 0:06:3,000
When he was young he survived a house fire,

149
0:06:31.256,000 --> 0:06:33,000
only because he jumped out of the third-story window to escape.

150
0:06:34.253,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But that fall left him with damage to his brain

151
0:06:36.478,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and several parts of this body, including his leg.

152
0:06:38.937,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So he can't work,

153
0:06:40.12,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and he relies on social security payments to survive.

154
0:06:42.646,000 --> 0:06:43,000
When I met him in his apartment,

155
0:06:44.356,000 --> 0:06:46,000
he had nothing of value there -- not even food in his fridge.

156
0:06:47.259,000 --> 0:06:48,000
He's chronically hungry.

157
0:06:48.448,000 --> 0:06:51,000
He had nothing of value in his apartment except a small piece of cardboard

158
0:06:51.951,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on which he'd written the names of his children.

159
0:06:54.209,000 --> 0:06:56,000
He cherished this a lot. He was happy to show it to me.

160
0:06:56.811,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But he can't pay his fines and fees because he has nothing to give.

161
0:06:59.995,000 --> 0:07:02,000
In the last nine years, he's been arrested 13 times,

162
0:07:03.385,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and jailed for a total of 130 days on that panhandling case.

163
0:07:08.479,000 --> 0:07:11,000
One of those stretches lasted 45 days.

164
0:07:11.551,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Just imagine spending from right now until sometime in June

165
0:07:15.981,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in the place that I described to you a few moments ago.

166
0:07:20.436,000 --> 0:07:24,000
He told me about all the suicide attempts he's seen in Ferguson's jail;

167
0:07:24.541,000 --> 0:07:26,000
about the time a man found a way to hang himself

168
0:07:26.838,000 --> 0:07:27,000
out of reach of the other inmates,

169
0:07:28.522,000 --> 0:07:31,000
so all they could do was yell and yell and yell,

170
0:07:31.708,000 --> 0:07:32,000
trying to get the guards' attention

171
0:07:33.472,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so they could come down and cut him down.

172
0:07:35.489,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond,

173
0:07:38.949,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and when they came, the man was unconscious.

174
0:07:41.241,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So they called the paramedics and the paramedics went to the cell.

175
0:07:44.436,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They said, "He'll be OK,"

176
0:07:45.792,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so they just left him there on the floor.

177
0:07:48.02,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I heard many stories like this and they shouldn't have surprised me,

178
0:07:51.338,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because suicide is the single leading cause of death in our local jails.

179
0:07:55.672,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This is related to the lack of mental health care in our jails.

180
0:07:58.683,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I met a woman, single mother of three, making seven dollars an hour.

181
0:08:02.627,000 --> 0:08:04,000
She relies on food stamps to feed herself and her children.

182
0:08:05.928,000 --> 0:08:06,000
About a decade ago,

183
0:08:07.496,000 --> 0:08:1,000
she got a couple of traffic tickets and a minor theft charge,

184
0:08:11.285,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and she can't afford her fines and fees on those cases.

185
0:08:14.546,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Since then, she's been jailed about 10 times on those cases,

186
0:08:18.07,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but she has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,

187
0:08:20.377,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and she needs medication every day.

188
0:08:22.552,000 --> 0:08:25,000
She doesn't have access to those medications in Ferguson's jail,

189
0:08:25.614,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because no one has access to their medications.

190
0:08:27.854,000 --> 0:08:31,000
She told me about what it was like to spend two weeks in a cage,

191
0:08:31.904,000 --> 0:08:34,000
hallucinating people and shadows and hearing voices,

192
0:08:35.481,000 --> 0:08:37,000
begging for the medication that would make it all stop,

193
0:08:38.099,000 --> 0:08:39,000
only to be ignored.

194
0:08:40.19,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And this isn't anomalous, either:

195
0:08:42.06,000 --> 0:08:45,000
thirty percent of women in our local jails have serious mental health needs

196
0:08:45.609,000 --> 0:08:46,000
just like hers,

197
0:08:46.789,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but only one in six receives any mental health care while in jail.

198
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And so, I heard all these stories about this grotesque dungeon

199
0:08:55.179,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that Ferguson was operating for its debtors,

200
0:08:57.401,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and when it came time for me to actually see it

201
0:08:59.718,000 --> 0:09:,000
and to go visit Ferguson's jail,

202
0:09:01.696,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I'm not sure what I was expecting to see,

203
0:09:03.76,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but I wasn't expecting this.

204
0:09:06.315,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's an ordinary government building.

205
0:09:08.178,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It could be a post office or a school.

206
0:09:10.658,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It reminded me that these illegal extortion schemes

207
0:09:14.374,000 --> 0:09:16,000
aren't being run somewhere in the shadows,

208
0:09:16.486,000 --> 0:09:18,000
they're being run out in the open by our public officials.

209
0:09:19.226,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They're a matter of public policy.

210
0:09:20.95,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And this reminded me that poverty jailing in general,

211
0:09:23.813,000 --> 0:09:25,000
even outside the debtors' prison context,

212
0:09:26.045,000 --> 0:09:28,000
plays a very visible and central role in our justice system.

213
0:09:29.638,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What I have in mind is our policy of bail.

214
0:09:31.874,000 --> 0:09:33,000
In our system, whether you're detained or free,

215
0:09:34.45,000 --> 0:09:37,000
pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are

216
0:09:37.604,000 --> 0:09:39,000
or how much of a flight risk you pose.

217
0:09:39.876,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's a matter of whether you can afford to post your bail amount.

218
0:09:42.986,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So Bill Cosby, whose bail was set at a million dollars,

219
0:09:45.722,000 --> 0:09:48,000
immediately writes the check, and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.

220
0:09:49.206,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But Sandra Bland, who died in jail,

221
0:09:50.962,000 --> 0:09:53,000
was only there because her family was unable to come up with 500 dollars.

222
0:09:54.984,000 --> 0:09:57,000
In fact, there are half a million Sandra Blands across the country --

223
0:09:58.395,000 --> 0:10:,000
500,000 people who are in jail right now,

224
0:10:00.685,000 --> 0:10:02,000
only because they can't afford their bail amount.

225
0:10:03.37,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We're told that our jails are places for criminals,

226
0:10:06.451,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but statistically that's not the case:

227
0:10:08.488,000 --> 0:10:12,000
three out of every five people in jail right now are there pretrial.

228
0:10:12.813,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They haven't been convicted of any crime;

229
0:10:15.019,000 --> 0:10:17,000
they haven't pled guilty to any offense.

230
0:10:18.171,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Right here in San Francisco,

231
0:10:19.539,000 --> 0:10:22,000
85 percent of the inmates in our jail in San Francisco

232
0:10:22.953,000 --> 0:10:23,000
are pretrial detainees.

233
0:10:24.721,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This means San Francisco is spending something like 80 million dollars

234
0:10:28.13,000 --> 0:10:29,000
every year

235
0:10:29.324,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to fund pretrial detention.

236
0:10:33.06,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Many of these people who are in jail only because they can't post bail

237
0:10:37.503,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are facing allegations so minor

238
0:10:39.773,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that the amount of time it would take for them to sit waiting for trial

239
0:10:43.18,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is longer than the sentence they would receive if convicted,

240
0:10:46.256,000 --> 0:10:48,000
which means they're guaranteed to get out faster

241
0:10:48.548,000 --> 0:10:49,000
if they just plead guilty.

242
0:10:49.856,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So now the choice is:

243
0:10:51.439,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Should I stay here in this horrible place,

244
0:10:54.336,000 --> 0:10:56,000
away from my family and my dependents,

245
0:10:56.47,000 --> 0:10:58,000
almost guaranteed to lose my job,

246
0:10:58.971,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and then fight the charges?

247
0:11:00.616,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Or should I just plead guilty to whatever the prosecutor wants and get out?

248
0:11:04.209,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And at this point, they're pretrial detainees, not criminals.

249
0:11:07.168,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But once they take that plea deal, we'll call them criminals,

250
0:11:10.084,000 --> 0:11:13,000
even though an affluent person would never have been in this situation,

251
0:11:13.488,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because an affluent person would have simply been bailed out.

252
0:11:16.386,000 --> 0:11:18,000
At this point you might be wondering,

253
0:11:18.5,000 --> 0:11:2,000
"This guy's in the inspiration section, what is he doing --

254
0:11:21.318,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Laughter)

255
0:11:22.502,000 --> 0:11:24,000
"This is extremely depressing. I want my money back."

256
0:11:25.332,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

257
0:11:26.562,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But in actuality,

258
0:11:28.985,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I find talking about jailing much less depressing than the alternative,

259
0:11:33.399,000 --> 0:11:35,000
because I think if we don't talk about these issues

260
0:11:35.859,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and collectively change how we think about jailing,

261
0:11:38.284,000 --> 0:11:39,000
at the end of all of our lives,

262
0:11:39.812,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we'll still have jails full of poor people who don't belong there.

263
0:11:42.967,000 --> 0:11:43,000
That really is depressing to me.

264
0:11:44.545,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But what's exciting to me is the thought that these stories can move us

265
0:11:47.993,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to think about jailing in different terms.

266
0:11:50.06,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Not in sterile policy terms like "mass incarceration,"

267
0:11:53.455,000 --> 0:11:54,000
or "sentencing of nonviolent offenders,"

268
0:11:55.465,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but in human terms.

269
0:11:56.655,000 --> 0:12:,000
When we put a human being in a cage for days or weeks or months

270
0:12:01.264,000 --> 0:12:02,000
or even years,

271
0:12:02.732,000 --> 0:12:04,000
what are we doing to that person's mind and body?

272
0:12:05.105,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Under what conditions are we really willing to do that?

273
0:12:08.389,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And so if starting with a few hundred of us in this room,

274
0:12:11.219,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we can commit to thinking about jailing in this different light,

275
0:12:14.287,000 --> 0:12:17,000
then we can undo that normalization I was referring to earlier.

276
0:12:17.791,000 --> 0:12:2,000
If I leave you with anything today, I hope it's with the thought

277
0:12:20.853,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that if we want anything to fundamentally change --

278
0:12:23.309,000 --> 0:12:26,000
not just to reform our policies on bail and fines and fees --

279
0:12:26.613,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but also to make sure that whatever new policies replace those

280
0:12:29.69,000 --> 0:12:32,000
don't punish the poor and the marginalized in their own new way.

281
0:12:32.765,000 --> 0:12:33,000
If we want that kind of change,

282
0:12:34.421,000 --> 0:12:36,000
then this shift in thinking is required of each of us.

283
0:12:36.97,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Thank you.

284
0:12:38.178,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Applause)

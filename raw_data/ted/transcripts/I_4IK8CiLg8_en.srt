1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I think it was in my second grade that I was caught

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was sent straight away to my school principal,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and my school principal, a sweet nun,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
looked at my book with disgust,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes --

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her --

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the nun slapped me on my face and said,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun."

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I had no clue what she was talking about,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again

12
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
until the ninth grade.

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Thanks to a really boring lecture,

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I started caricaturing my teachers in school.

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm not on top of the class.

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So what I did was I quickly put together

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
a collage of all the teachers I had drawn,

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
glorified my school principal, put him right on top,

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and gifted it to him.

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
He had a good laugh at the other teachers

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and put it up on the notice board.

27
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is a part of that.

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I became a school hero.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I have to tell you a little bit about my family.

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
That's my mother. I love her to bits.

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
She's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
She's a bit of a hippie.

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
She said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.

36
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The rest of my family are boring academics,

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
My father's a little different.

39
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My father believed in a holistic approach to living,

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and, you know, every time he taught us,

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
he'd say, "I hate these books,

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution."

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
While he still held that worldview, I was 16,

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I got the best lawyer in town,

45
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
my older brother Karthik,

46
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from today onwards I've decided

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'm going to be disciplined,

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'm going to be curious,

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'm going to learn something new every day,

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'm going to be very hard working,

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and I'm not going to depend on you

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
emotionally or financially."

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I said, "Hold that thought."

56
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I said, "Can I quit school then?"

57
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But, to cut a long story short,

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.

60
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
anything for anyone who wanted to use my services.

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But, most importantly, while I was traveling,

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I taught children cartooning,

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And mad and crazy and fun.

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
When I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
When I was 18 I started my own school.

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
However, an 18 year-old trying to start a school

69
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is not easy unless you have a big patron

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or a big supporter.

71
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India

72
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
when I saw that the Prime Minister of India

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
was visiting my home town, Bangalore.

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And, you know, just like how

75
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
every cartoonist knows Bush here,

76
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and if you had to meet Bush,

77
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it would be the funnest thing because

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
his face was a cartoonist's delight.

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I had to meet my Prime Minister.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I went to the place where

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
his helicopter was about to land.

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I saw layers of security.

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I caricatured my way through three layers

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
by just impressing the guards,

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.

86
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And what happened was, to my luck,

87
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I saw a nuclear scientist

88
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
at whose party I had done cartoons.

89
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?"

90
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
He said, "Oh, so am I."

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I hopped into his car, and off we went

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
through the remaining layers of security.

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Applause)

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Thank you.

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I sat him down, I caricatured him,

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
This is one I remember fondly.

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because I altered the map of New York, if you notice.

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you --

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Should I just turn that off?

106
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The next slide I'm about to show you,

107
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is a little more serious.

108
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I was hesitant to include this in my presentation

109
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because this cartoon was published

110
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
soon after 9/11.

111
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
What was, for me, a very naive observation,

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
turned out to be a disaster.

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
hundreds of people telling me how they

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
could have lived another day without seeing this.

116
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I was also asked to leave the organization,

117
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
a cartoonists' organization in America,

118
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that for me was my lifeline.

119
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
art comes with responsibility.

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Anyway, what I did was I decided

122
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that I need to take a break.

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I decided to go traveling.

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
When I went traveling, I remember,

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I met this fabulous old man,

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
who I met when I was caricaturing,

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
who turned out to be an artist, in Italy.

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
He invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit."

131
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
hanging from the ceiling.

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And I asked him, and he said,

136
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.

137
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In the morning, I am born again."

138
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I thought he was koo koo,

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but something about that really stuck.

140
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again."

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, I wanted to be a painter like him,

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
except, I don't know how to paint.

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So, I tried going to the art store.

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Forget it, they will confuse you

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
even if you know how to draw.

148
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.

149
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I'm going to show you a very quick clip

150
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to show you how I painted and a little bit

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
about my city, Bangalore.

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Music)

153
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They had to be larger than life.

154
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.

155
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And even bigger.

156
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.

157
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It was so exciting.

158
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Except, I even started painting dancers.

159
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Here for example is a Flamenco dancer,

160
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
except there was one problem.

161
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,

162
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and I made some money,

163
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
sold my paintings and would rush off

164
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to France or Spain and work with them.

165
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.

166
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But I had one problem, my paintings never danced.

167
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
As much energy as I put into them

168
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
while making them, they never danced.

169
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So I decided -- I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.

170
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I called my friends, painted on their bodies,

171
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and had them dance in front of a painting.

172
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.

173
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And then I was fortunate enough

174
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.

175
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I sat like you guys there in the audience.

176
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And I saw my work come alive.

177
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You know, normally you work in isolation,

178
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and you show at a gallery,

179
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but here, the work was coming alive,

180
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and it had some other artists working with me.

181
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The collaborative effort was fabulous.

182
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.

183
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I started doing fashion.

184
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This is a fashion show we held in London.

185
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The best collaboration, of course, is with children.

186
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They are ruthless, they are honest,

187
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but they're full of energy and fun.

188
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.

189
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And I must say, I spent time in the Bronx

190
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
working with these kids.

191
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And, in exchange for me working with them,

192
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
they taught me how to be cool.

193
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.

194
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."

195
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Then I said, all this is good,

197
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but I want to paint like a real painter.

198
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
American education is so expensive.

199
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I was in India, and I was walking down the streets,

200
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I saw a billboard painter.

201
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And these guys paint humongous paintings,

202
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and they look really good.

203
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I wondered how they did it from so close.

204
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,

205
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?"

206
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,

207
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but we're leaving the city,

208
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because billboard painters are a dying,

209
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
extinct bunch of artists,

210
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them."

211
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I said, in exchange for education in how to paint,

212
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I will support them, and I started a company.

213
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And since then, I've been painting all over the place.

214
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.

215
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This is another painting.

216
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And, in fact, I started painting on anything,

217
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and started sending them around town.

218
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration

219
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
has been with her, Netra.

220
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Netra and I met when she was 18.

221
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I must have been 19 and a half then,

222
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and it was love at first sight.

223
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
I lived in India. She lived in America.

224
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
She'd come every two months to visit me,

225
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and then I said I'm the man,

226
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.

227
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.

228
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I did that twice, and I went broke.

229
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"

230
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
She said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?

231
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.

232
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We'll try and con them into buying it,

233
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and then..."

234
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But it turned out, after I sent the works to her,

235
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that her dad's friends,

236
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
like most of you, are geeks.

237
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I'm joking.

238
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

239
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
No, they were really big geeks,

240
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and they didn't know much about art.

241
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.

242
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So what we did was we rented a little van

243
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.

244
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
She contacted anyone and everyone

245
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
who was willing to buy my work.

246
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
She made enough money, she sold off the whole collection

247
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and made enough money to move me for four years

248
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
with lawyers, a company, everything,

249
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and she became my manager.

250
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
That's us in New York.

251
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Notice one thing,

252
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we're equal here.

253
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Something happened along the line.

254
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

255
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But this brought me -- with Netra managing my career --

256
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
it brought me a lot of success.

257
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.

258
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I loved the attention.

259
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is all the press we got, and we said,

260
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
it's time to celebrate.

261
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.

262
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I said, "Let's get married."

263
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,

264
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
all the people who bought our work."

265
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,

266
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list,

267
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but I was determined to bring them to India, so --

268
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
a lot of them were in India.

269
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.

270
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
We had fashion designers, installation artists,

271
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,

272
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
all kinds of people working with me

273
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to make my wedding an art installation.

274
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.

275
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.

276
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But all this excitement led

277
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to the press writing about us.

278
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,

279
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.

280
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
My mother fell very ill.

281
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I love my mother

282
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.

283
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And they said you have to say bye to her,

284
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
you have to do what you have to do.

285
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I was devastated.

286
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I had shows booked up for another year.

287
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I was on a high.

288
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And I couldn't. I could not.

289
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
My life was not exuberant.

290
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I could not live this larger than life person.

291
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.

292
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Of course, my work turned ugly,

293
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but another thing happened.

294
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I lost all my audiences.

295
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The Bollywood stars who I would party with

296
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and buy my work disappeared.

297
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
The collectors, the friends, the press,

298
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
everyone said, "Nice, but thank you."

299
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"No thank you," was more like it.

300
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But I wanted people to actually

301
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
feel my work from their gut,

302
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because I was painting it from my gut.

303
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
If they wanted beauty,

304
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.

305
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Of course, none of them liked it.

306
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
My works also turned autobiographical.

307
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
At this point, something else happened.

308
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
A very, very dear friend of mine

309
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
came out of the closet,

310
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,

311
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.

312
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I was very upset.

313
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up

314
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
as a little girl -- that's me there --

315
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.

316
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Laughter)

317
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.

318
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It's a secret.

319
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So, after this, my works turned a little violent.

320
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.

321
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.

322
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
This time, not only did my collectors disappear,

323
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
the political activists decided to ban me

324
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and to threaten me

325
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and to forbid me from showing.

326
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.

327
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.

328
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So, I decided it was time

329
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
to end and go back home.

330
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
This time I said let's try something different.

331
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I need to be reborn again.

332
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,

333
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
the best way to have a new lease on life,

334
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is to have a child.

335
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I decided to have a child,

336
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.

337
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
How can a family get dysfunctional?

338
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And Rudra was born.

339
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
That's my little son.

340
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And two magical things happened after he was born.

341
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
My mother miraculously recovered

342
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
after a serious operation,

343
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and this man was elected president of this country.

344
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
You know I sat at home and I watched.

345
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.

346
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So Netra and I wound up our life,

347
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
closed up everything we had,

348
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and we decided to move to New York.

349
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And this was just eight months ago.

350
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I moved back to New York, my work has changed.

351
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Everything about my work has become more whimsical.

352
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
This one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?"

353
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It talks about mental incest.

354
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.

355
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.

356
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.

357
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Laughter)

358
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
These are just different cartoons.

359
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story.

360
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I was talking to mother and father this morning,

361
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say,

362
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
but you have to talk about your work with children."

363
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
So I said, okay.

364
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I work with children all over the world,

365
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and that's an entirely different talk,

366
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but I want to leave you with one story

367
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that really, really inspired me.

368
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I met Belinda when she was 16.

369
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I was 17.

370
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I was in Australia,

371
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and Belinda had cancer,

372
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and I was told she's not going to live very long.

373
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
They, in fact, told me three weeks.

374
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,

375
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.

376
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head

377
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and I drew a crown for her.

378
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time --

379
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
I told her how I ended up in Australia,

380
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,

381
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and all the stories.

382
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And I drew it out for her.

383
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And then I left.

384
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Belinda died

385
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and within a few days of her death,

386
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
they published a book for her,

387
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and she used my cartoon on the cover.

388
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And she wrote a little note, she said,

389
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world."

390
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
For me, my art is my magic carpet ride.

391
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,

392
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and touch children and be honest.

393
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Thank you so much.

394
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Applause)

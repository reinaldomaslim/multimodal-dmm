1
0:00:12.917,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Do you think the things we build today

2
0:00:15.667,000 --> 0:00:17,000
will be considered wonders in the future?

3
0:00:19.042,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Think of Stonehenge,

4
0:00:20.708,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the Pyramids,

5
0:00:22.25,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Machu Picchu and Easter Island.

6
0:00:26.167,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, they're all pretty different from what we're doing today,

7
0:00:30.333,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with those massive stones,

8
0:00:32.792,000 --> 0:00:36,000
assembled in complex but seemingly illogical ways,

9
0:00:38.292,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and all traces of their construction

10
0:00:41.958,000 --> 0:00:42,000
erased,

11
0:00:43.625,000 --> 0:00:45,000
shrouding them in mystery.

12
0:00:47.417,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It seems like people could not have possibly built these things,

13
0:00:52.583,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because people didn't.

14
0:00:54.792,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They were carefully crafted by a primordial race of giants

15
0:00:59.125,000 --> 0:01:,000
known as Cyclops.

16
0:01:00.417,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:01.75,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I've been collaborating with these monsters

18
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to learn their secrets for moving those massive stones.

19
0:01:08.667,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And as it turns out, Cyclops aren't even that strong.

20
0:01:13.25,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They're just really smart about getting material to work for them.

21
0:01:19.042,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now, the videos you see behind me of large, stone-like, wobbly creatures

22
0:01:23.5,000 --> 0:01:24,000
are the results of this collaboration.

23
0:01:26.875,000 --> 0:01:28,000
OK, so Cyclops might be a mythical creature,

24
0:01:30.917,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but those wonders are still real.

25
0:01:33.792,000 --> 0:01:34,000
People made them.

26
0:01:35.917,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But they also made the myths that surround them,

27
0:01:39.667,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and when it comes to wonders, there's this thick connective tissue

28
0:01:43.5,000 --> 0:01:45,000
between mythology and reality.

29
0:01:47.083,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Take Easter Island, for example.

30
0:01:49.958,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When the Dutch explorers first encountered the island,

31
0:01:53.125,000 --> 0:01:55,000
they asked the people of Rapa Nui

32
0:01:55.167,000 --> 0:01:58,000
how their ancestors could have possibly moved those massive statues.

33
0:01:59.833,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the Rapa Nui said,

34
0:02:01.833,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Our ancestors didn't move the statues,

35
0:02:05.5,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because the statues walked themselves."

36
0:02:09.5,000 --> 0:02:11,000
For centuries, this was dismissed, but actually it's true.

37
0:02:13.083,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The statues, known as moai, were transported standing,

38
0:02:18.5,000 --> 0:02:19,000
pivoting from side to side.

39
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:22,000
OK?

40
0:02:23.042,000 --> 0:02:26,000
As spectacular as the moai are for visitors today,

41
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you have to imagine being there then,

42
0:02:29.542,000 --> 0:02:32,000
with colossal moai marching around the island.

43
0:02:32.958,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Because the real memorial was not the objects themselves,

44
0:02:38.167,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it was the cultural ritual of bringing a stone to life.

45
0:02:43.708,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So as an architect, I've been chasing that dream.

46
0:02:47.458,000 --> 0:02:51,000
How can we shift our idea of construction to accommodate that mythical side?

47
0:02:53.583,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So what I've been doing is challenging myself

48
0:02:55.75,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with putting on a series of performances

49
0:02:58.875,000 --> 0:03:,000
of the ancient but pretty straightforward task

50
0:03:01.5,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of just moving and standing big heavy objects,

51
0:03:05.542,000 --> 0:03:08,000
like this 16-foot-tall megalith designed to walk across land

52
0:03:09.5,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and stand vertically;

53
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or this 4,000-pound behemoth that springs itself to life

54
0:03:16.417,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to dance onstage.

55
0:03:19.792,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And what I've found is that by thinking of architecture

56
0:03:23.167,000 --> 0:03:26,000
not as an end product but as a performance

57
0:03:26.75,000 --> 0:03:29,000
from conception to completion,

58
0:03:30.125,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we end up rediscovering some really smart ways to build things today.

59
0:03:35.375,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You know, so much of the discussion surrounding our future

60
0:03:38.167,000 --> 0:03:41,000
focuses on technology, efficiency and speed.

61
0:03:42.167,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But if I've learned anything from Cyclops,

62
0:03:44.25,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it's that wonders can be smart, spectacular

63
0:03:48.792,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and sustainable --

64
0:03:50.5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because of their mass and their mystery.

65
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And while people still want to know how those ancient wonders were built,

66
0:03:57.833,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I've been asking Cyclops how to create the mystery

67
0:04:00.667,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that compels people to ask that very question.

68
0:04:04.375,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Because in an era where we design buildings

69
0:04:06.458,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to last 30, maybe 60 years,

70
0:04:09.875,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I would love to learn how to create something

71
0:04:12.542,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that could entertain for an eternity.

72
0:04:15.083,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Thank you.

73
0:04:16.375,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

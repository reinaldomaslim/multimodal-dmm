0:00:12.9,000 --> 0:00:16,000
There's an ancient parable about a farmer who lost his horse.

2
0:00:17.015,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And neighbors came over to say, "Oh, that's too bad."

3
0:00:20.413,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the farmer said, "Good or bad, hard to say."

4
0:00:24.649,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Days later, the horse returns and brings with it seven wild horses.

5
0:00:30.183,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And neighbors come over to say, "Oh, that's so good!"

6
0:00:33.824,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And the farmer just shrugs and says, "Good or bad, hard to say."

7
0:00:39.579,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The next day, the farmer's son rides one of the wild horses,

8
0:00:43.675,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is thrown off and breaks his leg.

9
0:00:46.185,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And the neighbors say, "Oh, that's terrible luck."

10
0:00:49.514,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And the farmer says, "Good or bad, hard to say."

11
0:00:54.587,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Eventually, officers come knocking on people's doors,

12
0:00:57.282,000 --> 0:00:59,000
looking for men to draft for an army,

13
0:00:59.965,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and they see the farmer's son and his leg and they pass him by.

14
0:01:03.562,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And neighbors say, "Ooh, that's great luck!"

15
0:01:06.142,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And the farmer says, "Good or bad, hard to say."

16
0:01:11.136,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I first heard this story 20 years ago,

17
0:01:13.607,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I have since applied it 100 times.

18
0:01:16.218,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Didn't get the job I wanted:

19
0:01:18.734,000 --> 0:01:19,000
good or bad, hard to say.

20
0:01:20.905,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Got the job I wanted:

21
0:01:23.298,000 --> 0:01:25,000
good or bad, hard to say.

22
0:01:25.972,000 --> 0:01:28,000
To me, the story is not about looking on the bright side

23
0:01:29.25,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or waiting to see how things turn out.

24
0:01:32.055,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's about how eager we can be to label a situation,

25
0:01:35.762,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to put concrete around it by judging it.

26
0:01:38.901,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But reality is much more fluid,

27
0:01:41.992,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and good and bad are often incomplete stories that we tell ourselves.

28
0:01:46.862,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The parable has been my warning

29
0:01:49.276,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that by gripping tightly to the story of good or bad,

30
0:01:52.924,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I close down my ability to truly see a situation.

31
0:01:56.702,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I learn more when I proceed and loosen my grip

32
0:02:00.336,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and proceed openly with curiosity and wonder.

33
0:02:04.415,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But seven years ago,

34
0:02:07.073,000 --> 0:02:09,000
when I was pregnant with my first child,

35
0:02:09.196,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I completely forgot this lesson.

36
0:02:12.471,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I believed I knew wholeheartedly what was good.

37
0:02:15.644,000 --> 0:02:16,000
When it came to having kids,

38
0:02:17.377,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I thought that good was some version of a superbaby,

39
0:02:20.913,000 --> 0:02:23,000
some ultrahealthy human who possessed not a single flaw

40
0:02:24.901,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and would practically wear a cape flying into her superhero future.

41
0:02:29.674,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I took DHA pills to ensure that my baby had a super-high-functioning,

42
0:02:34.445,000 --> 0:02:35,000
supersmart brain,

43
0:02:35.754,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and I ate mostly organic food,

44
0:02:38.451,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I trained for a medication-free labor,

45
0:02:41.03,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I did many other things

46
0:02:42.875,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because I thought these things would help me make not just a good baby,

47
0:02:47.125,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but the best baby possible.

48
0:02:50.693,000 --> 0:02:54,000
When my daughter Fiona was born, she weighed 4 pounds, 12 ounces,

49
0:02:55.406,000 --> 0:02:57,000
or 2.15 kilograms.

50
0:02:58.514,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The pediatrician said there were only two possible explanations

51
0:03:02.43,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for her tiny size.

52
0:03:04.072,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"Either," he said, "it's bad seed,"

53
0:03:07.744,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"or it's bad soil."

54
0:03:09.773,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I wasn't so tired from labor to lose the thread of his logic:

55
0:03:14.64,000 --> 0:03:16,000
my newborn, according to the doctor,

56
0:03:16.959,000 --> 0:03:17,000
was a bad plant.

57
0:03:19.873,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Eventually, I learned that my daughter had an ultra-rare chromosomal condition

58
0:03:24.156,000 --> 0:03:26,000
called Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.

59
0:03:26.196,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She was missing a chunk of her fourth chromosome.

60
0:03:29.83,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And although my daughter was good --

61
0:03:33.039,000 --> 0:03:34,000
she was alive,

62
0:03:34.42,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and she had brand new baby skin

63
0:03:36.501,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and the most aware onyx eyes --

64
0:03:39.968,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I also learned that people with her syndrome

65
0:03:42.112,000 --> 0:03:45,000
have significant developmental delays and disabilities.

66
0:03:45.43,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Some never learn to walk or talk.

67
0:03:48.747,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I did not have the equanimity of the farmer.

68
0:03:52.176,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The situation looked unequivocally bad to me.

69
0:03:56.177,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But here's where the parable is so useful,

70
0:03:59.428,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because for weeks after her diagnosis, I felt gripped by despair,

71
0:04:04.453,000 --> 0:04:07,000
locked in the story that all of this was tragic.

72
0:04:08.293,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Reality, though -- thankfully -- is much more fluid,

73
0:04:12.082,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and it has much more to teach.

74
0:04:15.413,000 --> 0:04:19,000
As I started to get to know this mysterious person who was my kid,

75
0:04:20.204,000 --> 0:04:24,000
my fixed, tight story of tragedy loosened.

76
0:04:24.381,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It turned out my girl loved reggae,

77
0:04:26.774,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and she would smirk when my husband would bounce her tiny body up and down

78
0:04:30.71,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to the rhythm.

79
0:04:31.914,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Her onyx eyes eventually turned the most stunning Lake Tahoe blue,

80
0:04:36.624,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and she loved using them to gaze intently into other people's eyes.

81
0:04:41.376,000 --> 0:04:44,000
At five months old, she could not hold her head up like other babies,

82
0:04:45.207,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but she could hold this deep, intent eye contact.

83
0:04:48.568,000 --> 0:04:52,000
One friend said, "She's the most aware baby I've ever seen."

84
0:04:53.513,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But where I saw the gift of her calm, attentive presence,

85
0:04:57.502,000 --> 0:05:01,000
an occupational therapist who came over to our house to work with Fiona

86
0:05:01.879,000 --> 0:05:03,000
saw a child who was neurologically dull.

87
0:05:04.665,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This therapist was especially disappointed

88
0:05:07.965,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that Fiona wasn't rolling over yet,

89
0:05:10.369,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and so she told me we needed to wake her neurology up.

90
0:05:13.652,000 --> 0:05:15,000
One day she leaned over my daughter's body,

91
0:05:16.595,000 --> 0:05:17,000
took her tiny shoulders,

92
0:05:18.113,000 --> 0:05:2,000
jostled her and said, "Wake up! Wake up!"

93
0:05:21.738,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We had a few therapists visit our house that first year,

94
0:05:24.863,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and they usually focused on what they thought was bad about my kid.

95
0:05:28.613,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I was really happy when Fiona started using her right hand

96
0:05:31.567,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to bully a dangling stuffed sheep,

97
0:05:34.32,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but the therapist was fixated on my child's left hand.

98
0:05:38.027,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Fiona had a tendency not to use this hand very often,

99
0:05:41.143,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and she would cross the fingers on that hand.

100
0:05:44.035,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So the therapist said we should devise a splint,

101
0:05:46.959,000 --> 0:05:5,000
which would rob my kid of the ability to actually use those fingers,

102
0:05:51.128,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but it would at least force them into some position that looked normal.

103
0:05:55.516,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In that first year, I was starting to realize a few things.

104
0:05:58.5,000 --> 0:06:01,000
One: ancient parables aside, my kid had some bad therapists.

105
0:06:02.442,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

106
0:06:03.515,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Two: I had a choice.

107
0:06:05.171,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Like a person offered to swallow a red pill or a blue pill,

108
0:06:09.289,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I could choose to see my daughter's differences as bad;

109
0:06:12.922,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I could strive toward the goal that her therapists called,

110
0:06:16.274,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"You'd never know."

111
0:06:17.484,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They loved to pat themselves on the back when they could say about a kid,

112
0:06:20.978,000 --> 0:06:24,000
"You'd never know he was 'delayed' or 'autistic' or 'different.'"

113
0:06:25.604,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I could believe that the good path was the path that erased

114
0:06:29.459,000 --> 0:06:31,000
as many differences as possible.

115
0:06:32.61,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Of course, this would have been a disastrous pursuit,

116
0:06:35.442,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because at the cellular level, my daughter had rare blueprints.

117
0:06:39.693,000 --> 0:06:41,000
She wasn't designed to be like other people.

118
0:06:42.252,000 --> 0:06:43,000
She would lead a rare life.

119
0:06:44.465,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So, I had another choice: I could drop my story

120
0:06:48.376,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that neurological differences and developmental delays and disabilities

121
0:06:53.682,000 --> 0:06:54,000
were bad,

122
0:06:54.865,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which means I could also drop my story that a more able-bodied life was better.

123
0:07:00.785,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I could release my cultural biases about what made a life good or bad

124
0:07:05.712,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and simply watch my daughter's life as it unfolded

125
0:07:09.32,000 --> 0:07:11,000
with openness and curiosity.

126
0:07:12.593,000 --> 0:07:14,000
One afternoon she was lying on her back,

127
0:07:14.672,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and she arched her back on the carpet

128
0:07:17.836,000 --> 0:07:19,000
stuck her tongue out of the side of her mouth

129
0:07:20.812,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and managed to torque her body onto her belly.

130
0:07:24.866,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Then she tipped over and rolled back onto her back,

131
0:07:27.577,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and once there, she managed to do it all over again,

132
0:07:30.726,000 --> 0:07:33,000
rolling and wiggling her 12-pound self under a coffee table.

133
0:07:34.614,000 --> 0:07:36,000
At first, I thought she'd gotten stuck there,

134
0:07:37.386,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but then I saw her reaching for something that her eye had been on all along:

135
0:07:42.523,000 --> 0:07:43,000
a black electric cord.

136
0:07:44.626,000 --> 0:07:45,000
She was a year old.

137
0:07:46.598,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Other babies her age were for sure pulling up to stand and toddling around,

138
0:07:51.755,000 --> 0:07:52,000
some of them.

139
0:07:53.897,000 --> 0:07:56,000
To some, my kid's situation looked bad:

140
0:07:57.432,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a one-year-old who could only roll.

141
0:07:59.353,000 --> 0:08:,000
But screw that.

142
0:08:00.547,000 --> 0:08:04,000
My kid was enjoying the new, limber freedom of mobility.

143
0:08:05.271,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I rejoiced.

144
0:08:07.326,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Then again, what I watched that afternoon was a baby yanking on an electric cord,

145
0:08:11.925,000 --> 0:08:12,000
so you know,

146
0:08:13.139,000 --> 0:08:14,000
good or bad, hard to say.

147
0:08:14.729,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

148
0:08:16.967,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I started seeing that when I released my grip

149
0:08:20.101,000 --> 0:08:22,000
about what made a life good or bad,

150
0:08:22.468,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I could watch my daughter's life unfold and see what it was.

151
0:08:27.151,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It was beautiful,

152
0:08:28.579,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it was complicated,

153
0:08:31.176,000 --> 0:08:33,000
joyful, hard --

154
0:08:33.299,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in other words: just another expression of the human experience.

155
0:08:40.49,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Eventually, my family and I moved to a new state in America,

156
0:08:43.711,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and we got lucky with a brand-new batch of therapists.

157
0:08:47.628,000 --> 0:08:5,000
They didn't focus on all that was wrong with my kid.

158
0:08:51.09,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They didn't see her differences as problems to fix.

159
0:08:54.139,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They acknowledged her limitations,

160
0:08:56.662,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but they also saw her strengths,

161
0:08:59.345,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and they celebrated her for who she was.

162
0:09:02.931,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Their goal wasn't to make Fiona as normal as possible;

163
0:09:06.463,000 --> 0:09:09,000
their goal was simply to help her be as independent as possible

164
0:09:10.042,000 --> 0:09:14,000
so that she could fulfill her potential, however that looked for her.

165
0:09:14.883,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But the culture at large does not take this open attitude about disabilities.

166
0:09:20.535,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We call congenital differences "birth defects,"

167
0:09:24.027,000 --> 0:09:27,000
as though human beings were objects on a factory line.

168
0:09:27.878,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We might offer pitying expressions

169
0:09:30.205,000 --> 0:09:33,000
when we learn that a colleague had a baby with Down syndrome.

170
0:09:33.527,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We hail a blockbuster film about a suicidal wheelchair user,

171
0:09:37.559,000 --> 0:09:4,000
despite the fact that actual wheelchair users tell us

172
0:09:40.978,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that stereotype is unfair and damaging.

173
0:09:44.247,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And sometimes our medical institutions decide what lives are not worth living.

174
0:09:49.386,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Such is the case with Amelia Rivera,

175
0:09:51.843,000 --> 0:09:53,000
a girl with my daughter's same syndrome.

176
0:09:54.076,000 --> 0:09:57,000
In 2012, a famous American children's hospital

177
0:09:58.022,000 --> 0:10:02,000
initially denied Amelia the right to a lifesaving kidney transplant

178
0:10:02.646,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because, according to their form,

179
0:10:04.634,000 --> 0:10:06,000
as it said, she was "mentally retarded."

180
0:10:07.527,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is the way that the story of disabilities as bad manifests

181
0:10:11.393,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in a culture.

182
0:10:12.843,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But there's a surprisingly insidious counterstory --

183
0:10:16.683,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the story, especially, that people with intellectual disabilities are good

184
0:10:21.354,000 --> 0:10:24,000
because they are here to teach us something magical,

185
0:10:24.645,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or they are inherently angelic and always sweet.

186
0:10:28.977,000 --> 0:10:31,000
You have heard this ableist trope before:

187
0:10:32.376,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the boy with Down syndrome who's one of God's special children,

188
0:10:36.276,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or the girl with the walker and the communication device

189
0:10:40.129,000 --> 0:10:41,000
who is a precious little angel.

190
0:10:42.422,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This story rears its head in my daughter's life

191
0:10:44.753,000 --> 0:10:45,000
around Christmastime,

192
0:10:46.022,000 --> 0:10:48,000
when certain people get positively giddy

193
0:10:48.43,000 --> 0:10:51,000
at the thought of seeing her in angel's wings and a halo

194
0:10:51.66,000 --> 0:10:52,000
at the pageant.

195
0:10:53.112,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The insinuation is that these people don't experience the sticky complexities

196
0:10:58.592,000 --> 0:10:59,000
of being human.

197
0:11:00.457,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And although at times, especially as a baby,

198
0:11:02.958,000 --> 0:11:05,000
my daughter has, in fact, looked angelic,

199
0:11:06.171,000 --> 0:11:08,000
she has grown into the type of kid

200
0:11:08.529,000 --> 0:11:11,000
who does the rascally things that any other kid does,

201
0:11:11.838,000 --> 0:11:15,000
such as when she, at age four, shoved her two-year-old sister.

202
0:11:17.643,000 --> 0:11:2,000
My girl deserves the right to annoy the hell out of you,

203
0:11:20.918,000 --> 0:11:21,000
like any other kid.

204
0:11:23.532,000 --> 0:11:26,000
When we label a person tragic or angelic,

205
0:11:27.089,000 --> 0:11:29,000
bad or good,

206
0:11:29.203,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we rob them of their humanity,

207
0:11:31.75,000 --> 0:11:35,000
along with not only the messiness and complexity that that title brings,

208
0:11:36.045,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but the rights and dignities as well.

209
0:11:40.228,000 --> 0:11:42,000
My girl does not exist to teach me things

210
0:11:42.814,000 --> 0:11:43,000
or any of us things,

211
0:11:44.255,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but she has indeed taught me:

212
0:11:46.441,000 --> 0:11:48,000
number one, how many mozzarella cheese sticks

213
0:11:49.447,000 --> 0:11:52,000
a 22-pound human being can consume in one day --

214
0:11:52.939,000 --> 0:11:54,000
which is five, for the record;

215
0:11:55.512,000 --> 0:12:,000
and two, the gift of questioning my culture's beliefs

216
0:12:00.727,000 --> 0:12:02,000
about what makes a life good

217
0:12:02.97,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and what makes life bad.

218
0:12:04.99,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If you had told me six years ago

219
0:12:07.99,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that my daughter would sometimes use and iPad app to communicate,

220
0:12:11.639,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I might have thought that was sad.

221
0:12:14.644,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But now I recall the first day I handed Fiona her iPad,

222
0:12:18.264,000 --> 0:12:2,000
loaded with a thousand words,

223
0:12:21.005,000 --> 0:12:26,000
each represented by a tiny little icon or little square on her iPad app.

224
0:12:26.167,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And I recall how bold and hopeful it felt,

225
0:12:29.329,000 --> 0:12:34,000
even as some of her therapists said that my expectations were way too high,

226
0:12:34.487,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that she would never be able to hit those tiny targets.

227
0:12:38.276,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I recall watching in awe as she gradually learned

228
0:12:42.493,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to flex her little thumb

229
0:12:44.686,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and hit the buttons to say words she loved,

230
0:12:47.762,000 --> 0:12:49,000
like "reggae" and "cheese"

231
0:12:50.785,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and a hundred other words she loved that her mouth couldn't yet say.

232
0:12:55.216,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And then we had to teach her less-fun words, prepositions --

233
0:12:58.137,000 --> 0:13:,000
words like "of" and "on" and "in."

234
0:13:01.046,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And we worked on this for a few weeks.

235
0:13:03.34,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And then I recall sitting at a dining room table

236
0:13:06.764,000 --> 0:13:07,000
with many relatives,

237
0:13:08.769,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and, apropos of absolutely nothing,

238
0:13:11.903,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Fiona used her iPad app to say,

239
0:13:15.352,000 --> 0:13:17,000
"poop in toilet."

240
0:13:18.194,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

241
0:13:20.168,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Good or bad, hard to say.

242
0:13:22.048,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Laughter)

243
0:13:23.584,000 --> 0:13:25,000
My kid is human, that's all.

244
0:13:25.985,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And that is a lot.

245
0:13:28.268,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you.

246
0:13:29.569,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

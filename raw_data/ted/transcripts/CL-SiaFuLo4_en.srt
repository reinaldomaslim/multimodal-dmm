1
0:00:13.42,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,

2
0:00:15.74,000 --> 0:00:17,000
or should we say, have a seat, mom.

3
0:00:18.46,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Cheers)

4
0:00:21.249,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So no doubt, you guys are like me.

5
0:00:23.18,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You saw the release of Serena

6
0:00:25.82,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in that great yellow bathing suit last week

7
0:00:27.899,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and when I saw it, all I could think of was,

8
0:00:30.34,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Gosh, why couldn't she have waited til we sat onstage for TED?"

9
0:00:34.14,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was very selfish, I know.

10
0:00:36.1,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So I asked you about that picture,

11
0:00:37.78,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and you said nobody was supposed to see that picture.

12
0:00:40.58,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What do you mean?

13
0:00:41.86,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Serena Williams: Well, actually, it was an accident.

14
0:00:44.94,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was on vacation, just taking some time for myself,

15
0:00:47.74,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I have this thing where I've been checking my status

16
0:00:52.74,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and taking pictures every week to see how far along I'm going --

17
0:00:56.1,000 --> 0:00:57,000
GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?

18
0:00:58.02,000 --> 0:01:,000
SW: No, actually I have just been saving it,

19
0:01:00.74,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and I didn't really tell a lot of people,

20
0:01:02.78,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to be quite honest,

21
0:01:04.38,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I'd been saving it,

22
0:01:05.62,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and you know how social media is, you press the wrong button and --

23
0:01:08.9,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:09.94,000 --> 0:01:1,000
GK: And there it was.

25
0:01:11.58,000 --> 0:01:13,000
SW: So 30 minutes later -- my phone doesn't ring that much --

26
0:01:14.5,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and 30 minutes later, I missed like four calls,

27
0:01:16.74,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I'm like, that's weird,

28
0:01:18.1,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and then I picked it up and I was like, oh no.

29
0:01:21.06,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But it was a good moment.

30
0:01:22.3,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I was gonna wait literally just five or six more days -- that's OK.

31
0:01:26.02,000 --> 0:01:29,000
GK: I know, because it was weird, Serena, because it only said 20 weeks,

32
0:01:29.46,000 --> 0:01:31,000
so it's not like there was a whole lot of information on it.

33
0:01:32.34,000 --> 0:01:34,000
SW: Exactly, so that's what I've been doing all this time.

34
0:01:35.1,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I've been just tracking it.

35
0:01:36.46,000 --> 0:01:39,000
18, 19 -- every week I'd just take a picture and save it,

36
0:01:39.9,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I've been so good about it,

37
0:01:41.66,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and this was the one time that I slipped.

38
0:01:45.94,000 --> 0:01:47,000
GK: There you go. Well, congratulations.

39
0:01:48.54,000 --> 0:01:49,000
SW: Yes, thank you.

40
0:01:49.82,000 --> 0:01:51,000
GK: It really is OK. When you heard the news,

41
0:01:51.98,000 --> 0:01:53,000
were you excited? Were you afraid? Were you worried?

42
0:01:54.46,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That you were pregnant, I mean.

43
0:01:56.02,000 --> 0:02:,000
SW: So I heard it two days before the beginning of the Australian Open,

44
0:02:01.02,000 --> 0:02:02,000
which is one of the biggest grand slams.

45
0:02:02.98,000 --> 0:02:03,000
GK: You found out two days before?

46
0:02:04.66,000 --> 0:02:06,000
SW: Yeah, so it was two days before, and I knew.

47
0:02:07.34,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I was nervous.

48
0:02:09.86,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I wasn't quite sure what to think,

49
0:02:11.54,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but I just knew that at that moment

50
0:02:13.3,000 --> 0:02:16,000
it was really important for me to just focus right there

51
0:02:16.38,000 --> 0:02:17,000
at the Australian Open,

52
0:02:17.66,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I was definitely not sure what to do.

53
0:02:21.94,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I was like, can I play?

54
0:02:23.34,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I know it's very dangerous, maybe, sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,

55
0:02:28.82,000 --> 0:02:29,000
so I had a lot of questions.

56
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:33,000
GK: But not only did you play, Ms. Williams, you won.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Cheers)

58
0:02:36.86,000 --> 0:02:37,000
SW: Yeah.

59
0:02:40.3,000 --> 0:02:44,000
May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.

60
0:02:44.38,000 --> 0:02:45,000
SW: Thank you.

61
0:02:45.62,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Applause)

62
0:02:46.86,000 --> 0:02:47,000
GK: While pregnant!

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
SW: Well, I was looking for another handicap, so ... no.

64
0:02:51.62,000 --> 0:02:54,000
GK: Did you play differently that game, knowing you were pregnant?

65
0:02:54.78,000 --> 0:02:56,000
SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.

66
0:02:56.86,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You hear all these stories about people when they're pregnant,

67
0:02:59.82,000 --> 0:03:,000
they get sick and they get tired.

68
0:03:01.46,000 --> 0:03:02,000
GK: Have you had morning sickness?

69
0:03:03.14,000 --> 0:03:05,000
SW: No, I've been so fortunate and so I haven't.

70
0:03:05.94,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But they get really tired and they get really stressed out,

71
0:03:09.06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and I had to really take all that energy,

72
0:03:12.02,000 --> 0:03:14,000
put it in a paper bag, so to say,

73
0:03:14.06,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and throw it away,

74
0:03:15.3,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because I really felt like I didn't have time

75
0:03:17.46,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to deal with any extra emotions, any extra anything,

76
0:03:20.58,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because pregnant or not, no one knew,

77
0:03:23.02,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I was supposed to win that tournament

78
0:03:25.02,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as I am every tournament that I show up.

79
0:03:26.98,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I am expected to win,

80
0:03:28.22,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and if I don't win, it's actually much bigger news.

81
0:03:30.66,000 --> 0:03:32,000
GK: Yeah, when you don't win, that's a big story.

82
0:03:33.02,000 --> 0:03:36,000
SW: Yes, so for me, I had to really take anything negative

83
0:03:36.1,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and any emotions that I was feeling at that point

84
0:03:39.02,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and kind of just bottle them up

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and really figure out what the next step for me to do was.

86
0:03:44.42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
GK: You have a lot of support. You have a lot of love.

87
0:03:47.02,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Even when I was coming here, people stopped me at the airport.

88
0:03:49.98,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I was saying to the flight attendant, the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?"

89
0:03:53.46,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They said, "Oh my God, we're so glad she's pregnant."

90
0:03:55.98,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But then you always have these cranky Yankees.

91
0:03:58.18,000 --> 0:04:01,000
On the way over here, somebody was telling me about Ilie Nastase,

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
who said some very unkind, inappropriate, dare I say racial things.

93
0:04:04.46,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You have responded to him.

94
0:04:05.74,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I'm not even going to dignify what he said,

95
0:04:07.82,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but you responded. Why did you respond?

96
0:04:09.74,000 --> 0:04:11,000
SW: Well, I think there are very inappropriate comments,

97
0:04:12.42,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and not only that, I've been really supportive of my peers

98
0:04:15.18,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and the people that I've worked with.

99
0:04:17.02,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I've been a pro for almost 20 years,

100
0:04:18.78,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and so for me, it's really important to hold women up,

101
0:04:21.34,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and it's something that these young women,

102
0:04:23.38,000 --> 0:04:26,000
they'll come to the locker room, they'll want to take pictures with me,

103
0:04:26.74,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and for me, it's just like,

104
0:04:28.099,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I want to be able to be a good leader and a good example for them.

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So not only --

106
0:04:32.5,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Applause)

107
0:04:33.74,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Not only did he have rude things to say about me and my peers,

108
0:04:37.94,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I felt it was important for us to stand up for each other

109
0:04:40.66,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and to stand up for myself.

110
0:04:42.06,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And at that point it was really important for me to say,

111
0:04:44.78,000 --> 0:04:46,000
like, I'm not afraid, I'm not going anywhere,

112
0:04:47.66,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but this is inappropriate,

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and there's time and there's a place for everything.

114
0:04:52.74,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And that really wasn't the time and the place.

115
0:04:54.94,000 --> 0:04:56,000
GK: We cut the part where you said you're not going anywhere,

116
0:04:57.86,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because you'll be 36 in September. Baby's coming, 36.

117
0:05:00.38,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And your coach said age is always important,

118
0:05:02.62,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but in tennis it's very important,

119
0:05:04.54,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but he has no doubt that you're coming back.

120
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Have you thought, am I coming back?

121
0:05:08.38,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Will I take some time off?

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I know the women on the tour are saying,

123
0:05:12.22,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"How long does it take to have a baby? Two years will she be gone?"

124
0:05:15.42,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What are you thinking?

125
0:05:16.66,000 --> 0:05:18,000
SW: Well, I'm always trying to defy the odds, you know,

126
0:05:19.3,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so for me everything is really mental.

127
0:05:21.66,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I definitely plan on coming back. I'm not done yet.

128
0:05:24.1,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I'm really inspired by my sister.

129
0:05:25.98,000 --> 0:05:27,000
She's a year older than me, and that's something that --

130
0:05:28.66,000 --> 0:05:3,000
if she's still playing, I know I can play.

131
0:05:30.7,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:32.3,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And there's so many -- Roger Federer, he's a little bit older than me

133
0:05:35.66,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and he's still winning everything, so I'm like, I know I can do that too.

134
0:05:39.78,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So that's been so inspiring to me, especially recently,

135
0:05:43.58,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I know that it's something I want to do.

136
0:05:45.78,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And my story is definitely not over yet.

137
0:05:47.98,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I was talking to my coach about it,

138
0:05:49.9,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and we were talking about how this is just a new part of my life,

139
0:05:54.22,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and my baby's going to be in the stands

140
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and hopefully cheering for me, not crying too much.

141
0:05:59.18,000 --> 0:06:01,000
GK: No, you wrote a beautiful letter to your baby yesterday

142
0:06:01.98,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that you said -- from the oldest mommy to the youngest one,

143
0:06:04.78,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to the oldest, to the youngest, I can't wait for you to get here.

144
0:06:07.94,000 --> 0:06:08,000
A lot of people feel that.

145
0:06:09.38,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I saw you about a year ago, because I think about your life, Serena.

146
0:06:12.62,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You've had three life-changing things in a six-month time:

147
0:06:16.3,000 --> 0:06:19,000
pregnant, huge win, fell in love.

148
0:06:19.54,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And when I saw you last year,

149
0:06:21.42,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I was saying, "How's your love life? Da da da."

150
0:06:23.74,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You said, "I met a guy. He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.

151
0:06:26.42,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You won't know who he is."

152
0:06:27.98,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I said, "What's his name?"

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
SW: I remember talking to you about that, yes.

154
0:06:31.46,000 --> 0:06:35,000
GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian." I said, "I know him!" He's awesome.

155
0:06:35.5,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But I would never put you with a nerdy geek,

156
0:06:37.62,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and you said, you neither.

157
0:06:38.9,000 --> 0:06:4,000
SW: I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't either,

158
0:06:41.42,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but it's been the best thing for me.

159
0:06:43.18,000 --> 0:06:44,000
GK: The best thing why?

160
0:06:45.14,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Does that look like a nerdy geek?

161
0:06:46.78,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Look at the shirt.

162
0:06:48.02,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

163
0:06:49.06,000 --> 0:06:5,000
No, he's a very nice guy.

164
0:06:50.34,000 --> 0:06:51,000
SW: You can tell he's into technology.

165
0:06:52.22,000 --> 0:06:53,000
GK: He's a very, very nice guy.

166
0:06:53.98,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I like him very much.

167
0:06:55.58,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So how did he succeed when others have failed?

168
0:06:57.86,000 --> 0:07:,000
How was he the one that you knew, this is the one for me?

169
0:07:01.78,000 --> 0:07:03,000
SW: Well, I'm not going to say that,

170
0:07:04.06,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but ...

171
0:07:05.34,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:06.58,000 --> 0:07:07,000
GK: Say it, Serena, say it!

173
0:07:08.5,000 --> 0:07:09,000
SW: Well ...

174
0:07:09.74,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

175
0:07:12.58,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Yes.

176
0:07:13.82,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Applause)

177
0:07:16.9,000 --> 0:07:17,000
GK: But you know what I mean.

178
0:07:18.34,000 --> 0:07:21,000
SW: He is very loving and he's very kind, and my mom says he's very considerate,

179
0:07:22.14,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and when she said that to me,

180
0:07:23.74,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I was like, you know, he really is,

181
0:07:25.46,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and it's the little things that really make a huge difference in life.

182
0:07:28.82,000 --> 0:07:29,000
GK: Like?

183
0:07:30.1,000 --> 0:07:31,000
SW: Something simple.

184
0:07:31.34,000 --> 0:07:33,000
My fashion company, we have a show every year,

185
0:07:34.22,000 --> 0:07:36,000
so in our show last year, I was running around like crazy,

186
0:07:37.22,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because I do everything for the show,

187
0:07:39.06,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and everything for it,

188
0:07:40.74,000 --> 0:07:41,000
so I was running around like crazy,

189
0:07:42.46,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and he, it was a simple gesture of this shirt that he had,

190
0:07:45.86,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and he just wanted to make sure that I had the same one,

191
0:07:49.46,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and it was -- it's a weird story.

192
0:07:51.82,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It was better in person, I promise.

193
0:07:53.82,000 --> 0:07:54,000
GK: Was it a wonderful proposal?

194
0:07:55.82,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Or was it a Beyoncé song?

195
0:07:57.98,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"If you like it then you ought to put a ring on it"?

196
0:08:00.58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Were you feeling pressure to get married?

197
0:08:02.557,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Did you know it was coming?

198
0:08:03.9,000 --> 0:08:05,000
SW: Yeah, I actually never felt pressure to get married

199
0:08:06.58,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and I can't say I'm the marrying type of person.

200
0:08:08.86,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I really love my life.

201
0:08:11.02,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I love my freedom.

202
0:08:12.58,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I heard that kind of changes.

203
0:08:14.14,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But I love everything that I do,

204
0:08:18.22,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and I love my career,

205
0:08:20.54,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and I always felt like I didn't want anything to interfere with that.

206
0:08:23.82,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I've actually been so career-oriented

207
0:08:25.66,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and in fact, when he proposed,

208
0:08:28.18,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I was almost angry.

209
0:08:29.54,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Not almost. I was angry,

210
0:08:30.86,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because it was right in the middle of my training season,

211
0:08:33.74,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and I said, "I gotta win the Australian Open.

212
0:08:35.9,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I can't fly to Rome."

213
0:08:37.5,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Because he wanted to take me to Rome,

214
0:08:39.34,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and I said, "I can't. I gotta win."

215
0:08:41.06,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But that's how focused I was.

216
0:08:42.5,000 --> 0:08:44,000
GK: This is a girl that says, "No, I can't go to Rome." OK.

217
0:08:45.42,000 --> 0:08:47,000
SW: But I was really focused on reaching my goals

218
0:08:48.18,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and I knew at that point there was one player that I wanted to pass.

219
0:08:51.7,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record,

220
0:08:53.58,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and that really meant a lot to me,

221
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and when I put my mind to something,

222
0:08:57.06,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I really am determined to reach it

223
0:08:58.94,000 --> 0:08:59,000
no matter what.

224
0:09:00.62,000 --> 0:09:01,000
GK: You know, you said that for you --

225
0:09:02.5,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I've heard you say that winning is addictive to you.

226
0:09:04.98,000 --> 0:09:05,000
SW: It is.

227
0:09:06.22,000 --> 0:09:07,000
GK: What do you mean?

228
0:09:07.46,000 --> 0:09:09,000
SW: I feel like winning for me is superaddictive.

229
0:09:10.22,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I feel like once you experience it,

230
0:09:12.94,000 --> 0:09:14,000
you always want to get that feeling again,

231
0:09:15.22,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and when I won my first championship, I was only 17 years old,

232
0:09:18.74,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but I never forgot that feeling,

233
0:09:20.46,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and I feel like every time I win one,

234
0:09:23.06,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I want to reach that feeling of your first championship.

235
0:09:25.74,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There's really no feeling in the world like that.

236
0:09:28.22,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And it's like, all these years of training

237
0:09:31.22,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and being a little kid and playing,

238
0:09:33.3,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and then winning is a wonderful experience.

239
0:09:36.78,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So for me I've always felt like I loved that feeling,

240
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and obviously I don't like the feeling of losing. I feel like --

241
0:09:44.66,000 --> 0:09:47,000
GK: No, in fact, people close to you say you're a very bad loser.

242
0:09:47.78,000 --> 0:09:48,000
SW: I'm not the best loser.

243
0:09:49.1,000 --> 0:09:51,000
GK: That you're very, very, very bad.

244
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Listen, no athlete, no champion likes to lose.

245
0:09:53.54,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I get that.

246
0:09:54.78,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But they say when it comes to losing, you are very, very, very bad at it.

247
0:09:58.66,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

248
0:09:59.94,000 --> 0:10:02,000
SW: I'm number one at losing too, so you know, that's all I can say.

249
0:10:03.7,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

250
0:10:04.86,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Applause)

251
0:10:07.5,000 --> 0:10:1,000
GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic between you and Venus,

252
0:10:10.62,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because everybody that knows you and has followed the story

253
0:10:13.46,000 --> 0:10:14,000
knows that you two are very close,

254
0:10:15.14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and you always bring your A game in whatever you do,

255
0:10:17.62,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but I often wonder, when you're playing her,

256
0:10:19.74,000 --> 0:10:22,000
do you bring your A- game because you want to do something for her

257
0:10:23.5,000 --> 0:10:26,000
or do you bring your A++ game because you want to crush her.

258
0:10:26.54,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Is it harder for you playing her or easier?

259
0:10:28.98,000 --> 0:10:3,000
SW: Well, playing Venus is like playing myself,

260
0:10:31.22,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because we grew up playing each other, we grew up practicing together.

261
0:10:34.58,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it was something that has been difficult,

262
0:10:37.22,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because she's my toughest opponent.

263
0:10:38.94,000 --> 0:10:39,000
She's tall, she's fast,

264
0:10:40.7,000 --> 0:10:43,000
she hits hard like me, she serves like me.

265
0:10:43.82,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's really like playing a wall.

266
0:10:45.42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
GK: She knows you.

267
0:10:46.66,000 --> 0:10:48,000
SW: She knows where I'm hitting the ball before I hit it,

268
0:10:49.38,000 --> 0:10:51,000
so it's something that is not very easy,

269
0:10:51.82,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but it's really about, when I go out there,

270
0:10:54.58,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I really have to shut down my mind and I have to say to myself,

271
0:10:57.58,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"You know what?

272
0:10:58.82,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I'm just playing a great player, but today I have to be better.

273
0:11:02.62,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I don't care who it is, if it's my sister or it's my friend,

274
0:11:06.06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
today is the day I have to show up and I have to be better

275
0:11:09.1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and I have to want it more than anyone else at this moment

276
0:11:13.3,000 --> 0:11:14,000
anywhere on this world."

277
0:11:14.58,000 --> 0:11:17,000
GK: So never on the court do you fall back for Venus?

278
0:11:18.46,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Because, you know, it was always Venus and Serena.

279
0:11:22.58,000 --> 0:11:23,000
SW: Yes.

280
0:11:23.82,000 --> 0:11:25,000
GK: And now baby sister has surpassed older sister.

281
0:11:26.38,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Do you feel guilt about that?

282
0:11:28.1,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Do you feel joy in that?

283
0:11:29.78,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Is that a difficult position for you?

284
0:11:31.62,000 --> 0:11:32,000
SW: I don't feel anything in there.

285
0:11:33.34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
In my life, it still and forever is always going to be Venus and Serena.

286
0:11:36.82,000 --> 0:11:39,000
She's really love of my life, she's my best friend,

287
0:11:39.94,000 --> 0:11:4,000
she's my soul mate.

288
0:11:41.18,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I mean --

289
0:11:43.06,000 --> 0:11:44,000
There's pictures of her pushing me,

290
0:11:45.06,000 --> 0:11:47,000
really low-quality pictures or else I would have shared them,

291
0:11:47.98,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of her pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court,

292
0:11:50.38,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and she always took care of me.

293
0:11:51.94,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I used to spend all of my allowance money on the ice cream truck and stuff,

294
0:11:55.488,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and she would take her money and give it to me at school

295
0:11:59.82,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and make sure I had something to eat and she would go without,

296
0:12:02.78,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and that's the kind of person she actually is

297
0:12:05.1,000 --> 0:12:07,000
since I've always known her.

298
0:12:07.58,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So we always have this incredible respect for each other

299
0:12:10.9,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and this incredible love,

300
0:12:12.18,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and I think it's important for people to realize you can be successful

301
0:12:15.5,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but you can still have a wonderful relationship.

302
0:12:17.78,000 --> 0:12:18,000
On the court we are mortal enemies,

303
0:12:19.5,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but the second we shake hands, we are best friends again.

304
0:12:23.34,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And if I lose, it might be a day later for me,

305
0:12:27.98,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but for Venus --

306
0:12:29.22,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Laughter)

307
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
GK: There's never a time on the court where you hit the ball

308
0:12:35.14,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and say, "That's for seventh grade when you did the blah blah blah"?

309
0:12:38.58,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You never have any moment like that?

310
0:12:40.34,000 --> 0:12:42,000
SW: I feel like she should have those moments,

311
0:12:42.54,000 --> 0:12:44,000
because she's never done anything bad to me,

312
0:12:44.66,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but I'm the youngest. I'm the younger sister.

313
0:12:46.82,000 --> 0:12:48,000
GK: Serena, she's never done anything bad to you? Really?

314
0:12:49.54,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I have three sisters. I can think of some stuff I've done bad.

315
0:12:52.9,000 --> 0:12:54,000
SW: Unless she brainwashed me to forget them.

316
0:12:56.02,000 --> 0:12:59,000
GK: No, but the love you have for her I know is very pure. I know that.

317
0:12:59.38,000 --> 0:13:,000
SW: Yes. GK: I know that.

318
0:13:00.66,000 --> 0:13:02,000
SW: We were always brought up to be superclose,

319
0:13:02.9,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and we are incredibly close.

320
0:13:04.46,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Not only her.

321
0:13:05.7,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I have three other sisters as well, and we were always so close.

322
0:13:10.82,000 --> 0:13:12,000
GK: So before a big match, the two of you don't get together

323
0:13:13.7,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and say, look, we're going to go out there and -- there's nothing?

324
0:13:16.86,000 --> 0:13:18,000
SW: Well, it's funny. Before the Australian Open,

325
0:13:19.22,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we were in the locker room together,

326
0:13:20.98,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and I always pick on her, so I pulled out my camera while she was changing.

327
0:13:24.54,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I started taking pictures of her, which is totally inappropriate,

328
0:13:27.86,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but she was so mad at me.

329
0:13:29.14,000 --> 0:13:31,000
She's like, "Serena, stop!" And I was just laughing at her.

330
0:13:31.94,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But that's the kind of relationship that we have, and like I said,

331
0:13:36.02,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the second we step on the court,

332
0:13:37.62,000 --> 0:13:41,000
it was like, we were definitely mortal enemies,

333
0:13:41.82,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but the second we stepped off, and moments before, we're just --

334
0:13:46.06,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It is what it is, because at the end of the day,

335
0:13:48.34,000 --> 0:13:49,000
she'll always be my sister.

336
0:13:49.7,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I'm not going to play Australia in --

337
0:13:51.54,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Well, who knows, I've been playing forever,

338
0:13:53.62,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but I don't think I'll be playing in 50 years, say?

339
0:13:56.18,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Let's be safe and say 50 years.

340
0:13:57.7,000 --> 0:13:59,000
GK: I don't know, Serena. There's never been anybody like you.

341
0:14:00.66,000 --> 0:14:02,000
When you think about it, never been anybody

342
0:14:02.7,000 --> 0:14:04,000
who has intersected gender and race the way you have,

343
0:14:05.54,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the dominance that you have and the scrutiny that you have.

344
0:14:08.38,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And when you were growing up, did you say, "I want to be like that"?

345
0:14:11.66,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Because now little girls are looking at you

346
0:14:13.684,000 --> 0:14:14,000
saying, "I want to be like that."

347
0:14:15.3,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Who was the "I want to be like that" for you?

348
0:14:17.46,000 --> 0:14:19,000
SW: Well, it's interesting, and I'm glad you brought that up.

349
0:14:20.38,000 --> 0:14:22,000
For me, when I grew up, I always wanted to be the best,

350
0:14:23.02,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and I said, if you want to be the best, you've got to emulate the best.

351
0:14:26.38,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So when I started to go on tour when I was really young,

352
0:14:29.22,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I would see Steffi Graf, I would see Monica Seles,

353
0:14:31.62,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and I would even see Pete Sampras,

354
0:14:33.62,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and I would see what they did,

355
0:14:35.1,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I noticed that Steffi and Monica

356
0:14:37.22,000 --> 0:14:39,000
didn't really talk to a lot of the other players,

357
0:14:39.66,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and they kind of were on their own,

358
0:14:41.42,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and they were just so focused

359
0:14:42.86,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and I would see Pete Sampras, the technique that he did,

360
0:14:45.98,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and I was like, "I want to do that."

361
0:14:48.58,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So I did that, and I felt that to be the best,

362
0:14:51.82,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and if you want to be the best,

363
0:14:53.42,000 --> 0:14:54,000
you have to hang around people

364
0:14:54.98,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and you have to look at people that are the best,

365
0:14:57.34,000 --> 0:14:58,000
because you're not going to be the best

366
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
if you're looking at someone that's not at the top level.

367
0:15:01.98,000 --> 0:15:03,000
GK: People say nobody works as hard as you.

368
0:15:04.06,000 --> 0:15:06,000
SW: I'm a very hard worker. GK: That's what I heard.

369
0:15:06.54,000 --> 0:15:08,000
SW: People say, "Oh, she's talented, she's athletic."

370
0:15:09.06,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Actually, I wasn't. I was really small for my age.

371
0:15:11.46,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I grew up when I got older,

372
0:15:12.94,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and I had to work really hard,

373
0:15:14.42,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and I think one of the reasons why I fight so hard and I work so hard

374
0:15:17.7,000 --> 0:15:19,000
is because I was really, really, really small.

375
0:15:19.9,000 --> 0:15:2,000
GK: Yeah.

376
0:15:21.62,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You are no longer small.

377
0:15:22.94,000 --> 0:15:25,000
SW: No, I'm fully grown now.

378
0:15:26.1,000 --> 0:15:28,000
But I was small when I was really young for whatever reason.

379
0:15:28.98,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties.

380
0:15:32.3,000 --> 0:15:34,000
GK: You know, the other thing people talk about is your body.

381
0:15:35.22,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Your body brings men and women to their knees.

382
0:15:38.78,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And I mean in a good way.

383
0:15:40.78,000 --> 0:15:41,000
A lot has been made about your body.

384
0:15:42.54,000 --> 0:15:47,000
It's a work of art, it's masculine, it's glorious,

385
0:15:47.98,000 --> 0:15:49,000
there's never been anything like it.

386
0:15:50.02,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Did you have body issues when you were growing up?

387
0:15:52.74,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Have you always been comfortable with your body?

388
0:15:55.02,000 --> 0:15:57,000
SW: It's interesting, because when you're a teenage female

389
0:15:57.78,000 --> 0:15:58,000
growing up in the public eye,

390
0:15:59.62,000 --> 0:16:01,000
it is a lot of scrutiny that you face,

391
0:16:01.78,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and as any female that's a teenager,

392
0:16:03.62,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I definitely was not comfortable in my body.

393
0:16:05.86,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I didn't like it.

394
0:16:07.22,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I didn't understand why I had muscles.

395
0:16:10.06,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And I stopped lifting weights.

396
0:16:11.54,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I was like, I'm not going to do this.

397
0:16:13.38,000 --> 0:16:14,000
But then after I won the US Open,

398
0:16:15.02,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I realized that my body helped me reach goals that I wanted to reach,

399
0:16:18.3,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and I wanted to be happy with it,

400
0:16:20.02,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and I was so appreciative of it.

401
0:16:22.42,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I'm always healthy.

402
0:16:23.66,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I'm really fortunate and superblessed,

403
0:16:25.5,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and I felt like not only am I happy with my body,

404
0:16:28.46,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but I want other people and other young girls

405
0:16:30.62,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that have experienced what I've experienced

406
0:16:33.34,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to be happy with themselves.

407
0:16:34.74,000 --> 0:16:35,000
So whatever people say --

408
0:16:36.02,000 --> 0:16:38,000
masculine, whatever, too much, too little --

409
0:16:38.46,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.

410
0:16:41.86,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Applause)

411
0:16:46.5,000 --> 0:16:47,000
GK: I know you learn a lot from winning,

412
0:16:48.46,000 --> 0:16:5,000
but what have you learned from losing?

413
0:16:51.18,000 --> 0:16:54,000
SW: I hate to lose, but I think losing has brought me here today.

414
0:16:54.7,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The only reason I am who I am is because of my losses,

415
0:16:57.82,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and some of them are extremely painful,

416
0:17:00.22,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but I wouldn't take any of them away,

417
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
because every time I lose,

418
0:17:05.5,000 --> 0:17:07,000
it takes a really long time for me to lose again

419
0:17:07.78,000 --> 0:17:08,000
because I learn so much from it.

420
0:17:09.66,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And I encourage everyone that I talk to --

421
0:17:12.1,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I'm like, listen, if you lose or if something happens --

422
0:17:14.78,000 --> 0:17:16,000
not in sports -- in business or in school --

423
0:17:17.659,000 --> 0:17:18,000
learn from it.

424
0:17:19.3,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Don't live in the past, live in the present,

425
0:17:21.419,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and don't make the same mistakes in the future.

426
0:17:23.659,000 --> 0:17:25,000
That's something that I always try to live by.

427
0:17:25.86,000 --> 0:17:26,000
GK: Now you're planning a wedding

428
0:17:27.5,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and I want to know, is it a destination wedding

429
0:17:29.74,000 --> 0:17:32,000
in the Catskills or Poconos or are you going to do it in Florida?

430
0:17:33.139,000 --> 0:17:34,000
What are you thinking?

431
0:17:34.86,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Big or small?

432
0:17:36.899,000 --> 0:17:38,000
SW: We're thinking medium size. We don't want to do too big,

433
0:17:39.78,000 --> 0:17:42,000
but then we're like, OK, we can't say no to this person, this person.

434
0:17:43.06,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So we're thinking medium size and we're just thinking --

435
0:17:45.74,000 --> 0:17:48,000
My personality is a lot of fun. Hopefully you can see that today.

436
0:17:48.82,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I'm not too serious.

437
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
GK: And you like to dance.

438
0:17:52.06,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And the next chapter for Serena Williams is what?

439
0:17:55.18,000 --> 0:17:56,000
SW: Oh, next for me.

440
0:17:57.18,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Obviously I'm going to have a baby

441
0:17:59.14,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and I'm going to stay fit and kind of come back and play tennis

442
0:18:02.14,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and keep working on my fashion line.

443
0:18:03.9,000 --> 0:18:04,000
That'll be really fun.

444
0:18:05.18,000 --> 0:18:06,000
GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl?

445
0:18:07.06,000 --> 0:18:1,000
SW: I don't. I have a feeling of one or the other.

446
0:18:10.78,000 --> 0:18:12,000
It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling.

447
0:18:12.82,000 --> 0:18:13,000
GK: Gayle is a unisex name.

448
0:18:14.18,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Whatever you and Alexis decide, we are cheering you on!

449
0:18:16.82,000 --> 0:18:18,000
SW: Thank you for that. GK: You're welcome.

450
0:18:18.9,000 --> 0:18:2,000
We are cheering you on, Serena Williams. SW: Thank you so much.

451
0:18:21.9,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you guys.

452
0:18:23.18,000 --> 0:18:25,000
(Applause)

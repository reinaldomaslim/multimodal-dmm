1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
knows that for about two and half hours on the way down,

4
0:00:21.865,000 --> 0:00:23,000
it's a perfectly positively pitch-black world.

5
0:00:24.584,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window

6
0:00:27.6,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that you couldn't describe:

7
0:00:28.987,000 --> 0:00:31,000
these blinking lights -- a world of bioluminescence, like fireflies.

8
0:00:32.61,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association --

9
0:00:36.767,000 --> 0:00:37,000
was able to come up with a camera

10
0:00:38.55,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that could capture some of these incredible animals,

11
0:00:41.06,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and that's what you're seeing here on the screen.

12
0:00:43.46,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That's all bioluminescence. Like I said: just like fireflies.

13
0:00:46.377,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There's a flying turkey under a tree.

14
0:00:48.656,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:49.69,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm a geologist by training.

16
0:00:52.862,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But I love that.

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And you see, some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten,

18
0:00:58.613,000 --> 0:00:59,000
some they use to attract prey,

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but all of it, from an artistic point of view,

20
0:01:02.935,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is just positively amazing.

21
0:01:04.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And a lot of what goes on inside --

22
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.

23
0:01:08.518,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Some of the colors are designed to hypnotize,

24
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
these lovely patterns.

25
0:01:13.241,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And then this last one,

26
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Just absolutely amazing, every single dive.

28
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That's the unknown world, and today we've only explored

29
0:01:24.247,000 --> 0:01:26,000
about 3 percent of what's out there in the ocean.

30
0:01:26.997,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Already we've found the world's highest mountains,

31
0:01:29.627,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the world's deepest valleys,

32
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --

33
0:01:33.261,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a lot of that we shared with you from the stage.

34
0:01:35.571,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And in a place where we thought no life at all,

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we find more life, we think, and diversity and density

36
0:01:40.86,000 --> 0:01:41,000
than the tropical rainforest,

37
0:01:42.367,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all.

38
0:01:45.416,000 --> 0:01:46,000
There's still 97 percent,

39
0:01:46.769,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises.

40
0:01:49.894,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But I want to jump up to shallow water now

41
0:01:51.969,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and look at some creatures that are positively amazing.

42
0:01:54.679,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Cephalopods -- head-foots.

43
0:01:57.461,000 --> 0:01:59,000
As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly.

44
0:01:59.536,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:00.637,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This is an octopus.

46
0:02:01.86,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab,

47
0:02:05.061,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it's just fascinating how cephalopods can,

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
with their incredible eyes, sense their surroundings,

49
0:02:09.838,000 --> 0:02:1,000
look at light, look at patterns.

50
0:02:11.638,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Here's an octopus moving across the reef,

51
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
finds a spot to settle down, curls up and then disappears into the background.

52
0:02:18.425,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Tough thing to do.

53
0:02:21.052,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In the next bit, we're going to see a couple squid.

54
0:02:23.46,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now males, when they fight,

55
0:02:25.157,000 --> 0:02:27,000
if they're really aggressive, they turn white.

56
0:02:27.358,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And these two males are fighting.

57
0:02:28.96,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They do it by bouncing their butts together,

58
0:02:31.057,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which is an interesting concept.

59
0:02:32.701,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now, here's a male on the left and a female on the right,

60
0:02:35.46,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the male has managed to split his coloration

61
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so the female only always sees the kinder, gentler squid in him.

62
0:02:41.237,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Let's take a look at it again. Watch the coloration:

64
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
white on the right, brown on the left.

65
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
He takes a step back,

66
0:02:53.895,000 --> 0:02:55,000
he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body,

67
0:02:56.633,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and comes up on the other side --

68
0:02:58.36,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Bingo!

69
0:02:59.448,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males,

70
0:03:02.525,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but I don't know.

71
0:03:03.799,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish.

73
0:03:07.082,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.

74
0:03:08.97,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And there he is, his droopy little eyes up here.

75
0:03:13.069,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But they can do pretty amazing things, too.

76
0:03:15.422,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice,

77
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and watch his tentacles --

78
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
he just pulls them in, makes them look just like algae.

79
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Disappears right into the background.

80
0:03:26.505,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Positively amazing.

81
0:03:27.851,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Here's two males fighting.

82
0:03:29.275,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Once again, they're smart enough, these cephalopods;

83
0:03:31.76,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they know not to hurt each other.

84
0:03:33.36,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin.

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That's an amazing thing.

86
0:03:39.679,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Here's an octopus.

87
0:03:40.98,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move,

88
0:03:43.436,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because predators can see them.

89
0:03:44.97,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This guy can make himself look like a rock,

90
0:03:47.07,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and, looking at his environment,

91
0:03:49.27,000 --> 0:03:5,000
can actually slide across the bottom,

92
0:03:51.289,000 --> 0:03:53,000
using the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen.

93
0:03:54.29,000 --> 0:03:56,000
His motion blends right into the background --

94
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the moving rock trick.

95
0:04:00.958,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So, we're learning lots new from the shallow water.

96
0:04:03.46,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Still exploring the deep, but learning lots from the shallow water.

97
0:04:06.661,000 --> 0:04:07,000
There's a good reason why:

98
0:04:07.948,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the shallow water's full of predators -- here's a barracuda --

99
0:04:10.884,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,

100
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide.

101
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In the next scene, you're going to see a nice coral bottom.

102
0:04:18.961,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And you see that an octopus would stand out

103
0:04:21.025,000 --> 0:04:23,000
very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage,

104
0:04:23.632,000 --> 0:04:25,000
use your skin to change color and texture.

105
0:04:25.757,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Here's some algae in the foreground --

106
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and an octopus.

107
0:04:30.935,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Ain't that amazing?

108
0:04:34.007,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now, Roger spooked him, so he took off in a cloud of ink,

109
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and when he lands, the octopus says, "Oh, I've been seen.

110
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get."

111
0:04:43.661,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That big brown makes his eyespot very big.

112
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So, he's bluffing. Let's do it backwards.

113
0:04:48.161,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me.

114
0:04:50.761,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I thought it was all graphics. So here it is in reverse.

115
0:04:53.446,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Watch the skin color; watch the skin texture.

116
0:04:55.66,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Just an amazing animal, it can change color and texture

117
0:04:58.36,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to match the surroundings.

118
0:04:59.718,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Watch him blend right into this algae.

119
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
One, two, three.

120
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Applause)

121
0:05:08.925,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And now he's gone, and so am I. Thank you very much.

122
0:05:12.925,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Applause)

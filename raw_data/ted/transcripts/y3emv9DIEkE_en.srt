1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When you have a job that pays you enough to cover your basic needs,

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
your bills and even some more to spend,

3
0:00:18.708,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the assumption is that you'd be happy,

4
0:00:20.75,000 --> 0:00:21,000
or, even better, fulfilled.

5
0:00:23.542,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And it seems unthinkable when you wake up and say

6
0:00:25.917,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you're going to leave a job like that to pursue a passion.

7
0:00:29.708,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And that was my dilemma six years ago.

8
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I had a comfortable job, I lived a comfortable life,

9
0:00:36.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and people expected me to be fulfilled,

10
0:00:39.208,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but I wasn't.

11
0:00:40.833,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There was something in me that wanted more.

12
0:00:43.667,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There was a misalignment between the things I did on a daily basis

13
0:00:47.292,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and the things that I deeply cared about.

14
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And so I decided to quit

15
0:00:52.708,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and explore the possibility of bringing this passion into my daily routine.

16
0:00:58.458,000 --> 0:01:,000
And the thing about finding your passion

17
0:01:00.667,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is that it's not straightforward.

18
0:01:02.667,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Even for people with money and degrees,

19
0:01:04.625,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they still struggle to identify their passion.

20
0:01:08.208,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And here I was as a 30-year-old,

21
0:01:11.167,000 --> 0:01:13,000
talking about finding my passion

22
0:01:13.292,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and turning it into a career.

23
0:01:15.958,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Literally, people told me,

24
0:01:17.292,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"You don't talk about passion until you've made enough money --

25
0:01:20.583,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:22.375,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or at least until you're ready to retire."

27
0:01:26.292,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Because there's a notion that looking inward

28
0:01:28.417,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and finding the things that give us pleasure and fulfillment

29
0:01:31.792,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is a luxury that only the rich can enjoy,

30
0:01:35.208,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or a pleasure that only the retired can indulge in.

31
0:01:39.792,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Which made me wonder:

32
0:01:41.5,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Is passion only for the rich,

33
0:01:44.25,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or an experience only the retired can enjoy?

34
0:01:47.917,000 --> 0:01:5,000
For many of us, we've been led to believe

35
0:01:51.208,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that life is a race of survival.

36
0:01:53.875,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We've been conditioned to see ourselves as survivors

37
0:01:56.75,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that must do everything in our power to survive.

38
0:02:00.5,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In Africa, we're nurtured to go through school, cram and pass,

39
0:02:05.083,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in the hope that you get a job after.

40
0:02:07.375,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And if you do, stick at it no matter how much it sucks.

41
0:02:11.292,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:12.708,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Until you get a better offer or you're asked to retire.

43
0:02:18.208,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And as a dropout,

44
0:02:19.625,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I knew that I was not entitled to anything.

45
0:02:22.458,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Every opportunity was a privilege.

46
0:02:26.292,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And so when I thought about quitting,

47
0:02:28.792,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it was a huge risk.

48
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I was given two alternatives,

49
0:02:33.125,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which are the most popular in Africa.

50
0:02:35.042,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The first one is sign up for any course at a vocational institution and do it.

51
0:02:40.5,000 --> 0:02:43,000
My second option, settle for any job offer you can get,

52
0:02:44.375,000 --> 0:02:46,000
no matter the working conditions,

53
0:02:46.583,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and do it.

54
0:02:48.042,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That probably explains why we have so many of our young people

55
0:02:51.042,000 --> 0:02:53,000
being trafficked in search of greener pastures.

56
0:02:54.667,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I opted for the first option.

57
0:02:56.708,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I did look at a couple vocational institutions

58
0:02:59.292,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in the hope that I would find a course that resonated with my persona,

59
0:03:02.875,000 --> 0:03:04,000
my dream and my aspiration.

60
0:03:05.958,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I was disappointed to learn that there was no room for misfits like me

61
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in these institutions.

62
0:03:12.25,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The education system in many parts of the world

63
0:03:14.5,000 --> 0:03:16,000
has been designed around preselected options

64
0:03:17.208,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that young people are expected to fit in or risk becoming misfits.

65
0:03:21.75,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And so going through school, I was nurtured and conditioned

66
0:03:24.875,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to think in the straight line and stay within the straight line.

67
0:03:29.042,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But when I dropped out, I discovered a world of possibilities.

68
0:03:32.25,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I knew I could be anything, I could study anything,

69
0:03:35.708,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and so I leveraged free online courses.

70
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That's how I built my CV, got into employment

71
0:03:41.125,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and worked for eight years.

72
0:03:43.083,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And after eight years,

73
0:03:44.583,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I told myself there must be more to life

74
0:03:47.083,000 --> 0:03:49,000
than just going through the routines of life.

75
0:03:49.792,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So in 2014, I started an organization called Kyusa

76
0:03:53.708,000 --> 0:03:55,000
where we are working with out-of-school youth

77
0:03:55.833,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and empowering them to turn their passions

78
0:03:58.042,000 --> 0:04:01,000
into profitable, scalable and sustainable businesses.

79
0:04:01.958,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, when we talk about passion,

80
0:04:03.708,000 --> 0:04:07,000
one of the most common questions that people ask is, "What is passion?

81
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
How do I even find it?"

82
0:04:10.167,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And in the simplest definition,

83
0:04:12.208,000 --> 0:04:14,000
passion is a collection of your life experiences

84
0:04:14.708,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that give you the deepest sense of fulfillment.

85
0:04:18.5,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And to identify your passion, you need to look inward.

86
0:04:22.292,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So we use two reflective questions.

87
0:04:25.333,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The first question we ask is,

88
0:04:27.417,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"If you had all the time and the money in the world,

89
0:04:30.167,000 --> 0:04:32,000
what would you spend your time doing?"

90
0:04:32.583,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It sounds like a very simple question,

91
0:04:34.667,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but many people struggle to answer this question

92
0:04:37.208,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because they've just never thought about it.

93
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The second question we ask

94
0:04:42.083,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is, "What makes you happy

95
0:04:44.042,000 --> 0:04:46,000
or gives you the deepest sense of fulfillment?"

96
0:04:47.042,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, you would assume that we all know what makes us happy,

97
0:04:49.917,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but it's also interesting to note that so many people have no idea

98
0:04:53.292,000 --> 0:04:54,000
what makes them happy,

99
0:04:56.208,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because they are so busy going through the routines of life,

100
0:04:59.125,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they've never stopped to look inward.

101
0:05:02.458,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And so identifying the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment

102
0:05:05.833,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and the things that give us deep joy

103
0:05:07.708,000 --> 0:05:1,000
are thoughts that begin to direct us in the direction of our passion.

104
0:05:11.833,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And just in case you're wondering

105
0:05:13.5,000 --> 0:05:15,000
what your answers are to those two questions,

106
0:05:15.708,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I invite you to sit with these questions later and just reflect about it.

107
0:05:20.667,000 --> 0:05:21,000
However, I am also aware

108
0:05:22.292,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that passion alone cannot guarantee success in life.

109
0:05:26.708,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I should note

110
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that not every passion can become a career.

111
0:05:31.833,000 --> 0:05:33,000
For passion to become a career,

112
0:05:34.083,000 --> 0:05:38,000
it must be coupled with the right set of skills, conditioning and positioning.

113
0:05:39.917,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So when we get our young people to look inward,

114
0:05:42.458,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we also ask them what skills do you have,

115
0:05:45.125,000 --> 0:05:47,000
what talents do you have, what experience do you have

116
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that you can use to build a niche in the marketplace.

117
0:05:52.208,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But more than that, we also look at the market trends,

118
0:05:54.875,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because it doesn't matter how much you love and enjoy it.

119
0:05:57.583,000 --> 0:06:,000
If nobody wants it or is willing to pay for it,

120
0:06:00.708,000 --> 0:06:01,000
it can't be a career.

121
0:06:02.458,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's just a hobby.

122
0:06:05.625,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the third thing we look at is how do you position yourself?

123
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Who are you targeting? Who do you want to sell to?

124
0:06:12.417,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Why would they want to buy from you?

125
0:06:14.833,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And so the combination of the three is what enables you to move

126
0:06:18.125,000 --> 0:06:2,000
from just a passion to a business.

127
0:06:21.5,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And many of our young people have been able to turn their ideas

128
0:06:24.542,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and burning desires into profitable businesses

129
0:06:27.417,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or social enterprises,

130
0:06:29.083,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and they're not just creating jobs,

131
0:06:31.125,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but they are solving societal challenges.

132
0:06:34.583,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I'll share with you two examples.

133
0:06:36.792,000 --> 0:06:37,000
One of them is Esther.

134
0:06:38.708,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I met Esther two years ago.

135
0:06:40.708,000 --> 0:06:41,000
She had been out of school for two years,

136
0:06:43.25,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and she had been deeply affected by her dropping out.

137
0:06:46.333,000 --> 0:06:48,000
As a result, she had experienced severe depression

138
0:06:49.167,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to a point where she attempted to take her own life several times.

139
0:06:53.25,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Her friends and family didn't know what to do for her.

140
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They simply prayed for her.

141
0:06:58.583,000 --> 0:07:,000
When I met Esther and I started to converse with her,

142
0:07:01.167,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I asked her a simple question.

143
0:07:02.958,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I said, "If you had all the time and the money in the world,

144
0:07:05.792,000 --> 0:07:06,000
what would you do?"

145
0:07:07.917,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Without thinking or hesitation,

146
0:07:10.083,000 --> 0:07:11,000
her eyes lit up and she began to tell me

147
0:07:12.083,000 --> 0:07:14,000
how she wanted to change the lives of young people.

148
0:07:14.583,000 --> 0:07:16,000
She wanted to restore hope and dignity to other teenagers

149
0:07:17.458,000 --> 0:07:2,000
by helping them make informed decisions about life.

150
0:07:22.75,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I was certain of the fact that this burning desire in her

151
0:07:25.917,000 --> 0:07:26,000
was unquenchable.

152
0:07:27.5,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And so we worked with Esther to put a framework around this desire.

153
0:07:31.458,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Today, she runs a social enterprise in her village,

154
0:07:34.042,000 --> 0:07:39,000
raising awareness about substance abuse, mental health, sexual reproductive health

155
0:07:39.5,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and is helping other school dropouts acquire vocational skills,

156
0:07:42.75,000 --> 0:07:44,000
so they can make a living for themselves.

157
0:07:45.958,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Esther turned 20 this year,

158
0:07:49.542,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and for the last two years, she has organized an annual teen fest

159
0:07:53.667,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that brings together over 500 teenagers.

160
0:07:57.75,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Applause)

161
0:08:02.958,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Young people that are able to network and collaborate

162
0:08:05.75,000 --> 0:08:06,000
on different projects,

163
0:08:07.083,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but more importantly to meet professionals they would otherwise never have met.

164
0:08:12.25,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This is all engineered by a girl that believed the world had no room for her,

165
0:08:16.083,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that without education she would never amount to anything.

166
0:08:19.792,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But by looking inward and tapping into a burning desire,

167
0:08:23.125,000 --> 0:08:24,000
putting structure around it,

168
0:08:24.875,000 --> 0:08:27,000
it has become a model that not only changed her life

169
0:08:28.167,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but is transforming the lives of hundreds of young people every year.

170
0:08:33.25,000 --> 0:08:34,000
My other example is Musa.

171
0:08:35.208,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Musa is a natural artistic guy.

172
0:08:37.25,000 --> 0:08:4,000
He's the kind that would look at any design and replicate it with ease.

173
0:08:41.417,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And so he seeks to recognize that ability in him.

174
0:08:44.875,000 --> 0:08:46,000
When I met Musa, he was doing all kinds of crafts --

175
0:08:47.583,000 --> 0:08:48,000
bags, belts, wallets --

176
0:08:49.417,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but it was more of a part-time thing.

177
0:08:51.958,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Or sometimes, if he was really broke and needed to make quick money,

178
0:08:55.25,000 --> 0:08:57,000
then he would come up with a design and sell it.

179
0:08:57.667,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But he had never thought of it as a business.

180
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We started working with Musa,

181
0:09:02.583,000 --> 0:09:05,000
helping him shift his mindset from a hobby to a business

182
0:09:06.417,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and beginning to rethink how he can make products that he could sell

183
0:09:10.167,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and even be able to scale.

184
0:09:12.625,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Musa makes some of the most amazing bags I've ever seen,

185
0:09:16.125,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and over the last one year, Musa's business has grown.

186
0:09:19.208,000 --> 0:09:21,000
He has been recognized in different places.

187
0:09:21.375,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Currently, he's talking about exporting to developed countries.

188
0:09:25.583,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Musa, like any other dropout,

189
0:09:27.208,000 --> 0:09:29,000
believed that without academic credentials,

190
0:09:29.417,000 --> 0:09:31,000
he wouldn't amount to anything.

191
0:09:31.875,000 --> 0:09:33,000
He thought the talent he had was nothing

192
0:09:34.25,000 --> 0:09:37,000
simply because he did not have an academic paper to define him.

193
0:09:39.333,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But by looking inward and finding that what he had was the greatest asset

194
0:09:43.542,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and supporting him to turn it into a business,

195
0:09:45.792,000 --> 0:09:47,000
he's not just living -- he's thriving.

196
0:09:49.208,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The thing about looking inward is that it can be scary,

197
0:09:53.5,000 --> 0:09:55,000
especially if you're doing it for the first time.

198
0:09:56.25,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But the truth is you never truly start living

199
0:09:59.375,000 --> 0:10:01,000
until you learn to live from the inside out.

200
0:10:03.583,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And in unlocking potential, we need to look inward to identify

201
0:10:07.542,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment,

202
0:10:10.333,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the things that give us the deepest joy,

203
0:10:12.625,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and then weave them into the patterns of our daily routines.

204
0:10:16.375,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In so doing, we cease to work and we start to live.

205
0:10:21.167,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And the thing about living is that you never have to retire or to resign.

206
0:10:25.667,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:28.042,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

208
0:10:33.125,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And so as you think about unlocking potential for ourselves,

209
0:10:36.083,000 --> 0:10:38,000
for our young people, for our children,

210
0:10:38.792,000 --> 0:10:4,000
let's not condition them to look outward

211
0:10:41.292,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but condition them to look inward

212
0:10:43.333,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to tap into who they are and bring that self into what they do every day.

213
0:10:48.708,000 --> 0:10:5,000
When you cease to work and you live,

214
0:10:51.458,000 --> 0:10:52,000
when passion becomes a career,

215
0:10:53.333,000 --> 0:10:54,000
you don't just excel,

216
0:10:55.167,000 --> 0:10:56,000
you become unstoppable.

217
0:10:57.875,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Thank you.

218
0:10:59.167,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

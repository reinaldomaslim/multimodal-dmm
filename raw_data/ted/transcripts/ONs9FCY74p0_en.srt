1
0:00:13.286,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The most important gift your mother and father ever gave you

2
0:00:17.341,000 --> 0:00:19,000
was the two sets of three billion letters of DNA

3
0:00:20.085,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that make up your genome.

4
0:00:22.014,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But like anything with three billion components,

5
0:00:24.515,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that gift is fragile.

6
0:00:26.815,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Sunlight, smoking, unhealthy eating,

7
0:00:30.379,000 --> 0:00:32,000
even spontaneous mistakes made by your cells,

8
0:00:33.395,000 --> 0:00:34,000
all cause changes to your genome.

9
0:00:36.942,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The most common kind of change in DNA

10
0:00:40.244,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is the simple swap of one letter, or base, such as C,

11
0:00:44.497,000 --> 0:00:47,000
with a different letter, such as T, G or A.

12
0:00:48.744,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In any day, the cells in your body will collectively accumulate

13
0:00:52.141,000 --> 0:00:56,000
billions of these single-letter swaps, which are also called "point mutations."

14
0:00:58.147,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, most of these point mutations are harmless.

15
0:01:00.702,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But every now and then,

16
0:01:01.884,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a point mutation disrupts an important capability in a cell

17
0:01:05.901,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or causes a cell to misbehave in harmful ways.

18
0:01:10.099,000 --> 0:01:12,000
If that mutation were inherited from your parents

19
0:01:13.122,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or occurred early enough in your development,

20
0:01:15.806,000 --> 0:01:17,000
then the result would be that many or all of your cells

21
0:01:18.796,000 --> 0:01:19,000
contain this harmful mutation.

22
0:01:21.153,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And then you would be one of hundreds of millions of people

23
0:01:24.447,000 --> 0:01:25,000
with a genetic disease,

24
0:01:26.082,000 --> 0:01:29,000
such as sickle cell anemia or progeria

25
0:01:29.109,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or muscular dystrophy or Tay-Sachs disease.

26
0:01:34.225,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Grievous genetic diseases caused by point mutations

27
0:01:37.431,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are especially frustrating,

28
0:01:39.448,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because we often know the exact single-letter change

29
0:01:42.376,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that causes the disease and, in theory, could cure the disease.

30
0:01:47.268,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Millions suffer from sickle cell anemia

31
0:01:50.141,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because they have a single A to T point mutations

32
0:01:53.236,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in both copies of their hemoglobin gene.

33
0:01:57.529,000 --> 0:02:,000
And children with progeria are born with a T

34
0:02:00.685,000 --> 0:02:02,000
at a single position in their genome

35
0:02:02.877,000 --> 0:02:03,000
where you have a C,

36
0:02:05.125,000 --> 0:02:08,000
with the devastating consequence that these wonderful, bright kids

37
0:02:08.588,000 --> 0:02:11,000
age very rapidly and pass away by about age 14.

38
0:02:14.358,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Throughout the history of medicine,

39
0:02:16.065,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we have not had a way to efficiently correct point mutations

40
0:02:19.149,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in living systems,

41
0:02:20.942,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to change that disease-causing T back into a C.

42
0:02:25.482,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Perhaps until now.

43
0:02:27.474,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Because my laboratory recently succeeded in developing such a capability,

44
0:02:31.688,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which we call "base editing."

45
0:02:35.277,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The story of how we developed base editing

46
0:02:37.325,000 --> 0:02:39,000
actually begins three billion years ago.

47
0:02:41.055,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We think of bacteria as sources of infection,

48
0:02:43.739,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but bacteria themselves are also prone to being infected,

49
0:02:47.077,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in particular, by viruses.

50
0:02:49.871,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So about three billion years ago,

51
0:02:52.046,000 --> 0:02:55,000
bacteria evolved a defense mechanism to fight viral infection.

52
0:02:57.649,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That defense mechanism is now better known as CRISPR.

53
0:03:01.008,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the warhead in CRISPR is this purple protein

54
0:03:03.857,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that acts like molecular scissors to cut DNA,

55
0:03:07.659,000 --> 0:03:09,000
breaking the double helix into two pieces.

56
0:03:11.323,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If CRISPR couldn't distinguish between bacterial and viral DNA,

57
0:03:15.323,000 --> 0:03:17,000
it wouldn't be a very useful defense system.

58
0:03:18.315,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But the most amazing feature of CRISPR

59
0:03:21.124,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is that the scissors can be programmed to search for,

60
0:03:26.185,000 --> 0:03:28,000
bind to and cut

61
0:03:28.632,000 --> 0:03:3,000
only a specific DNA sequence.

62
0:03:32.911,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So when a bacterium encounters a virus for the first time,

63
0:03:36.332,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it can store a small snippet of that virus's DNA

64
0:03:39.729,000 --> 0:03:42,000
for use as a program to direct the CRISPR scissors

65
0:03:43.397,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to cut that viral DNA sequence during a future infection.

66
0:03:47.778,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Cutting a virus's DNA messes up the function of the cut viral gene,

67
0:03:52.715,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and therefore disrupts the virus's life cycle.

68
0:03:58.059,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Remarkable researchers including Emmanuelle Charpentier, George Church,

69
0:04:02.884,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang

70
0:04:05.561,000 --> 0:04:08,000
showed six years ago how CRISPR scissors could be programmed

71
0:04:09.554,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to cut DNA sequences of our choosing,

72
0:04:12.165,000 --> 0:04:14,000
including sequences in your genome,

73
0:04:14.558,000 --> 0:04:17,000
instead of the viral DNA sequences chosen by bacteria.

74
0:04:18.55,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But the outcomes are actually similar.

75
0:04:21.606,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Cutting a DNA sequence in your genome

76
0:04:24.098,000 --> 0:04:28,000
also disrupts the function of the cut gene, typically,

77
0:04:28.997,000 --> 0:04:32,000
by causing the insertion and deletion of random mixtures of DNA letters

78
0:04:33.488,000 --> 0:04:34,000
at the cut site.

79
0:04:36.625,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, disrupting genes can be very useful for some applications.

80
0:04:42.005,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But for most point mutations that cause genetic diseases,

81
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
simply cutting the already-mutated gene won't benefit patients,

82
0:04:50.711,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because the function of the mutated gene needs to be restored,

83
0:04:54.703,000 --> 0:04:55,000
not further disrupted.

84
0:04:57.259,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So cutting this already-mutated hemoglobin gene

85
0:05:00.165,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that causes sickle cell anemia

86
0:05:02.712,000 --> 0:05:05,000
won't restore the ability of patients to make healthy red blood cells.

87
0:05:07.631,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And while we can sometimes introduce new DNA sequences into cells

88
0:05:11.996,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to replace the DNA sequences surrounding a cut site,

89
0:05:15.441,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that process, unfortunately, doesn't work in most types of cells,

90
0:05:19.789,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the disrupted gene outcomes still predominate.

91
0:05:24.297,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Like many scientists, I've dreamed of a future

92
0:05:26.503,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in which we might be able to treat or maybe even cure

93
0:05:29.301,000 --> 0:05:3,000
human genetic diseases.

94
0:05:31.135,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But I saw the lack of a way to fix point mutations,

95
0:05:34.96,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which cause most human genetic diseases,

96
0:05:38.008,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as a major problem standing in the way.

97
0:05:41.434,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Being a chemist, I began working with my students

98
0:05:44.126,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to develop ways on performing chemistry directly on an individual DNA base,

99
0:05:49.085,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to truly fix, rather than disrupt, the mutations that cause genetic diseases.

100
0:05:56.522,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The results of our efforts are molecular machines

101
0:05:59.094,000 --> 0:06:,000
called "base editors."

102
0:06:01.618,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Base editors use the programmable searching mechanism of CRISPR scissors,

103
0:06:07.117,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but instead of cutting the DNA,

104
0:06:10.077,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they directly convert one base to another base

105
0:06:13.042,000 --> 0:06:15,000
without disrupting the rest of the gene.

106
0:06:16.674,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So if you think of naturally occurring CRISPR proteins as molecular scissors,

107
0:06:20.856,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you can think of base editors as pencils,

108
0:06:23.666,000 --> 0:06:26,000
capable of directly rewriting one DNA letter into another

109
0:06:28.098,000 --> 0:06:31,000
by actually rearranging the atoms of one DNA base

110
0:06:31.925,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to instead become a different base.

111
0:06:35.513,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, base editors don't exist in nature.

112
0:06:38.683,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In fact, we engineered the first base editor, shown here,

113
0:06:41.937,000 --> 0:06:42,000
from three separate proteins

114
0:06:43.318,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that don't even come from the same organism.

115
0:06:46.151,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We started by taking CRISPR scissors and disabling the ability to cut DNA

116
0:06:51.272,000 --> 0:06:55,000
while retaining its ability to search for and bind a target DNA sequence

117
0:06:55.835,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in a programmed manner.

118
0:06:58.351,000 --> 0:07:,000
To those disabled CRISPR scissors, shown in blue,

119
0:07:01.212,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we attached a second protein in red,

120
0:07:03.744,000 --> 0:07:07,000
which performs a chemical reaction on the DNA base C,

121
0:07:08.069,000 --> 0:07:11,000
converting it into a base that behaves like T.

122
0:07:12.958,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Third, we had to attach to the first two proteins

123
0:07:16.124,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the protein shown in purple,

124
0:07:17.498,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which protects the edited base from being removed by the cell.

125
0:07:22.466,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The net result is an engineered three-part protein

126
0:07:25.332,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that for the first time allows us to convert Cs into Ts

127
0:07:29.474,000 --> 0:07:31,000
at specified locations in the genome.

128
0:07:33.49,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But even at this point, our work was only half done.

129
0:07:36.546,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Because in order to be stable in cells,

130
0:07:39.196,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the two strands of a DNA double helix have to form base pairs.

131
0:07:44.125,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And because C only pairs with G,

132
0:07:47.807,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and T only pairs with A,

133
0:07:51.752,000 --> 0:07:55,000
simply changing a C to a T on one DNA strand creates a mismatch,

134
0:07:56.622,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a disagreement between the two DNA strands

135
0:07:59.495,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that the cell has to resolve by deciding which strand to replace.

136
0:08:05.149,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We realized that we could further engineer this three-part protein

137
0:08:10.649,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to flag the nonedited strand as the one to be replaced

138
0:08:14.539,000 --> 0:08:15,000
by nicking that strand.

139
0:08:17.276,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This little nick tricks the cell

140
0:08:19.829,000 --> 0:08:23,000
into replacing the nonedited G with an A

141
0:08:24.8,000 --> 0:08:26,000
as it remakes the nicked strand,

142
0:08:27.149,000 --> 0:08:31,000
thereby completing the conversion of what used to be a C-G base pair

143
0:08:31.204,000 --> 0:08:33,000
into a stable T-A base pair.

144
0:08:36.585,000 --> 0:08:37,000
After several years of hard work

145
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
led by a former post doc in the lab, Alexis Komor,

146
0:08:42.165,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we succeeded in developing this first class of base editor,

147
0:08:45.371,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which converts Cs into Ts and Gs into As

148
0:08:49.061,000 --> 0:08:51,000
at targeted positions of our choosing.

149
0:08:52.633,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Among the more than 35,000 known disease-associated point mutations,

150
0:08:57.887,000 --> 0:09:,000
the two kinds of mutations that this first base editor can reverse

151
0:09:01.696,000 --> 0:09:07,000
collectively account for about 14 percent or 5,000 or so pathogenic point mutations.

152
0:09:08.593,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But correcting the largest fraction of disease-causing point mutations

153
0:09:13.387,000 --> 0:09:16,000
would require developing a second class of base editor,

154
0:09:17.046,000 --> 0:09:21,000
one that could convert As into Gs or Ts into Cs.

155
0:09:22.846,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Led by Nicole Gaudelli, a former post doc in the lab,

156
0:09:26.597,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we set out to develop this second class of base editor,

157
0:09:29.743,000 --> 0:09:35,000
which, in theory, could correct up to almost half of pathogenic point mutations,

158
0:09:35.894,000 --> 0:09:38,000
including that mutation that causes the rapid-aging disease progeria.

159
0:09:42.107,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We realized that we could borrow, once again,

160
0:09:45.298,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the targeting mechanism of CRISPR scissors

161
0:09:49.39,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to bring the new base editor to the right site in a genome.

162
0:09:55.543,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But we quickly encountered an incredible problem;

163
0:09:59.896,000 --> 0:10:01,000
namely, there is no protein

164
0:10:02.348,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that's known to convert A into G or T into C

165
0:10:06.424,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in DNA.

166
0:10:08.76,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Faced with such a serious stumbling block,

167
0:10:10.95,000 --> 0:10:12,000
most students would probably look for another project,

168
0:10:13.506,000 --> 0:10:14,000
if not another research advisor.

169
0:10:15.27,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

170
0:10:16.458,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But Nicole agreed to proceed with a plan

171
0:10:18.424,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that seemed wildly ambitious at the time.

172
0:10:21.966,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Given the absence of a naturally occurring protein

173
0:10:24.329,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that performs the necessary chemistry,

174
0:10:26.514,000 --> 0:10:29,000
we decided we would evolve our own protein in the laboratory

175
0:10:29.974,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to convert A into a base that behaves like G,

176
0:10:33.833,000 --> 0:10:37,000
starting from a protein that performs related chemistry on RNA.

177
0:10:39.23,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We set up a Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest selection system

178
0:10:43.188,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that explored tens of millions of protein variants

179
0:10:47.204,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and only allowed those rare variants

180
0:10:49.246,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that could perform the necessary chemistry to survive.

181
0:10:53.883,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We ended up with a protein shown here,

182
0:10:56.295,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the first that can convert A in DNA

183
0:10:59.176,000 --> 0:11:01,000
into a base that resembles G.

184
0:11:01.292,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And when we attached that protein

185
0:11:02.919,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to the disabled CRISPR scissors, shown in blue,

186
0:11:05.514,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we produced the second base editor,

187
0:11:07.546,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which converts As into Gs,

188
0:11:10.665,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and then uses the same strand-nicking strategy

189
0:11:14.53,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that we used in the first base editor

190
0:11:16.474,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to trick the cell into replacing the nonedited T with a C

191
0:11:21.963,000 --> 0:11:22,000
as it remakes that nicked strand,

192
0:11:23.662,000 --> 0:11:27,000
thereby completing the conversion of an A-T base pair to a G-C base pair.

193
0:11:28.845,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Applause)

194
0:11:30.916,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Thank you.

195
0:11:32.11,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

196
0:11:35.491,000 --> 0:11:37,000
As an academic scientist in the US,

197
0:11:37.85,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I'm not used to being interrupted by applause.

198
0:11:40.021,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Laughter)

199
0:11:43.196,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We developed these first two classes of base editors

200
0:11:47.625,000 --> 0:11:49,000
only three years ago and one and a half years ago.

201
0:11:51.267,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But even in that short time,

202
0:11:52.839,000 --> 0:11:55,000
base editing has become widely used by the biomedical research community.

203
0:11:57.776,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Base editors have been sent more than 6,000 times

204
0:12:02.165,000 --> 0:12:05,000
at the request of more than 1,000 researchers around the globe.

205
0:12:07.475,000 --> 0:12:1,000
A hundred scientific research papers have been published already,

206
0:12:11.015,000 --> 0:12:14,000
using base editors in organisms ranging from bacteria

207
0:12:14.767,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to plants to mice to primates.

208
0:12:19.95,000 --> 0:12:2,000
While base editors are too new

209
0:12:21.581,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to have already entered human clinical trials,

210
0:12:24.49,000 --> 0:12:29,000
scientists have succeeded in achieving a critical milestone towards that goal

211
0:12:29.636,000 --> 0:12:31,000
by using base editors in animals

212
0:12:32.509,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to correct point mutations that cause human genetic diseases.

213
0:12:37.815,000 --> 0:12:38,000
For example,

214
0:12:38.99,000 --> 0:12:41,000
a collaborative team of scientists led by Luke Koblan and Jon Levy,

215
0:12:42.807,000 --> 0:12:44,000
two additional students in my lab,

216
0:12:45.244,000 --> 0:12:49,000
recently used a virus to deliver that second base editor

217
0:12:49.387,000 --> 0:12:51,000
into a mouse with progeria,

218
0:12:51.601,000 --> 0:12:54,000
changing that disease-causing T back into a C

219
0:12:55.482,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and reversing its consequences at the DNA, RNA and protein levels.

220
0:13:00.88,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Base editors have also been used in animals

221
0:13:03.65,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to reverse the consequence of tyrosinemia,

222
0:13:07.642,000 --> 0:13:1,000
beta thalassemia, muscular dystrophy,

223
0:13:11.284,000 --> 0:13:14,000
phenylketonuria, a congenital deafness

224
0:13:14.998,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and a type of cardiovascular disease --

225
0:13:16.961,000 --> 0:13:2,000
in each case, by directly correcting a point mutation

226
0:13:21.847,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that causes or contributes to the disease.

227
0:13:25.688,000 --> 0:13:27,000
In plants, base editors have been used

228
0:13:27.768,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to introduce individual single DNA letter changes

229
0:13:31.864,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that could lead to better crops.

230
0:13:34.253,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And biologists have used base editors to probe the role of individual letters

231
0:13:38.866,000 --> 0:13:4,000
in genes associated with diseases such as cancer.

232
0:13:43.046,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Two companies I cofounded, Beam Therapeutics and Pairwise Plants,

233
0:13:47.637,000 --> 0:13:5,000
are using base editing to treat human genetic diseases

234
0:13:51.486,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and to improve agriculture.

235
0:13:53.953,000 --> 0:13:54,000
All of these applications of base editing

236
0:13:55.943,000 --> 0:13:58,000
have taken place in less than the past three years:

237
0:13:59.061,000 --> 0:14:01,000
on the historical timescale of science,

238
0:14:01.449,000 --> 0:14:02,000
the blink of an eye.

239
0:14:04.657,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Additional work lies ahead

240
0:14:05.934,000 --> 0:14:08,000
before base editing can realize its full potential

241
0:14:08.99,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to improve the lives of patients with genetic diseases.

242
0:14:13.244,000 --> 0:14:15,000
While many of these diseases are thought to be treatable

243
0:14:16.048,000 --> 0:14:17,000
by correcting the underlying mutation

244
0:14:17.921,000 --> 0:14:2,000
in even a modest fraction of cells in an organ,

245
0:14:21.461,000 --> 0:14:23,000
delivering molecular machines like base editors

246
0:14:24.461,000 --> 0:14:25,000
into cells in a human being

247
0:14:26.252,000 --> 0:14:27,000
can be challenging.

248
0:14:28.962,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Co-opting nature's viruses to deliver base editors

249
0:14:32.359,000 --> 0:14:34,000
instead of the molecules that give you a cold

250
0:14:34.581,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is one of several promising delivery strategies

251
0:14:37.292,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that's been successfully used.

252
0:14:40.268,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Continuing to develop new molecular machines

253
0:14:42.657,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that can make all of the remaining ways

254
0:14:44.549,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to convert one base pair to another base pair

255
0:14:47.465,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and that minimize unwanted editing at off-target locations in cells

256
0:14:51.869,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is very important.

257
0:14:53.782,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And engaging with other scientists, doctors, ethicists and governments

258
0:14:58.512,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to maximize the likelihood that base editing is applied thoughtfully,

259
0:15:03.327,000 --> 0:15:05,000
safely and ethically,

260
0:15:05.732,000 --> 0:15:07,000
remains a critical obligation.

261
0:15:09.525,000 --> 0:15:1,000
These challenges notwithstanding,

262
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
if you had told me even just five years ago

263
0:15:14.839,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that researchers around the globe

264
0:15:16.514,000 --> 0:15:19,000
would be using laboratory-evolved molecular machines

265
0:15:20.077,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to directly convert an individual base pair

266
0:15:23.098,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to another base pair

267
0:15:24.304,000 --> 0:15:26,000
at a specified location in the human genome

268
0:15:26.947,000 --> 0:15:29,000
efficiently and with a minimum of other outcomes,

269
0:15:30.796,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I would have asked you,

270
0:15:31.988,000 --> 0:15:33,000
"What science-fiction novel are you reading?"

271
0:15:35.706,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Thanks to a relentlessly dedicated group of students

272
0:15:39.19,000 --> 0:15:43,000
who were creative enough to engineer what we could design ourselves

273
0:15:43.674,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and brave enough to evolve what we couldn't,

274
0:15:46.623,000 --> 0:15:51,000
base editing has begun to transform that science-fiction-like aspiration

275
0:15:51.687,000 --> 0:15:52,000
into an exciting new reality,

276
0:15:54.25,000 --> 0:15:57,000
one in which the most important gift we give our children

277
0:15:57.505,000 --> 0:16:,000
may not only be three billion letters of DNA,

278
0:16:00.554,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but also the means to protect and repair them.

279
0:16:04.339,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Thank you.

280
0:16:05.514,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Applause)

281
0:16:10.04,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Thank you.

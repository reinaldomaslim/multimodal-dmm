1
0:00:13.071,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I would like to share with you a new model of higher education,

2
0:00:17.502,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a model that, once expanded,

3
0:00:20.308,000 --> 0:00:22,000
can enhance the collective intelligence

4
0:00:22.65,000 --> 0:00:26,000
of millions of creative and motivated individuals

5
0:00:27.143,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that otherwise would be left behind.

6
0:00:30.25,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Look at the world.

7
0:00:32.001,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Pick a place and focus on it.

8
0:00:34.664,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You will find humans chasing higher education.

9
0:00:39.187,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Let's meet some of them.

10
0:00:41.354,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Patrick.

11
0:00:42.821,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Patrick was born in Liberia to a family of 20 children.

12
0:00:48.38,000 --> 0:00:49,000
During the civil war,

13
0:00:50.004,000 --> 0:00:53,000
he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria.

14
0:00:54.468,000 --> 0:00:56,000
There, in spite of his situation,

15
0:00:57.23,000 --> 0:01:,000
he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades.

16
0:01:01.389,000 --> 0:01:04,000
He wanted to continue to higher education,

17
0:01:04.477,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but due to his family living on the poverty line,

18
0:01:07.761,000 --> 0:01:09,000
he was soon sent to South Africa

19
0:01:10.292,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to work and send back money to feed his family.

20
0:01:15.036,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education.

21
0:01:18.892,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Late at night, after work,

22
0:01:21.315,000 --> 0:01:24,000
he surfed the net, looking for ways to study.

23
0:01:25.827,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Meet Debbie.

24
0:01:27.117,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Debbie is from Florida.

25
0:01:29.897,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Her parents didn't go to college, and neither did any of her siblings.

26
0:01:34.706,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Debbie has worked all her life,

27
0:01:38.013,000 --> 0:01:41,000
pays taxes, supports herself month to month,

28
0:01:41.847,000 --> 0:01:43,000
proud of the American dream,

29
0:01:44.199,000 --> 0:01:47,000
a dream that just won't be complete without higher education.

30
0:01:48.87,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education.

31
0:01:52.613,000 --> 0:01:53,000
She can't pay the tuition.

32
0:01:54.881,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Neither could she leave work.

33
0:01:58.094,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Meet Wael.

34
0:01:59.75,000 --> 0:02:,000
Wael is from Syria.

35
0:02:01.91,000 --> 0:02:03,000
He's experiencing firsthand

36
0:02:05.528,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the misery, fear and failure imposed on his country.

37
0:02:10.755,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He's a big believer in education.

38
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
He knew that if he could find an opportunity for higher education,

39
0:02:17.387,000 --> 0:02:19,000
an opportunity to get ahead of the rest,

40
0:02:20.206,000 --> 0:02:24,000
he has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down.

41
0:02:26.057,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The higher education system

42
0:02:29.495,000 --> 0:02:31,000
failed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,

43
0:02:32.241,000 --> 0:02:36,000
exactly as it is failing millions of potential students --

44
0:02:37.21,000 --> 0:02:39,000
millions that graduate high school,

45
0:02:40.187,000 --> 0:02:43,000
millions that are qualified for higher education,

46
0:02:43.599,000 --> 0:02:48,000
millions that want to study yet cannot access it for various reasons.

47
0:02:49.618,000 --> 0:02:5,000
First: financial.

48
0:02:52.412,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Universities are expensive; we all know it.

49
0:02:55.331,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In large parts of the world,

50
0:02:57.459,000 --> 0:03:,000
higher education is unattainable for an average citizen.

51
0:03:02.258,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is probably the biggest problem facing our society.

52
0:03:06.672,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Higher education stopped being a right for all

53
0:03:10.282,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and became a privilege for the few.

54
0:03:13.971,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Second: cultural.

55
0:03:18.061,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Students who are qualified for higher education

56
0:03:20.914,000 --> 0:03:23,000
can afford -- want to study -- cannot,

57
0:03:24.97,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because it is not decent, it is not a place for a woman.

58
0:03:31.047,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is the story of countless women in Africa, for example,

59
0:03:35.01,000 --> 0:03:38,000
prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers.

60
0:03:39.686,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And here comes the third reason:

61
0:03:42.11,000 --> 0:03:45,000
UNESCO stated that in 2025,

62
0:03:45.946,000 --> 0:03:5,000
100 million students will be deprived of higher education,

63
0:03:51.614,000 --> 0:03:55,000
simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them,

64
0:03:56.608,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to meet the demand.

65
0:03:58.363,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They will take a placement test, they will pass it,

66
0:04:01.556,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but they still won't have access, because there are no places available.

67
0:04:07.416,000 --> 0:04:11,000
These are the reasons I founded University of the People,

68
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a nonprofit, tuition-free, degree-granting university

69
0:04:17.047,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to give an alternative,

70
0:04:18.858,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to create an alternative, to those who have no other;

71
0:04:22.376,000 --> 0:04:27,000
an alternative that will be affordable and scalable,

72
0:04:27.841,000 --> 0:04:32,000
an alternative that will disrupt the current education system,

73
0:04:33.725,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and open the gates to higher education for every qualified student

74
0:04:37.917,000 --> 0:04:41,000
regardless of what they earn, where they live,

75
0:04:42.553,000 --> 0:04:44,000
or what society says about them.

76
0:04:45.449,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Patrick, Debbie and Wael

77
0:04:47.445,000 --> 0:04:5,000
are only three examples out of the 1,700 accepted students

78
0:04:51.095,000 --> 0:04:53,000
from 143 countries.

79
0:04:55.492,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:56.896,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Thank you.

81
0:04:58.196,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

82
0:05:00.028,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.

83
0:05:02.273,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We just looked at what wasn't working

84
0:05:04.809,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and used the amazing power of the Internet

85
0:05:07.572,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to get around it.

86
0:05:09.386,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We set out to build a model

87
0:05:12.928,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education.

88
0:05:17.927,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And that's how we did it.

89
0:05:19.869,000 --> 0:05:21,000
First, bricks and mortar cost money.

90
0:05:23.324,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Universities have expenses that virtual universities don't.

91
0:05:28.47,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We don't need to pass these expenses on to our students.

92
0:05:32.124,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They don't exist.

93
0:05:33.528,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We also don't need to worry about capacity.

94
0:05:36.671,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There are no limits of seats in virtual university.

95
0:05:40.867,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Actually, nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall.

96
0:05:45.228,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Textbooks are also something our students don't need to buy.

97
0:05:49.803,000 --> 0:05:51,000
By using open educational resources

98
0:05:52.731,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and the generosity of professors

99
0:05:55.211,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who are putting their material up free and accessible,

100
0:05:59.747,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we don't need to send our students to buy textbooks.

101
0:06:02.523,000 --> 0:06:04,000
All of our materials come free.

102
0:06:05.635,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Even professors,

103
0:06:07.265,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the most expensive line in any university balance sheet,

104
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
come free to our students.

105
0:06:12.84,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Over 3,000 of them,

106
0:06:15.611,000 --> 0:06:21,000
including presidents, vice chancellors, professors and academic advisers

107
0:06:21.648,000 --> 0:06:26,000
from top universities such as NYU, Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,

108
0:06:27.224,000 --> 0:06:29,000
came on board to help our students.

109
0:06:30.2,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Finally, is our belief in peer-to-peer learning.

110
0:06:34.394,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We use this sound pedagogical model

111
0:06:37.624,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to encourage our students from all over the world

112
0:06:40.361,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to interact and study together,

113
0:06:42.715,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and also to reduce the time our professors need

114
0:06:47.778,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to labor over class assignments.

115
0:06:53.006,000 --> 0:06:58,000
If the Internet has made us a global village,

116
0:06:58.232,000 --> 0:07:01,000
this model can develop its future leadership.

117
0:07:02.378,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Look how we do it.

118
0:07:04.251,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We only offer two programs:

119
0:07:07.079,000 --> 0:07:09,000
business administration and computer science,

120
0:07:09.776,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the two programs most in demand worldwide,

121
0:07:13.958,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job.

122
0:07:19.512,000 --> 0:07:21,000
When our students are accepted,

123
0:07:22.274,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they are placed in a small classroom of 20 to 30 students,

124
0:07:28.161,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it.

125
0:07:32.827,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Moreover, for every nine-week course, they meet a new peer,

126
0:07:38.614,000 --> 0:07:41,000
a whole new set of students from all over the world.

127
0:07:42.129,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Every week, when they go into the classroom,

128
0:07:45.409,000 --> 0:07:47,000
they find the lecture notes of the week,

129
0:07:48.166,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the reading assignment, the homework assignment,

130
0:07:50.454,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and the discussion question, which is the core of our studies.

131
0:07:54.405,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Every week, every student must contribute to the class discussion,

132
0:07:58.887,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and also must comment on the contribution of others.

133
0:08:03.109,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This way, we open our students' minds,

134
0:08:06.631,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures.

135
0:08:12.089,000 --> 0:08:15,000
By the end of each week, the students take a quiz,

136
0:08:15.854,000 --> 0:08:16,000
hand in their homework,

137
0:08:17.201,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors,

138
0:08:22.292,000 --> 0:08:24,000
get a grade, move to the next week.

139
0:08:24.566,000 --> 0:08:26,000
By the end of the course, they take the final exam,

140
0:08:27.236,000 --> 0:08:31,000
get a grade, and follow to the next course.

141
0:08:32.703,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We open the gates for higher education for every qualified student.

142
0:08:38.855,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Every student with a high school diploma,

143
0:08:41.793,000 --> 0:08:44,000
sufficient English and Internet connection

144
0:08:44.957,000 --> 0:08:45,000
can study with us.

145
0:08:46.573,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We don't use audio, we don't use video.

146
0:08:49.505,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Broadband is not necessary.

147
0:08:51.889,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Any student from any part of the world with any Internet connection

148
0:08:56.492,000 --> 0:08:57,000
can study with us.

149
0:08:58.798,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We are tuition free.

150
0:09:01.202,000 --> 0:09:04,000
All we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams,

151
0:09:04.843,000 --> 0:09:06,000
100 dollars per exam.

152
0:09:07.396,000 --> 0:09:11,000
A full-time bachelor's degree student taking 40 courses

153
0:09:12.02,000 --> 0:09:13,000
will pay 1,000 dollars a year,

154
0:09:14.867,000 --> 0:09:16,000
4,000 dollars for the entire degree.

155
0:09:17.521,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And for those who cannot afford even this,

156
0:09:21.121,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we offer them a variety of scholarships.

157
0:09:23.895,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It is our mission that nobody will be left behind

158
0:09:26.973,000 --> 0:09:27,000
for financial reasons.

159
0:09:29.058,000 --> 0:09:35,000
With 5,000 students in 2016, this model is financially sustainable.

160
0:09:37.352,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Five years ago, it was a vision.

161
0:09:41.813,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Today, it is a reality.

162
0:09:44.862,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Last month, we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model.

163
0:09:50.325,000 --> 0:09:53,000
University of the People is now fully accredited.

164
0:09:54.743,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

165
0:09:56.029,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Thank you.

166
0:09:57.277,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Applause)

167
0:10:01.386,000 --> 0:10:05,000
With this accreditation, it's our time now to scale up.

168
0:10:06.179,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We have demonstrated that our model works.

169
0:10:10.404,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I invite universities and, even more important,

170
0:10:13.416,000 --> 0:10:14,000
developing countries' governments,

171
0:10:15.109,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to replicate this model

172
0:10:17.039,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely.

173
0:10:22.49,000 --> 0:10:23,000
A new era is coming --

174
0:10:24.45,000 --> 0:10:29,000
an era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model

175
0:10:29.767,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as we know it today,

176
0:10:31.931,000 --> 0:10:33,000
from being a privilege for the few

177
0:10:35.658,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to becoming a basic right, affordable and accessible for all.

178
0:10:41.779,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Thank you.

179
0:10:43.122,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

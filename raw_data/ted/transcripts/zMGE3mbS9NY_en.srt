1
0:00:13.401,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Fifty-four percent of the world's population

2
0:00:16.955,000 --> 0:00:18,000
lives in our cities.

3
0:00:19.536,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In developing countries,

4
0:00:21.181,000 --> 0:00:23,000
one third of that population

5
0:00:23.461,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is living in slums.

6
0:00:26.408,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption

7
0:00:31.04,000 --> 0:00:34,000
occurs in our cities,

8
0:00:34.09,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and 80 percent of gas emissions

9
0:00:36.599,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that cause global warming

10
0:00:38.354,000 --> 0:00:41,000
come from our cities.

11
0:00:41.392,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So things that you and I might think about

12
0:00:44.417,000 --> 0:00:46,000
as global problems,

13
0:00:46.532,000 --> 0:00:48,000
like climate change, the energy crisis

14
0:00:49.18,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or poverty,

15
0:00:50.842,000 --> 0:00:54,000
are really, in many ways, city problems.

16
0:00:55.702,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They will not be solved

17
0:00:57.564,000 --> 0:01:,000
unless people who live in cities,

18
0:01:00.582,000 --> 0:01:01,000
like most of us,

19
0:01:02.501,000 --> 0:01:04,000
actually start doing a better job,

20
0:01:05.293,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because right now, we are not doing a very good one.

21
0:01:09.249,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And that becomes very clear

22
0:01:12.585,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when we look into three aspects of city life:

23
0:01:16.479,000 --> 0:01:2,000
first, our citizens' willingness to engage

24
0:01:20.605,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with democratic institutions;

25
0:01:23.417,000 --> 0:01:27,000
second, our cities' ability to really include

26
0:01:28.221,000 --> 0:01:3,000
all of their residents;

27
0:01:30.763,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and lastly, our own ability

28
0:01:33.94,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to live fulfilling and happy lives.

29
0:01:38.405,000 --> 0:01:39,000
When it comes to engagement,

30
0:01:40.184,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the data is very clear.

31
0:01:43.114,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Voter turnout around the world

32
0:01:45.195,000 --> 0:01:47,000
peaked in the late '80s,

33
0:01:47.636,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and it has been declining at a pace

34
0:01:49.481,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that we have never seen before,

35
0:01:52.543,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and if those numbers are bad at the national level,

36
0:01:56.138,000 --> 0:01:58,000
at the level of our cities,

37
0:01:58.147,000 --> 0:02:01,000
they are just dismal.

38
0:02:01.236,000 --> 0:02:02,000
In the last two years,

39
0:02:02.83,000 --> 0:02:04,000
two of the world's most consolidated,

40
0:02:05.331,000 --> 0:02:08,000
oldest democracies, the U.S. and France,

41
0:02:09.166,000 --> 0:02:12,000
held nationwide municipal elections.

42
0:02:12.971,000 --> 0:02:15,000
In France, voter turnout hit a record low.

43
0:02:16.871,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Almost 40 percent of voters decided

44
0:02:20.933,000 --> 0:02:22,000
not to show up.

45
0:02:23.621,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In the U.S., the numbers were even scarier.

46
0:02:26.71,000 --> 0:02:28,000
In some American cities,

47
0:02:28.987,000 --> 0:02:32,000
voter turnout was close to five percent.

48
0:02:33.981,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'll let that sink in for a second.

49
0:02:35.77,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We're talking about democratic cities

50
0:02:38.188,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in which 95 percent of people

51
0:02:41.563,000 --> 0:02:43,000
decided that it was not important

52
0:02:43.981,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to elect their leaders.

53
0:02:46.726,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The city of L.A., a city of four million people,

54
0:02:50.38,000 --> 0:02:54,000
elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes.

55
0:02:55.309,000 --> 0:02:57,000
That was the lowest turnout the city had seen

56
0:02:57.795,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in 100 years.

57
0:03:00.676,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Right here, in my city of Rio,

58
0:03:03.72,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in spite of mandatory voting,

59
0:03:06.794,000 --> 0:03:09,000
almost 30 percent of the voting population

60
0:03:10.292,000 --> 0:03:12,000
chose to either annul their votes

61
0:03:12.857,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or stay home and pay a fine

62
0:03:15.489,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in the last mayoral elections.

63
0:03:18.82,000 --> 0:03:2,000
When it comes to inclusiveness,

64
0:03:21.139,000 --> 0:03:24,000
our cities are not the best cases of success either,

65
0:03:24.244,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and again, you don't need to look very far

66
0:03:27.134,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in order to find proof of that.

67
0:03:28.889,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The city of Rio is incredibly unequal.

68
0:03:33.388,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is Leblon.

69
0:03:35.357,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood.

70
0:03:38.461,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And this is Complexo do Alemão.

71
0:03:40.9,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This is where over 70,000

72
0:03:43.164,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of the city's poorest residents live.

73
0:03:46.415,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Leblon has an HDI, a Human Development Index,

74
0:03:50.001,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of .967.

75
0:03:53.39,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That is higher than Norway, Switzerland

76
0:03:57.211,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or Sweden.

77
0:03:59.452,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Complexo do Alemão has an HDI of .711.

78
0:04:03.181,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It sits somewhere in between the HDI

79
0:04:06.111,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of Algeria and Gabon.

80
0:04:09.328,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So Rio, like so many cities across the global South,

81
0:04:14.109,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is a place where you can go from northern Europe

82
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to sub-Saharan Africa

83
0:04:18.98,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in the space of 30 minutes.

84
0:04:21.984,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If you drive, that is.

85
0:04:23.693,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you take public transit, it's about two hours.

86
0:04:28.44,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And lastly, perhaps most importantly,

87
0:04:32.299,000 --> 0:04:34,000
cities, with the incredible wealth

88
0:04:34.78,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of relations that they enable,

89
0:04:37.282,000 --> 0:04:4,000
could be the ideal places for human happiness

90
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to flourish.

91
0:04:42.562,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We like being around people.

92
0:04:44.987,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We are social animals.

93
0:04:47.383,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Instead, countries where urbanization

94
0:04:50.006,000 --> 0:04:54,000
has already peaked seem to be the very countries

95
0:04:54.228,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in which cities have stopped making us happy.

96
0:04:58.88,000 --> 0:05:,000
The United States population has suffered

97
0:05:01.484,000 --> 0:05:03,000
from a general decrease in happiness

98
0:05:04.464,000 --> 0:05:07,000
for the past three decades,

99
0:05:07.666,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and the main reason is this.

100
0:05:10.64,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The American way of building cities

101
0:05:13.542,000 --> 0:05:15,000
has caused good quality public spaces

102
0:05:16.253,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to virtually disappear in many,

103
0:05:18.237,000 --> 0:05:19,000
many American cities,

104
0:05:19.992,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and as a result, they have seen

105
0:05:21.989,000 --> 0:05:23,000
a decline of relations,

106
0:05:24.544,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of the things that make us happy.

107
0:05:26.748,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Many studies show an increase

108
0:05:28.795,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in solitude and a decrease in solidarity,

109
0:05:33.486,000 --> 0:05:37,000
honesty, and social and civic participation.

110
0:05:38.142,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So how do we start building cities

111
0:05:41.506,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that make us care?

112
0:05:44.116,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Cities that value their most important asset:

113
0:05:48.75,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the incredible diversity

114
0:05:51.349,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of the people who live in them?

115
0:05:53.555,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Cities that make us happy?

116
0:05:57.212,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Well, I believe that if we want to change

117
0:05:59.719,000 --> 0:06:01,000
what our cities look like,

118
0:06:02.271,000 --> 0:06:04,000
then we really have to change

119
0:06:04.961,000 --> 0:06:06,000
the decision-making processes

120
0:06:07.504,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that have given us the results that we have right now.

121
0:06:11.328,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We need a participation revolution,

122
0:06:14.5,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and we need it fast.

123
0:06:17.374,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship

124
0:06:22.712,000 --> 0:06:24,000
does not make sense anymore.

125
0:06:25.67,000 --> 0:06:27,000
People are tired of only being treated

126
0:06:28.199,000 --> 0:06:32,000
as empowered individuals every few years

127
0:06:32.372,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when it's time to delegate that power

128
0:06:35.522,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to someone else.

129
0:06:37.897,000 --> 0:06:39,000
If the protests that swept Brazil

130
0:06:40.842,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in June 2013 have taught us anything,

131
0:06:45.814,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it's that every time we try

132
0:06:48.649,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to exercise our power

133
0:06:51.101,000 --> 0:06:53,000
outside of an electoral context,

134
0:06:53.958,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we are beaten up, humiliated or arrested.

135
0:06:59.212,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And this needs to change,

136
0:07:02.419,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because when it does,

137
0:07:04.633,000 --> 0:07:06,000
not only will people re-engage

138
0:07:06.894,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with the structures of representation,

139
0:07:09.38,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but also complement these structures

140
0:07:12.654,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with direct, effective, and collective decision making,

141
0:07:19.572,000 --> 0:07:2,000
decision making of the kind

142
0:07:21.496,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that attacks inequality

143
0:07:23.542,000 --> 0:07:26,000
by its very inclusive nature,

144
0:07:26.782,000 --> 0:07:27,000
decision making of the kind

145
0:07:28.605,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that can change our cities

146
0:07:30.821,000 --> 0:07:33,000
into better places for us to live.

147
0:07:33.937,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But there is a catch, obviously:

148
0:07:37.416,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Enabling widespread participation

149
0:07:40.157,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and redistributing power

150
0:07:42.115,000 --> 0:07:44,000
can be a logistical nightmare,

151
0:07:44.84,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and there's where technology can play

152
0:07:47.129,000 --> 0:07:49,000
an incredibly helpful role,

153
0:07:49.306,000 --> 0:07:52,000
by making it easier for people to organize,

154
0:07:52.388,000 --> 0:07:54,000
communicate and make decisions

155
0:07:54.452,000 --> 0:07:56,000
without having to be in the same room

156
0:07:56.69,000 --> 0:07:58,000
at the same time.

157
0:07:58.952,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Unfortunately for us,

158
0:08:00.853,000 --> 0:08:03,000
when it comes to fostering democratic processes,

159
0:08:03.879,000 --> 0:08:06,000
our city governments have not used technology

160
0:08:06.964,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to its full potential.

161
0:08:09.942,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So far, most city governments have been effective

162
0:08:13.159,000 --> 0:08:17,000
at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors

163
0:08:17.742,000 --> 0:08:2,000
who serve authorities with data on the city:

164
0:08:21.45,000 --> 0:08:25,000
potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.

165
0:08:25.456,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They have also, to a lesser extent,

166
0:08:27.886,000 --> 0:08:3,000
invited people to participate in improving

167
0:08:31.486,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the outcome of decisions

168
0:08:33.1,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that were already made for them,

169
0:08:36.412,000 --> 0:08:37,000
just like my mom when I was eight

170
0:08:37.987,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and she told me that I had a choice:

171
0:08:39.753,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I had to be in bed by 8 p.m.,

172
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas.

173
0:08:45.243,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That's not participation,

174
0:08:47.482,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and in fact, governments have not been very good

175
0:08:51.227,000 --> 0:08:53,000
at using technology to enable participation

176
0:08:54.13,000 --> 0:08:55,000
on what matters —

177
0:08:56.08,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the way we allocate our budget,

178
0:08:58.393,000 --> 0:09:,000
the way we occupy our land,

179
0:09:00.615,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and the way we manage our natural resources.

180
0:09:04.164,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Those are the kinds of decisions

181
0:09:06.278,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that can actually impact global problems

182
0:09:09.158,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that manifest themselves in our cities.

183
0:09:12.98,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The good news is,

184
0:09:14.506,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and I do have good news to share with you,

185
0:09:16.369,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we don't need to wait for governments to do this.

186
0:09:20.666,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I have reason to believe

187
0:09:22.636,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that it's possible for citizens to build

188
0:09:25.224,000 --> 0:09:29,000
their own structures of participation.

189
0:09:29.757,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Three years ago, I cofounded an organization

190
0:09:32.558,000 --> 0:09:34,000
called Meu Rio,

191
0:09:35.045,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio

192
0:09:38.125,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to organize around causes and places

193
0:09:41.704,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that they care about in their own city,

194
0:09:44.301,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and have an impact on those causes and places

195
0:09:46.99,000 --> 0:09:48,000
every day.

196
0:09:49.318,000 --> 0:09:51,000
In these past three years, Meu Rio grew

197
0:09:52.06,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to a network of 160,000 citizens of Rio.

198
0:09:57.928,000 --> 0:10:,000
About 40 percent of those members are young people

199
0:10:01.833,000 --> 0:10:03,000
aged 20 to 29.

200
0:10:04.072,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That is one in every 15 young people

201
0:10:08.996,000 --> 0:10:11,000
of that age in Rio today.

202
0:10:12.828,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Amongst our members is this adorable little girl,

203
0:10:16.46,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Bia, to your right,

204
0:10:18.509,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and Bia was just 11 years old

205
0:10:21.636,000 --> 0:10:23,000
when she started a campaign using one of our tools

206
0:10:24.572,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to save her model public school from demolition.

207
0:10:28.161,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Her school actually ranks among the best

208
0:10:30.253,000 --> 0:10:32,000
public schools in the country,

209
0:10:32.525,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and it was going to be demolished

210
0:10:34.257,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by the Rio de Janeiro state government

211
0:10:36.811,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to build, I kid you not,

212
0:10:38.701,000 --> 0:10:4,000
a parking lot for the World Cup

213
0:10:41.524,000 --> 0:10:43,000
right before the event happened.

214
0:10:43.87,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Bia started a campaign, and we even watched

215
0:10:46.364,000 --> 0:10:49,000
her school 24/7 through webcam monitoring,

216
0:10:49.747,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and many months afterwards,

217
0:10:51.761,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the government changed their minds.

218
0:10:53.392,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Bia's school stayed in place.

219
0:10:56.316,000 --> 0:10:58,000
There's also Jovita.

220
0:10:58.487,000 --> 0:11:,000
She's an amazing woman whose daughter

221
0:11:00.759,000 --> 0:11:02,000
went missing about 10 years ago,

222
0:11:03.42,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and since then, she has been looking

223
0:11:05.855,000 --> 0:11:06,000
for her daughter.

224
0:11:07.039,000 --> 0:11:09,000
In that process, she found out

225
0:11:09.815,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that first, she was not alone.

226
0:11:12.368,000 --> 0:11:14,000
In the last year alone, 2013,

227
0:11:14.956,000 --> 0:11:15,000
6,000 people disappeared

228
0:11:16.83,000 --> 0:11:17,000
in the state of Rio.

229
0:11:18.706,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But she also found out that in spite of that,

230
0:11:21.334,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Rio had no centralized intelligence system

231
0:11:25.285,000 --> 0:11:28,000
for solving missing persons cases.

232
0:11:28.59,000 --> 0:11:3,000
In other Brazilian cities, those systems

233
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
have helped solve up to 80 percent

234
0:11:33.55,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of missing persons cases.

235
0:11:35.586,000 --> 0:11:36,000
She started a campaign,

236
0:11:37.329,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and after the secretary of security got 16,000 emails

237
0:11:41.311,000 --> 0:11:43,000
from people asking him to do this,

238
0:11:44.124,000 --> 0:11:46,000
he responded, and started to build a police unit

239
0:11:47.106,000 --> 0:11:48,000
specializing in those cases.

240
0:11:48.93,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It was open to the public at the end of last month,

241
0:11:52.286,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and Jovita was there

242
0:11:54.137,000 --> 0:11:57,000
giving interviews and being very fancy.

243
0:11:57.161,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And then, there is Leandro.

244
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:,000
Leandro is an amazing guy

245
0:12:00.723,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in a slum in Rio,

246
0:12:02.639,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and he created a recycling project in the slum.

247
0:12:06.062,000 --> 0:12:08,000
At the end of last year, December 16,

248
0:12:08.512,000 --> 0:12:1,000
he received an eviction order

249
0:12:10.604,000 --> 0:12:11,000
by the Rio de Janeiro state government

250
0:12:12.584,000 --> 0:12:15,000
giving him two weeks to leave the space

251
0:12:16.504,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that he had been using for two years.

252
0:12:20.244,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The plan was to hand it over to a developer,

253
0:12:22.809,000 --> 0:12:25,000
who planned to turn it into a construction site.

254
0:12:26.229,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools,

255
0:12:29.297,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the Pressure Cooker,

256
0:12:30.875,000 --> 0:12:32,000
the same one that Bia and Jovita used,

257
0:12:33.214,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and the state government changed their minds

258
0:12:36.27,000 --> 0:12:39,000
before Christmas Eve.

259
0:12:39.536,000 --> 0:12:42,000
These stories make me happy,

260
0:12:42.608,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but not just because they have happy endings.

261
0:12:45.655,000 --> 0:12:47,000
They make me happy because they are

262
0:12:48.401,000 --> 0:12:5,000
happy beginnings.

263
0:12:51.1,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The teacher and parent community at Bia's school

264
0:12:53.519,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is looking for other ways they could improve

265
0:12:55.475,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that space even further.

266
0:12:58.952,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Leandro has ambitious plans

267
0:13:00.663,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to take his model to other low-income communities in Rio,

268
0:13:03.616,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit

269
0:13:06.827,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that she helped created.

270
0:13:09.667,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Bia, Jovita and Leandro

271
0:13:12.415,000 --> 0:13:14,000
are living examples of something

272
0:13:14.475,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that citizens and city governments around the world

273
0:13:18.057,000 --> 0:13:2,000
need to know:

274
0:13:20.461,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We are ready.

275
0:13:23.788,000 --> 0:13:25,000
As citizens, we are ready

276
0:13:26.716,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to decide on our common destinies,

277
0:13:30.271,000 --> 0:13:34,000
because we know that the way we distribute power

278
0:13:34.29,000 --> 0:13:38,000
says a lot about how we actually value everyone,

279
0:13:39.13,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and because we know

280
0:13:41.36,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that enabling and participating in local politics

281
0:13:44.855,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is a sign that we truly care

282
0:13:46.978,000 --> 0:13:48,000
about our relations to one another,

283
0:13:49.168,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and we are ready to do this

284
0:13:50.89,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in cities around the world right now.

285
0:13:54.907,000 --> 0:13:56,000
With the Our Cities network,

286
0:13:57.303,000 --> 0:13:58,000
the Meu Rio team

287
0:13:58.64,000 --> 0:14:,000
hopes to share what we have learned

288
0:14:00.666,000 --> 0:14:01,000
with other people who want to create

289
0:14:02.622,000 --> 0:14:05,000
similar initiatives in their own cities.

290
0:14:05.884,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We have already started doing it in São Paulo

291
0:14:08.441,000 --> 0:14:09,000
with incredible results,

292
0:14:10.137,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and want to take it to cities around the world

293
0:14:13.444,000 --> 0:14:15,000
through a network of citizen-centric,

294
0:14:16.369,000 --> 0:14:18,000
citizen-led organizations

295
0:14:18.746,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that can inspire us,

296
0:14:20.932,000 --> 0:14:23,000
challenge us, and remind us to demand

297
0:14:24.396,000 --> 0:14:29,000
real participation in our city lives.

298
0:14:29.447,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It is up to us

299
0:14:31.409,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to decide whether we want schools

300
0:14:33.894,000 --> 0:14:35,000
or parking lots,

301
0:14:36.18,000 --> 0:14:38,000
community-driven recycling projects

302
0:14:38.513,000 --> 0:14:4,000
or construction sites,

303
0:14:41.116,000 --> 0:14:43,000
loneliness or solidarity, cars or buses,

304
0:14:43.536,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and it is our responsibility to do that now,

305
0:14:47.235,000 --> 0:14:5,000
for ourselves, for our families,

306
0:14:50.659,000 --> 0:14:54,000
for the people who make our lives worth living,

307
0:14:54.753,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and for the incredible creativity,

308
0:14:57.62,000 --> 0:15:,000
beauty, and wonder that make our cities,

309
0:15:01.027,000 --> 0:15:03,000
in spite of all of their problems,

310
0:15:03.614,000 --> 0:15:06,000
the greatest invention of our time.

311
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Obrigado. Thank you.

312
0:15:09.81,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(Applause)

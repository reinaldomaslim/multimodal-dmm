1
0:00:12.664,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It was chaos as I got off the elevator.

2
0:00:15.773,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was coming back on duty as a resident physician

3
0:00:18.662,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to cover the labor and delivery unit.

4
0:00:20.881,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And all I could see was a swarm of doctors and nurses

5
0:00:24.046,000 --> 0:00:26,000
hovering over a patient in the labor room.

6
0:00:26.508,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They were all desperately trying to save a woman's life.

7
0:00:29.987,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The patient was in shock.

8
0:00:31.773,000 --> 0:00:35,000
She had delivered a healthy baby boy a few hours before I arrived.

9
0:00:36.7,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Suddenly, she collapsed, became unresponsive,

10
0:00:39.819,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and had profuse uterine bleeding.

11
0:00:42.483,000 --> 0:00:43,000
By the time I got to the room,

12
0:00:44.229,000 --> 0:00:48,000
there were multiple doctors and nurses, and the patient was lifeless.

13
0:00:48.553,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The resuscitation team tried to bring her back to life,

14
0:00:51.859,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but despite everyone's best efforts,

15
0:00:53.635,000 --> 0:00:54,000
she died.

16
0:00:55.108,000 --> 0:00:59,000
What I remember most about that day was the father's piercing cry.

17
0:00:59.303,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It went through my heart and the heart of everyone on that floor.

18
0:01:02.977,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This was supposed to be the happiest day of his life,

19
0:01:05.812,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but instead it turned out to be the worst day.

20
0:01:10.278,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I wish I could say this tragedy was an isolated incident,

21
0:01:13.871,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but sadly, that's not the case.

22
0:01:16.132,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Every year in the United States,

23
0:01:18.001,000 --> 0:01:21,000
somewhere between 700 and 900 women die

24
0:01:21.542,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from a pregnancy-related cause.

25
0:01:23.882,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The shocking part of this story

26
0:01:25.867,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is that our maternal mortality rate is actually higher

27
0:01:29.241,000 --> 0:01:31,000
than all other high-income countries,

28
0:01:31.686,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and our rates are far worse for women of color.

29
0:01:35.189,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Our rate of maternal mortality actually increased over the last decade,

30
0:01:40.207,000 --> 0:01:42,000
while other countries reduced their rates.

31
0:01:43.38,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And the biggest paradox of all?

32
0:01:45.523,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We spend more on health care than any other country in the world.

33
0:01:50.582,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Well, around the same time in residency that this new mother lost her life,

34
0:01:54.698,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I became a mother myself.

35
0:01:56.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And even with all of my background and training in the field,

36
0:02:00.114,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I was taken aback by how little attention was paid

37
0:02:03.677,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to delivering high-quality maternal health care.

38
0:02:06.649,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I thought about what that meant, not just for myself

39
0:02:09.381,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but for so many other women.

40
0:02:11.781,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Maybe it's because my dad was a civil rights attorney

41
0:02:15.209,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and my parents were socially conscious

42
0:02:17.488,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and demanded that we stand up for what we believe in.

43
0:02:20.314,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Or the fact that my parents were born in Jamaica,

44
0:02:22.816,000 --> 0:02:23,000
came to the United States

45
0:02:24.247,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and were able to realize the American Dream.

46
0:02:27.257,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Or maybe it was my residency training,

47
0:02:29.431,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where I saw firsthand

48
0:02:31.648,000 --> 0:02:34,000
how poorly so many low-income women of color were treated

49
0:02:34.856,000 --> 0:02:35,000
by our healthcare system.

50
0:02:36.617,000 --> 0:02:39,000
For whatever the reason, I felt a responsibility to stand up,

51
0:02:40.401,000 --> 0:02:41,000
not just for myself,

52
0:02:41.879,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but for all women,

53
0:02:43.177,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and especially those marginalized by our healthcare system.

54
0:02:46.758,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I decided to focus my career on improving maternal health care.

55
0:02:52.726,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So what's killing mothers?

56
0:02:54.656,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Cardiovascular disease, hemorrhage,

57
0:02:57.055,000 --> 0:02:59,000
high blood pressure causing seizures and strokes,

58
0:03:00.069,000 --> 0:03:01,000
blood clots and infection

59
0:03:01.522,000 --> 0:03:04,000
are some of the major causes of maternal mortality in this country.

60
0:03:05.796,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But a maternal death is only the tip of the iceberg.

61
0:03:09.357,000 --> 0:03:13,000
For every death, over a hundred women suffer a severe complication

62
0:03:14.293,000 --> 0:03:16,000
related to pregnancy and childbirth,

63
0:03:16.343,000 --> 0:03:2,000
resulting in over 60,000 women every year having one of these events.

64
0:03:21.506,000 --> 0:03:23,000
These complications, called severe maternal morbidity,

65
0:03:24.5,000 --> 0:03:27,000
are on the rise in the United States, and they're life-altering.

66
0:03:28.362,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's estimated that somewhere between 1.5 and two percent

67
0:03:32.063,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of the four million deliveries that occur every year in this country

68
0:03:35.809,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are associated with one of these events.

69
0:03:38.539,000 --> 0:03:43,000
That is five or six women every hour having a blood clot, a seizure, a stroke,

70
0:03:44.117,000 --> 0:03:45,000
receiving a blood transfusion,

71
0:03:45.96,000 --> 0:03:47,000
having end-organ damage such as kidney failure,

72
0:03:48.879,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or some other tragic event.

73
0:03:52.758,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, the part of this story that's frankly unforgivable

74
0:03:55.991,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is the fact that 60 percent of these deaths and severe complications

75
0:04:00.318,000 --> 0:04:01,000
are thought to be preventable.

76
0:04:02.309,000 --> 0:04:04,000
When I say 60 percent are preventable,

77
0:04:04.829,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I mean there are concrete steps and standard procedures

78
0:04:08.091,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that we could implement

79
0:04:09.583,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that could prevent these bad outcomes from occurring

80
0:04:12.158,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and save women's lives.

81
0:04:14.361,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And it doesn't require fancy new technology.

82
0:04:17.062,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We just have to apply what we know

83
0:04:19.194,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and ensure equal standards between hospitals.

84
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
For example, if a pregnant woman in labor has really high blood pressure

85
0:04:27.466,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and we treat her with the right antihypertensive medication

86
0:04:30.446,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in a timely fashion,

87
0:04:32.052,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we can prevent stroke.

88
0:04:34.3,000 --> 0:04:37,000
If we accurately track blood loss during delivery,

89
0:04:37.543,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we can detect a hemorrhage sooner and save a woman's life.

90
0:04:41.7,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We could actually lower the rates of these catastrophic events tomorrow,

91
0:04:46.249,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but it requires that we value the quality of care

92
0:04:49.048,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we deliver to pregnant women

93
0:04:50.921,000 --> 0:04:53,000
before, during and after pregnancy.

94
0:04:54.052,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If we raise quality of care universally to what is supposed to be the standard,

95
0:04:58.897,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we could bring the rates of these deaths and severe complications way down.

96
0:05:03.695,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Well, there is some good news.

97
0:05:06.403,000 --> 0:05:07,000
There are some success stories.

98
0:05:08.972,000 --> 0:05:11,000
There are some places that have actually adopted these standards,

99
0:05:12.104,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and it's really making a difference.

100
0:05:13.883,000 --> 0:05:17,000
A few years ago, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

101
0:05:18.238,000 --> 0:05:2,000
joined forces with other healthcare organizations,

102
0:05:21.026,000 --> 0:05:24,000
researchers like myself and community organizations.

103
0:05:24.363,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They wanted to implement standard care practices

104
0:05:27.326,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in hospitals and health systems throughout the country.

105
0:05:30.726,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And the vehicle they're using is a program called

106
0:05:33.079,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the Alliance for Innovation in Maternal Health, the AIM program.

107
0:05:37.344,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Their goal is to lower maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity rates

108
0:05:42.129,000 --> 0:05:45,000
through quality and safety initiatives across the country.

109
0:05:45.959,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The group has developed a number of safety bundles

110
0:05:48.949,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that target some of the most preventable causes of a maternal death.

111
0:05:53.148,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The AIM program currently has the potential to reach

112
0:05:56.204,000 --> 0:05:58,000
over 50 percent of US births.

113
0:05:59.443,000 --> 0:06:,000
So what's in a safety bundle?

114
0:06:01.46,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Evidence-based practices, protocols, procedures,

115
0:06:04.237,000 --> 0:06:05,000
medications, equipment

116
0:06:05.795,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and other items targeting these conditions.

117
0:06:08.537,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Let's take the example of a hemorrhage bundle.

118
0:06:11.66,000 --> 0:06:12,000
For a hemorrhage, you need a cart

119
0:06:13.604,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that has everything a doctor or nurse might need in an emergency:

120
0:06:17.165,000 --> 0:06:2,000
an IV line, an oxygen mask, medications,

121
0:06:20.772,000 --> 0:06:22,000
checklists, other equipment.

122
0:06:22.995,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Then you need something to measure blood loss:

123
0:06:25.179,000 --> 0:06:26,000
sponges and pads.

124
0:06:26.745,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And instead of just eyeballing it,

125
0:06:28.602,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the doctors and nurses collect these sponges and pads

126
0:06:31.609,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and either weigh them

127
0:06:33.221,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or use newer technology to accurately assess how much blood has been lost.

128
0:06:39.32,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The hemorrhage bundle also includes crises protocols for massive transfusions

129
0:06:44.554,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and regular trainings and drills.

130
0:06:46.914,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now, California has been a leader in the use of these types of bundles,

131
0:06:50.681,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and that's why California saw a 21 percent reduction

132
0:06:54.467,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in near death from hemorrhage

133
0:06:56.149,000 --> 0:06:59,000
among hospitals that implemented this bundle in the first year.

134
0:07:00.276,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Yet the use of these bundles across the country is spotty or missing.

135
0:07:04.707,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Just like the fact that the use of evidence-based practices

136
0:07:07.636,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and the emphasis on safety

137
0:07:09.506,000 --> 0:07:11,000
differs from one hospital to the next,

138
0:07:12.19,000 --> 0:07:13,000
quality of care differs.

139
0:07:14.359,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And quality of care differs greatly for women of color in the United States.

140
0:07:19.121,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Black women who deliver in this country

141
0:07:21.252,000 --> 0:07:25,000
are three to four times more likely to suffer a pregnancy-related death

142
0:07:25.602,000 --> 0:07:26,000
than are white women.

143
0:07:27.649,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This statistic is true for all black women who deliver in this country,

144
0:07:31.727,000 --> 0:07:33,000
whether they were born in the United States

145
0:07:33.88,000 --> 0:07:34,000
or born in another country.

146
0:07:35.823,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Many want to think that income differences drive these disparities,

147
0:07:39.536,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but it goes beyond class.

148
0:07:41.833,000 --> 0:07:43,000
A black woman with a college education

149
0:07:44.493,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is nearly twice as likely to die as compared to a white woman

150
0:07:48.264,000 --> 0:07:5,000
with less than a high school education.

151
0:07:50.82,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And she is two to three times more likely to suffer a severe pregnancy complication

152
0:07:56.378,000 --> 0:07:57,000
with her delivery.

153
0:07:58.407,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now, I was always taught to think that education was our salvation,

154
0:08:02.652,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but in this case, it's simply not true.

155
0:08:06.271,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This black-white disparity

156
0:08:08.405,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is the largest disparity

157
0:08:10.161,000 --> 0:08:12,000
among all population perinatal health measures,

158
0:08:12.617,000 --> 0:08:13,000
according to the CDC.

159
0:08:14.99,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And these disparities are even more pronounced

160
0:08:17.234,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in some of our cities.

161
0:08:18.776,000 --> 0:08:2,000
For example, in New York City,

162
0:08:20.954,000 --> 0:08:23,000
a black woman is eight to 12 times more likely to die

163
0:08:24.381,000 --> 0:08:27,000
from a pregnancy-related cause than is a white woman.

164
0:08:28.822,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, I think many of you are probably familiar with

165
0:08:31.263,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the heart-wrenching story of Dr. Shalon Irving,

166
0:08:33.884,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a CDC epidemiologist who died following childbirth.

167
0:08:37.893,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Her story was reported in ProPublica and NPR

168
0:08:41.501,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a little less than a year ago.

169
0:08:43.434,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Recently, I was at a conference

170
0:08:45.13,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I had the privilege of hearing her mother speak.

171
0:08:47.797,000 --> 0:08:49,000
She brought the entire audience to tears.

172
0:08:50.909,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Shalon was a brilliant epidemiologist,

173
0:08:53.189,000 --> 0:08:56,000
committed to studying racial and ethnic disparities in health.

174
0:08:56.474,000 --> 0:08:59,000
She was 36 years old, this was her first baby,

175
0:08:59.648,000 --> 0:09:,000
and she was African-American.

176
0:09:02.07,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now, Shalon did have a complicated pregnancy,

177
0:09:05.121,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but she delivered a healthy baby girl and was discharged from the hospital.

178
0:09:09.71,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Three weeks later, she died from complications of high blood pressure.

179
0:09:14.864,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Shalon was seen four or five times by healthcare professionals

180
0:09:19.168,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in those three weeks.

181
0:09:20.74,000 --> 0:09:21,000
She was not listened to,

182
0:09:22.413,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and the severity of her condition was not recognized.

183
0:09:27.169,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, Shalon's story is just one of many stories

184
0:09:30.193,000 --> 0:09:33,000
about racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care

185
0:09:33.631,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in the United States,

186
0:09:35.345,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and there's a growing recognition that the social determinants of health,

187
0:09:39.737,000 --> 0:09:43,000
such as racism, poverty, education, segregated housing,

188
0:09:44.064,000 --> 0:09:45,000
contribute to these disparities.

189
0:09:46.419,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But Shalon's story highlights an additional underlying cause:

190
0:09:50.528,000 --> 0:09:51,000
quality of care.

191
0:09:52.027,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Lack of standards in postpartum care.

192
0:09:55.067,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Shalon was seen multiple times by clinicians in those three weeks,

193
0:09:58.379,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and she still died.

194
0:10:00.3,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Quality of care in the setting of childbirth

195
0:10:03.025,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is an underlying cause of racial and ethnic disparities

196
0:10:06.292,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity

197
0:10:09.134,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in the United States,

198
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and it's something we can address now.

199
0:10:14.073,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Research by our team and others

200
0:10:16.244,000 --> 0:10:18,000
has documented that, for a variety of reasons,

201
0:10:18.802,000 --> 0:10:21,000
black women tend to deliver in a specific set of hospitals,

202
0:10:22.298,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and those hospitals often have worse outcomes for both black and white women,

203
0:10:26.478,000 --> 0:10:28,000
regardless of patient risk factors.

204
0:10:29.379,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is true overall in the United States,

205
0:10:31.959,000 --> 0:10:33,000
where about three quarters of all black women

206
0:10:34.228,000 --> 0:10:36,000
deliver in a specific set of hospitals,

207
0:10:36.542,000 --> 0:10:39,000
while less than one-fifth of white women deliver in those same hospitals.

208
0:10:40.85,000 --> 0:10:44,000
In New York City, a woman's risk of having a life-threatening complication

209
0:10:44.932,000 --> 0:10:45,000
during delivery

210
0:10:46.115,000 --> 0:10:49,000
can be six times higher in one hospital than another.

211
0:10:49.849,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Not surprisingly, black women are more likely to deliver

212
0:10:53.943,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in hospitals with worse outcomes.

213
0:10:55.571,000 --> 0:10:57,000
In fact, differences in delivery hospital

214
0:10:57.668,000 --> 0:10:59,000
explain nearly one-half of the black-white disparity.

215
0:11:01.757,000 --> 0:11:03,000
While we must address social determinants of health

216
0:11:04.429,000 --> 0:11:07,000
if we're ever going to truly have equitable health care in this country,

217
0:11:08.366,000 --> 0:11:11,000
many of these are deep-seated and they will take some time to resolve.

218
0:11:12.129,000 --> 0:11:14,000
In the meantime, we can tackle quality of care.

219
0:11:15.373,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Providing high-quality care across the care continuum

220
0:11:19.408,000 --> 0:11:22,000
means providing access to safe and reliable contraception

221
0:11:22.953,000 --> 0:11:24,000
throughout women's reproductive lives.

222
0:11:25.801,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Before pregnancy, it means providing preconception care,

223
0:11:30.553,000 --> 0:11:33,000
so we can manage chronic illness and optimize health.

224
0:11:34.081,000 --> 0:11:38,000
During pregnancy, it includes high-quality prenatal and delivery care

225
0:11:38.263,000 --> 0:11:4,000
so we can produce healthy moms and babies.

226
0:11:41.123,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And finally, after pregnancy, it includes postpartum and inter-pregnancy care

227
0:11:46.473,000 --> 0:11:49,000
so we can set moms up to have a healthy next baby

228
0:11:49.834,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and a healthy life.

229
0:11:51.348,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And it can literally spell the difference between life and death,

230
0:11:54.492,000 --> 0:11:55,000
as it did in the case of Maria,

231
0:11:56.479,000 --> 0:11:59,000
who checked into the hospital after having an elevated blood pressure

232
0:11:59.812,000 --> 0:12:,000
during a prenatal visit.

233
0:12:01.653,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Maria was 40, and this was her second pregnancy.

234
0:12:05.044,000 --> 0:12:08,000
During Maria's first pregnancy that had happened two years earlier,

235
0:12:08.644,000 --> 0:12:11,000
she also didn't feel so well in the last few weeks of her pregnancy,

236
0:12:12.055,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and she had a few elevated blood pressures,

237
0:12:14.45,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but nobody seemed to pay attention.

238
0:12:16.797,000 --> 0:12:18,000
They just said, "Maria, don't worry, you'll be fine.

239
0:12:19.288,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This is your first pregnancy. You're a little nervous."

240
0:12:22.007,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But it did not end well for Maria last time.

241
0:12:24.467,000 --> 0:12:25,000
She seized during labor.

242
0:12:26.91,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Well, this time her team really listened.

243
0:12:29.368,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They asked smart and probing questions.

244
0:12:31.809,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Her doctor counseled her about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia

245
0:12:35.737,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and explained that if she was not feeling well,

246
0:12:37.997,000 --> 0:12:38,000
she needed to come in and be seen.

247
0:12:40.065,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And this time Maria came in,

248
0:12:42.079,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and her doctor immediately sent her to the hospital.

249
0:12:45.418,000 --> 0:12:48,000
At the hospital, her doctor ordered urgent lab tests.

250
0:12:49.379,000 --> 0:12:51,000
They hooked her up to multiple different monitors

251
0:12:51.84,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and paid special attention to her blood pressure,

252
0:12:54.158,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the fetal heart rate tracing

253
0:12:55.824,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and gave her IV medication to prevent a seizure.

254
0:12:59.038,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And when Maria's blood pressure got so high it put her at risk for a stroke,

255
0:13:03.044,000 --> 0:13:05,000
her doctors and nurses jumped into action.

256
0:13:05.625,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They repeated her blood pressure in 15 minutes

257
0:13:07.819,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and declared a hypertensive emergency.

258
0:13:10.003,000 --> 0:13:14,000
They gave her the right IV medication according to the latest correct protocol.

259
0:13:14.222,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They worked smoothly together as a coordinated team

260
0:13:17.204,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and successfully lowered her blood pressure.

261
0:13:21.246,000 --> 0:13:24,000
As a result, what could have been a tragedy became a success story.

262
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Maria's dangerous symptoms were controlled,

263
0:13:27.262,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and she delivered a healthy baby girl.

264
0:13:30.489,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And before Maria was discharged from the hospital,

265
0:13:33.044,000 --> 0:13:36,000
her doctor counseled her again about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia,

266
0:13:36.965,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the importance of having her blood pressure checked,

267
0:13:39.653,000 --> 0:13:41,000
especially in this first week postpartum

268
0:13:41.872,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and gave her education about postpartum health and what to expect.

269
0:13:46.213,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And in the weeks and months that followed,

270
0:13:48.314,000 --> 0:13:5,000
naturally, Maria had follow-up visits with her pediatrician

271
0:13:51.126,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to check in on her baby's health.

272
0:13:53.379,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But just as important,

273
0:13:54.713,000 --> 0:13:56,000
she had follow-up visits with her ob-gyn

274
0:13:57.409,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to check in on her health, her blood pressure,

275
0:13:59.854,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and her cares and concerns as a new mother.

276
0:14:02.882,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This is what high-quality care across the care continuum looks like,

277
0:14:06.745,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and this is how it can look.

278
0:14:08.671,000 --> 0:14:1,000
If every pregnant woman in every community

279
0:14:11.273,000 --> 0:14:14,000
received this kind of high-quality care

280
0:14:14.473,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and delivered at facilities that utilized standard care practices,

281
0:14:18.123,000 --> 0:14:22,000
our maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity rates would plummet.

282
0:14:22.349,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Our international ranking would no longer be an embarrassment.

283
0:14:25.937,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But the truth is, we've had decades of unacceptably high rates

284
0:14:30.78,000 --> 0:14:34,000
of maternal death and life-threatening complications during delivery

285
0:14:35.55,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and decades of devastating consequences for moms, babies and families,

286
0:14:40.692,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and we have not been moved to action.

287
0:14:43.336,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The recent media attention on our poor performance on maternal mortality

288
0:14:47.198,000 --> 0:14:49,000
has helped the public to understand:

289
0:14:49.556,000 --> 0:14:52,000
high-quality maternal health care is within reach.

290
0:14:52.581,000 --> 0:14:53,000
The question is:

291
0:14:53.81,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Are we as a society ready to value pregnant women from every community?

292
0:14:59.042,000 --> 0:15:03,000
For my part, I'm doing everything I can to ensure that when we do,

293
0:15:03.737,000 --> 0:15:06,000
we have the tools and evidence base ready

294
0:15:06.853,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to move forward.

295
0:15:09.001,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Thank you.

296
0:15:10.207,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

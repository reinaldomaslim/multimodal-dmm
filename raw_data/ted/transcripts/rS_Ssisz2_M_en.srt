1
0:00:12.537,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I want to tell you

2
0:00:14.159,000 --> 0:00:18,000
how 20,000 remarkable young people

3
0:00:18.85,000 --> 0:00:19,000
from over 100 countries

4
0:00:20.706,000 --> 0:00:21,000
ended up in Cuba

5
0:00:22.518,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and are transforming health in their communities.

6
0:00:26.321,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Ninety percent of them would never

7
0:00:28.401,000 --> 0:00:29,000
have left home at all

8
0:00:29.973,000 --> 0:00:32,000
if it weren't for a scholarship to study medicine in Cuba

9
0:00:33.317,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and a commitment to go back

10
0:00:35.128,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to places like the ones they'd come from —

11
0:00:38.756,000 --> 0:00:41,000
remote farmlands, mountains, ghettos —

12
0:00:42.203,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to become doctors for people like themselves,

13
0:00:45.689,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to walk the walk.

14
0:00:47.781,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Havana's Latin American Medical School:

15
0:00:50.447,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's the largest medical school in the world,

16
0:00:53.372,000 --> 0:00:55,000
graduating 23,000 young doctors

17
0:00:56.274,000 --> 0:00:58,000
since its first class of 2005,

18
0:00:59.002,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline.

19
0:01:02.611,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Its mission, to train physicians for the people

20
0:01:06.432,000 --> 0:01:08,000
who need them the most:

21
0:01:08.483,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the over one billion

22
0:01:10.419,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who have never seen a doctor,

23
0:01:12.682,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the people who live and die

24
0:01:16.515,000 --> 0:01:19,000
under every poverty line ever invented.

25
0:01:20.009,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Its students defy all norms.

26
0:01:22.259,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They're the school's biggest risk

27
0:01:24.53,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and also its best bet.

28
0:01:26.99,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They're recruited from the poorest,

29
0:01:29.505,000 --> 0:01:31,000
most broken places on our planet

30
0:01:32.076,000 --> 0:01:34,000
by a school that believes they can become

31
0:01:34.35,000 --> 0:01:35,000
not just the good

32
0:01:35.857,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but the excellent physicians

33
0:01:37.792,000 --> 0:01:39,000
their communities desperately need,

34
0:01:40.545,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that they will practice where most doctors don't,

35
0:01:44.197,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in places not only poor

36
0:01:46.623,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but oftentimes dangerous,

37
0:01:49.176,000 --> 0:01:52,000
carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks

38
0:01:52.202,000 --> 0:01:54,000
or navigating neighborhoods

39
0:01:54.821,000 --> 0:01:57,000
riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,

40
0:01:58.142,000 --> 0:02:,000
their home ground.

41
0:02:00.842,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The hope is that they will help

42
0:02:02.168,000 --> 0:02:04,000
transform access to care,

43
0:02:04.768,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the health picture in impoverished areas,

44
0:02:07.187,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and even the way medicine itself

45
0:02:09.346,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is learned and practiced,

46
0:02:11.889,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and that they will become pioneers in our global reach

47
0:02:16.14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for universal health coverage,

48
0:02:18.66,000 --> 0:02:2,000
surely a tall order.

49
0:02:21.378,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Two big storms and this notion of "walk the walk"

50
0:02:25.504,000 --> 0:02:29,000
prompted creation of ELAM back in 1998.

51
0:02:29.588,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch

52
0:02:32.591,000 --> 0:02:33,000
had ripped through the Caribbean

53
0:02:34.143,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and Central America,

54
0:02:36.348,000 --> 0:02:38,000
leaving 30,000 dead

55
0:02:38.727,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and two and a half million homeless.

56
0:02:41.61,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Hundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response,

57
0:02:45.303,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but when they got there,

58
0:02:47.148,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they found a bigger disaster:

59
0:02:49.231,000 --> 0:02:52,000
whole communities with no healthcare,

60
0:02:52.427,000 --> 0:02:54,000
doors bolted shut on rural hospitals

61
0:02:54.751,000 --> 0:02:55,000
for lack of staff,

62
0:02:56.63,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and just too many babies dying

63
0:02:59.301,000 --> 0:03:01,000
before their first birthday.

64
0:03:02.236,000 --> 0:03:05,000
What would happen when these Cuban doctors left?

65
0:03:06.07,000 --> 0:03:08,000
New doctors were needed to make care sustainable,

66
0:03:08.784,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but where would they come from?

67
0:03:10.096,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Where would they train?

68
0:03:12.901,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In Havana, the campus of a former naval academy

69
0:03:17.344,000 --> 0:03:19,000
was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry

70
0:03:20.269,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to become the Latin American Medical School,

71
0:03:23.62,000 --> 0:03:25,000
ELAM.

72
0:03:25.633,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Tuition, room and board, and a small stipend

73
0:03:28.107,000 --> 0:03:29,000
were offered to hundreds of students

74
0:03:30.018,000 --> 0:03:33,000
from the countries hardest hit by the storms.

75
0:03:33.051,000 --> 0:03:35,000
As a journalist in Havana,

76
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive

77
0:03:38.047,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in March 1999,

78
0:03:40.589,000 --> 0:03:42,000
settling into dorms barely refurbished

79
0:03:43.305,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms

80
0:03:46.984,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes.

81
0:03:51.663,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Over the next few years,

82
0:03:53.542,000 --> 0:03:54,000
governments throughout the Americas

83
0:03:55.454,000 --> 0:03:58,000
requested scholarships for their own students,

84
0:03:58.627,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the Congressional Black Caucus

85
0:04:00.505,000 --> 0:04:03,000
asked for and received hundreds of scholarships

86
0:04:03.88,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for young people from the USA.

87
0:04:07.12,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Today, among the 23,000

88
0:04:10.832,000 --> 0:04:13,000
are graduates from 83 countries

89
0:04:13.847,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in the Americas, Africa and Asia,

90
0:04:16.851,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and enrollment has grown to 123 nations.

91
0:04:22.454,000 --> 0:04:24,000
More than half the students are young women.

92
0:04:24.658,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They come from 100 ethnic groups,

93
0:04:26.05,000 --> 0:04:28,000
speak 50 different languages.

94
0:04:28.075,000 --> 0:04:31,000
WHO Director Margaret Chan said,

95
0:04:31.216,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"For once, if you are poor, female,

96
0:04:35.254,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or from an indigenous population,

97
0:04:37.516,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you have a distinct advantage,

98
0:04:39.221,000 --> 0:04:43,000
an ethic that makes this medical school unique."

99
0:04:43.95,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho

100
0:04:48.1,000 --> 0:04:5,000
on the Atlantic coast of Honduras.

101
0:04:50.97,000 --> 0:04:51,000
There's no running water,

102
0:04:52.882,000 --> 0:04:53,000
no electricity there,

103
0:04:54.682,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and to reach the village, you have to walk for hours

104
0:04:58.282,000 --> 0:05:,000
or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did

105
0:05:01.195,000 --> 0:05:04,000
skirting the waves of the Atlantic.

106
0:05:04.49,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Luther was one of 40 Tocamacho children

107
0:05:09.131,000 --> 0:05:11,000
who started grammar school,

108
0:05:11.134,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people

109
0:05:13.878,000 --> 0:05:14,000
known as the Garífuna,

110
0:05:15.734,000 --> 0:05:18,000
20 percent of the Honduran population.

111
0:05:19.21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away.

112
0:05:24.363,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Luther had to walk three hours every day

113
0:05:27.85,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to middle school.

114
0:05:29.751,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Only 17 made that trip.

115
0:05:31.832,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Only five went on to high school,

116
0:05:33.936,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and only one to university:

117
0:05:36.1,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Luther, to ELAM,

118
0:05:38.121,000 --> 0:05:42,000
among the first crop of Garífuna graduates.

119
0:05:42.13,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Just two Garífuna doctors had preceded them

120
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in all of Honduran history.

121
0:05:48.044,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Now there are 69, thanks to ELAM.

122
0:05:53.945,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Big problems need big solutions,

123
0:05:57.145,000 --> 0:06:,000
sparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity,

124
0:06:00.937,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but also solutions that work.

125
0:06:03.94,000 --> 0:06:06,000
ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base

126
0:06:07.27,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to guide them, so they learned the hard way,

127
0:06:10.79,000 --> 0:06:13,000
by doing and correcting course as they went.

128
0:06:14.479,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Even the brightest students

129
0:06:16.741,000 --> 0:06:17,000
from these poor communities

130
0:06:18.654,000 --> 0:06:19,000
weren't academically prepared

131
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
for six years of medical training,

132
0:06:23.023,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so a bridging course was set up in sciences.

133
0:06:26.68,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Then came language:

134
0:06:28.255,000 --> 0:06:31,000
these were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,

135
0:06:31.416,000 --> 0:06:32,000
indigenous peoples

136
0:06:33.193,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who learned Spanish as a second language,

137
0:06:35.393,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or Haitians who spoke Creole.

138
0:06:38.19,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So Spanish became part

139
0:06:40.127,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of the pre-pre-med curriculum.

140
0:06:44.285,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Even so, in Cuba,

141
0:06:47.227,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the music, the food, the smells,

142
0:06:50.461,000 --> 0:06:52,000
just about everything was different,

143
0:06:53.15,000 --> 0:06:58,000
so faculty became family, ELAM home.

144
0:06:58.155,000 --> 0:07:,000
Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs

145
0:07:00.968,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical.

146
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Embracing diversity became a way of life.

147
0:07:09.484,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Why have so many countries

148
0:07:11.474,000 --> 0:07:13,000
asked for these scholarships?

149
0:07:13.949,000 --> 0:07:16,000
First, they just don't have enough doctors,

150
0:07:17.201,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and where they do, their distribution

151
0:07:18.967,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is skewed against the poor,

152
0:07:21.409,000 --> 0:07:23,000
because our global health crisis

153
0:07:23.871,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is fed by a crisis in human resources.

154
0:07:26.836,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We are short four to seven million health workers

155
0:07:30.688,000 --> 0:07:32,000
just to meet basic needs,

156
0:07:33.152,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and the problem is everywhere.

157
0:07:35.01,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Doctors are concentrated in the cities,

158
0:07:37.562,000 --> 0:07:39,000
where only half the world's people live,

159
0:07:40.172,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and within cities,

160
0:07:41.96,000 --> 0:07:45,000
not in the shantytowns or South L.A.

161
0:07:46.139,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Here in the United States,

162
0:07:47.905,000 --> 0:07:49,000
where we have healthcare reform,

163
0:07:50.406,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we don't have the professionals we need.

164
0:07:52.954,000 --> 0:07:54,000
By 2020, we will be short

165
0:07:55.469,000 --> 0:07:59,000
45,000 primary care physicians.

166
0:07:59.608,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And we're also part of the problem.

167
0:08:01.765,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The United States is the number one importer

168
0:08:04.232,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of doctors from developing countries.

169
0:08:08.596,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The second reasons students flock to Cuba

170
0:08:11.465,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is the island's own health report card,

171
0:08:13.692,000 --> 0:08:15,000
relying on strong primary care.

172
0:08:16.662,000 --> 0:08:17,000
A commission from The Lancet

173
0:08:18.484,000 --> 0:08:2,000
rates Cuba among the best performing

174
0:08:20.99,000 --> 0:08:22,000
middle-income countries in health.

175
0:08:23.839,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Save the Children ranks Cuba

176
0:08:25.785,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the best country in Latin America to become a mother.

177
0:08:30.421,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Cuba has similar life expectancy

178
0:08:33.41,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and lower infant mortality than the United States,

179
0:08:36.642,000 --> 0:08:38,000
with fewer disparities,

180
0:08:38.823,000 --> 0:08:39,000
while spending per person

181
0:08:40.623,000 --> 0:08:43,000
one 20th of what we do on health

182
0:08:43.638,000 --> 0:08:45,000
here in the USA.

183
0:08:45.787,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Academically, ELAM is tough,

184
0:08:48.779,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but 80 percent of its students graduate.

185
0:08:52.41,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The subjects are familiar —

186
0:08:53.756,000 --> 0:08:55,000
basic and clinical sciences —

187
0:08:56.23,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but there are major differences.

188
0:08:58.656,000 --> 0:09:01,000
First, training has moved out of the ivory tower

189
0:09:02.267,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods,

190
0:09:05.169,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the kinds of places most of these grads will practice.

191
0:09:08.533,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Sure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too,

192
0:09:12.627,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but community-based learning starts on day one.

193
0:09:17.657,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Second, students treat the whole patient,

194
0:09:21.423,000 --> 0:09:22,000
mind and body,

195
0:09:23.337,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in the context of their families, their communities

196
0:09:25.843,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and their culture.

197
0:09:27.99,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Third, they learn public health:

198
0:09:30.89,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to assess their patients' drinking water, housing,

199
0:09:33.99,000 --> 0:09:36,000
social and economic conditions.

200
0:09:37.286,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Fourth, they are taught

201
0:09:39.817,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that a good patient interview

202
0:09:42.584,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and a thorough clinical exam

203
0:09:44.688,000 --> 0:09:46,000
provide most of the clues for diagnosis,

204
0:09:47.523,000 --> 0:09:5,000
saving costly technology for confirmation.

205
0:09:51.426,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And finally, they're taught over and over again

206
0:09:54.976,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the importance of prevention,

207
0:09:57.02,000 --> 0:09:59,000
especially as chronic diseases

208
0:09:59.42,000 --> 0:10:03,000
cripple health systems worldwide.

209
0:10:03.58,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Such an in-service learning

210
0:10:06.77,000 --> 0:10:08,000
also comes with a team approach,

211
0:10:09.37,000 --> 0:10:11,000
as much how to work in teams

212
0:10:12.237,000 --> 0:10:13,000
as how to lead them,

213
0:10:14.183,000 --> 0:10:16,000
with a dose of humility.

214
0:10:16.31,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Upon graduation, these doctors share

215
0:10:19.11,000 --> 0:10:21,000
their knowledge with nurse's aids, midwives,

216
0:10:21.82,000 --> 0:10:22,000
community health workers,

217
0:10:23.79,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to help them become better at what they do,

218
0:10:26.176,000 --> 0:10:27,000
not to replace them,

219
0:10:28.121,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to work with shamans and traditional healers.

220
0:10:33.311,000 --> 0:10:35,000
ELAM's graduates:

221
0:10:35.87,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Are they proving this audacious experiment right?

222
0:10:40.527,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Dozens of projects give us an inkling

223
0:10:42.822,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of what they're capable of doing.

224
0:10:45.39,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Take the Garífuna grads.

225
0:10:47.153,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They not only went to work back home,

226
0:10:49.343,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but they organized their communities to build

227
0:10:51.75,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Honduras' first indigenous hospital.

228
0:10:55.151,000 --> 0:10:57,000
With an architect's help,

229
0:10:57.3,000 --> 0:11:01,000
residents literally raised it from the ground up.

230
0:11:01.777,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The first patients walked through the doors

231
0:11:03.959,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in December 2007,

232
0:11:06.299,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and since then, the hospital has received

233
0:11:08.808,000 --> 0:11:11,000
nearly one million patient visits.

234
0:11:11.958,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And government is paying attention,

235
0:11:14.119,000 --> 0:11:16,000
upholding the hospital as a model

236
0:11:16.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
of rural public health for Honduras.

237
0:11:21.819,000 --> 0:11:24,000
ELAM's graduates are smart,

238
0:11:25.467,000 --> 0:11:28,000
strong and also dedicated.

239
0:11:28.92,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Haiti, January 2010.

240
0:11:33.274,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The pain.

241
0:11:35.109,000 --> 0:11:39,000
People buried under 30 million tons of rubble.

242
0:11:39.112,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Overwhelming.

243
0:11:41.261,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Three hundred forty Cuban doctors

244
0:11:43.139,000 --> 0:11:45,000
were already on the ground long term.

245
0:11:45.58,000 --> 0:11:47,000
More were on their way. Many more were needed.

246
0:11:47.983,000 --> 0:11:5,000
At ELAM, students worked round the clock

247
0:11:51.227,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to contact 2,000 graduates.

248
0:11:54.445,000 --> 0:11:57,000
As a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti,

249
0:11:57.629,000 --> 0:12:01,000
27 countries' worth, from Mali in the Sahara

250
0:12:01.926,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA.

251
0:12:06.414,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They spoke easily to each other in Spanish

252
0:12:09.71,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and listened to their patients in Creole

253
0:12:12.399,000 --> 0:12:14,000
thanks to Haitian medical students

254
0:12:14.525,000 --> 0:12:16,000
flown in from ELAM in Cuba.

255
0:12:16.752,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Many stayed for months,

256
0:12:18.44,000 --> 0:12:2,000
even through the cholera epidemic.

257
0:12:21.218,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Hundreds of Haitian graduates

258
0:12:23.558,000 --> 0:12:25,000
had to pick up the pieces,

259
0:12:26.28,000 --> 0:12:28,000
overcome their own heartbreak,

260
0:12:28.294,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and then pick up the burden

261
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
of building a new public health system for Haiti.

262
0:12:33.728,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Today, with aid of organizations and governments

263
0:12:36.225,000 --> 0:12:38,000
from Norway to Cuba to Brazil,

264
0:12:38.778,000 --> 0:12:4,000
dozens of new health centers have been built,

265
0:12:41.004,000 --> 0:12:44,000
staffed, and in 35 cases, headed

266
0:12:44.575,000 --> 0:12:47,000
by ELAM graduates.

267
0:12:48.497,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Yet the Haitian story

268
0:12:50.365,000 --> 0:12:52,000
also illustrates some of the bigger problems

269
0:12:52.424,000 --> 0:12:54,000
faced in many countries.

270
0:12:54.64,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Take a look:

271
0:12:56.384,000 --> 0:13:01,000
748 Haitian graduates by 2012, when cholera struck,

272
0:13:02.166,000 --> 0:13:05,000
nearly half working in the public health sector

273
0:13:05.912,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but one quarter unemployed,

274
0:13:07.983,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and 110 had left Haiti altogether.

275
0:13:14.093,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So in the best case scenarios,

276
0:13:16.861,000 --> 0:13:17,000
these graduates are staffing

277
0:13:18.731,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and thus strengthening public health systems,

278
0:13:21.98,000 --> 0:13:24,000
where often they're the only doctors around.

279
0:13:25.159,000 --> 0:13:27,000
In the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs

280
0:13:27.95,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in the public health sector,

281
0:13:29.592,000 --> 0:13:31,000
where most poor people are treated,

282
0:13:32.158,000 --> 0:13:34,000
not enough political will, not enough resources,

283
0:13:34.957,000 --> 0:13:36,000
not enough anything —

284
0:13:37.163,000 --> 0:13:4,000
just too many patients with no care.

285
0:13:40.616,000 --> 0:13:42,000
The grads face pressure from their families too,

286
0:13:43.6,000 --> 0:13:45,000
desperate to make ends meet,

287
0:13:45.903,000 --> 0:13:47,000
so when there are no public sector jobs,

288
0:13:48.479,000 --> 0:13:5,000
these new MDs decamp into private practice,

289
0:13:51.1,000 --> 0:13:55,000
or go abroad to send money home.

290
0:13:55.115,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Worst of all, in some countries,

291
0:13:58.3,000 --> 0:14:,000
medical societies influence accreditation bodies

292
0:14:01.236,000 --> 0:14:04,000
not to honor the ELAM degree,

293
0:14:04.251,000 --> 0:14:06,000
fearful these grads will take their jobs

294
0:14:06.568,000 --> 0:14:09,000
or reduce their patient loads and income.

295
0:14:10.123,000 --> 0:14:12,000
It's not a question of competencies.

296
0:14:13.104,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Here in the USA, the California Medical Board

297
0:14:15.612,000 --> 0:14:18,000
accredited the school after rigorous inspection,

298
0:14:19.212,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and the new physicians are making good

299
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
on Cuba's big bet,

300
0:14:23.451,000 --> 0:14:24,000
passing their boards and accepted

301
0:14:25.262,000 --> 0:14:27,000
into highly respected residencies

302
0:14:27.647,000 --> 0:14:31,000
from New York to Chicago to New Mexico.

303
0:14:31.738,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Two hundred strong, they're coming

304
0:14:34.363,000 --> 0:14:36,000
back to the United States energized,

305
0:14:36.748,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and also dissatisfied.

306
0:14:39.335,000 --> 0:14:4,000
As one grad put it,

307
0:14:40.966,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in Cuba, "We are trained to provide quality care

308
0:14:44.42,000 --> 0:14:46,000
with minimal resources,

309
0:14:46.422,000 --> 0:14:48,000
so when I see all the resources we have here,

310
0:14:48.998,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and you tell me that's not possible,

311
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I know it's not true.

312
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Not only have I seen it work, I've done the work."

313
0:14:58.949,000 --> 0:14:59,000
ELAM's graduates,

314
0:15:00.91,000 --> 0:15:03,000
some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,

315
0:15:04.427,000 --> 0:15:07,000
have come from the poorest of the poor

316
0:15:07.595,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to offer health, education

317
0:15:09.928,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and a voice to their communities.

318
0:15:12.844,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They've done the heavy lifting.

319
0:15:15.496,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Now we need to do our part

320
0:15:17.51,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to support the 23,000 and counting,

321
0:15:21.127,000 --> 0:15:22,000
All of us —

322
0:15:22.481,000 --> 0:15:25,000
foundations, residency directors, press,

323
0:15:26.115,000 --> 0:15:29,000
entrepreneurs, policymakers, people —

324
0:15:29.299,000 --> 0:15:31,000
need to step up.

325
0:15:31.452,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We need to do much more globally

326
0:15:33.443,000 --> 0:15:35,000
to give these new doctors the opportunity

327
0:15:36.382,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to prove their mettle.

328
0:15:38.775,000 --> 0:15:39,000
They need to be able

329
0:15:39.778,000 --> 0:15:42,000
to take their countries' licensing exams.

330
0:15:42.982,000 --> 0:15:44,000
They need jobs in the public health sector

331
0:15:45.93,000 --> 0:15:46,000
or in nonprofit health centers

332
0:15:47.685,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to put their training and commitment to work.

333
0:15:51.532,000 --> 0:15:53,000
They need the chance to be

334
0:15:53.815,000 --> 0:15:57,000
the doctors their patients need.

335
0:15:58.674,000 --> 0:15:59,000
To move forward,

336
0:16:00.531,000 --> 0:16:02,000
we may have to find our way back

337
0:16:03.523,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to that pediatrician who would

338
0:16:05.706,000 --> 0:16:06,000
knock on my family's door

339
0:16:07.393,000 --> 0:16:1,000
on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid,

340
0:16:10.579,000 --> 0:16:11,000
who made house calls,

341
0:16:12.489,000 --> 0:16:14,000
who was a public servant.

342
0:16:15.38,000 --> 0:16:16,000
These aren't such new ideas

343
0:16:17.203,000 --> 0:16:19,000
of what medicine should be.

344
0:16:19.565,000 --> 0:16:21,000
What's new is the scaling up

345
0:16:22.29,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and the faces of the doctors themselves:

346
0:16:25.673,000 --> 0:16:28,000
an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she

347
0:16:29.13,000 --> 0:16:3,000
than a he;

348
0:16:31.06,000 --> 0:16:33,000
In the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala,

349
0:16:33.987,000 --> 0:16:35,000
an indigenous doctor;

350
0:16:36.338,000 --> 0:16:39,000
in the USA, a doctor of color

351
0:16:39.352,000 --> 0:16:41,000
who speaks fluent Spanish.

352
0:16:41.748,000 --> 0:16:44,000
She is well trained, can be counted on,

353
0:16:45.427,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and shares the face and culture of her patients,

354
0:16:49.071,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and she deserves our support surely,

355
0:16:52.48,000 --> 0:16:56,000
because whether by subway, mule, or canoe,

356
0:16:56.946,000 --> 0:16:58,000
she is teaching us to walk the walk.

357
0:16:59.944,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Thank you. (Applause)

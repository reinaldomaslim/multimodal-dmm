1
0:00:12.972,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize [winner] in economics, once wrote:

2
0:00:18.929,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"Productivity is not everything, but in the long run,

3
0:00:24.349,000 --> 0:00:26,000
it is almost everything."

4
0:00:28.062,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So this is serious.

5
0:00:30.214,000 --> 0:00:34,000
There are not that many things on earth that are "almost everything."

6
0:00:36.138,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society.

7
0:00:43.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So we have a problem.

8
0:00:45.837,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In the largest European economies,

9
0:00:48.63,000 --> 0:00:51,000
productivity used to grow five percent per annum

10
0:00:51.804,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in the '50s, '60s, early '70s.

11
0:00:54.943,000 --> 0:00:58,000
From '73 to '83: three percent per annum.

12
0:00:58.995,000 --> 0:01:01,000
From '83 to '95: two percent per annum.

13
0:01:02.308,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Since 1995: less than one percent per annum.

14
0:01:07.042,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The same profile in Japan.

15
0:01:10.115,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The same profile in the US,

16
0:01:13.009,000 --> 0:01:18,000
despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,

17
0:01:18.366,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and despite all the technological innovations

18
0:01:21.754,000 --> 0:01:23,000
around us: the Internet, the information,

19
0:01:24.357,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the new information and communication technologies.

20
0:01:28.155,000 --> 0:01:32,000
When productivity grows three percent per annum,

21
0:01:32.758,000 --> 0:01:35,000
you double the standard of living every generation.

22
0:01:37.169,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Every generation is twice as well-off as its parents'.

23
0:01:42.686,000 --> 0:01:45,000
When it grows one percent per annum,

24
0:01:46.036,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it takes three generations to double the standard of living.

25
0:01:49.687,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And in this process, many people will be less well-off than their parents.

26
0:01:55.505,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They will have less of everything:

27
0:01:58.043,000 --> 0:02:01,000
smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,

28
0:02:02.645,000 --> 0:02:08,000
less access to education, to vitamins, to antibiotics, to vaccination --

29
0:02:09.068,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to everything.

30
0:02:11.502,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Think of all the problems that we're facing at the moment.

31
0:02:18.347,000 --> 0:02:19,000
All.

32
0:02:20.692,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis.

33
0:02:27.226,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Why this crisis?

34
0:02:30.438,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Because the basic tenets about efficiency --

35
0:02:35.937,000 --> 0:02:39,000
effectiveness in organizations, in management --

36
0:02:40.772,000 --> 0:02:44,000
have become counterproductive for human efforts.

37
0:02:45.539,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Everywhere in public services -- in companies, in the way we work,

38
0:02:49.729,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the way we innovate, invest -- try to learn to work better.

39
0:02:54.954,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Take the holy trinity of efficiency:

40
0:03:00.805,000 --> 0:03:05,000
clarity, measurement, accountability.

41
0:03:07.87,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They make human efforts derail.

42
0:03:11.65,000 --> 0:03:15,000
There are two ways to look at it, to prove it.

43
0:03:15.746,000 --> 0:03:17,000
One, the one I prefer,

44
0:03:18.436,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math.

45
0:03:24.593,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But the full math version takes a little while,

46
0:03:27.88,000 --> 0:03:28,000
so there is another one.

47
0:03:29.699,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It is to look at a relay race.

48
0:03:32.697,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is what we will do today.

49
0:03:34.389,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster -- it's a race.

50
0:03:41.572,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Hopefully, it's faster.

51
0:03:42.89,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:44.278,000 --> 0:03:48,000
World championship final -- women.

53
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Eight teams in the final.

54
0:03:51.395,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The fastest team is the US team.

55
0:03:55.129,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They have the fastest women on earth.

56
0:03:58.153,000 --> 0:04:,000
They are the favorite team to win.

57
0:04:00.952,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Notably, if you compare them to an average team,

58
0:04:05.166,000 --> 0:04:06,000
say, the French team,

59
0:04:06.564,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

60
0:04:08.175,000 --> 0:04:13,000
based on their best performances in the 100-meter race,

61
0:04:13.394,000 --> 0:04:18,000
if you add the individual times of the US runners,

62
0:04:19.187,000 --> 0:04:25,000
they arrive at the finish line 3.2 meters ahead of the French team.

63
0:04:26.438,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And this year, the US team is in great shape.

64
0:04:30.034,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Based on their best performance this year,

65
0:04:32.444,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they arrive 6.4 meters ahead of the French team,

66
0:04:37.373,000 --> 0:04:38,000
based on the data.

67
0:04:39.274,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We are going to look at the race.

68
0:04:40.877,000 --> 0:04:42,000
At some point you will see, towards the end,

69
0:04:43.324,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that Torri Edwards, the fourth US runner, is ahead.

70
0:04:49.654,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Not surprising -- this year she got the gold medal in the 100-meter race.

71
0:04:56.167,000 --> 0:05:,000
And by the way, Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team,

72
0:05:01.133,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is the fastest woman on earth.

73
0:05:03.794,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.

74
0:05:09.89,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Where are the two fastest? On the US team.

75
0:05:13.087,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And the two other runners on the US team are not bad, either.

76
0:05:16.384,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

77
0:05:18.124,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So clearly, the US team has won the war for talent.

78
0:05:24.391,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But behind, the average team is trying to catch up.

79
0:05:28.396,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Let's watch the race.

80
0:05:30.3,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)

81
0:06:18.886,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Video: Race narration ends)

82
0:06:22.112,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Yves Morieux: So what happened?

83
0:06:23.631,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The fastest team did not win; the slower one did.

84
0:06:28.809,000 --> 0:06:29,000
By the way, I hope you appreciate

85
0:06:30.77,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the deep historical research I did to make the French look good.

86
0:06:36.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

87
0:06:41.485,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But let's not exaggerate -- it's not archeology, either.

88
0:06:45.928,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

89
0:06:47.933,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But why?

90
0:06:49.123,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Because of cooperation.

91
0:06:50.687,000 --> 0:06:51,000
When you hear this sentence:

92
0:06:52.545,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"Thanks to cooperation, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts."

93
0:06:57.707,000 --> 0:07:,000
This is not poetry; this is not philosophy.

94
0:07:01.046,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This is math.

95
0:07:03.196,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Those who carry the baton are slower,

96
0:07:06.5,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but their baton is faster.

97
0:07:08.848,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Miracle of cooperation:

98
0:07:11.057,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts.

99
0:07:16.361,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It is the essence of human efforts:

100
0:07:19.36,000 --> 0:07:24,000
how we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others.

101
0:07:26.017,000 --> 0:07:29,000
With cooperation, we can do more with less.

102
0:07:29.788,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, what happens to cooperation when the holy grail --

103
0:07:35.36,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the holy trinity, even --

104
0:07:37.822,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of clarity, measurement, accountability --

105
0:07:44.067,000 --> 0:07:45,000
appears?

106
0:07:46.952,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Clarity.

107
0:07:48.128,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity.

108
0:07:53.424,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Compliance audits, consultants' diagnostics.

109
0:07:58.49,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We need more clarity, we need to clarify the roles, the processes.

110
0:08:04.092,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It is as though the runners on the team were saying,

111
0:08:08.132,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Let's be clear -- where does my role really start and end?

112
0:08:14.938,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Am I supposed to run for 95 meters, 96, 97...?"

113
0:08:19.794,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's important, let's be clear.

114
0:08:22.885,000 --> 0:08:25,000
If you say 97, after 97 meters,

115
0:08:25.915,000 --> 0:08:28,000
people will drop the baton, whether there is someone to take it or not.

116
0:08:31.145,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Accountability.

117
0:08:33.084,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We are constantly trying to put accountability

118
0:08:36.558,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in someone's hands.

119
0:08:38.559,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Who is accountable for this process?

120
0:08:41.156,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We need somebody accountable for this process.

121
0:08:44.634,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So in the relay race, since passing the baton is so important,

122
0:08:49.119,000 --> 0:08:52,000
then we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton.

123
0:08:53.786,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So between each runner,

124
0:08:55.989,000 --> 0:08:59,000
now we will have a new dedicated athlete,

125
0:09:00.737,000 --> 0:09:04,000
clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner,

126
0:09:05.306,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and passing it to the next runner.

127
0:09:08.284,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And we will have at least two like that.

128
0:09:12.381,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Well, will we, in that case, win the race?

129
0:09:19.903,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That I don't know, but for sure,

130
0:09:21.928,000 --> 0:09:24,000
we would have a clear interface,

131
0:09:25.222,000 --> 0:09:27,000
a clear line of accountability.

132
0:09:27.89,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We will know who to blame.

133
0:09:30.834,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But we'll never win the race.

134
0:09:33.099,000 --> 0:09:37,000
If you think about it, we pay more attention

135
0:09:38.11,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to knowing who to blame in case we fail,

136
0:09:42.289,000 --> 0:09:45,000
than to creating the conditions to succeed.

137
0:09:47.384,000 --> 0:09:5,000
All the human intelligence put in organization design --

138
0:09:50.771,000 --> 0:09:52,000
urban structures, processing systems --

139
0:09:53.58,000 --> 0:09:54,000
what is the real goal?

140
0:09:56.347,000 --> 0:09:58,000
To have somebody guilty in case they fail.

141
0:10:00.499,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We are creating organizations able to fail,

142
0:10:05.41,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but in a compliant way,

143
0:10:08.411,000 --> 0:10:11,000
with somebody clearly accountable when we fail.

144
0:10:11.877,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And we are quite effective at that -- failing.

145
0:10:16.892,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Measurement.

146
0:10:18.674,000 --> 0:10:19,000
What gets measured gets done.

147
0:10:20.126,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Look, to pass the baton, you have to do it at the right time,

148
0:10:24.541,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in the right hand, at the right speed.

149
0:10:27.457,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But to do that, you have to put energy in your arm.

150
0:10:30.04,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs.

151
0:10:33.491,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It will come at the expense of your measurable speed.

152
0:10:37.367,000 --> 0:10:4,000
You have to shout early enough to the next runner

153
0:10:40.844,000 --> 0:10:43,000
when you will pass the baton, to signal that you are arriving,

154
0:10:44.179,000 --> 0:10:47,000
so that the next runner can prepare, can anticipate.

155
0:10:47.408,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And you have to shout loud.

156
0:10:50.182,000 --> 0:10:53,000
But the blood, the energy that will be in your throat

157
0:10:54.179,000 --> 0:10:55,000
will not be in your legs.

158
0:10:55.603,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Because you know, there are eight people shouting at the same time.

159
0:10:59.383,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague.

160
0:11:02.372,000 --> 0:11:03,000
You cannot say, "Is it you?"

161
0:11:04.57,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Too late!

162
0:11:05.748,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

163
0:11:06.978,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now, let's look at the race in slow motion,

164
0:11:11.978,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and concentrate on the third runner.

165
0:11:14.55,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Look at where she allocates her efforts,

166
0:11:18.997,000 --> 0:11:2,000
her energy, her attention.

167
0:11:22.878,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Not all in her legs -- that would be great for her own speed --

168
0:11:26.046,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but in also in her throat, arm, eye, brain.

169
0:11:29.56,000 --> 0:11:31,000
That makes a difference in whose legs?

170
0:11:32.314,000 --> 0:11:34,000
In the legs of the next runner.

171
0:11:34.728,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But when the next runner runs super-fast,

172
0:11:37.586,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is it because she made a super effort,

173
0:11:39.738,000 --> 0:11:42,000
or because of the way the third runner passed the baton?

174
0:11:43.403,000 --> 0:11:46,000
There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer.

175
0:11:48.31,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance,

176
0:11:52.845,000 --> 0:11:55,000
they will put their energy, their attention, their blood

177
0:11:55.923,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in what can get measured -- in their legs.

178
0:11:58.581,000 --> 0:12:,000
And the baton will fall and slow down.

179
0:12:01.534,000 --> 0:12:03,000
To cooperate is not a super effort,

180
0:12:04.13,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it is how you allocate your effort.

181
0:12:07.28,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It is to take a risk,

182
0:12:09.144,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because you sacrifice the ultimate protection

183
0:12:13.398,000 --> 0:12:18,000
granted by objectively measurable individual performance.

184
0:12:20.516,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It is to make a super difference in the performance of others,

185
0:12:24.417,000 --> 0:12:25,000
with whom we are compared.

186
0:12:26.757,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It takes being stupid to cooperate, then.

187
0:12:29.551,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And people are not stupid; they don't cooperate.

188
0:12:32.738,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You know, clarity, accountability, measurement were OK

189
0:12:37.902,000 --> 0:12:39,000
when the world was simpler.

190
0:12:40.929,000 --> 0:12:43,000
But business has become much more complex.

191
0:12:43.977,000 --> 0:12:45,000
With my teams, we have measured

192
0:12:46.032,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the evolution of complexity in business.

193
0:12:49.08,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers,

194
0:12:54.707,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to build advantage on a global scale,

195
0:12:58.042,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to create value.

196
0:13:00.691,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And the more business gets complex,

197
0:13:03.472,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the more, in the name of clarity, accountability, measurement

198
0:13:08.797,000 --> 0:13:11,000
we multiply structures, processes, systems.

199
0:13:13.083,000 --> 0:13:17,000
You know, this drive for clarity and accountability triggers

200
0:13:17.916,000 --> 0:13:22,000
a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces, middle offices,

201
0:13:23.295,000 --> 0:13:28,000
coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources,

202
0:13:28.356,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but that also add obstacles.

203
0:13:31.276,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And the more complicated the organization,

204
0:13:35.87,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening.

205
0:13:39.547,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So we need summaries, proxies, reports,

206
0:13:44.991,000 --> 0:13:47,000
key performance indicators, metrics.

207
0:13:48.315,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So people put their energy in what can get measured,

208
0:13:53.051,000 --> 0:13:55,000
at the expense of cooperation.

209
0:13:55.17,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And as performance deteriorates,

210
0:13:57.726,000 --> 0:14:,000
we add even more structure, process, systems.

211
0:14:00.879,000 --> 0:14:02,000
People spend their time in meetings,

212
0:14:03.735,000 --> 0:14:07,000
writing reports they have to do, undo and redo.

213
0:14:08.289,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Based on our analysis, teams in these organizations

214
0:14:11.735,000 --> 0:14:17,000
spend between 40 and 80 percent of their time wasting their time,

215
0:14:17.93,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but working harder and harder, longer and longer,

216
0:14:21.947,000 --> 0:14:23,000
on less and less value-adding activities.

217
0:14:26.242,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This is what is killing productivity,

218
0:14:28.576,000 --> 0:14:3,000
what makes people suffer at work.

219
0:14:31.226,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Our organizations are wasting human intelligence.

220
0:14:35.787,000 --> 0:14:38,000
They have turned against human efforts.

221
0:14:40.673,000 --> 0:14:42,000
When people don't cooperate,

222
0:14:43.587,000 --> 0:14:47,000
don't blame their mindsets, their mentalities, their personality --

223
0:14:48.006,000 --> 0:14:5,000
look at the work situations.

224
0:14:51.125,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not,

225
0:14:55.398,000 --> 0:14:58,000
if, when they cooperate, they are individually worse off?

226
0:14:59.914,000 --> 0:15:,000
Why would they cooperate?

227
0:15:01.922,000 --> 0:15:04,000
When we blame personalities

228
0:15:05.538,000 --> 0:15:11,000
instead of the clarity, the accountability, the measurement,

229
0:15:11.72,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we add injustice to ineffectiveness.

230
0:15:17.654,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We need to create organizations

231
0:15:19.591,000 --> 0:15:23,000
in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate.

232
0:15:24.807,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Remove the interfaces, the middle offices --

233
0:15:29.626,000 --> 0:15:32,000
all these complicated coordination structures.

234
0:15:33.573,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.

235
0:15:37.977,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Fuzziness overlaps.

236
0:15:41.244,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance.

237
0:15:46.2,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Speed the "what."

238
0:15:48.414,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Look at cooperation, the "how."

239
0:15:51.255,000 --> 0:15:52,000
How did you pass the baton?

240
0:15:52.88,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Did you throw it, or did you pass it effectively?

241
0:15:58.569,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Am I putting my energy in what can get measured --

242
0:16:04.651,000 --> 0:16:08,000
my legs, my speed -- or in passing the baton?

243
0:16:08.81,000 --> 0:16:12,000
You, as leaders, as managers,

244
0:16:13.177,000 --> 0:16:18,000
are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate?

245
0:16:20.205,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The future of our organizations,

246
0:16:23.367,000 --> 0:16:26,000
our companies, our societies

247
0:16:27.184,000 --> 0:16:32,000
hinges on your answer to these questions.

248
0:16:33.035,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Thank you.

249
0:16:34.24,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Applause)

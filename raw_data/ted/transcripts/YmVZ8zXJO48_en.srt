1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Do you know

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
how many species of flowering plants there are?

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about --

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And flowers are a real bugger.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
They're really difficult for plants to produce.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Why would they go to that bother?

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is sex.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important --

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You can take cuttings;

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
they can sort of have sex with themselves;

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
they can pollinate themselves.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But they really need to spread their genes

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to mix with other genes

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
so that they can adapt to environmental niches.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Evolution works that way.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now the way that plants transmit that information

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is through pollen.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to be able to see these.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And there is as many different kinds of pollen

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
as there are flowering plants.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is from plants that use the wind

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to disseminate the pollen,

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and that's a very inefficient process,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which is why it gets up our noses so much.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it,

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
which are held within the pollen,

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
will somehow reach another flower just by chance.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and most of the trees

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
have wind-borne pollen.

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But most species

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
actually use insects to do their bidding,

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and that's more intelligent in a way,

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The insects

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and other species

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
can take the pollen,

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
transfer it directly to where it's required.

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
between insects and plants.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
There's a symbiotic relationship there,

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
whether it's flies or birds or bees,

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
they're getting something in return,

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that something in return is generally nectar.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Sometimes that symbiosis

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
has led to wonderful adaptations --

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the hummingbird hawk-moth

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is beautiful in its adaptation.

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The plant gets something,

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Plants have evolved

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to create little landing strips here and there

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
for bees that might have lost their way.

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There are markings on many plants

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that look like other insects.

66
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
These are the anthers of a lily,

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
cleverly done

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
so that when the unsuspecting insect

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
lands on it,

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the anther flips up and whops it on the back

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And there's an orchid

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that might look to you as if it's got jaws,

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out,

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least,

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
species of orchids --

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
amazingly, amazingly diverse.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
They have to try and attract pollinators

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to do their bidding.

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid,

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because it's one that he studied

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it --

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
you can see that there's a very long nectar tube

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that descends down

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
from the orchid.

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And basically what the insect has to do --

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we're in the middle of the flower --

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it has to stick its little proboscis

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
right into the middle of that

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and all the way down that nectar tube

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to get to the nectar.

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And Darwin said, looking at this flower,

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"I guess something has coevolved with this."

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And sure enough,

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
there's the insect.

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away,

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but in its erect form,

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that's what it looks like.

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now you can imagine

102
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that if nectar

103
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is such a valuable thing

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and expensive for the plant to produce

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and it attracts lots of pollinators,

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
then, just as in human sex,

107
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
people might start to deceive.

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"

109
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now this is a plant.

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is a plant here

111
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that insects in South Africa just love,

112
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and they've evolved with a long proboscis

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to get the nectar at the bottom.

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And this is the mimic.

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And here is the long-probosced fly

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic,

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.

119
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So not only has the fly

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
not got the nectar from the mimic plant,

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
it's also -- if you look very closely

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that it would be transmitting to another plant,

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
if only some botanist hadn't come along

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and stuck it to a blue piece of card.

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This flower with its black dots:

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
they might look like black dots to us,

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species,

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that looks like two females

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who are really, really hot to trot.

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And when the insect gets there and lands on it,

135
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant,

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture,

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you can see that there are actually some patterning there,

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which is three-dimensional.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So it probably even feels good for the insect,

140
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
as well as looking good.

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And these electron microscope pictures --

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect --

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
you can see that different parts of the structure

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
have different colors and different textures to our eye,

145
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
have very, very different textures

146
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to what an insect might perceive.

147
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this one is evolved to mimic

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a glossy metallic surface

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you see on some beetles.

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And under the scanning electron microscope,

151
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you can see the surface there --

152
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Sometimes the whole plant

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
mimics an insect, even to us.

155
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.

156
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I think of it as insidium sometimes.

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
To the right species of bee,

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
this looks like another very aggressive bee,

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away,

162
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and, of course, covers itself with pollen.

163
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The other thing it does

164
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is that this plant mimics another orchid

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that has a wonderful store

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of food for insects.

167
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And this one doesn't have anything for them.

168
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So it's deceiving on two levels --

169
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
fabulous.

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Here we see ylang ylang,

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the component of many perfumes.

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.

174
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.

175
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent

176
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to any insect that'll have it.

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This one doesn't smell so good.

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This is a flower

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that really, really smells pretty nasty

180
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and is designed, again, evolved,

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to look like carrion.

182
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So flies love this.

183
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They fly in and they pollinate.

184
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
This, which is helicodiceros,

185
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is also known as dead horse arum.

186
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like,

187
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but this one probably smells pretty much like it.

188
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's really horrible.

189
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And blowflies just can't help themselves.

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They fly into this thing,

191
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and they fly all the way down it.

192
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They lay their eggs in it,

193
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
thinking it's a nice bit of carrion,

194
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die,

195
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited,

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because the bristles release

197
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and the flies disappear

198
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.

199
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Here's arum, arum maculatum,

200
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.

201
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.

202
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This thing heats up

203
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature --

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
amazing.

205
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And if you look down into it,

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
there's this sort of dam past the spadix,

207
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
flies get attracted by the heat --

208
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges --

209
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and they get trapped underneath in this container.

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They drink this fabulous nectar

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and then they're all a bit sticky.

212
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
At night they get covered in pollen,

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which showers down over them,

214
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and then the bristles that we saw above,

215
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen --

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
fabulous thing.

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.

218
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This is the philodendron selloum.

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
This is the most amazing thing.

221
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
That sort of phallic bit there

222
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is about a foot long.

223
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And it does something

224
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that no other plant that I know of does,

225
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and that is that when it flowers --

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that's the spadix in the middle there --

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
for a period of about two days,

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it metabolizes in a way

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
which is rather similar to mammals.

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So instead of having starch,

231
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
which is the food of plants,

232
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it takes something rather similar to brown fat

233
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and burns it at such a rate

234
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that it's burning fat, metabolizing,

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
about the rate of a small cat.

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight,

237
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
than a hummingbird --

238
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
absolutely astonishing.

239
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This thing does something else which is unusual.

240
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit,

241
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days,

242
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but it keeps constant temperature.

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there

244
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that keeps constant temperature.

245
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Now wouldn't you know it,

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.

248
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And they get inside, and they get it all on.

249
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter)

250
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And the plant showers them with pollen,

251
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and off they go and pollinate.

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And what a wonderful thing it is.

253
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now most pollinators

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that we think about are insects,

255
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but actually in the tropics,

256
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
many birds and butterflies pollinate.

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And many of the tropical flowers are red,

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and that's because butterflies and birds

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
see similarly to us, we think,

260
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and can see the color red very well.

261
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But if you look at the spectrum,

262
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
birds and us, we see red, green and blue

263
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and see that spectrum.

264
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet,

265
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and they see various shades of ultraviolet.

266
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So there's something that goes on off the end there.

267
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.

268
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Well yes we can.

269
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So what is an insect seeing?

270
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose,

271
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
helianthemum, in Dorset.

272
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
These are little yellow flowers like we all see,

273
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
little yellow flowers all over the place.

274
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And this is what it looks like with visible light.

275
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.

276
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Most bees don't perceive red.

277
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera

278
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and took a very, very long exposure

279
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light

280
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and this is what I got.

281
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.

282
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now we don't know

283
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
exactly what a bee sees,

284
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
any more than you know what I'm seeing

285
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
when I call this red.

286
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's --

287
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
another human being's mind.

288
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But the contrast will look something like that,

289
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
so standing out a lot from the background.

290
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Here's another little flower --

291
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
different range of ultraviolet frequencies,

292
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
different filters

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to match the pollinators.

294
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.

295
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Just in case you think

296
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that all yellow flowers have this property --

297
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
no flower was damaged in the process of this shot;

298
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
it was just attached to the tripod,

299
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
not killed --

300
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
then under ultraviolet light,

301
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
look at that.

302
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen

303
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.

304
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.

305
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Finally, there's one of evening primrose

306
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me --

307
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
fantastic hidden pattern.

308
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I love the idea of something hidden.

309
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I think there's something poetic here,

310
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter,

311
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the main use of that filter

312
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus --

313
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
actually the clouds of Venus.

314
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
That's the main use of that filter.

315
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility,

316
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
which is the flower story.

317
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort

318
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
trying to get pollinators to do their bidding,

319
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them

320
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and give them to each other

321
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
at times of birth and death,

322
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and particularly at marriage,

323
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
which, when you think of it,

324
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
is the moment that encapsulates

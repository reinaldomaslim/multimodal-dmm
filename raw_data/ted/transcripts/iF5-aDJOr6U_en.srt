1
0:00:12.879,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today, I am going to show you

2
0:00:14.905,000 --> 0:00:18,000
how this tablet and this virtual-reality headset that I'm wearing

3
0:00:19.358,000 --> 0:00:23,000
are going to completely revolutionize science education.

4
0:00:24.1,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I'm also going to show you

5
0:00:25.919,000 --> 0:00:29,000
how it can make any science teacher more than twice as effective.

6
0:00:31.124,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But before I show you how all of this is possible,

7
0:00:34.612,000 --> 0:00:39,000
let's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education

8
0:00:40.175,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is so vitally important.

9
0:00:43.513,000 --> 0:00:44,000
If you think about it,

10
0:00:44.698,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the world is growing incredibly fast.

11
0:00:47.322,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges,

12
0:00:51.231,000 --> 0:00:54,000
challenges such as dealing with global warming,

13
0:00:54.268,000 --> 0:00:56,000
solving starvation and water shortages

14
0:00:56.655,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and curing diseases,

15
0:00:58.131,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to name just a few.

16
0:01:00.402,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And who, exactly, is going to help us solve all of these great challenges?

17
0:01:06.733,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Well, to a very last degree, it is these young students.

18
0:01:10.194,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is the next generation of young, bright scientists.

19
0:01:14.06,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And in many ways, we all rely on them

20
0:01:17.104,000 --> 0:01:19,000
for coming up with new, great innovations

21
0:01:19.93,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to help us solve all these challenges ahead of us.

22
0:01:24.708,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And so a couple of years back,

23
0:01:26.683,000 --> 0:01:3,000
my cofounder and I were teaching university students just like these,

24
0:01:31.066,000 --> 0:01:36,000
only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here.

25
0:01:36.204,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:37.292,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And yes, this is really the reality out there

27
0:01:40.154,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in way too many universities around the world:

28
0:01:43.703,000 --> 0:01:45,000
students that are bored, disengaged

29
0:01:46.38,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and sometimes not even sure why they're learning about a topic

30
0:01:50.009,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in the first place.

31
0:01:51.763,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So we started looking around for new, innovative teaching methods,

32
0:01:56.121,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but what we found was quite disappointing.

33
0:01:58.968,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We saw that books were being turned into e-books,

34
0:02:03.495,000 --> 0:02:06,000
blackboards were being turned into YouTube videos

35
0:02:06.535,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and lecture hall monologues were being turned into MOOCs --

36
0:02:09.703,000 --> 0:02:11,000
massive online open courses.

37
0:02:12.694,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And if you think about it,

38
0:02:13.965,000 --> 0:02:16,000
all we're really doing here is taking the same content

39
0:02:17.572,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and the same format,

40
0:02:19.144,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and bringing it out to more students --

41
0:02:22.565,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which is great, don't get me wrong, that is really great --

42
0:02:25.427,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but the teaching method is still more or less the same,

43
0:02:29.078,000 --> 0:02:31,000
no real innovation there.

44
0:02:31.863,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So we started looking elsewhere.

45
0:02:33.906,000 --> 0:02:37,000
What we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again

46
0:02:38.557,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to be far more effective

47
0:02:40.048,000 --> 0:02:45,000
when used in combination with real, in-flight training to train the pilots.

48
0:02:45.338,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so we thought to ourselves:

49
0:02:47.532,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Why not just apply that to science?

50
0:02:49.893,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Why not build a virtual laboratory simulator?

51
0:02:55.563,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Well, we did it.

52
0:02:56.835,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We basically set out to create

53
0:02:58.677,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a fully simulated, one-to-one, virtual reality laboratory simulator,

54
0:03:04.316,000 --> 0:03:06,000
where the students could perform experiments

55
0:03:06.537,000 --> 0:03:07,000
with mathematical equations

56
0:03:08.471,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that would simulate what would happen in a real-world lab.

57
0:03:11.714,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But not just simple simulations --

58
0:03:13.417,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we would also create advanced simulations

59
0:03:15.507,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with top universities like MIT,

60
0:03:17.455,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to bring out cutting-edge cancer research to these students.

61
0:03:22.52,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And suddenly, the universities could save millions of dollars

62
0:03:25.427,000 --> 0:03:27,000
by letting the students perform virtual experiments

63
0:03:28.381,000 --> 0:03:31,000
before they go into the real laboratory.

64
0:03:32.303,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And not only that; now, they could also understand --

65
0:03:34.859,000 --> 0:03:36,000
even on a molecular level inside the machine --

66
0:03:37.316,000 --> 0:03:39,000
what is happening to the machines.

67
0:03:40.016,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And then they could suddenly perform

68
0:03:41.939,000 --> 0:03:43,000
dangerous experiments in the labs as well.

69
0:03:44.591,000 --> 0:03:45,000
For instance also here,

70
0:03:46.101,000 --> 0:03:49,000
learning about salmonella bacteria, which is an important topic

71
0:03:49.737,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that many schools cannot teach for good safety reasons.

72
0:03:54.315,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we, of course, quiz the students

73
0:03:56.076,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and then give the teachers a full dashboard,

74
0:03:58.505,000 --> 0:04:,000
so they fully understand where the students are at.

75
0:04:02.134,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But we didn't stop there,

76
0:04:03.366,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because we had seen just how important meaning is

77
0:04:05.715,000 --> 0:04:07,000
for the students' engagement in the class.

78
0:04:08.025,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So we brought in game designers

79
0:04:09.771,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to create fun and engaging stories.

80
0:04:12.676,000 --> 0:04:13,000
For instance, here in this case,

81
0:04:14.534,000 --> 0:04:18,000
where the students have to solve a mysterious CSI murder case

82
0:04:18.681,000 --> 0:04:2,000
using their core science skills.

83
0:04:23.861,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And the feedback we got when we launched all of this

84
0:04:26.329,000 --> 0:04:27,000
was quite overwhelmingly positive.

85
0:04:28.305,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Here we have 300 students,

86
0:04:30.132,000 --> 0:04:32,000
all passionately solving CSI murder cases

87
0:04:32.871,000 --> 0:04:33,000
while learning core science skills.

88
0:04:34.76,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And what I love the most about this

89
0:04:37.029,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is really when the students come up to me sometimes afterwards,

90
0:04:40.697,000 --> 0:04:42,000
all surprised and a little confused,

91
0:04:42.836,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and say, "I just spent two hours in this virtual lab,

92
0:04:48.432,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and ... and I didn't check Facebook."

93
0:04:50.635,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:51.988,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students.

95
0:04:56.663,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so, to investigate whether this really worked,

96
0:04:59.507,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a learning psychologist did a study with 160 students --

97
0:05:03.934,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that was from Stanford University and Technical University of Denmark.

98
0:05:08.204,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And what they did is split the students into two groups.

99
0:05:11.76,000 --> 0:05:15,000
One group would only use the virtual laboratory simulations,

100
0:05:16.035,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the other group would only use traditional teaching methods,

101
0:05:19.759,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and they had the same amount of time.

102
0:05:22.801,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Then, interestingly,

103
0:05:23.977,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they gave the students a test before and after the experiment,

104
0:05:27.668,000 --> 0:05:31,000
so they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students.

105
0:05:32.045,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And what they found

106
0:05:33.237,000 --> 0:05:38,000
was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness

107
0:05:39.062,000 --> 0:05:43,000
when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods.

108
0:05:44.349,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But even more interestingly,

109
0:05:45.858,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the second part of this study investigated

110
0:05:49.096,000 --> 0:05:51,000
what the teacher's impact was on the learning.

111
0:05:52.024,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And what they found

112
0:05:53.199,000 --> 0:05:55,000
was that when you combined the virtual laboratories

113
0:05:55.885,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with teacher-led coaching and mentoring,

114
0:05:58.513,000 --> 0:06:03,000
then we saw a total 101 percent increase in the learning effectiveness,

115
0:06:04.353,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which effectively doubles the science teacher's impact

116
0:06:08.809,000 --> 0:06:1,000
with the same amount of time spent.

117
0:06:13.784,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So a couple of months back,

118
0:06:16.518,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we started asking ourselves --

119
0:06:18.055,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we have a wonderful team now of learning psychologists

120
0:06:20.626,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and teachers and scientists and game developers --

121
0:06:23.006,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and we started asking ourselves:

122
0:06:24.571,000 --> 0:06:26,000
How can we keep ourselves to our promise

123
0:06:27.19,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of constantly reimagining education?

124
0:06:30.178,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And today, I am really excited to be presenting what we came up with

125
0:06:35.303,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and have been working incredibly hard to create.

126
0:06:40.228,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I will explain briefly what this is.

127
0:06:42.885,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Basically, I take my mobile phone --

128
0:06:45.645,000 --> 0:06:47,000
most students already have these, smartphones --

129
0:06:48.375,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and I plug it into this virtual-reality headset, a low-cost headset.

130
0:06:52.923,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And now what I can effectively do is,

131
0:06:54.916,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I can literally step into this virtual world.

132
0:06:58.09,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We'll have some of you in the audience also get to try this,

133
0:07:01.198,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because it is really something that you have to try

134
0:07:04.378,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to fully feel how immersive it really is.

135
0:07:06.697,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It literally feels like I just stepped inside this virtual lab.

136
0:07:10.498,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Do you see me up on the screen?

137
0:07:12.025,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Audience: Yes.

138
0:07:13.2,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.

139
0:07:14.827,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So basically, I have just turned my mobile phone

140
0:07:17.749,000 --> 0:07:2,000
into a fully simulated, million-dollar Ivy League laboratory

141
0:07:21.437,000 --> 0:07:23,000
with all this amazing equipment that I can interact with.

142
0:07:24.286,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I can, for instance, pick up the pipette and do experiments with it.

143
0:07:27.683,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I have my E-Ggel, my PCR and -- oh, look there,

144
0:07:30.127,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I have my next-generation sequencing machine,

145
0:07:32.672,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and there I even have my electron microscope.

146
0:07:36.194,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I mean, who's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket?

147
0:07:39.648,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And here I have my machine,

148
0:07:41.544,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I can do different experiments on the machine.

149
0:07:43.738,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And over here I have the door,

150
0:07:45.216,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I can go into other experiments,

151
0:07:47.608,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I can perform in the laboratories.

152
0:07:49.565,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And here, I have my learning tablet.

153
0:07:51.795,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This is an intelligent tablet

154
0:07:53.273,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that allows me to read about relevant theory.

155
0:07:56.145,000 --> 0:07:58,000
As you can see, I can interact with it.

156
0:07:58.471,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I can watch videos and see content that is relevant

157
0:08:02.389,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to the experiment that I'm performing right now.

158
0:08:06.074,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Then over here, I have Marie.

159
0:08:07.501,000 --> 0:08:1,000
She is my teacher -- my lab assistant --

160
0:08:11.044,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and what she does is guides me through this whole laboratory.

161
0:08:14.245,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And very soon,

162
0:08:15.428,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the teachers will be able to literally teleport themselves

163
0:08:18.42,000 --> 0:08:2,000
into this virtual world that I'm in right now

164
0:08:21.003,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and help me, guide me, through this whole experiment.

165
0:08:24.257,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And now before I finalize this,

166
0:08:26.591,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I want to show you an even cooler thing, I think --

167
0:08:29.583,000 --> 0:08:32,000
something you cannot even do in real laboratories.

168
0:08:32.643,000 --> 0:08:33,000
This is a PCR machine.

169
0:08:33.905,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I'm now going to start this experiment.

170
0:08:36.409,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And what I just did is literally shrunk myself a million times

171
0:08:40.666,000 --> 0:08:41,000
into the size of a molecule --

172
0:08:42.249,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and it really feels like it, you have to try this.

173
0:08:44.622,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So now it feels like I'm standing inside the machine

174
0:08:47.249,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and I'm seeing all the DNA, and I see the molecules.

175
0:08:49.866,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I see the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth.

176
0:08:53.493,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And I can see how in this case,

177
0:08:55.12,000 --> 0:08:58,000
DNA is being replicated millions of times,

178
0:08:58.221,000 --> 0:09:,000
just like it's happening inside your body right now.

179
0:09:01.078,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And I can really feel and understand how all of this works.

180
0:09:06.219,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, I hope that gives you a little bit of a sense

181
0:09:09.537,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of the possibilities in these new teaching methods.

182
0:09:16.23,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And I want to also emphasize

183
0:09:17.596,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that everything you just saw also works on iPads and laptops

184
0:09:21.311,000 --> 0:09:22,000
without the headsets.

185
0:09:22.506,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I say that for a very important reason.

186
0:09:25.394,000 --> 0:09:28,000
In order for us to really empower and inspire

187
0:09:28.903,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the next generation of scientists,

188
0:09:31.095,000 --> 0:09:34,000
we really need teachers to drive the adoption

189
0:09:34.643,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of new technologies in the classroom.

190
0:09:38.542,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And so in many ways,

191
0:09:40.444,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I believe that the next big, quantum leap in science education

192
0:09:44.823,000 --> 0:09:46,000
lies no longer with the technology,

193
0:09:47.156,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but rather with the teachers' decision

194
0:09:49.061,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to push forward and adopt these technologies

195
0:09:52.29,000 --> 0:09:53,000
inside the classrooms.

196
0:09:54.061,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers

197
0:09:57.922,000 --> 0:09:59,000
will collaborate with technology companies

198
0:10:00.811,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to realize this full potential.

199
0:10:04.989,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And so,

200
0:10:06.458,000 --> 0:10:08,000
lastly, I'd like to leave you with a little story

201
0:10:09.315,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that really inspires me.

202
0:10:10.901,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And that is the story of Jack Andraka.

203
0:10:13.346,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Some of you might already know him.

204
0:10:15.132,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Jack invented a new, groundbreaking low-cost test for pancreatic cancer

205
0:10:22.148,000 --> 0:10:24,000
at the age 15.

206
0:10:25.758,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And when Jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough,

207
0:10:29.521,000 --> 0:10:32,000
he also explains that one thing almost prevented him

208
0:10:33.37,000 --> 0:10:34,000
from making this breakthrough.

209
0:10:35.543,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And that was that he did not have access to real laboratories,

210
0:10:40.627,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because he was too inexperienced

211
0:10:43.18,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to be allowed in.

212
0:10:45.853,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, imagine if we could bring

213
0:10:48.079,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Ivy League, million-dollar virtual laboratories

214
0:10:51.372,000 --> 0:10:53,000
out to all these students just like Jack,

215
0:10:53.467,000 --> 0:10:54,000
all over the world,

216
0:10:55.098,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and give them the latest, greatest, most fancy machines you can imagine

217
0:10:58.678,000 --> 0:11:,000
that would quite literally make any scientist in here

218
0:11:01.248,000 --> 0:11:03,000
jump up and down out of pure excitement.

219
0:11:03.745,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And then imagine how that would empower and inspire

220
0:11:08.379,000 --> 0:11:12,000
a whole new generation of young and bright scientists,

221
0:11:12.582,000 --> 0:11:15,000
ready to innovate and change the world.

222
0:11:16.187,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Thank you very much.

223
0:11:17.362,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Applause)

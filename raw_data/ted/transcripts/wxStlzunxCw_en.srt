1
0:00:12.652,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I could fit all movies ever made inside of this tube.

2
0:00:17.872,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If you can't see it, that's kind of the point.

3
0:00:20.149,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.189,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Before we understand how this is possible,

5
0:00:24.456,000 --> 0:00:27,000
it's important to understand the value of this feat.

6
0:00:29.075,000 --> 0:00:31,000
All of our thoughts and actions these days,

7
0:00:31.365,000 --> 0:00:32,000
through photos and videos --

8
0:00:33.375,000 --> 0:00:34,000
even our fitness activities --

9
0:00:35.278,000 --> 0:00:37,000
are stored as digital data.

10
0:00:38.109,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Aside from running out of space

11
0:00:39.65,000 --> 0:00:4,000
on our phones,

12
0:00:40.825,000 --> 0:00:42,000
we rarely think about our digital footprint.

13
0:00:43.536,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But humanity has collectively generated more data

14
0:00:47.088,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in the last few years

15
0:00:48.985,000 --> 0:00:5,000
than all of preceding human history.

16
0:00:51.902,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Big data has become a big problem.

17
0:00:55.229,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Digital storage is really expensive,

18
0:00:58.07,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and none of these devices that we have really stand the test of time.

19
0:01:03.256,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There's this nonprofit website called the Internet Archive.

20
0:01:07.03,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In addition to free books and movies,

21
0:01:09.699,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you can access web pages as far back as 1996.

22
0:01:14.087,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now, this is very tempting,

23
0:01:15.795,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but I decided to go back and look at the TED website's very humble beginnings.

24
0:01:21.808,000 --> 0:01:24,000
As you can see, it's changed quite a bit in the last 30 years.

25
0:01:26.72,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So this led me to the first-ever TED,

26
0:01:29.568,000 --> 0:01:31,000
back in 1984,

27
0:01:31.772,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and it just so happened to be a Sony executive

28
0:01:34.321,000 --> 0:01:37,000
explaining how a compact disk works.

29
0:01:37.403,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:38.506,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, it's really incredible to be able to go back in time

31
0:01:42.794,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and access this moment.

32
0:01:45.548,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's also really fascinating that after 30 years, after that first TED,

33
0:01:50.935,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we're still talking about digital storage.

34
0:01:54.827,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now, if we look back another 30 years,

35
0:01:57.638,000 --> 0:02:,000
IBM released the first-ever hard drive

36
0:02:00.847,000 --> 0:02:02,000
back in 1956.

37
0:02:02.998,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Here it is being loaded for shipping in front of a small audience.

38
0:02:07.569,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It held the equivalent of one MP3 song

39
0:02:11.354,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and weighed over one ton.

40
0:02:14.1,000 --> 0:02:16,000
At 10,000 dollars a megabyte,

41
0:02:16.775,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I don't think anyone in this room would be interested in buying this thing,

42
0:02:20.386,000 --> 0:02:21,000
except maybe as a collector's item.

43
0:02:22.817,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But it's the best we could do at the time.

44
0:02:26.832,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We've come such a long way in data storage.

45
0:02:29.972,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Devices have evolved dramatically.

46
0:02:32.894,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But all media eventually wear out or become obsolete.

47
0:02:37.401,000 --> 0:02:41,000
If someone handed you a floppy drive today to back up your presentation,

48
0:02:41.842,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you'd probably look at them kind of strange, maybe laugh,

49
0:02:44.806,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but you'd have no way to use the damn thing.

50
0:02:47.854,000 --> 0:02:5,000
These devices can no longer meet our storage needs,

51
0:02:51.019,000 --> 0:02:53,000
although some of them can be repurposed.

52
0:02:54.682,000 --> 0:02:57,000
All technology eventually dies or is lost,

53
0:02:57.815,000 --> 0:02:58,000
along with our data,

54
0:02:59.69,000 --> 0:03:,000
all of our memories.

55
0:03:02.21,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There's this illusion that the storage problem has been solved,

56
0:03:06.35,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but really, we all just externalize it.

57
0:03:08.867,000 --> 0:03:11,000
We don't worry about storing our emails and our photos.

58
0:03:12.368,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They're just in the cloud.

59
0:03:15.231,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But behind the scenes, storage is problematic.

60
0:03:18.192,000 --> 0:03:21,000
After all, the cloud is just a lot of hard drives.

61
0:03:23.156,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now, most digital data, we could argue, is not really critical.

62
0:03:27.22,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Surely, we could just delete it.

63
0:03:29.957,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But how can we really know what's important today?

64
0:03:34.132,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We've learned so much about human history

65
0:03:36.692,000 --> 0:03:38,000
from drawings and writings in caves,

66
0:03:39.542,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from stone tablets.

67
0:03:41.18,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We've deciphered languages from the Rosetta Stone.

68
0:03:45.841,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You know, we'll never really have the whole story, though.

69
0:03:49.474,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Our data is our story,

70
0:03:51.392,000 --> 0:03:52,000
even more so today.

71
0:03:53.508,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We won't have our record recorded on stone tablets.

72
0:03:57.692,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But we don't have to choose what is important now.

73
0:04:00.847,000 --> 0:04:01,000
There's a way to store it all.

74
0:04:03.519,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It turns out that there's a solution that's been around

75
0:04:06.141,000 --> 0:04:08,000
for a few billion years,

76
0:04:08.608,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and it's actually in this tube.

77
0:04:12.044,000 --> 0:04:15,000
DNA is nature's oldest storage device.

78
0:04:15.79,000 --> 0:04:18,000
After all, it contains all the information necessary

79
0:04:19.185,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to build and maintain a human being.

80
0:04:22.583,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But what makes DNA so great?

81
0:04:25.493,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Well, let's take our own genome

82
0:04:27.273,000 --> 0:04:28,000
as an example.

83
0:04:28.857,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If we were to print out all three billion A's, T's, C's and G's

84
0:04:33.651,000 --> 0:04:36,000
on a standard font, standard format,

85
0:04:37.306,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and then we were to stack all of those papers,

86
0:04:40.07,000 --> 0:04:42,000
it would be about 130 meters high,

87
0:04:42.754,000 --> 0:04:45,000
somewhere between the Statue of Liberty and the Washington Monument.

88
0:04:46.437,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Now, if we converted all those A's, T's, C's and G's

89
0:04:48.898,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to digital data, to zeroes and ones,

90
0:04:51.478,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it would total a few gigs.

91
0:04:53.786,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And that's in each cell of our body.

92
0:04:56.516,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We have more than 30 trillion cells.

93
0:04:59.757,000 --> 0:05:,000
You get the idea:

94
0:05:01.281,000 --> 0:05:05,000
DNA can store a ton of information in a minuscule space.

95
0:05:07.62,000 --> 0:05:08,000
DNA is also very durable,

96
0:05:09.469,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and it doesn't even require electricity to store it.

97
0:05:12.327,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We know this because scientists have recovered DNA from ancient humans

98
0:05:16.627,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that lived hundreds of thousands of years ago.

99
0:05:19.739,000 --> 0:05:21,000
One of those is Ötzi the Iceman.

100
0:05:22.39,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Turns out, he's Austrian.

101
0:05:24.097,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:25.721,000 --> 0:05:26,000
He was found high, well-preserved,

103
0:05:27.375,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in the mountains between Italy and Austria,

104
0:05:30.213,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it turns out that he has living genetic relatives here in Austria today.

105
0:05:34.221,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So one of you could be a cousin of Ötzi.

106
0:05:36.587,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:38.043,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The point is that we have a better chance of recovering information

108
0:05:41.92,000 --> 0:05:42,000
from an ancient human

109
0:05:43.169,000 --> 0:05:45,000
than we do from an old phone.

110
0:05:45.783,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's also much less likely that we'll lose the ability to read DNA

111
0:05:50.452,000 --> 0:05:52,000
than any single man-made device.

112
0:05:53.567,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Every single new storage format requires a new way to read it.

113
0:05:57.703,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We'll always be able to read DNA.

114
0:05:59.86,000 --> 0:06:02,000
If we can no longer sequence, we have bigger problems

115
0:06:02.952,000 --> 0:06:04,000
than worrying about data storage.

116
0:06:05.725,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Storing data on DNA is not new.

117
0:06:08.82,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Nature's been doing it for several billion years.

118
0:06:11.943,000 --> 0:06:14,000
In fact, every living thing is a DNA storage device.

119
0:06:16.397,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But how do we store data on DNA?

120
0:06:19.725,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is Photo 51.

121
0:06:21.54,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's the first-ever photo of DNA,

122
0:06:24.191,000 --> 0:06:26,000
taken about 60 years ago.

123
0:06:26.467,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is around the time that that same hard drive was released by IBM.

124
0:06:31.246,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So really, our understanding of digital storage and of DNA have coevolved.

125
0:06:37.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We first learned to sequence, or read DNA,

126
0:06:40.94,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and very soon after, how to write it,

127
0:06:42.976,000 --> 0:06:43,000
or synthesize it.

128
0:06:44.559,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is much like how we learn a new language.

129
0:06:48.812,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And now we have the ability to read, write and copy DNA.

130
0:06:53.449,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We do it in the lab all the time.

131
0:06:56.283,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So anything, really anything, that can be stored as zeroes and ones

132
0:07:00.189,000 --> 0:07:01,000
can be stored in DNA.

133
0:07:02.579,000 --> 0:07:05,000
To store something digitally, like this photo,

134
0:07:05.798,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we convert it to bits, or binary digits.

135
0:07:09.128,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Each pixel in a black-and-white photo is simply a zero or a one.

136
0:07:13.849,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And we can write DNA much like an inkjet printer can print letters on a page.

137
0:07:18.697,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We just have to convert our data, all of those zeroes and ones,

138
0:07:22.545,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to A's, T's, C's and G's,

139
0:07:24.707,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and then we send this to a synthesis company.

140
0:07:26.989,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So we write it, we can store it,

141
0:07:28.96,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and when we want to recover our data, we just sequence it.

142
0:07:32.218,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now, the fun part of all of this is deciding what files to include.

143
0:07:36.323,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We're serious scientists, so we had to include a manuscript

144
0:07:39.724,000 --> 0:07:4,000
for good posterity.

145
0:07:41.491,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We also included a $50 Amazon gift card --

146
0:07:44.348,000 --> 0:07:47,000
don't get too excited, it's already been spent, someone decoded it --

147
0:07:47.903,000 --> 0:07:49,000
as well as an operating system,

148
0:07:50.137,000 --> 0:07:52,000
one of the first movies ever made

149
0:07:52.532,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and a Pioneer plaque.

150
0:07:54.294,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Some of you might have seen this.

151
0:07:55.987,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It has a depiction of a typical -- apparently -- male and female,

152
0:07:59.467,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and our approximate location in the Solar System,

153
0:08:02.053,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in case the Pioneer spacecraft ever encounters extraterrestrials.

154
0:08:06.861,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So once we decided what sort of files we want to encode,

155
0:08:09.814,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we package up the data,

156
0:08:11.306,000 --> 0:08:14,000
convert those zeroes and ones to A's, T's, C's and G's,

157
0:08:14.984,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and then we just send this file off to a synthesis company.

158
0:08:18.285,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And this is what we got back.

159
0:08:20.079,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Our files were in this tube.

160
0:08:22.022,000 --> 0:08:24,000
All we had to do was sequence it.

161
0:08:24.525,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This all sounds pretty straightforward,

162
0:08:27.08,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but the difference between a really cool, fun idea

163
0:08:30.082,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and something we can actually use

164
0:08:32.261,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is overcoming these practical challenges.

165
0:08:35.453,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Now, while DNA is more robust than any man-made device,

166
0:08:39.449,000 --> 0:08:4,000
it's not perfect.

167
0:08:40.758,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It does have some weaknesses.

168
0:08:43.364,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We recover our message by sequencing the DNA,

169
0:08:46.819,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and every time data is retrieved,

170
0:08:48.856,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we lose the DNA.

171
0:08:50.666,000 --> 0:08:52,000
That's just part of the sequencing process.

172
0:08:53.104,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We don't want to run out of data,

173
0:08:55.063,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but luckily, there's a way to copy the DNA

174
0:08:58.183,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that's even cheaper and easier than synthesizing it.

175
0:09:03.275,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We actually tested a way to make 200 trillion copies of our files,

176
0:09:08.157,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and we recovered all the data without error.

177
0:09:11.556,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So sequencing also introduces errors into our DNA,

178
0:09:15.447,000 --> 0:09:17,000
into the A's, T's, C's and G's.

179
0:09:18.135,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Nature has a way to deal with this in our cells.

180
0:09:21.137,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But our data is stored in synthetic DNA in a tube,

181
0:09:27.051,000 --> 0:09:3,000
so we had to find our own way to overcome this problem.

182
0:09:30.724,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We decided to use an algorithm that was used to stream videos.

183
0:09:35.452,000 --> 0:09:36,000
When you're streaming a video,

184
0:09:36.929,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you're essentially trying to recover the original video, the original file.

185
0:09:41.414,000 --> 0:09:43,000
When we're trying to recover our original files,

186
0:09:44.347,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we're simply sequencing.

187
0:09:46.219,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But really, both of these processes are about recovering enough zeroes and ones

188
0:09:50.331,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to put our data back together.

189
0:09:52.711,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And so, because of our coding strategy,

190
0:09:54.776,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we were able to package up all of our data

191
0:09:57.351,000 --> 0:10:,000
in a way that allowed us to make millions and trillions of copies

192
0:10:01.147,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and still always recover all of our files back.

193
0:10:04.708,000 --> 0:10:05,000
This is the movie we encoded.

194
0:10:06.482,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's one of the first movies ever made,

195
0:10:09.086,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and now the first to be copied more than 200 trillion times on DNA.

196
0:10:14.377,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Soon after our work was published,

197
0:10:16.531,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we participated in an "Ask Me Anything" on the website reddit.

198
0:10:20.302,000 --> 0:10:23,000
If you're a fellow nerd, you're very familiar with this website.

199
0:10:23.501,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Most questions were thoughtful.

200
0:10:25.47,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Some were comical.

201
0:10:27.366,000 --> 0:10:31,000
For example, one user wanted to know when we would have a literal thumb drive.

202
0:10:32.091,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now, the thing is,

203
0:10:34.391,000 --> 0:10:38,000
our DNA already stores everything needed to make us who we are.

204
0:10:38.557,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's a lot safer to store data on DNA

205
0:10:42.399,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in synthetic DNA in a tube.

206
0:10:46.704,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Writing and reading data from DNA is obviously a lot more time-consuming

207
0:10:52.154,000 --> 0:10:55,000
than just saving all your files on a hard drive --

208
0:10:55.273,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for now.

209
0:10:57.159,000 --> 0:11:,000
So initially, we should focus on long-term storage.

210
0:11:02.63,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Most data are ephemeral.

211
0:11:04.964,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's really hard to grasp what's important today,

212
0:11:07.576,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or what will be important for future generations.

213
0:11:10.852,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But the point is, we don't have to decide today.

214
0:11:14.065,000 --> 0:11:18,000
There's this great program by UNESCO called the "Memory of the World" program.

215
0:11:19.077,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It's been created to preserve historical materials

216
0:11:22.368,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that are considered of value to all of humanity.

217
0:11:26.21,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Items are nominated to be added to the collection,

218
0:11:29.211,000 --> 0:11:31,000
including that film that we encoded.

219
0:11:32.188,000 --> 0:11:35,000
While a wonderful way to preserve human heritage,

220
0:11:35.794,000 --> 0:11:36,000
it doesn't have to be a choice.

221
0:11:38.088,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Instead of asking the current generation -- us --

222
0:11:41.566,000 --> 0:11:43,000
what might be important in the future,

223
0:11:43.812,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we could store everything in DNA.

224
0:11:47.543,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Storage is not just about how many bytes

225
0:11:50.007,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but how well we can actually store the data and recover it.

226
0:11:53.94,000 --> 0:11:56,000
There's always been this tension between how much data we can generate

227
0:11:57.395,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and how much we can recover

228
0:11:59.134,000 --> 0:12:,000
and how much we can store.

229
0:12:01.841,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Every advance in writing data has required a new way to read it.

230
0:12:05.904,000 --> 0:12:07,000
We can no longer read old media.

231
0:12:08.271,000 --> 0:12:11,000
How many of you even have a disk drive in your laptop,

232
0:12:12.036,000 --> 0:12:13,000
never mind a floppy drive?

233
0:12:14.151,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This will never be the case with DNA.

234
0:12:16.727,000 --> 0:12:19,000
As long as we're around, DNA is around,

235
0:12:19.928,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and we'll find a way to sequence it.

236
0:12:23.214,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Archiving the world around us is part of human nature.

237
0:12:27.172,000 --> 0:12:31,000
This is the progress we've made in digital storage in 60 years,

238
0:12:31.82,000 --> 0:12:34,000
at a time when we were only beginning to understand DNA.

239
0:12:35.725,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Yet, we've made similar progress in half that time with DNA sequencers,

240
0:12:40.594,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and as long as we're around, DNA will never be obsolete.

241
0:12:46.107,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Thank you.

242
0:12:47.312,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.796,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Leah Chase: Oh, this is beautiful.

2
0:00:15.305,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Oh, gosh, I never saw such a room

3
0:00:17.345,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and beauty and strength like I'm looking at.

4
0:00:20.441,000 --> 0:00:22,000
That's gorgeous. It is.

5
0:00:22.599,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It is a beautiful room.

6
0:00:24.926,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Pat Mitchell: I almost said your age, because you gave me permission,

7
0:00:29.234,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but I realized that I was about to make you a year older.

8
0:00:31.933,000 --> 0:00:32,000
You're only 94.

9
0:00:33.75,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:35.123,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Applause)

11
0:00:36.751,000 --> 0:00:37,000
LC: Yeah, I'm only 94.

12
0:00:38.558,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Applause)

13
0:00:39.982,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I mean, you get this old and parts start wearing out.

14
0:00:44.092,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Your legs start wearing out.

15
0:00:46.206,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The one thing that my children always say:

16
0:00:48.743,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"But nothing happened to your mouth."

17
0:00:50.569,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:53.03,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So you've got to have something going, so I've got my mouth going.

19
0:00:56.15,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:58.664,000 --> 0:01:,000
PM: So Mrs. Chase, the first time we were there,

21
0:01:00.941,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I brought a group of young women, who work with us at TED,

22
0:01:05.111,000 --> 0:01:06,000
into the kitchen,

23
0:01:06.295,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and we were all standing around and you had already cooked lunch

24
0:01:09.319,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for hundreds of people, as you do every day,

25
0:01:11.413,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and you looked up at them.

26
0:01:13.35,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You have to share with this audience what you said to those young women.

27
0:01:18.015,000 --> 0:01:21,000
LC: Well, you know, I talk to young women all the time,

28
0:01:21.212,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it's beginning to bother me,

29
0:01:24.246,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because look how far I came.

30
0:01:26.457,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I'd come with women that had to really hustle and work hard,

31
0:01:32.791,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and they knew how to be women.

32
0:01:36.706,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They didn't play that man down.

33
0:01:40.547,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And, well, we didn't have the education you have today,

34
0:01:44.099,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and God, I'm so proud

35
0:01:45.749,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when I see those women with all that education under their belt.

36
0:01:50.162,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That's why I worked hard,

37
0:01:51.499,000 --> 0:01:54,000
tried to get everybody to use those resources.

38
0:01:55.793,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So they just don't know their power,

39
0:01:59.352,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I always tell them, just look at my mother,

40
0:02:03.026,000 --> 0:02:05,000
had 12 girls before she had a boy.

41
0:02:05.495,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:06.693,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So you know how I came out.

43
0:02:08.185,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:09.431,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, she had 14 children.

45
0:02:11.01,000 --> 0:02:15,000
She raised 11 of us out of that 14,

46
0:02:15.082,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and up until last year, we were all still living,

47
0:02:18.045,000 --> 0:02:2,000
a bunch of old biddies, but we're still here.

48
0:02:20.318,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:21.668,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And sometimes we can be just cantankerous and blah blah blah blah blah,

50
0:02:25.923,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but we still go.

51
0:02:27.948,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I love to see women.

52
0:02:30.844,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You don't know what it does for me

53
0:02:32.98,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to see women in the position that you're in today.

54
0:02:36.999,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I never thought I'd see that.

55
0:02:38.937,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I never thought I'd see women

56
0:02:41.302,000 --> 0:02:46,000
be able to take places and positions that we have today.

57
0:02:46.62,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It is just a powerful thing.

58
0:02:48.901,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I had a young woman come to me.

59
0:02:51.328,000 --> 0:02:52,000
She was an African-American woman.

60
0:02:53.998,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I said, "Well, what do you do, honey?"

61
0:02:56.824,000 --> 0:03:,000
She said, "I am a retired Navy pilot."

62
0:03:01.927,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Oh God, that just melted me,

63
0:03:04.595,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because I knew how hard it was to integrate that Navy.

64
0:03:10.643,000 --> 0:03:15,000
You know, the Navy was the last thing to really be integrated,

65
0:03:16.315,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that was done by Franklin Roosevelt

66
0:03:20.566,000 --> 0:03:24,000
as a favor to an African-American man,

67
0:03:25.114,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Lester Granger, that I knew very well.

68
0:03:27.513,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He was the head of the National Urban League back there,

69
0:03:31.528,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and when Roosevelt asked him,

70
0:03:33.831,000 --> 0:03:38,000
he wanted to appoint Lester as maybe one of his cabinet members.

71
0:03:39.11,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Lester said, "No, I don't want that.

72
0:03:41.469,000 --> 0:03:44,000
All I want you to do is integrate that Navy."

73
0:03:45.675,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And that was what Franklin did.

74
0:03:48.136,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Well, Franklin didn't live to do it,

75
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but Truman did it.

76
0:03:51.84,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But when this woman told me,

77
0:03:54.462,000 --> 0:03:57,000
"I have flown everything there is to fly,"

78
0:03:57.645,000 --> 0:04:,000
bombers, just all kinds of planes,

79
0:04:01.262,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it just melted me, you know,

80
0:04:04.627,000 --> 0:04:07,000
just to see how far women have come.

81
0:04:07.671,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I told her, I said,

82
0:04:08.937,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Well, you could get into the space program."

83
0:04:12.129,000 --> 0:04:14,000
She said, "But Ms. Chase, I'm too old."

84
0:04:14.328,000 --> 0:04:16,000
She was already 60-some years old,

85
0:04:16.828,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and, you know, you're over the hill then.

86
0:04:19.852,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:22.225,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They don't want you flying up in the sky at 60-something years old.

88
0:04:25.71,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Stay on the ground.

89
0:04:26.986,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When I meet women,

90
0:04:30.336,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and today everybody comes to my kitchen,

91
0:04:32.781,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and you know that,

92
0:04:34.304,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and it upsets Stella, my daughter.

93
0:04:36.535,000 --> 0:04:38,000
She doesn't like people coming in the kitchen.

94
0:04:38.835,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But that's where I am,

95
0:04:40.321,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that's where you're going to see me, in the kitchen.

96
0:04:43.186,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So when they come there, I meet all kinds of people.

97
0:04:46.209,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And that is the thing that really uplifts me,

98
0:04:49.345,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is when I meet women on the move.

99
0:04:52.463,000 --> 0:04:56,000
When I meet women on the move, it is good for me.

100
0:04:56.765,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, I'm not one of these flag-waving women.

101
0:04:59.483,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You're not going to see me out there waving.

102
0:05:01.901,000 --> 0:05:03,000
No, I don't do that.

103
0:05:03.948,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:04.98,000 --> 0:05:07,000
No, I don't do that, and I don't want any of you to do that.

105
0:05:08.027,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Just be good women.

106
0:05:10.284,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And you know, my mother taught us ...

107
0:05:12.745,000 --> 0:05:14,000
she was tough on us,

108
0:05:15.197,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and she said, "You know, Leah,"

109
0:05:16.904,000 --> 0:05:18,000
she gave us all this plaque,

110
0:05:19.333,000 --> 0:05:23,000
"to be a good woman, you have to first look like a girl."

111
0:05:23.405,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Well, I thought I looked like a girl.

112
0:05:26.056,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"Act like a lady."

113
0:05:27.601,000 --> 0:05:28,000
That, I never learned to do.

114
0:05:29.192,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:31.09,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"Think like a man."

116
0:05:33.075,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now don't act like that man; think like a man.

117
0:05:35.678,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And "work like a dog."

118
0:05:37.128,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:39.342,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So we learned that the hard way.

120
0:05:42.099,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And they taught you that.

121
0:05:44.01,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They taught you what women had to do.

122
0:05:47.156,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We were taught that women controlled the behavior of men.

123
0:05:51.914,000 --> 0:05:53,000
How you act, they will act.

124
0:05:55.064,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So you've got to do that, and I tell you all the time.

125
0:05:58.279,000 --> 0:06:,000
You know, don't play this man down.

126
0:06:01.288,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It upsets me when you may have a husband

127
0:06:05.103,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that maybe he doesn't have as much education under his belt as you have,

128
0:06:11.435,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but still you can't play him down.

129
0:06:15.149,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You've got to keep lifting him up,

130
0:06:17.261,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because you don't want to live with a mouse.

131
0:06:19.585,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So you want that man to be a man, and do what he has to do.

132
0:06:24.478,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And anyway, always remember,

133
0:06:26.765,000 --> 0:06:28,000
he runs on cheap gas.

134
0:06:28.813,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:31.143,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So fill him up with cheap gas --

136
0:06:33.582,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:35.478,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and then, you got him.

138
0:06:37.034,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's just so --

139
0:06:38.395,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:41.058,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's just --

141
0:06:42.438,000 --> 0:06:44,000
PM: You have to give us a minute to take that in.

142
0:06:44.836,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:47.416,000 --> 0:06:5,000
LC: When I heard this young lady speak before I came out --

144
0:06:51.433,000 --> 0:06:53,000
she was so beautiful,

145
0:06:53.988,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and I wished I could be like that,

146
0:06:56.21,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and my husband, poor darling --

147
0:06:57.711,000 --> 0:07:,000
I lost him after we were married 70 years --

148
0:07:00.759,000 --> 0:07:01,000
didn't agree on one thing,

149
0:07:02.66,000 --> 0:07:04,000
never did, nothing,

150
0:07:05.251,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but we got along together

151
0:07:06.696,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because he learned to understand me,

152
0:07:09.252,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and that was just hard,

153
0:07:11.387,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because he was so different.

154
0:07:13.435,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And that lady reminded me.

155
0:07:15.19,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I said, "If I would have just been like her,

156
0:07:17.972,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Dooky would have really loved it."

157
0:07:20.289,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:22.755,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But I wasn't.

159
0:07:23.94,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I was always pushy, always moving,

160
0:07:25.837,000 --> 0:07:26,000
always doing this,

161
0:07:27.296,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and he used to come to me all the time, and he said,

162
0:07:30.526,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"Honey, God's going to punish you."

163
0:07:32.217,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:33.79,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"You -- you're just not grateful."

165
0:07:35.918,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But it isn't that I'm not grateful,

166
0:07:38.155,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but I think, as long as you're living, you've got to keep moving,

167
0:07:41.576,000 --> 0:07:42,000
you've got to keep trying to get up

168
0:07:43.444,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and do what you've got to do.

169
0:07:44.925,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Applause)

170
0:07:45.95,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You cannot sit down.

171
0:07:47.148,000 --> 0:07:48,000
You have to keep going,

172
0:07:49.076,000 --> 0:07:51,000
keep trying to do a little bit every day.

173
0:07:51.918,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Every day, you do a little bit,

174
0:07:53.644,000 --> 0:07:54,000
try to make it better.

175
0:07:55.093,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And that's been my whole life.

176
0:07:56.89,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Well, I came up in the country, small town,

177
0:08:00.378,000 --> 0:08:02,000
had to do everything, had to haul the water,

178
0:08:02.768,000 --> 0:08:04,000
had to wash the clothes, do this, do that,

179
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
pick the dumb strawberries, all that kind of stuff.

180
0:08:08.02,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:09.045,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But still, my daddy insisted that we act nice,

182
0:08:14.346,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we be kind.

183
0:08:15.786,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And that's all.

184
0:08:17.048,000 --> 0:08:18,000
When I heard this young woman --

185
0:08:18.638,000 --> 0:08:2,000
oh, she sounds so beautiful --

186
0:08:21.123,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I said, "I wish I could be like that."

187
0:08:23.925,000 --> 0:08:26,000
PM: Mrs. Chase, we don't want you to be any different than you are.

188
0:08:27.158,000 --> 0:08:28,000
There is no question about that.

189
0:08:28.713,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Let me ask you.

190
0:08:30.361,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This is why it's so wonderful to have a conversation

191
0:08:32.861,000 --> 0:08:34,000
with someone who has such a long view --

192
0:08:34.965,000 --> 0:08:35,000
LC: A long time.

193
0:08:36.14,000 --> 0:08:37,000
PM: to remembering Roosevelt

194
0:08:37.514,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and the person he did that favor for.

195
0:08:39.342,000 --> 0:08:41,000
What is in your head and your mind

196
0:08:42.296,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and what you have seen and witnessed ...

197
0:08:44.246,000 --> 0:08:49,000
One of the things that it's good to remember, always,

198
0:08:49.653,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is that when you opened that restaurant,

199
0:08:52.456,000 --> 0:08:56,000
whites and blacks could not eat together in this city.

200
0:08:57.041,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It was against the law.

201
0:08:58.688,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And yet they did, at Dooky Chase. Tell me about that.

202
0:09:02.863,000 --> 0:09:03,000
LC: They did, there.

203
0:09:04.301,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Well, my mother-in-law first started this,

204
0:09:06.36,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and the reason she started is,

205
0:09:08.229,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because her husband was sickly, and he would go out --

206
0:09:15.25,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and people from Chicago and all the places,

207
0:09:19.337,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you would call his job a numbers runner.

208
0:09:23.931,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But in New Orleans, we are very sophisticated --

209
0:09:27.121,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:28.145,000 --> 0:09:29,000
so it wasn't a numbers runner,

211
0:09:29.876,000 --> 0:09:31,000
it was a lottery vendor.

212
0:09:31.956,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

213
0:09:33.654,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So you see, we put class to that.

214
0:09:35.687,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But that's how he did it.

215
0:09:36.957,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And he couldn't go from house to house to get his clients and all that,

216
0:09:42.023,000 --> 0:09:43,000
because he was sick,

217
0:09:43.485,000 --> 0:09:46,000
so she opened up this little sandwich shop,

218
0:09:46.979,000 --> 0:09:48,000
so she was going to take down the numbers,

219
0:09:49.899,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because he was sick a lot.

220
0:09:52.51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
He had ulcers. He was really bad for a long a time.

221
0:09:56.395,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So she did that --

222
0:09:57.755,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and not knowing anything,

223
0:10:00.573,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but she knew she could make a sandwich.

224
0:10:02.501,000 --> 0:10:03,000
She knew she could cook,

225
0:10:03.97,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and she borrowed 600 dollars from a brewery.

226
0:10:08.274,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Can you imagine starting a business today with 600 dollars

227
0:10:12.773,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and no knowledge of what you're doing?

228
0:10:15.789,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And it always just amazed me what she could do.

229
0:10:19.999,000 --> 0:10:2,000
She was a good money manager.

230
0:10:21.814,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That, I am not.

231
0:10:23.751,000 --> 0:10:25,000
My husband used to call me a bankrupt sister.

232
0:10:26.426,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

233
0:10:27.887,000 --> 0:10:28,000
"She'll spend everything you got."

234
0:10:29.547,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And I would, you know.

235
0:10:30.949,000 --> 0:10:32,000
PM: But you kept the restaurant open, though,

236
0:10:33.083,000 --> 0:10:37,000
even in those times of controversy, when people were protesting

237
0:10:37.593,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and almost boycotting.

238
0:10:39.331,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I mean, it was a controversial move that you and your husband made.

239
0:10:42.926,000 --> 0:10:44,000
LC: It was, and I don't know how we did it,

240
0:10:45.031,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but as I said, my mother-in-law was a kind, kind person,

241
0:10:48.935,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and you didn't have any African-Americans on the police force at that time.

242
0:10:53.772,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They were all white.

243
0:10:55.385,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But they would come around,

244
0:10:57.259,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and she would say,

245
0:10:58.852,000 --> 0:11:,000
"Bebe, I'm gonna fix you a little sandwich."

246
0:11:01.075,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So she would fix them a sandwich.

247
0:11:03.836,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Today they would call that bribery.

248
0:11:05.855,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

249
0:11:07.959,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But she was just that kind of person.

250
0:11:10.647,000 --> 0:11:11,000
She liked to do things for you.

251
0:11:12.27,000 --> 0:11:13,000
She liked to give.

252
0:11:13.953,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So she would do that,

253
0:11:16.068,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and maybe that helped us out,

254
0:11:17.477,000 --> 0:11:19,000
because nobody ever bothered us.

255
0:11:20.421,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We had Jim Dombrowski, Albert Ben Smith,

256
0:11:24.335,000 --> 0:11:28,000
who started all kinds of things right in that restaurant,

257
0:11:29.316,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and nobody ever bothered us.

258
0:11:31.322,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So we just did it.

259
0:11:32.98,000 --> 0:11:33,000
PM: Excuse me.

260
0:11:34.155,000 --> 0:11:36,000
You talked to me that day

261
0:11:36.262,000 --> 0:11:4,000
about the fact that people considered the restaurant a safe haven

262
0:11:40.531,000 --> 0:11:41,000
where they could come together,

263
0:11:42.262,000 --> 0:11:45,000
particularly if they were working on civil rights,

264
0:11:45.594,000 --> 0:11:46,000
human rights,

265
0:11:46.888,000 --> 0:11:48,000
working to change the laws.

266
0:11:49.078,000 --> 0:11:52,000
LC: Well, because once you got inside those doors,

267
0:11:52.857,000 --> 0:11:55,000
nobody ever, ever bothered you.

268
0:11:55.953,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The police would never come in

269
0:11:58.245,000 --> 0:12:,000
and bother our customers, never.

270
0:12:01.083,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So they felt safe to come there.

271
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:05,000
They could eat, they could plan.

272
0:12:05.711,000 --> 0:12:06,000
All the Freedom Riders,

273
0:12:07.441,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that's where they planned all their meetings.

274
0:12:11.148,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They would come and we would serve them a bowl of gumbo

275
0:12:14.36,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and fried chicken.

276
0:12:15.543,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Laughter)

277
0:12:16.582,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So I said, we'd changed the course of America

278
0:12:19.713,000 --> 0:12:21,000
over a bowl of gumbo and some fried chicken.

279
0:12:22.284,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

280
0:12:27.022,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I would like to invite the leaders, now,

281
0:12:30.053,000 --> 0:12:32,000
just come have a bowl of gumbo and some fried chicken,

282
0:12:32.932,000 --> 0:12:34,000
talk it over and we'd go and we'd do what we have to do.

283
0:12:35.75,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Applause)

284
0:12:37.877,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And that's all we did.

285
0:12:39.311,000 --> 0:12:42,000
PM: Could we send you a list to invite to lunch?

286
0:12:42.564,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Laughter)

287
0:12:43.681,000 --> 0:12:44,000
LC: Yeah, invite.

288
0:12:44.921,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Because that's what we're not doing.

289
0:12:47.094,000 --> 0:12:48,000
We're not talking.

290
0:12:48.97,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Come together.

291
0:12:50.21,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I don't care if you're a Republican or what you are -- come together.

292
0:12:53.591,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Talk.

293
0:12:54.805,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And I know those old guys.

294
0:12:56.084,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I was friends with those old guys,

295
0:12:57.728,000 --> 0:12:59,000
like Tip O'Neill and all of those people.

296
0:13:00.186,000 --> 0:13:03,000
They knew how to come together and talk,

297
0:13:03.257,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and you would disagree maybe.

298
0:13:06.857,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That's OK.

299
0:13:08.158,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But you would talk, and we would come to a good thing and meet.

300
0:13:11.162,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And so that's what we did in that restaurant.

301
0:13:14.041,000 --> 0:13:17,000
They would plan the meeting,

302
0:13:17.175,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Oretha's mother, Oretha Haley's mother.

303
0:13:20.278,000 --> 0:13:21,000
She was big in CORE.

304
0:13:21.944,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Her mother worked for me for 42 years.

305
0:13:25.306,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And she was like me.

306
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We didn't understand the program.

307
0:13:29.939,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Nobody our age understood this program,

308
0:13:33.621,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and we sure didn't want our children to go to jail.

309
0:13:37.889,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Oh, that was ... oh God.

310
0:13:39.707,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But these young people were willing to go to jail

311
0:13:42.52,000 --> 0:13:43,000
for what they believed.

312
0:13:43.786,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We were working with Thurgood and A.P. Tureaud and all those people

313
0:13:48.319,000 --> 0:13:49,000
with the NAACP.

314
0:13:50.193,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But that was a slow move.

315
0:13:52.196,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We would still be out here trying to get in the door, waiting for them.

316
0:13:55.783,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Laughter)

317
0:13:57.837,000 --> 0:13:59,000
PM: Is that Thurgood Marshall you're talking about?

318
0:14:00.276,000 --> 0:14:02,000
LC: Thurgood Marshall. But I loved Thurgood.

319
0:14:02.406,000 --> 0:14:03,000
He was a good movement.

320
0:14:03.916,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They wanted to do this without offending anybody.

321
0:14:08.456,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I'll never forget A.P. Tureaud:

322
0:14:10.233,000 --> 0:14:11,000
"But you can't offend the white people.

323
0:14:12.152,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Don't offend them."

324
0:14:14.813,000 --> 0:14:15,000
But these young people didn't care.

325
0:14:16.702,000 --> 0:14:2,000
They said, "We're going. Ready or not, we're going to do this."

326
0:14:21.455,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And so we had to support them.

327
0:14:23.59,000 --> 0:14:26,000
These were the children we knew, righteous children.

328
0:14:26.928,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We had to help them.

329
0:14:28.578,000 --> 0:14:31,000
PM: And they brought the change. LC: And they brought the change.

330
0:14:31.678,000 --> 0:14:32,000
You know, it was hard,

331
0:14:33.598,000 --> 0:14:36,000
but sometimes you do hard things to make changes.

332
0:14:36.781,000 --> 0:14:38,000
PM: And you've seen so many of those changes.

333
0:14:39.336,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The restaurant has been a bridge.

334
0:14:41.169,000 --> 0:14:45,000
You have been a bridge between the past and now,

335
0:14:45.647,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but you don't live in the past, do you?

336
0:14:48.155,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You live very much in the present.

337
0:14:51.188,000 --> 0:14:54,000
LC: And that's what you have to tell young people today.

338
0:14:54.413,000 --> 0:14:55,000
OK, you can protest,

339
0:14:56.422,000 --> 0:14:57,000
but put the past behind you.

340
0:14:58.601,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I can't make you responsible for what your grandfather did.

341
0:15:03.268,000 --> 0:15:04,000
That's your grandfather.

342
0:15:04.839,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I have to build on that.

343
0:15:06.808,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I have to make changes.

344
0:15:08.086,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I can't stay there and say,

345
0:15:10.538,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"Oh, well, look what they did to us then.

346
0:15:12.561,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Look what they do to us now."

347
0:15:13.968,000 --> 0:15:14,000
No, you remember that,

348
0:15:15.679,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but that makes you keep going on,

349
0:15:17.988,000 --> 0:15:19,000
but you don't harp on it every day.

350
0:15:20.46,000 --> 0:15:21,000
You move,

351
0:15:21.648,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and you move to make a difference,

352
0:15:23.536,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and everybody should be involved.

353
0:15:27.358,000 --> 0:15:28,000
My children said,

354
0:15:28.597,000 --> 0:15:3,000
"Mother, don't get political," you know.

355
0:15:30.727,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

356
0:15:32.742,000 --> 0:15:35,000
"Don't get political, because you know we don't like that."

357
0:15:35.822,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But you have to be political today.

358
0:15:38.545,000 --> 0:15:4,000
You have to be involved.

359
0:15:40.933,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Be a part of the system.

360
0:15:42.737,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Look how it was when we couldn't be a part of the system.

361
0:15:46.055,000 --> 0:15:49,000
When Dutch Morial became the mayor,

362
0:15:49.745,000 --> 0:15:52,000
it was a different feeling in the African-American community.

363
0:15:54.34,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We felt a part of things.

364
0:15:56.888,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Now we've got a mayor.

365
0:15:58.752,000 --> 0:16:,000
We feel like we belong.

366
0:16:01.006,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Moon tried before Dutch came.

367
0:16:04.311,000 --> 0:16:06,000
PM: Mayor Landrieu's father, Moon Landrieu.

368
0:16:06.35,000 --> 0:16:08,000
LC: Mayor Landrieu's father, he took great, great risks

369
0:16:09.257,000 --> 0:16:13,000
by putting African-Americans in city hall.

370
0:16:13.485,000 --> 0:16:16,000
He took a whipping for that for a long time,

371
0:16:16.993,000 --> 0:16:18,000
but he was a visionary,

372
0:16:19.272,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and he did those things that he knew was going to help the city.

373
0:16:24.367,000 --> 0:16:26,000
He knew we had to get involved.

374
0:16:26.676,000 --> 0:16:27,000
So that's what we have to do.

375
0:16:28.683,000 --> 0:16:29,000
We don't harp on that.

376
0:16:29.989,000 --> 0:16:3,000
We just keep moving,

377
0:16:31.597,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and Mitch, you know, I tell Moon all the time,

378
0:16:34.977,000 --> 0:16:35,000
"You did a good thing,"

379
0:16:36.688,000 --> 0:16:39,000
but Mitch did one bigger than you and better than you.

380
0:16:40.529,000 --> 0:16:41,000
When he pulled those statues down,

381
0:16:42.281,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I said, "Boy, you're crazy!"

382
0:16:43.728,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Applause)

383
0:16:46.443,000 --> 0:16:47,000
You're crazy.

384
0:16:47.988,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But it was a good political move.

385
0:16:52.006,000 --> 0:16:54,000
You know, when I saw P.T. Beauregard come down,

386
0:16:55.002,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I was sitting looking at the news,

387
0:16:58.05,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and it just hit me what this was all about.

388
0:17:02.527,000 --> 0:17:06,000
To me, it wasn't about race; it was a political move.

389
0:17:07.639,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And I got so furious,

390
0:17:08.971,000 --> 0:17:1,000
I got back on that kitchen the next morning,

391
0:17:11.051,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and I said, come on, pick up your pants, and let's go to work,

392
0:17:14.163,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because you're going to get left behind.

393
0:17:16.243,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And that's what you have to do.

394
0:17:17.776,000 --> 0:17:18,000
You have to move on people,

395
0:17:19.53,000 --> 0:17:2,000
move on what they do.

396
0:17:21.292,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It was going to bring visibility to the city.

397
0:17:24.731,000 --> 0:17:27,000
So you got that visibility -- move on it, uplift yourself,

398
0:17:28.672,000 --> 0:17:29,000
do what you have to do,

399
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and do it well.

400
0:17:32.195,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And that's all we do.

401
0:17:33.461,000 --> 0:17:34,000
That's all I try to do.

402
0:17:34.788,000 --> 0:17:38,000
PM: But you just gave the formula for resilience. Right?

403
0:17:38.974,000 --> 0:17:43,000
So you are clearly the best example we could find anywhere of resilience,

404
0:17:44.376,000 --> 0:17:46,000
so there must be something you think --

405
0:17:46.639,000 --> 0:17:47,000
LC: I like emotional strength.

406
0:17:48.258,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I like people with emotional and physical strength,

407
0:17:52.081,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and maybe that's bad for me.

408
0:17:55.91,000 --> 0:17:59,000
My favorite all-time general was George Patton.

409
0:18:00.752,000 --> 0:18:02,000
You know, that wasn't too cool.

410
0:18:02.96,000 --> 0:18:04,000
(Laughter)

411
0:18:05.228,000 --> 0:18:06,000
PM: It's surprising.

412
0:18:06.444,000 --> 0:18:09,000
LC: I've got George Patton hanging in my dining room

413
0:18:09.997,000 --> 0:18:11,000
because I want to remember.

414
0:18:12.483,000 --> 0:18:13,000
He set goals for himself,

415
0:18:14.382,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and he was going to set out to reach those goals.

416
0:18:18.067,000 --> 0:18:19,000
He never stopped.

417
0:18:19.754,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And I always remember his words:

418
0:18:22.075,000 --> 0:18:24,000
"Lead, follow, or get out of the way."

419
0:18:25.203,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Now, I can't lead --

420
0:18:26.733,000 --> 0:18:27,000
(Applause)

421
0:18:27.899,000 --> 0:18:28,000
I can't be a leader,

422
0:18:29.705,000 --> 0:18:31,000
but I can follow a good leader,

423
0:18:31.784,000 --> 0:18:33,000
but I am not getting out of the way.

424
0:18:34.126,000 --> 0:18:35,000
(Applause)

425
0:18:35.609,000 --> 0:18:37,000
But that's just what you have to do.

426
0:18:38.046,000 --> 0:18:4,000
(Applause)

427
0:18:40.486,000 --> 0:18:42,000
If you can't lead --

428
0:18:42.587,000 --> 0:18:44,000
leaders need followers,

429
0:18:44.858,000 --> 0:18:49,000
so if I help you up there, I'm going to ride on your coattails,

430
0:18:49.892,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and I can't count the coattails I've ridden upon.

431
0:18:52.766,000 --> 0:18:53,000
(Laughter)

432
0:18:54.368,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Feed you good. You'll help me out.

433
0:18:56.042,000 --> 0:18:57,000
(Laughter)

434
0:18:57.156,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And that's what life is all about.

435
0:18:59.64,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Everybody can do something,

436
0:19:02.703,000 --> 0:19:04,000
but please get involved.

437
0:19:05.024,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Do something.

438
0:19:06.23,000 --> 0:19:1,000
The thing we have to do in this city, in all cities --

439
0:19:10.769,000 --> 0:19:13,000
mommas have to start being mommas today.

440
0:19:14.988,000 --> 0:19:15,000
You know?

441
0:19:16.163,000 --> 0:19:18,000
They have to start understanding --

442
0:19:18.191,000 --> 0:19:2,000
when you bring this child in the world,

443
0:19:20.716,000 --> 0:19:21,000
you have to make a man out of it,

444
0:19:22.516,000 --> 0:19:24,000
you have to make a woman out of it,

445
0:19:24.59,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and it takes some doing.

446
0:19:26.027,000 --> 0:19:27,000
It takes sacrifice.

447
0:19:27.989,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Maybe you won't have the long fingernails, maybe you won't have the pretty hair.

448
0:19:32.419,000 --> 0:19:34,000
But that child will be on the move,

449
0:19:35.42,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and that's what you have to do.

450
0:19:36.968,000 --> 0:19:38,000
We have to concentrate on educating

451
0:19:39.154,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and making these children understand what it's all about.

452
0:19:44.167,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And I hate to tell you, gentlemen,

453
0:19:46.287,000 --> 0:19:48,000
it's going to take a good woman to do that.

454
0:19:49.809,000 --> 0:19:52,000
It's going to take a good woman to do that.

455
0:19:53.012,000 --> 0:19:54,000
(Applause)

456
0:19:54.043,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Men can do their part.

457
0:19:55.877,000 --> 0:19:57,000
The other part is to just do what you have to do

458
0:19:58.179,000 --> 0:19:59,000
and bring it home,

459
0:19:59.376,000 --> 0:20:,000
but we can handle the rest,

460
0:20:01.091,000 --> 0:20:02,000
and we will handle the rest.

461
0:20:03.229,000 --> 0:20:05,000
If you're a good woman, you can do that.

462
0:20:05.381,000 --> 0:20:06,000
PM: You heard that first here.

463
0:20:06.919,000 --> 0:20:07,000
We can handle the rest.

464
0:20:08.311,000 --> 0:20:09,000
LC: We can handle the rest.

465
0:20:10.07,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Mrs. Chase, thank you so much --

466
0:20:12.078,000 --> 0:20:13,000
LC: Thank you.

467
0:20:13.26,000 --> 0:20:17,000
PM: for taking time out from the work you do every day in this community.

468
0:20:17.443,000 --> 0:20:19,000
LC: But you don't know what this does for me.

469
0:20:19.625,000 --> 0:20:21,000
When I see all of these people, and come together --

470
0:20:22.331,000 --> 0:20:24,000
people come to my kitchen from all over the world.

471
0:20:25.751,000 --> 0:20:27,000
I had people come from London,

472
0:20:28.306,000 --> 0:20:3,000
now twice this happened to me.

473
0:20:30.637,000 --> 0:20:34,000
First a man came, and I don't know why he came to this --

474
0:20:34.677,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Every year, the chefs do something called "Chef's Charity."

475
0:20:40.041,000 --> 0:20:44,000
Well, it so happened I was the only woman there,

476
0:20:44.756,000 --> 0:20:46,000
and the only African-American there

477
0:20:47.3,000 --> 0:20:49,000
on that stage doing these demonstrations,

478
0:20:50.219,000 --> 0:20:53,000
and I would not leave until I saw another woman come up there, too.

479
0:20:53.837,000 --> 0:20:55,000
I'm not going up -- they're going to carry me up there

480
0:20:56.464,000 --> 0:20:57,000
until you bring another woman up here.

481
0:20:58.336,000 --> 0:20:59,000
(Laughter)

482
0:21:00.09,000 --> 0:21:03,000
So they have another one now, so I could step down.

483
0:21:03.161,000 --> 0:21:05,000
But this man was from London.

484
0:21:06.018,000 --> 0:21:08,000
So after that, I found the man in my kitchen.

485
0:21:08.963,000 --> 0:21:09,000
He came to my kitchen,

486
0:21:10.862,000 --> 0:21:12,000
and he said, "I want to ask you one question."

487
0:21:13.172,000 --> 0:21:16,000
OK, I thought I was going to ask something about food.

488
0:21:16.298,000 --> 0:21:2,000
"Why do all these white men hang around you?"

489
0:21:20.338,000 --> 0:21:22,000
(Laughter)

490
0:21:22.481,000 --> 0:21:23,000
What?

491
0:21:23.656,000 --> 0:21:24,000
(Laughter)

492
0:21:25.481,000 --> 0:21:26,000
I couldn't understand.

493
0:21:27.108,000 --> 0:21:29,000
He couldn't understand that.

494
0:21:29.156,000 --> 0:21:3,000
I said, "We work together.

495
0:21:30.966,000 --> 0:21:32,000
This is the way we live in this city.

496
0:21:33.569,000 --> 0:21:36,000
I may never go to your house, you may never come to my house.

497
0:21:36.64,000 --> 0:21:37,000
But when it comes to working,

498
0:21:38.298,000 --> 0:21:4,000
like raising money for this special school,

499
0:21:41.083,000 --> 0:21:42,000
we come together.

500
0:21:42.917,000 --> 0:21:43,000
That's what we do.

501
0:21:44.219,000 --> 0:21:46,000
And still here comes another, a woman,

502
0:21:47.211,000 --> 0:21:48,000
elegantly dressed,

503
0:21:48.814,000 --> 0:21:5,000
about a month ago in my kitchen.

504
0:21:51.829,000 --> 0:21:54,000
She said, "I don't understand what I see in your dining room."

505
0:21:56.269,000 --> 0:21:57,000
I said, "What do you see?"

506
0:21:57.96,000 --> 0:21:59,000
She saw whites and blacks together.

507
0:22:00.735,000 --> 0:22:01,000
That's what we do.

508
0:22:02.324,000 --> 0:22:03,000
We meet. We talk.

509
0:22:04.571,000 --> 0:22:05,000
And we work together,

510
0:22:06.301,000 --> 0:22:07,000
and that's what we have to do.

511
0:22:08.219,000 --> 0:22:11,000
You don't have to be my best friend to work to better your city,

512
0:22:11.957,000 --> 0:22:12,000
to better your country.

513
0:22:13.662,000 --> 0:22:16,000
We just have to come together and work, and that's what we do in this city.

514
0:22:17.654,000 --> 0:22:19,000
We're a weird bunch down here.

515
0:22:19.876,000 --> 0:22:2,000
(Laughter)

516
0:22:21.122,000 --> 0:22:23,000
Nobody understands us,

517
0:22:23.503,000 --> 0:22:24,000
but we feed you well.

518
0:22:25.114,000 --> 0:22:27,000
(Laughter)

519
0:22:27.385,000 --> 0:22:31,000
(Applause)

520
0:22:31.781,000 --> 0:22:32,000
(Cheering)

521
0:22:32.817,000 --> 0:22:33,000
Thank you.

522
0:22:34.004,000 --> 0:22:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Economists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years:

2
0:00:18.88,000 --> 0:00:19,000
how we make decisions,

3
0:00:20.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
how we act individually and in groups,

4
0:00:23.56,000 --> 0:00:24,000
how we exchange value.

5
0:00:26.76,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade,

6
0:00:30.24,000 --> 0:00:31,000
like legal systems,

7
0:00:31.68,000 --> 0:00:32,000
corporations,

8
0:00:33.52,000 --> 0:00:34,000
marketplaces.

9
0:00:35.6,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But there is a new, technological institution

10
0:00:39.08,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that will fundamentally change how we exchange value,

11
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and it's called the blockchain.

12
0:00:46.04,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now, that's a pretty bold statement,

13
0:00:48.72,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but if you take nothing else away from this talk,

14
0:00:51.88,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I actually want you to remember

15
0:00:53.64,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that while blockchain technology is relatively new,

16
0:00:57.6,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it's also a continuation of a very human story,

17
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and the story is this.

18
0:01:04.08,000 --> 0:01:06,000
As humans, we find ways

19
0:01:06.12,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to lower uncertainty about one another

20
0:01:08.96,000 --> 0:01:09,000
so that we can exchange value.

21
0:01:13.08,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, one of the first people to really explore the idea

22
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:19,000
of institutions as a tool in economics

23
0:01:19.8,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to lower our uncertainties about one another

24
0:01:22.28,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and be able to do trade

25
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:26,000
was the Nobel economist Douglass North.

26
0:01:27.68,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He passed away at the end of 2015,

27
0:01:29.84,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but North pioneered what's called "new institutional economics."

28
0:01:35.12,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules

29
0:01:39.32,000 --> 0:01:4,000
like a constitution,

30
0:01:41.32,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and informal constraints, like bribery.

31
0:01:45.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
These institutions are really the grease

32
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that allow our economic wheels to function,

33
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and we can see this play out over the course of human history.

34
0:01:55.12,000 --> 0:01:58,000
If we think back to when we were hunter-gatherer economies,

35
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:,000
we really just traded within our village structure.

36
0:02:01.56,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We had some informal constraints in place,

37
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but we enforced all of our trade with violence

38
0:02:07.56,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or social repercussions.

39
0:02:09.96,000 --> 0:02:11,000
As our societies grew more complex

40
0:02:12.32,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and our trade routes grew more distant,

41
0:02:15.56,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we built up more formal institutions,

42
0:02:18.6,000 --> 0:02:21,000
institutions like banks for currency,

43
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
governments, corporations.

44
0:02:24.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
These institutions helped us manage our trade

45
0:02:27.24,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as the uncertainty and the complexity grew,

46
0:02:30.28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and our personal control was much lower.

47
0:02:33.56,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Eventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online.

48
0:02:38.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We built platform marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,

49
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
just faster institutions that act as middlemen

50
0:02:46.56,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to facilitate human economic activity.

51
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:53,000
As Douglass North saw it,

52
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty

53
0:02:57.68,000 --> 0:03:01,000
so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.

54
0:03:02.84,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I believe we are now entering

55
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:07,000
a further and radical evolution

56
0:03:08.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of how we interact and trade,

57
0:03:10.68,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty

58
0:03:14.28,000 --> 0:03:17,000
not just with political and economic institutions,

59
0:03:17.88,000 --> 0:03:2,000
like our banks, our corporations, our governments,

60
0:03:21.64,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but we can do it with technology alone.

61
0:03:25.92,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So what is the blockchain?

62
0:03:27.96,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Blockchain technology is a decentralized database

63
0:03:32.04,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that stores a registry of assets and transactions

64
0:03:35.6,000 --> 0:03:36,000
across a peer-to-peer network.

65
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's basically a public registry

66
0:03:40.32,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of who owns what and who transacts what.

67
0:03:43.92,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The transactions are secured through cryptography,

68
0:03:46.92,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data

69
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that are then cryptographically linked together and secured.

70
0:03:57.36,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This creates an immutable, unforgeable record

71
0:04:01.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
of all of the transactions across this network.

72
0:04:05.4,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.

73
0:04:11.24,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's not an app.

74
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's not a company.

75
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I think it's closest in description to something like Wikipedia.

76
0:04:19.8,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We can see everything on Wikipedia.

77
0:04:21.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated.

78
0:04:27.88,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia,

79
0:04:31.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we can create our own wikis,

80
0:04:33.88,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because at their core, they're just a data infrastructure.

81
0:04:38.6,000 --> 0:04:43,000
On Wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images

82
0:04:44.12,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and the changes to that data over time.

83
0:04:47.52,000 --> 0:04:48,000
On the blockchain,

84
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you can think of it as an open infrastructure

85
0:04:51.96,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that stores many kinds of assets.

86
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It stores the history of custodianship,

87
0:04:58.52,000 --> 0:05:,000
ownership and location

88
0:05:00.76,000 --> 0:05:03,000
for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin,

89
0:05:04.44,000 --> 0:05:05,000
other digital assets

90
0:05:06.04,000 --> 0:05:09,000
like a title of ownership of IP.

91
0:05:10.48,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It could be a certificate, a contract,

92
0:05:13.64,000 --> 0:05:14,000
real world objects,

93
0:05:14.92,000 --> 0:05:16,000
even personal identifiable information.

94
0:05:19.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There are of course other technical details to the blockchain,

95
0:05:22.96,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but at its core, that's how it works.

96
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's this public registry that stores transactions in a network

97
0:05:29.36,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.

98
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Which brings me to my point

99
0:05:37.28,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of how blockchains lower uncertainty

100
0:05:40.36,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems

101
0:05:44.52,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in radical ways.

102
0:05:47.88,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So uncertainty is kind of a big term

103
0:05:50.24,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in economics,

104
0:05:51.64,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but I want to go through three forms of it

105
0:05:53.72,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions,

106
0:05:57.12,000 --> 0:05:59,000
where blockchains can play a role.

107
0:05:59.24,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with,

108
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:04,000
not having visibility into a transaction

109
0:06:05.48,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and not having recourse if things go wrong.

110
0:06:09.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.

111
0:06:13.72,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Say I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay.

112
0:06:17.76,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The first thing I'm going to do is look up who I'm buying from.

113
0:06:21.6,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Are they a power user?

114
0:06:23.36,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Do they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all?

115
0:06:28.96,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:

116
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:34,000
these are the attestations about our identities

117
0:06:35.4,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that we cobble together today

118
0:06:37.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with.

119
0:06:41.84,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But the problem is they're very fragmented.

120
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Think about how many profiles you have.

121
0:06:48.52,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform

122
0:06:54.04,000 --> 0:06:58,000
on which to store any attestation about any individual

123
0:06:58.44,000 --> 0:06:59,000
from any source.

124
0:07:00.48,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This allows us to create a user-controlled

125
0:07:03.8,000 --> 0:07:04,000
portable identity.

126
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:08,000
More than a profile,

127
0:07:09.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
it means you can selectively reveal

128
0:07:13.04,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the different attributes about you

129
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that help facilitate trade or interaction,

130
0:07:18.32,000 --> 0:07:2,000
for instance that a government issued you an ID,

131
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
or that you're over 21,

132
0:07:23.48,000 --> 0:07:25,000
by revealing the cryptographic proof

133
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that these details exist and are signed off on.

134
0:07:30.96,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Having this kind of portable identity

135
0:07:33.04,000 --> 0:07:36,000
around the physical world and the digital world

136
0:07:36.08,000 --> 0:07:39,000
means we can do all kinds of human trade

137
0:07:39.4,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in a totally new way.

138
0:07:42.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So I've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty

139
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in who we're dealing with.

140
0:07:47.08,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The second uncertainty that we often face

141
0:07:49.68,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is just not having transparency into our interactions.

142
0:07:53.6,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Say you're going to send me that smartphone by mail.

143
0:07:56.36,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I want some degree of transparency.

144
0:07:58.08,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I want to know that the product I bought is the same one that arrives in the mail

145
0:08:02.4,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and that there's some record for how it got to me.

146
0:08:04.8,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is true not just for electronics like smartphones,

147
0:08:07.44,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but for many kinds of goods and data,

148
0:08:10.64,000 --> 0:08:12,000
things like medicine, luxury goods,

149
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
any kind of data or product that we don't want tampered with.

150
0:08:18.88,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The problem in many companies,

151
0:08:21.12,000 --> 0:08:24,000
especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone,

152
0:08:24.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is they're managing all of these different vendors

153
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:28,000
across a horizontal supply chain.

154
0:08:30.24,000 --> 0:08:32,000
All of these people that go into making a product,

155
0:08:32.84,000 --> 0:08:33,000
they don't have the same database.

156
0:08:34.52,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They don't use the same infrastructure,

157
0:08:36.56,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.

158
0:08:43.84,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Using the blockchain, we can create

159
0:08:45.799,000 --> 0:08:48,000
a shared reality across nontrusting entities.

160
0:08:50.64,000 --> 0:08:51,000
By this I mean

161
0:08:51.88,000 --> 0:08:54,000
all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other

162
0:08:55.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or trust each other,

163
0:08:56.72,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because they each have the ability

164
0:08:58.88,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to monitor and validate the chain for themselves.

165
0:09:03.04,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Think back to Wikipedia.

166
0:09:04.8,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's a shared database,

167
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and even though it has multiple readers

168
0:09:09.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and multiple writers at the same time,

169
0:09:11.96,000 --> 0:09:12,000
it has one single truth.

170
0:09:14.72,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So we can create that using blockchains.

171
0:09:16.84,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly

172
0:09:22.84,000 --> 0:09:24,000
without actually creating that central authority.

173
0:09:26.2,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So all of these vendors, all sorts of companies,

174
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:31,000
can interact using the same database without trusting one another.

175
0:09:34.2,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency.

176
0:09:37.76,000 --> 0:09:39,000
As a real-world object travels along,

177
0:09:39.92,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain,

178
0:09:45.12,000 --> 0:09:46,000
adding value as it goes.

179
0:09:48.36,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.

180
0:09:53.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So I've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity

181
0:09:59.24,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and how they change what we mean about transparency

182
0:10:02.48,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain.

183
0:10:07.52,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The last uncertainty that we often face

184
0:10:09.64,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is one of the most open-ended, and it's reneging.

185
0:10:12.92,000 --> 0:10:14,000
What if you don't send me the smartphone?

186
0:10:15.44,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Can I get my money back?

187
0:10:17.8,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Blockchains allow us to write code,

188
0:10:21.52,000 --> 0:10:22,000
binding contracts,

189
0:10:23.24,000 --> 0:10:24,000
between individuals

190
0:10:24.92,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out

191
0:10:28.6,000 --> 0:10:29,000
without a third party enforcer.

192
0:10:31.72,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow.

193
0:10:35.64,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You are financing that phone,

194
0:10:37.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but you don't need to release the funds

195
0:10:40.32,000 --> 0:10:42,000
until you can verify that all the conditions have been met.

196
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
You got the phone.

197
0:10:46.24,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I think this is one of the most exciting ways

198
0:10:48.68,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that blockchains lower our uncertainties,

199
0:10:51.84,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because it means to some degree

200
0:10:53.44,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we can collapse institutions and their enforcement.

201
0:10:59.72,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It means a lot of human economic activity

202
0:11:02.44,000 --> 0:11:07,000
can get collateralized and automated,

203
0:11:07.48,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and push a lot of human intervention to the edges,

204
0:11:10.56,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.

205
0:11:16.88,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I think what would probably floor Douglass North

206
0:11:19.36,000 --> 0:11:21,000
about this use of technology

207
0:11:21.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is the fact that the very thing that makes it work,

208
0:11:24.8,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified,

209
0:11:29.36,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is our mutual distrust.

210
0:11:33.6,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So rather than all of our uncertainties

211
0:11:36.72,000 --> 0:11:37,000
slowing us down

212
0:11:38.36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and requiring institutions

213
0:11:40.88,000 --> 0:11:43,000
like banks, our governments, our corporations,

214
0:11:45.36,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty

215
0:11:49.76,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.

216
0:11:56.8,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now, I don't want you to get the impression

217
0:11:58.88,000 --> 0:12:,000
that the blockchain is the solution to everything,

218
0:12:01.28,000 --> 0:12:05,000
even though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty,

219
0:12:07.84,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem

220
0:12:10.6,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and potentially save the rainforest.

221
0:12:14.32,000 --> 0:12:17,000
The truth is, this technology is in its infancy,

222
0:12:18.32,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place

223
0:12:21.56,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and probably fail

224
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
before we truly understand all of the use cases

225
0:12:26.56,000 --> 0:12:27,000
for our economy.

226
0:12:29.24,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But there are tons of people working on this,

227
0:12:31.44,000 --> 0:12:32,000
from financial institutions

228
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to technology companies, start-ups and universities.

229
0:12:37.12,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution.

230
0:12:42.08,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It's also an innovation in computer science.

231
0:12:49.36,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Blockchains give us the technological capability

232
0:12:52.84,000 --> 0:12:55,000
of creating a record of human exchange,

233
0:12:56.44,000 --> 0:12:57,000
of exchange of currency,

234
0:12:58.72,000 --> 0:13:01,000
of all kinds of digital and physical assets,

235
0:13:02.44,000 --> 0:13:04,000
even of our own personal attributes,

236
0:13:05.04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
in a totally new way.

237
0:13:07.72,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So in some ways,

238
0:13:09.08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
they become a technological institution

239
0:13:12.08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that has a lot of the benefits

240
0:13:13.88,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of the traditional institutions we're used to using in society,

241
0:13:18.2,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but it does this in a decentralized way.

242
0:13:22.36,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties

243
0:13:25.92,000 --> 0:13:26,000
into certainties.

244
0:13:28.36,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So I think we need to start preparing ourselves,

245
0:13:31.92,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because we are about to face a world

246
0:13:34.48,000 --> 0:13:37,000
where distributed, autonomous institutions

247
0:13:37.64,000 --> 0:13:39,000
have quite a significant role.

248
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Thank you.

249
0:13:41.84,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Applause)

250
0:13:50.4,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.

251
0:13:52.88,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I think I understood that it's coming,

252
0:13:56.6,000 --> 0:13:57,000
it offers a lot of potential,

253
0:13:58.52,000 --> 0:14:,000
and it's complex.

254
0:14:00.72,000 --> 0:14:05,000
What is your estimate for the rate of adoption?

255
0:14:07.12,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Bettina Warburg: I think that's a really good question.

256
0:14:09.76,000 --> 0:14:1,000
My lab is pretty much focused

257
0:14:11.2,000 --> 0:14:14,000
on going the enterprise and government route first,

258
0:14:14.68,000 --> 0:14:17,000
because in reality, blockchain is a complex technology.

259
0:14:18.24,000 --> 0:14:2,000
How many of you actually understand how the internet works?

260
0:14:21.04,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But you use it every day,

261
0:14:22.72,000 --> 0:14:25,000
so I think we're sort of facing the same John Sculley idea

262
0:14:26.52,000 --> 0:14:29,000
of technology should either be invisible or beautiful,

263
0:14:30.2,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now,

264
0:14:34.08,000 --> 0:14:37,000
so it's better suited for either really early adopters

265
0:14:38.08,000 --> 0:14:4,000
who kind of get it and can tinker around

266
0:14:40.32,000 --> 0:14:42,000
or for finding those best use cases

267
0:14:43.32,000 --> 0:14:46,000
like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts

268
0:14:46.52,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that can be used at that level of an enterprise or government.

269
0:14:50.56,000 --> 0:14:51,000
BG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED.

270
0:14:52.489,000 --> 0:14:53,000
BW: Thanks.

271
0:14:53.72,000 --> 0:14:55,000

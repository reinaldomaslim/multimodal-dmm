1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I come from a family of five brothers,

2
0:00:15.52,000 --> 0:00:16,000
all scientists and engineers.

3
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:21,000
A few years ago, I sent them the following email:

4
0:00:22.92,000 --> 0:00:25,000
"Dear brothers, I hope this message finds you well.

5
0:00:26.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I am emailing to let you know

6
0:00:28.72,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that I'm dropping out of my master's program in engineering

7
0:00:31.88,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to pursue a career as a full-time musician.

8
0:00:35.48,000 --> 0:00:38,000
All that I ask from you is not to worry about me."

9
0:00:40.36,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Brother number one replied.

10
0:00:42.76,000 --> 0:00:43,000
He was encouraging but a bit skeptical.

11
0:00:45.56,000 --> 0:00:47,000
He said, "I wish you the best of luck.

12
0:00:47.72,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You're going to need it."

13
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Brother number two was a little bit more skeptical.

15
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:56,000
He said, "Don't do it!

16
0:00:56.8,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This will be the worst mistake of your life.

17
0:00:59.8,000 --> 0:01:,000
Find a real career."

18
0:01:01.28,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:02.88,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Well, the rest of my brothers were so enthusiastic about my decision,

20
0:01:07.72,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they didn't even respond.

21
0:01:09.48,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:12.24,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I know that the skepticism coming from my brothers

23
0:01:15.44,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is out of care and concern for me.

24
0:01:17.519,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They were worried.

25
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They thought it would be difficult to make it as an artist,

26
0:01:22.52,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that it will be a challenge.

27
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And you know what? They were right.

28
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It is such a challenge to be a full-time artist.

29
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I have so many friends who need to have a second job

30
0:01:34.4,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as a plan B in order to pay for the bills,

31
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:39,000
except that plan B sometimes becomes their plan A.

32
0:01:41.92,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And it's not just my friends and I who experience this.

33
0:01:45.24,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The US Census Bureau states that only 10 percent of art school graduates

34
0:01:50.2,000 --> 0:01:53,000
end up working as full-time artists.

35
0:01:53.32,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The other 90 percent, they change careers,

36
0:01:55.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they work in marketing, sales, education and other fields.

37
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But this is not news, right?

38
0:02:02.64,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We almost expect the artist to be a struggling artist.

39
0:02:06.96,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But why should we expect that?

40
0:02:10.68,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I read an article in the "Huffington Post"

41
0:02:12.96,000 --> 0:02:15,000
saying that four years ago, the European Union

42
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
began the world's largest ever arts funding initiative.

43
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Creative Europe will give 2.4 billion dollars

44
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to over 300,000 artists.

45
0:02:26.52,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In contrast, the US budget for our National Endowment for the Arts,

46
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the largest single funder for the arts across the United States,

47
0:02:35.96,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is merely 146 million dollars.

48
0:02:39.8,000 --> 0:02:41,000
To put things into perspective,

49
0:02:41.96,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the US budget for the military marching bands alone

50
0:02:46.12,000 --> 0:02:49,000
is almost twice as much as the entire NEA.

51
0:02:51.56,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Another striking image comes from Brendan McMahon for the "Huffington Post,"

52
0:02:56.12,000 --> 0:02:59,000
saying that out of the one trillion dollar budget

53
0:02:59.24,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for military and defense-related spending,

54
0:03:02.08,000 --> 0:03:06,000
if only 0.05 percent were allocated to the arts,

55
0:03:06.48,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we would be able to pay for 20 full-time symphony orchestras

56
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:12,000
at 20 million dollars apiece,

57
0:03:12.84,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and give over 80,000 artists

58
0:03:16.32,000 --> 0:03:19,000
an annual salary of 50,000 dollars each.

59
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
If that's only 0.05 percent,

60
0:03:23.48,000 --> 0:03:24,000
imagine what a full one percent could do.

61
0:03:26.92,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, I know we live in a capitalist society,

62
0:03:29.64,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and profits matter a lot.

63
0:03:32.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So let's look at it from a financial angle, shall we?

64
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The US nonprofit arts industry

65
0:03:38.68,000 --> 0:03:43,000
generates more than 166 billion dollars in economic activity,

66
0:03:44.52,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it employs 5.7 million people

67
0:03:48.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it returns 12.6 billion dollars

68
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in tax revenue.

69
0:03:52.6,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But this is only a financial angle, right?

70
0:03:54.88,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We all know that the arts is way more than just an economic value.

71
0:03:59.4,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The arts brings meaning to life.

72
0:04:01.52,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's the spirit of our culture.

73
0:04:04.48,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It brings people together and it supports creativity

74
0:04:06.96,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and social cohesion.

75
0:04:09.36,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But if the arts contributes this much to our economy,

76
0:04:13.48,000 --> 0:04:17,000
why then do we still invest so little in arts and artists?

77
0:04:19.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Why do more than 80 percent of our schools nationwide

78
0:04:23.6,000 --> 0:04:26,000
still experience budget cuts in arts education programs?

79
0:04:28.36,000 --> 0:04:3,000
What is it about the value of arts and artists

80
0:04:31.12,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that we still don't understand?

81
0:04:34.079,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I believe the system is flawed and far from being fair,

82
0:04:37.8,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I want to help change that.

83
0:04:39.96,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I want to live in a society

84
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
where artists are more valued

85
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and have more cultural and financial support

86
0:04:46.4,000 --> 0:04:5,000
so they can focus on creating arts instead of being forced to drive Ubers

87
0:04:50.44,000 --> 0:04:52,000
or take corporate jobs they'd rather not have.

88
0:04:53.88,000 --> 0:04:56,000
There are other sources of income for artists, however.

89
0:04:57.4,000 --> 0:04:59,000
There are private foundations,

90
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
grants and patrons who give money,

91
0:05:02.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
except a vast majority of artists don't know about these opportunities.

92
0:05:07.12,000 --> 0:05:1,000
On one side you have institutions and people with money.

93
0:05:10.76,000 --> 0:05:12,000
On the other side you have artists seeking funding,

94
0:05:13.4,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but the artists don't know about the people with the money,

95
0:05:16.24,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the people with the money don't necessarily know

96
0:05:18.72,000 --> 0:05:19,000
about the artists out there.

97
0:05:20.12,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is why I am very excited to share "Grantpa,"

98
0:05:23.84,000 --> 0:05:25,000
an online platform that uses technology

99
0:05:26.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to match artists with grants and funding opportunities

100
0:05:30.4,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in a way that is easy, fast and less intimidating.

101
0:05:34.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Grantpa is only one step towards solving an existing problem

102
0:05:38.56,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of funding inequality,

103
0:05:41.2,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but we need to work collectively on multiple fronts

104
0:05:44.48,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to reevaluate how we view the artists in our society.

105
0:05:48.56,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Do we think of arts as a luxury or a necessity?

106
0:05:52.92,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Do we understand what goes on in the day-to-day life of an artist,

107
0:05:57.08,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or do we still believe that artists, no matter how struggling they are,

108
0:06:01.36,000 --> 0:06:04,000
are happy simply because they're following their passion?

109
0:06:06.32,000 --> 0:06:1,000
In a few years, I plan to send my brothers the following email:

110
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Dear brothers, I hope this message finds you well.

111
0:06:16.2,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I am emailing to let you know that I am doing great

112
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and so are hundreds of thousands of artists

113
0:06:21.68,000 --> 0:06:24,000
who are being valued more culturally and financially

114
0:06:25.2,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and getting enough funding to focus on their crafts

115
0:06:28.24,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and create more art.

116
0:06:30.28,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I appreciate all of your support.

117
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Couldn't have done it without you."

118
0:06:34.56,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thank you.

119
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Applause)

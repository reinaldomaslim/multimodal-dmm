0:00:15.319,000 --> 0:00:18,000
One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,

3
0:00:19.243,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.

4
0:00:23.537,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You. Yeah. (Laughter)

5
0:00:25.096,000 --> 0:00:28,000
With the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)

6
0:00:28.444,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You know who you are.

7
0:00:29.499,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Actually, that whole row isn't right. (Laughter)

8
0:00:31.896,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me. (Laughter)

9
0:00:37.07,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I am one of the one in four. Thank you.

10
0:00:42.183,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I think I inherit it from my mother, who,

11
0:00:45.193,000 --> 0:00:47,000
used to crawl around the house on all fours.

12
0:00:48.007,000 --> 0:00:51,000
She had two sponges in her hand, and then she had two

13
0:00:51.054,000 --> 0:00:55,000
tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)

14
0:00:55.636,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And she would crawl around behind me going,

15
0:00:57.944,000 --> 0:01:,000
"Who brings footprints into a building?!"

16
0:01:01.509,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.

17
0:01:03.859,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So before I start, I would like to thank

18
0:01:09.051,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,

19
0:01:13.737,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.

20
0:01:18.66,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So how did it start?

21
0:01:23.497,000 --> 0:01:27,000
My mental illness -- well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.

22
0:01:27.616,000 --> 0:01:29,000
What am I going to talk about? Okay.

23
0:01:29.929,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,

24
0:01:34.331,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque

25
0:01:36.87,000 --> 0:01:38,000
existentialist revelation,

26
0:01:39.283,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)

27
0:01:43.628,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown

28
0:01:46.735,000 --> 0:01:47,000
during my daughter's sports day.

29
0:01:48.725,000 --> 0:01:51,000
There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot

30
0:01:52.45,000 --> 0:01:56,000
eating food out of the back of their car -- only the English --

31
0:01:56.457,000 --> 0:02:02,000
eating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)

32
0:02:02.684,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,

33
0:02:07.316,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,

34
0:02:09.779,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and all the mummies went, "Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!" (Laughter)

35
0:02:14.99,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"

36
0:02:18.858,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,

37
0:02:21.325,000 --> 0:02:23,000
everybody except for my daughter, who was just standing

38
0:02:24.27,000 --> 0:02:26,000
at the starting line, just waving,

39
0:02:27.037,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because she didn't know she was supposed to run.

40
0:02:29.368,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up

41
0:02:33.717,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,

42
0:02:38.31,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)

43
0:02:42.702,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Because they became my only friends, they became my friends,

44
0:02:46.19,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn't

45
0:02:49.188,000 --> 0:02:52,000
sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg

46
0:02:52.558,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or I was with child I would have been inundated,

47
0:02:54.722,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.

48
0:02:58.398,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Perk up.

49
0:03:00.098,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Because I didn't think of that. (Laughter)

50
0:03:04.805,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

51
0:03:08.105,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,

52
0:03:12.382,000 --> 0:03:15,000
this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,

53
0:03:16.348,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because your friends go, "Oh come on, show me the lump,

54
0:03:18.66,000 --> 0:03:2,000
show me the x-rays," and of course you've got nothing to show,

55
0:03:21.071,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking,

56
0:03:24.165,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."

57
0:03:26.981,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice,

58
0:03:30.429,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices,

59
0:03:33.288,000 --> 0:03:37,000
like if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.

60
0:03:37.297,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,

61
0:03:39.925,000 --> 0:03:4,000
there are no voices in your head.

62
0:03:41.804,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You know that when you have those abusive voices,

63
0:03:43.478,000 --> 0:03:45,000
all those little neurons get together and in that little gap

64
0:03:46.379,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical,

65
0:03:50.037,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,

66
0:03:52.783,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you might have yourself depression.

67
0:03:54.679,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.

68
0:03:57.362,000 --> 0:04:,000
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,

69
0:04:00.964,000 --> 0:04:03,000
its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive

70
0:04:04.421,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow,

71
0:04:08.413,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.

72
0:04:11.868,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into

73
0:04:15.345,000 --> 0:04:18,000
such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words,

74
0:04:18.859,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so he just feels the horror over and over again.

75
0:04:21.633,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So here's my question. My question is, how come

76
0:04:24.006,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?

77
0:04:28.051,000 --> 0:04:31,000
How come every other organ in your body can get sick

78
0:04:31.27,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and you get sympathy, except the brain?

79
0:04:33.974,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain,

80
0:04:36.373,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because I know you like that here at TED,

81
0:04:38.404,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so if you just give me a minute here, okay.

82
0:04:41.857,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Okay, let me just say, there's some good news.

83
0:04:43.863,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There is some good news. First of all, let me say,

84
0:04:47.145,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we've come a long, long way.

85
0:04:49.472,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,

86
0:04:53.513,000 --> 0:04:57,000
tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.

87
0:04:58.11,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Here we go. (Laughter)

88
0:05:00.01,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This little baby has a lot of horsepower.

89
0:05:02.375,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.

90
0:05:06.798,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.

91
0:05:10.391,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.

92
0:05:13.037,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Here we've got a little bit of long-term memory,

93
0:05:14.656,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)

94
0:05:19.893,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons

95
0:05:23.213,000 --> 0:05:26,000
just zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,

96
0:05:26.516,000 --> 0:05:28,000
zizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.

97
0:05:29.236,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter)

98
0:05:32.828,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So, zizzing away, and so — (Laughter) —

99
0:05:36.828,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.

100
0:05:40.517,000 --> 0:05:43,000
For every one single neuron, you can actually have

101
0:05:44.189,000 --> 0:05:47,000
from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections

102
0:05:47.915,000 --> 0:05:5,000
or dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time

103
0:05:51.177,000 --> 0:05:53,000
you learn something, or you have an experience,

104
0:05:53.697,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that bush grows, you know, that bush of information.

105
0:05:55.97,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Can you imagine, every human being is carrying

106
0:05:58.924,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)

107
0:06:03.847,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Go figure.

108
0:06:05.541,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.

109
0:06:09.025,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.

110
0:06:12.145,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We are not equipped for the 21st century.

111
0:06:16.325,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth,

112
0:06:20.074,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day,

113
0:06:22.657,000 --> 0:06:25,000
they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.

114
0:06:26.217,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches

115
0:06:28.741,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.

116
0:06:31.185,000 --> 0:06:34,000
When we were ancient man — (Laughter) —

117
0:06:34.746,000 --> 0:06:37,000
millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened

118
0:06:38.507,000 --> 0:06:41,000
by a predator, okay? — (Laughter) —

119
0:06:42.209,000 --> 0:06:44,000
we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)

120
0:06:45.157,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

121
0:06:48.98,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline

122
0:06:53.054,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed,

123
0:06:55.672,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel,

124
0:06:58.942,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and we'd go back to normal. Okay.

125
0:07:00.875,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man— (Laughter) —

126
0:07:06.157,000 --> 0:07:09,000
when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical

127
0:07:09.924,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but because we can't kill traffic wardens — (Laughter) —

128
0:07:14.559,000 --> 0:07:18,000
or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body

129
0:07:19.356,000 --> 0:07:21,000
over and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm,

130
0:07:21.844,000 --> 0:07:22,000
a constant state. And here's another thing that happened.

131
0:07:23.577,000 --> 0:07:26,000
About 150,000 years ago, when language came online,

132
0:07:26.682,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we started to put words to this constant emergency,

133
0:07:29.107,000 --> 0:07:31,000
so it wasn't just, "Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger,"

134
0:07:31.763,000 --> 0:07:35,000
which could be, it was suddenly, "Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat.

135
0:07:35.804,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Oh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"

136
0:07:39.809,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes

137
0:07:42.295,000 --> 0:07:44,000
over and over again that drives you insane, so,

138
0:07:44.831,000 --> 0:07:46,000
you see what the problem is? What once made you safe

139
0:07:47.808,000 --> 0:07:48,000
now drives you insane.

140
0:07:49.614,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.

141
0:07:52.768,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Your pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)

142
0:07:58.632,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Applause)

143
0:08:01.528,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)

144
0:08:06.683,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Completely and utterly -- so, screwed.

145
0:08:08.958,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff,

146
0:08:11.417,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going

147
0:08:13.755,000 --> 0:08:15,000

2
0:00:13.046,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(In Maori: My mountain is Taupiri.)

3
0:00:15.744,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Waikato is my river.)

4
0:00:18.048,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(My name is Marilyn.)

5
0:00:20.643,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Hello.)

6
0:00:22.728,000 --> 0:00:24,000
As you've heard, when I was very young,

7
0:00:25.594,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was elected to the New Zealand Parliament.

8
0:00:30.496,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And at that age, you learn mostly by listening to others' stories.

9
0:00:37.29,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I remember a woman who'd been injured in a farm accident,

10
0:00:42.783,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and it was coming up to shearing time

11
0:00:45.521,000 --> 0:00:46,000
on the farm,

12
0:00:47.639,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and she had to be replaced by a shepherd,

13
0:00:51.071,000 --> 0:00:54,000
by a rousie in the woolshed,

14
0:00:54.152,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and of course there was still someone needed to manage the household

15
0:00:59.473,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and to prepare the food for the shearing gangs.

16
0:01:03.307,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And her mother came to help with that.

17
0:01:08.909,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But the family got no compensation for the mother,

18
0:01:12.162,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because that's what mothers and family members are supposed to do.

19
0:01:18.468,000 --> 0:01:22,000
One year, a company called Gold Mines New Zealand

20
0:01:23.193,000 --> 0:01:28,000
applied for a prospecting license on our beautiful Mt. Pirongia.

21
0:01:30.5,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It is a mountain

22
0:01:32.841,000 --> 0:01:37,000
full of extraordinary ecosystems,

23
0:01:38.43,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of verdant, virgin native forests.

24
0:01:44.144,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It produced oxygen, it was a carbon sink,

25
0:01:47.405,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it was a home for endangered species and for pollinating species

26
0:01:52.034,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in the farmland around.

27
0:01:55.176,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the mining company put up this great economic prospectus

28
0:02:00.717,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that was about how much money could be made

29
0:02:06.009,000 --> 0:02:09,000
from mining our mountain,

30
0:02:09.087,000 --> 0:02:12,000
about all the growth and development

31
0:02:12.814,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that would show in New Zealand's budgetary forecasts,

32
0:02:17.969,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and we were just left with the language

33
0:02:21.295,000 --> 0:02:24,000
of all that we valued about our mountain.

34
0:02:26.333,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Fortunately, we stopped.

35
0:02:31.092,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And then I remembered

36
0:02:33.486,000 --> 0:02:36,000
a woman who had three children under five

37
0:02:38.028,000 --> 0:02:4,000
who was caring for her elderly parents,

38
0:02:41.812,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and nobody seemed to think that at some stage

39
0:02:45.511,000 --> 0:02:5,000
she might actually need some assistance with childcare,

40
0:02:50.68,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because she wasn't in the paid workforce.

41
0:02:54.803,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And there began to be a pattern in all of these stories I was being told.

42
0:03:00.916,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And I started to ask enough questions

43
0:03:03.119,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to try and track to the core of this pattern of values

44
0:03:09.612,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that was part of all of these stories.

45
0:03:14.619,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I found it

46
0:03:17.036,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in an economic formula called the "gross domestic product,"

47
0:03:23.01,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or the GDP.

48
0:03:25.395,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Most of you will have heard of it.

49
0:03:27.695,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Many of you won't have any idea what it actually means.

50
0:03:33.784,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The rules were drawn up by Western-educated men in 1953.

51
0:03:41.548,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They established a boundary of production

52
0:03:47.099,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in drawing up these rules.

53
0:03:48.928,000 --> 0:03:49,000
What they were keen to measure

54
0:03:50.766,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was everything that involved a market transaction.

55
0:03:55.076,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So on one side of the boundary,

56
0:03:57.749,000 --> 0:04:,000
everything where there was a market exchange was counted.

57
0:04:01.678,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It doesn't matter whether the exchange is legal or illegal.

58
0:04:06.063,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Market exchange in the illegal trade in armaments, [munitions],

59
0:04:10.952,000 --> 0:04:12,000
drugs, endangered species,

60
0:04:13.653,000 --> 0:04:15,000
trafficking of people --

61
0:04:15.897,000 --> 0:04:17,000
all of this is great for growth

62
0:04:18.732,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and it all counts.

63
0:04:21.102,000 --> 0:04:24,000
On the other side of the boundary of production,

64
0:04:24.813,000 --> 0:04:27,000
there was this extraordinary phrase in the rules

65
0:04:30.244,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that the work done by the people they called "nonprimary producers"

66
0:04:36.703,000 --> 0:04:39,000
was "of little or no value."

67
0:04:41.287,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So I thought, let's see how many nonprimary producers we have here today.

68
0:04:46.489,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So in the last week or so,

69
0:04:49.313,000 --> 0:04:54,000
how many of you have transported members of your household or their goods

70
0:04:54.445,000 --> 0:04:55,000
without payment?

71
0:04:57.021,000 --> 0:05:,000
How many of you have done a bit of cleaning, a bit of vacuuming,

72
0:05:00.501,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a bit of sweeping, a bit of tidying up the kitchen?

73
0:05:04.281,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Yeah?

74
0:05:05.531,000 --> 0:05:08,000
How about going shopping for members of the household?

75
0:05:10.004,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Preparing food? Cleaning up afterwards?

76
0:05:13.747,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Laundry? Ironing?

77
0:05:17.917,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

78
0:05:21.661,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Well, as far as economics is concerned,

79
0:05:26.49,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you were at leisure.

80
0:05:28.164,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

81
0:05:31.27,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause and cheers)

82
0:05:38.101,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Now, how about the women

83
0:05:40.657,000 --> 0:05:43,000
who have been pregnant and who have had children?

84
0:05:44.838,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Yes.

85
0:05:46.696,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, I really hate to tell you this,

86
0:05:49.209,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because it might well have been hard labor,

87
0:05:52.201,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but at that moment, you were unproductive.

88
0:05:54.771,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:58.454,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And some of you may have breastfed your infant.

90
0:06:03.153,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, in the New Zealand national accounts --

91
0:06:07.51,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that's what the figures are called, that's where we get the GDP --

92
0:06:12.367,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in the New Zealand national accounts,

93
0:06:14.82,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the milk of buffalo, goats, sheep and cows

94
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is of value

95
0:06:19.06,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but not human breast milk.

96
0:06:21.238,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

97
0:06:23.506,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It is the very best food on the planet.

98
0:06:26.94,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It is the very best investment that we can make in the future health

99
0:06:30.991,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and education of that child.

100
0:06:33.486,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It doesn't count at all.

101
0:06:35.918,000 --> 0:06:4,000
All of those activities are on the wrong side of the production boundary.

102
0:06:42.136,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And something that's very important to know

103
0:06:45.055,000 --> 0:06:47,000
about this accounting framework:

104
0:06:47.335,000 --> 0:06:48,000
they call it "accounts,"

105
0:06:48.927,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but there's no debit side.

106
0:06:52.278,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We just keep market exchanges going,

107
0:06:56.621,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and it's all good for growth.

108
0:06:58.523,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We're in Christchurch,

109
0:07:01.172,000 --> 0:07:07,000
where people have lived through a devastating natural disaster

110
0:07:07.591,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and recovered.

111
0:07:10.611,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And ever since that time,

112
0:07:13.517,000 --> 0:07:15,000
New Zealand has been told

113
0:07:16.524,000 --> 0:07:21,000
our growth figures are great, because we're rebuilding Christchurch.

114
0:07:23.028,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Nothing was ever lost

115
0:07:25.065,000 --> 0:07:28,000
from the national accounting framework

116
0:07:28.434,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because of the loss of lives,

117
0:07:30.156,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the loss of land,

118
0:07:32.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the loss of buildings,

119
0:07:33.783,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the loss of special spaces.

120
0:07:37.155,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, it might also be becoming obvious to you

121
0:07:41.217,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that this boundary of production works in terms of our environment.

122
0:07:47.307,000 --> 0:07:48,000
When we're mining it,

123
0:07:49.31,000 --> 0:07:51,000
when we're deforesting,

124
0:07:51.451,000 --> 0:07:54,000
when we're deleting our environment,

125
0:07:55.278,000 --> 0:07:59,000
when we're fishing out our marine resources,

126
0:07:59.782,000 --> 0:08:01,000
legal or illegal,

127
0:08:01.85,000 --> 0:08:04,000
as long as market is exchanged, it's all good for growth.

128
0:08:05.821,000 --> 0:08:08,000
To leave our natural environment alone,

129
0:08:09.049,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to sustain it, to protect it,

130
0:08:12.231,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is apparently worth nothing.

131
0:08:18.009,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now, how and what can we do about this?

132
0:08:22.854,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Well, I wrote first about it 30 years ago.

133
0:08:26.387,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Then in 2008, after the global financial crisis,

134
0:08:30.397,000 --> 0:08:31,000
President Sarkozy of France

135
0:08:32.314,000 --> 0:08:36,000
asked three men who had all won Nobel Prizes in Economics --

136
0:08:36.721,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Sen, Fitoussi and Stiglitz --

137
0:08:39.699,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to discover what I'd written about

138
0:08:41.645,000 --> 0:08:42,000
30 years ago.

139
0:08:43.156,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

140
0:08:44.642,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Applause)

141
0:08:53.143,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"Relying on per capita GDP, relying on these growth figures," they said,

142
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"doesn't appear to be the best way to proceed

143
0:09:01.994,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to make public policy."

144
0:09:04.073,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And I totally agree with them.

145
0:09:06.358,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

146
0:09:10.666,000 --> 0:09:13,000
One of the things that you notice about these rules --

147
0:09:13.92,000 --> 0:09:19,000
they are revised; 1968 they were revised, 1993, 2008 --

148
0:09:21.644,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is that the revisions are mostly done by statisticians,

149
0:09:24.646,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and the statisticians do know what is wrong with the data,

150
0:09:29.347,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but hardly any of the economists ever stop to ask that same question.

151
0:09:34.686,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, in 2019,

152
0:09:38.384,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the GDP is in even worse shape.

153
0:09:42.279,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You see, to measure GDP,

154
0:09:44.325,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you have to assume that some kind of production

155
0:09:47.665,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or service delivery or consumption

156
0:09:50.884,000 --> 0:09:52,000
occurs inside a nation-state,

157
0:09:53.413,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and you know where that is.

158
0:09:56.616,000 --> 0:10:,000
But trillions of dollars are circling the globe

159
0:10:02.392,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in mini-part from our Googles, our Facebooks, our Twitters,

160
0:10:08.721,000 --> 0:10:12,000
siphoned through a number of tax shelters,

161
0:10:13.409,000 --> 0:10:15,000
so that when we click on our computer

162
0:10:15.812,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and go to download some software,

163
0:10:18.689,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we don't know where it was produced,

164
0:10:21.179,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and frankly, no one knows where we are as we're consuming it, either.

165
0:10:27.737,000 --> 0:10:29,000
These tax-free havens

166
0:10:30.587,000 --> 0:10:33,000
distort the GDP to such an extent

167
0:10:34.542,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that about three years ago,

168
0:10:36.717,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Europe looked askance at Ireland

169
0:10:39.451,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and said, "We don't think you're reporting correctly,"

170
0:10:42.463,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and in the next year, their GDP went up 35 percent.

171
0:10:47.343,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now, all that work that you're doing

172
0:10:51.731,000 --> 0:10:54,000
when you were at leisure and unproductive,

173
0:10:55.069,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we can measure this,

174
0:10:56.932,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and we can measure this in time use surveys.

175
0:11:00.459,000 --> 0:11:02,000
When we look at the amount of time that's taken

176
0:11:03.43,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in the unpaid sector,

177
0:11:06.173,000 --> 0:11:1,000
what we find is that in almost every country where I've ever seen the data,

178
0:11:11.111,000 --> 0:11:14,000
it is the single largest sector of the nation's economy.

179
0:11:15.826,000 --> 0:11:17,000
In the last three years, for example,

180
0:11:18.617,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the UK statistician has declared

181
0:11:21.555,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that all of that unpaid work is the equivalent of all manufacturing

182
0:11:26.393,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and all retailing in the UK.

183
0:11:30.242,000 --> 0:11:31,000
In Australia,

184
0:11:31.5,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the single largest sector of Australia's economy is unpaid childcare,

185
0:11:38.312,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and the second-largest sector is all the rest of the unpaid work,

186
0:11:42.802,000 --> 0:11:46,000
before banking and insurance and financial intermediation services

187
0:11:47.754,000 --> 0:11:51,000
clock in at the largest part of the market sector.

188
0:11:52.195,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Just last year, the Premier of the Victoria state of Australia

189
0:11:56.849,000 --> 0:11:59,000
declared that half of that state's GDP

190
0:12:00.767,000 --> 0:12:03,000
was, in fact, the value of all the unpaid work.

191
0:12:04.631,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Now, as a policy maker,

192
0:12:06.156,000 --> 0:12:09,000
you cannot make good policy

193
0:12:09.858,000 --> 0:12:12,000
if the single largest sector of your nation's economy

194
0:12:13.299,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is not visible.

195
0:12:15.761,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You can't presume to know where the needs are.

196
0:12:21.003,000 --> 0:12:24,000
You can't locate time poverty.

197
0:12:25.454,000 --> 0:12:3,000
You can't address the most critical issues of need.

198
0:12:32.43,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So what can go in the place of GDP?

199
0:12:36.471,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Well, GDP has got many other problems, OK?

200
0:12:43.45,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We don't behave in a way that assists GDP.

201
0:12:47.416,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Large numbers of people around the planet

202
0:12:49.497,000 --> 0:12:53,000
are now using household assets -- their cars, their homes, themselves --

203
0:12:54.445,000 --> 0:12:56,000
for Uber, for Airbnb.

204
0:12:56.969,000 --> 0:13:,000
And no, we're not supposed to use assets from the unpaid sector

205
0:13:01.409,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to make money in the market sector.

206
0:13:03.842,000 --> 0:13:04,000
This is confusing!

207
0:13:05.707,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Laughter)

208
0:13:08.311,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And very difficult to measure.

209
0:13:12.399,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So economists don't want to know

210
0:13:15.271,000 --> 0:13:18,000
what's wrong with their most important GDP,

211
0:13:18.991,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and I think they've got so many problems, they can just move off to a quiet corner

212
0:13:23.796,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and continue to publish that

213
0:13:25.752,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and not come anywhere near the rest of us

214
0:13:28.62,000 --> 0:13:3,000
with this talk of capitals

215
0:13:31.192,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and natural assets

216
0:13:34.072,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and other ways in which to colonize the rest of our lives.

217
0:13:39.291,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I think time use is the most important indicator going forward.

218
0:13:43.086,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Every one of us has exactly the same amount of it.

219
0:13:47.078,000 --> 0:13:52,000
If there are going to be critical issues as we move forward,

220
0:13:52.922,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we need a solid database,

221
0:13:56.343,000 --> 0:14:,000
because whatever we change away from the GDP,

222
0:14:00.64,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we're going to be stuck with it for about 50 years,

223
0:14:03.41,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and we need something that's solid and immutable

224
0:14:06.59,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and that everybody understands,

225
0:14:08.647,000 --> 0:14:1,000
because if I put time use data in front of you,

226
0:14:11.612,000 --> 0:14:13,000
you'll immediately start nodding.

227
0:14:14.201,000 --> 0:14:17,000
You'll immediately start recognizing what it means.

228
0:14:18.164,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And, honestly,

229
0:14:19.668,000 --> 0:14:22,000
if I put the GDP data in front of you,

230
0:14:23.154,000 --> 0:14:26,000
a lot of you would prefer to leave for morning tea.

231
0:14:27.128,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Laughter)

232
0:14:29.233,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We also need to be looking at the quality of our environment.

233
0:14:36.76,000 --> 0:14:39,000
As every year goes past, we get much better

234
0:14:40.781,000 --> 0:14:43,000
at measuring the devastation of it,

235
0:14:43.971,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of measuring how little we protect anymore.

236
0:14:48.687,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And yet, with climate change,

237
0:14:50.996,000 --> 0:14:55,000
we don't all have to be scientists to see, to feel, to know

238
0:14:56.648,000 --> 0:14:58,000
what is happening to our beautiful planet.

239
0:15:00.616,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We need, in this country,

240
0:15:03.882,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the paramountcy of what we can learn from kaitiakitanga,

241
0:15:08.794,000 --> 0:15:09,000
from whanaungatanaga,

242
0:15:10.628,000 --> 0:15:14,000
from what Maori, who have been here for centuries, can teach us.

243
0:15:17.651,000 --> 0:15:19,000
When you're in parliament,

244
0:15:21.333,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and you're not in an economist's frame of mind,

245
0:15:25.246,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you make decisions across a range of data.

246
0:15:29.806,000 --> 0:15:3,000
You look at the trade-offs.

247
0:15:32.009,000 --> 0:15:34,000
You think deeply about implications

248
0:15:34.97,000 --> 0:15:39,000
way beyond whether or not GDP is up or down.

249
0:15:41.761,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Economists want to turn everything into a monetary exchange,

250
0:15:47.989,000 --> 0:15:49,000
even time use data,

251
0:15:50.389,000 --> 0:15:53,000
so that they can carry on trying to decide

252
0:15:54.215,000 --> 0:15:57,000
whether GDP is up or down.

253
0:15:58.602,000 --> 0:15:59,000
That's not a great way to go.

254
0:16:00.853,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And others have said to me,

255
0:16:02.207,000 --> 0:16:04,000
"Marilyn, why don't you just work on a system

256
0:16:05.022,000 --> 0:16:07,000
that includes all the unpaid work

257
0:16:07.307,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and the pregnancy and the birth and the lactation

258
0:16:10.478,000 --> 0:16:11,000
in the GDP?"

259
0:16:14.187,000 --> 0:16:18,000
There's a very important moral and ethical answer to that,

260
0:16:19.551,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and it is that I do not want the most valuable things on earth,

261
0:16:24.496,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the things I treasure,

262
0:16:26.314,000 --> 0:16:3,000
sitting in an accounting framework that thinks that war is great for growth.

263
0:16:31.463,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Applause and cheers)

264
0:16:40.653,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So from now on,

265
0:16:41.914,000 --> 0:16:43,000
whenever you listen to the news,

266
0:16:44.088,000 --> 0:16:46,000
you're not going to go blank when they say GDP.

267
0:16:47.418,000 --> 0:16:48,000
You're going to think,

268
0:16:48.606,000 --> 0:16:5,000
"I know what they're talking about, and it's not good."

269
0:16:51.25,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Laughter)

270
0:16:54.114,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I know that there are alternatives,

271
0:16:57.396,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and I'm going to spend my time correcting people,

272
0:17:01.572,000 --> 0:17:04,000
talking to them about this value base

273
0:17:04.828,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and talking to them about what the alternatives can be,

274
0:17:09.034,000 --> 0:17:1,000
because humankind

275
0:17:10.844,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and our planet

276
0:17:12.384,000 --> 0:17:13,000
need another way.

277
0:17:14.505,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Thank you.

278
0:17:15.681,000 --> 0:17:17,000
(Applause and cheers)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
is one of the major threats against our fauna,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
especially birds,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and mainly to supply the pet market

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with thousands of animals taken from nature every month,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and transported far from their origins,

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It is estimated that

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
withdraw from nature

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
almost 38 million animals every year,

12
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a business worth almost two billion dollars.

13
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The police intercepts

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
these huge cargos with live animals,

15
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
intended to supply the pet market,

16
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses,

17
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and this is how we end up, every month,

18
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with thousands of seized animals.

19
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And for us to understand what happens with them,

20
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
we're going to follow Brad.

21
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In the eyes of many people,

22
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
after the animals are seized,

23
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
they say, "Yay, justice has been served.

24
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The good guys arrived,

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
took the cute, mistreated animals

26
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
from the hands of the evil traffickers,

27
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and everyone lived happily ever after."

28
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But did they? Actually, no,

29
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and this is where many of our problems begin.

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Because we have to figure out

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
what to do with all these animals.

32
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In Brazil, they are usually first sent

33
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to governmental triage facilities,

34
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in which most of the cases,

35
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the conditions are as bad as

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
with the traffickers.

37
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
In 2002, these centers received

38
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
45,000 animals,

39
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of which 37,000 were birds.

40
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the police estimates that we seize

41
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
only five percent of what's being trafficked.

42
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad --

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
go to serious rehabilitation centers after that.

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And in these places they are cared for.

45
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
They train their flying,

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature,

47
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and they are able to socialize

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
with others from the same species.

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But then what?

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The Brazil Ornithological Society --

52
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so now we're talking only birds --

53
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
claims that we have too little knowledge

54
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
about the species in nature.

55
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Therefore, it would be too risky

56
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to release these animals,

57
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
both for the released and for the natural populations.

58
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They also claim that we spend too many resources

59
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in their rehabilitation.

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Following this argument,

61
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
they suggest that all the birds

62
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
seized from non-threatened species

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
should be euthanized.

64
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
However, this would mean having killed

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
26,267 birds,

66
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
only in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006.

67
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But, some researchers, myself included --

68
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government --

69
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
believe there is an alternative.

70
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We think that if and when the animals meet

71
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
certain criteria concerning their health,

72
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
behavior, inferred origin

73
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and whatever we know about the natural populations,

74
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
then technically responsible releases are possible,

75
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
both for the well-being of the individual,

76
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems,

77
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because we will be returning genes for these populations --

78
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
which could be important for them

79
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in facing environmental challenges --

80
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and also we could be returning

81
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
potential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc.

82
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
All of these were released by us.

83
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom.

84
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
On the middle,

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release.

87
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And on the bottom, my personal favorite,

88
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the little male over there,

89
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
four hours after his release

90
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
he was together with a wild female.

91
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So, this is not new, people have been

92
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
doing this around the world.

93
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But it's still a big issue in Brazil.

94
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We believe we have performed

95
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
responsible releases.

96
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We've registered released animals mating in nature

97
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and having chicks.

98
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations.

99
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
However this is still a minority

100
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for the very lack of knowledge.

101
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So, I say, "Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue,

102
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
let's do whatever we can."

103
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'm devoting my career to that.

104
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I'm here to urge each and every one of you

105
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to do whatever is in your reach:

106
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Talk to your neighbor, teach your children,

107
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
make sure your pet is from a legal breeder.

108
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We need to act, and act now,

109
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
before these ones are the only ones left.

110
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Thank you very much.

111
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Applause)

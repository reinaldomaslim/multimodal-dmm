2
0:00:12.952,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi.

3
0:00:14.793,000 --> 0:00:16,000
You might have noticed that I have half a beard.

4
0:00:17.603,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's not because I lost a bet.

5
0:00:19.77,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Many years ago, I was badly burned.

6
0:00:22.747,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Most of my body is covered with scars,

7
0:00:24.834,000 --> 0:00:25,000
including the right side of my face.

8
0:00:26.706,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I just don't have hair. That's just how it happened.

9
0:00:29.498,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It looks symmetrical, but almost.

10
0:00:31.889,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Anyway, now that we discussed facial hair,

11
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
let's move to social science.

12
0:00:37.902,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And in particular, I want us to think about where is the potential for humanity

13
0:00:44.167,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and where we are now.

14
0:00:45.879,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And if you think about it, there's a big gap

15
0:00:47.981,000 --> 0:00:49,000
between where we think we could be and where we are,

16
0:00:50.527,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and it's in all kinds of areas.

17
0:00:52.672,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So let me ask you:

18
0:00:54.767,000 --> 0:00:58,000
How many of you in the last month have eaten more than you think you should?

19
0:00:58.842,000 --> 0:01:,000
Just kind of general. OK.

20
0:01:00.874,000 --> 0:01:04,000
How many of you in the last month have exercised less than you think you should?

21
0:01:05.36,000 --> 0:01:07,000
OK, and for how many of you has raising your hands twice

22
0:01:08.323,000 --> 0:01:09,000
been the most exercise you got today?

23
0:01:10.287,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:13.539,000 --> 0:01:16,000
How many of you have ever texted while driving?

25
0:01:18.2,000 --> 0:01:21,000
OK, we're getting honest. Let's test your honesty.

26
0:01:21.58,000 --> 0:01:23,000
How many people here in the last month

27
0:01:23.606,000 --> 0:01:25,000
have not always washed your hands when you left the bathroom?

28
0:01:26.516,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:28.178,000 --> 0:01:29,000
A little less honest.

30
0:01:29.376,000 --> 0:01:32,000
By the way, it's interesting how we're willing to admit texting and driving

31
0:01:33.027,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but not washing our hands, that's difficult.

32
0:01:35.1,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:37.389,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We can go on and on.

34
0:01:38.69,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The problem, the topic is that there's lots of things

35
0:01:41.477,000 --> 0:01:43,000
when we know what we could do --

36
0:01:43.545,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we could be very, very different, but we're acting in a very different way.

37
0:01:47.209,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And when we think how do we bridge that gap,

38
0:01:49.486,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the usual answer is, "Just tell people."

39
0:01:52.595,000 --> 0:01:55,000
For example, just tell people that texting and driving is dangerous.

40
0:01:55.827,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Did you know it's dangerous? You should stop doing it.

41
0:01:58.391,000 --> 0:02:,000
You tell people something is dangerous, and they will stop.

42
0:02:01.206,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Texting and driving is one example.

43
0:02:02.916,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Another very sad example is that in the US,

44
0:02:05.168,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we spend between seven and eight hundred million dollars a year

45
0:02:08.676,000 --> 0:02:1,000
on what's called "financial literacy."

46
0:02:11.237,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And what do we get as a consequence of that?

47
0:02:13.721,000 --> 0:02:17,000
There was recently a study that looked at all the research ever to be conducted

48
0:02:17.844,000 --> 0:02:19,000
on financial literacy -- what's called a meta-analysis.

49
0:02:20.662,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And what they found is that when you tell people,

50
0:02:23.498,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you teach them financial literacy,

51
0:02:25.436,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they learn and they remember.

52
0:02:27.847,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But do people execute? Not so much.

53
0:02:30.854,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The improvement is about three or four percent

54
0:02:33.127,000 --> 0:02:34,000
immediately after the course,

55
0:02:35.012,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and then it goes down.

56
0:02:36.702,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And at the end of the day,

57
0:02:38.433,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the improvement is about 0.1 percent --

58
0:02:42.116,000 --> 0:02:45,000
not zero, but as humanly close to zero as possible.

59
0:02:45.612,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:48.494,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So that's the sad news.

61
0:02:49.689,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The sad news is, giving information to people

62
0:02:52.266,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is just not a good recipe to change behavior.

63
0:02:55.024,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What is?

64
0:02:56.207,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, social science has made lots of strides,

65
0:02:59.084,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and the basic insight is that if we want to change behavior,

66
0:03:02.811,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we have to change the environment.

67
0:03:05.232,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The right way is not to change people, it's to change the environment.

68
0:03:08.645,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I want to present a very simpleminded model of how to think about it:

69
0:03:12.197,000 --> 0:03:14,000
it's to think about behavioral change

70
0:03:14.243,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in the same way that we think about sending a rocket to space.

71
0:03:17.762,000 --> 0:03:19,000
When we think about sending a rocket to space,

72
0:03:20.19,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we want to do two main things.

73
0:03:21.66,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The first one is to reduce friction.

74
0:03:24.141,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We want to take the rocket and have as little friction as possible

75
0:03:27.315,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so it's the most aerodynamic possible.

76
0:03:29.39,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And the second thing is we want to load as much fuel as possible,

77
0:03:32.937,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to give it the most amount of motivation, energy to do its task.

78
0:03:37.461,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And behavior change is the same thing.

79
0:03:39.851,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So let's first talk about friction.

80
0:03:43.345,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In this particular case study I'll tell you about,

81
0:03:46.299,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there's a pharmacy, an online pharmacy.

82
0:03:49.486,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Imagine you go to your doctor.

83
0:03:51.411,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You have a long-term illness,

84
0:03:53.077,000 --> 0:03:55,000
your doctor prescribes to you a medication,

85
0:03:55.938,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you sign up for this online pharmacy

86
0:03:58.256,000 --> 0:04:,000
and you get your medication in the mail every 90 days.

87
0:04:01.169,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Every 90 days, medication, medication, medication.

88
0:04:04.122,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And this online pharmacy wants to switch people

89
0:04:07.816,000 --> 0:04:09,000
from branded medication to generic medication.

90
0:04:11.176,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So they send people letters, and they say,

91
0:04:13.254,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"Please, please, please, switch to generics.

92
0:04:15.582,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You will save money, we will save money, your employer will save money."

93
0:04:19.033,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And what do people do?

94
0:04:20.657,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Nothing.

95
0:04:21.832,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So they try all kinds of things and nothing happens.

96
0:04:24.334,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So for one year, they give people an amazing offer.

97
0:04:27.45,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They send people a letter, and they say,

98
0:04:29.423,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"If you switch to generics now, it will be free for a whole year."

99
0:04:33.141,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Free for a whole year. Amazing!

100
0:04:35.179,000 --> 0:04:37,000
What percentage of people do you think switched?

101
0:04:39.067,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Less than 10 percent.

102
0:04:41.104,000 --> 0:04:43,000
At this point, they show up to my office.

103
0:04:43.366,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And they come to complain.

104
0:04:45.711,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Why did they pick me?

105
0:04:46.886,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I wrote a couple of papers on the "allure of free."

106
0:04:49.681,000 --> 0:04:52,000
In those papers, we showed that if you reduce the price of something

107
0:04:52.922,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for, let's say, 10 cents to one cent, nothing much happens.

108
0:04:55.976,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You reduce it from one cent to zero, now people get excited.

109
0:04:58.916,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:00.012,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And they said, "Look, we read these papers on 'free,' we gave 'free.'

111
0:05:03.317,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Not working as we expected.

112
0:05:04.649,000 --> 0:05:05,000
What's going on?"

113
0:05:06.314,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I said, "You know, maybe it's a question of friction."

114
0:05:09.558,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They said, "What do you mean?"

115
0:05:11.066,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I said, "People are starting with branded.

116
0:05:13.122,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They can do nothing and end with branded.

117
0:05:15.503,000 --> 0:05:18,000
To move to generic, they have to choose generic over branded,

118
0:05:19.194,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but they also have to do something.

119
0:05:21.083,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They have to return the letter."

120
0:05:22.72,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So this is what we call a "confounded design."

121
0:05:25.354,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Two things are happening at the same time.

122
0:05:27.402,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's branded versus generic,

123
0:05:29.113,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but it's doing nothing versus doing something.

124
0:05:32.206,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So I said, "Why don't we switch it?

125
0:05:34.417,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Why don't we send people a letter and say, 'We're switching you to generics.

126
0:05:38.048,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You don't need to do anything.

127
0:05:39.554,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If you want to stay with branded, please return the letter.'"

128
0:05:42.656,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:43.834,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Right?

130
0:05:45.49,000 --> 0:05:46,000
What do you think happened?

131
0:05:48.841,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Lawyers, lawyers happened.

132
0:05:50.413,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

133
0:05:56.017,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It turns out, this is illegal.

134
0:05:57.886,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:03.398,000 --> 0:06:05,000
By the way, for brainstorming and creativity,

136
0:06:06.37,000 --> 0:06:08,000
doing things that are illegal and immoral, it's fine,

137
0:06:08.948,000 --> 0:06:11,000
as long as it's just in the brainstorming phase.

138
0:06:12.422,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:13.796,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But this was the purity of the idea,

140
0:06:15.622,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because the initial design was the branded had the no-action benefit.

141
0:06:19.645,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In my illegal, immoral design, generic had the no-action benefit.

142
0:06:23.984,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But they agreed to give people a T-intersection:

143
0:06:26.876,000 --> 0:06:27,000
send people a letter and say,

144
0:06:28.294,000 --> 0:06:3,000
"If you don't return this letter,

145
0:06:30.341,000 --> 0:06:32,000
we will be forced to stop your medications.

146
0:06:33.083,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But when you return the letter, you could choose branded at this price,

147
0:06:36.87,000 --> 0:06:37,000
generic at this price."

148
0:06:38.906,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now people had to take an action.

149
0:06:40.846,000 --> 0:06:41,000
They were on even footing. Right?

150
0:06:42.545,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It wasn't that one had the no-action benefit.

151
0:06:44.94,000 --> 0:06:46,000
What percentage do you think switched?

152
0:06:48.278,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The vast majority switched.

153
0:06:50.208,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So what does it tell us?

154
0:06:51.425,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Do people like generics, or do we like branded?

155
0:06:54.434,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We hate returning letters.

156
0:06:56.054,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

157
0:06:58.037,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This is the story of friction: small things really matter.

158
0:07:02.964,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And friction is about taking the desired behavior

159
0:07:06.35,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and saying: Where do we have too much friction

160
0:07:08.721,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so it's slowing people down from acting on it?

161
0:07:11.318,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And every time you see that the desired behavior

162
0:07:13.634,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the easy behavior are not aligned,

163
0:07:15.52,000 --> 0:07:17,000
it means we want to try and realign them.

164
0:07:18.509,000 --> 0:07:2,000
That's the first part. We talked about friction.

165
0:07:20.841,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Now let's talk about motivation.

166
0:07:22.878,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In this particular study,

167
0:07:24.102,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we were trying to get very poor people in a slum called Kibera in Kenya

168
0:07:28.464,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to save a little bit of money for a rainy day.

169
0:07:31.156,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You know, if you're very, very poor, you have no extra money,

170
0:07:34.097,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you live hand to mouth,

171
0:07:35.345,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and from time to time, bad things happen.

172
0:07:37.686,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And when something bad happens, you have nothing to draw on, you borrow.

173
0:07:42.061,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The Kibera people can borrow at sometimes up to 10 percent interest a week.

174
0:07:48.458,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And then, of course, it's really hard to get out of it.

175
0:07:51.091,000 --> 0:07:53,000
You live hand to mouth, something bad happens,

176
0:07:53.288,000 --> 0:07:55,000
you borrow, things get worse and worse and worse.

177
0:07:56.078,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So we wanted people to keep a little bit of money for a rainy day.

178
0:08:00.141,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And we thought about what is the motivation,

179
0:08:02.731,000 --> 0:08:04,000
what is the fuel that we need to add?

180
0:08:05.074,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And we tried all kinds of things.

181
0:08:07.373,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Some people, we texted them once a week and said,

182
0:08:09.995,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Please try to save 100 shillings" -- about a dollar -- "this week."

183
0:08:14.571,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Some people, we sent a text message as if it came from their kids.

184
0:08:19.317,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So it said, "Hi Mom, hi Dad, this is little Joey" --

185
0:08:22.748,000 --> 0:08:23,000
whatever the name of the kid was --

186
0:08:24.539,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"Try and save 100 shillings this week for the future of our family."

187
0:08:28.508,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Right? I'm Jewish, a little bit of guilt always works.

188
0:08:32.112,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:33.586,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Some people got 10 percent.

190
0:08:35.453,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"Save up to a hundred shillings, we'll give you 10 percent."

191
0:08:38.326,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Some people got 20 percent.

192
0:08:40.035,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Some people got also 10 percent and 20 percent,

193
0:08:42.713,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but they got it with loss aversion.

194
0:08:45.01,000 --> 0:08:46,000
What is loss aversion?

195
0:08:46.365,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Loss aversion is the idea that we hate losing

196
0:08:48.984,000 --> 0:08:49,000
more than we enjoy gaining.

197
0:08:50.744,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, think about somebody who is in a 10-percent condition

198
0:08:53.495,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and they put 40 shillings in.

199
0:08:55.44,000 --> 0:08:57,000
They put 40 shillings, we give them four more,

200
0:08:57.651,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they say thank you very much.

201
0:08:59.127,000 --> 0:09:,000
That person gave up six.

202
0:09:00.881,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They could have gotten six more if they gave a hundred,

203
0:09:03.504,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but they don't see it.

204
0:09:05.112,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So we created what we call pre-match.

205
0:09:07.563,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We put the 10 shillings in at the beginning of the week.

206
0:09:10.252,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We said, "It's waiting for you!"

207
0:09:11.826,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And then if somebody puts 40 in, we say, "Oh, you put 40 in,

208
0:09:14.816,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we're leaving four, and we're taking six back."

209
0:09:17.431,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So in both cases, pre-match or post-match,

210
0:09:20.458,000 --> 0:09:21,000
people get 10 percent.

211
0:09:22.18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But in the pre-match,

212
0:09:23.648,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they see the money they did not match leaving their account.

213
0:09:27.85,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So we have text, text from kids, 10 percent, 20 percent,

214
0:09:30.796,000 --> 0:09:31,000
pre-match, post-match.

215
0:09:32.407,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And we had one more condition.

216
0:09:34.398,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It was a coin about this size,

217
0:09:36.792,000 --> 0:09:38,000
with 24 numbers written on it.

218
0:09:39.472,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And we asked them to put the coin somewhere in their hut,

219
0:09:42.959,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and every week, take a knife and scratch the number for that week --

220
0:09:46.284,000 --> 0:09:48,000
week one, two, three, four --

221
0:09:48.412,000 --> 0:09:5,000
scratch it like a minus if they didn't save

222
0:09:50.935,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and scratch it up and down if they saved.

223
0:09:53.788,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now, think to yourself:

224
0:09:55.076,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Which one of those methods do you think worked the best?

225
0:09:58.42,000 --> 0:10:,000
Text, text from the kids, 10 percent, 20 percent,

226
0:10:00.815,000 --> 0:10:02,000
beginning of the week, end of the week, and the coin?

227
0:10:03.399,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I'll tell you what the average people think.

228
0:10:05.528,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We've done these studies of prediction,

229
0:10:07.539,000 --> 0:10:09,000
both in the US and in Kenya.

230
0:10:09.657,000 --> 0:10:11,000
People think that 20 percent will get a lot of action,

231
0:10:12.625,000 --> 0:10:13,000
10 percent less,

232
0:10:13.891,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the rest of it will do nothing --

233
0:10:15.751,000 --> 0:10:17,000
kids, coin, doesn't matter.

234
0:10:19.048,000 --> 0:10:21,000
People think loss aversion will have a small effect.

235
0:10:22.677,000 --> 0:10:23,000
What actually happened?

236
0:10:24.861,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Sending a text reminder once a week

237
0:10:27.057,000 --> 0:10:28,000
helps a lot.

238
0:10:28.848,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Good news!

239
0:10:30.03,000 --> 0:10:33,000
This program lasted six months. People forget. Reminding people is great.

240
0:10:34.088,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Ten percent at the end of the week helped some more.

241
0:10:37.057,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Financial incentives work.

242
0:10:39.033,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Twenty percent at the end of the week -- just like 10 percent, no difference.

243
0:10:43.625,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Ten percent in the beginning of the week

244
0:10:45.606,000 --> 0:10:46,000
helps some more.

245
0:10:46.787,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Loss aversion works.

246
0:10:48.009,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Twenty percent in the beginning of the week,

247
0:10:50.104,000 --> 0:10:53,000
just like 10 percent in the beginning of the week, no difference.

248
0:10:53.203,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the text message from the kids was just as effective

249
0:10:56.205,000 --> 0:10:59,000
as 20 percent plus loss aversion --

250
0:10:59.443,000 --> 0:11:,000
which is amazing, right?

251
0:11:01.125,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's amazing how motivating messages from kids were.

252
0:11:04.477,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And one conclusion is we don't use kids enough.

253
0:11:07.851,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:09.923,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And, of course, I don't mean in a child labor sense.

255
0:11:16.065,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But if you think about parents and their kids,

256
0:11:18.463,000 --> 0:11:2,000
we are the best that we can for our kids,

257
0:11:21.106,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and we think about the future,

258
0:11:22.621,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and I think we should think

259
0:11:24.125,000 --> 0:11:27,000
about how to use that amazing source of motivation

260
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to get parents to behave in a better way.

261
0:11:30.847,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But the big surprise of this study was the coin.

262
0:11:33.698,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The coin basically doubled savings compared to everything else.

263
0:11:37.727,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And now the question is: Why? What was it about the coin?

264
0:11:41.046,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So I'll tell you how I started thinking about the coin,

265
0:11:43.726,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and then we'll come back to it.

266
0:11:45.254,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So you know, when I do research on, let's say, buying coffee,

267
0:11:48.254,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I don't need to go anywhere. I can sit in my office.

268
0:11:50.73,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I've bought enough coffee. I know how it works.

269
0:11:52.967,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The details, I'm familiar with.

270
0:11:54.927,000 --> 0:11:57,000
When you do research in some of the poorest places in the world,

271
0:11:58.058,000 --> 0:12:,000
you have to go and visit and see what's going on

272
0:12:00.361,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and get some insight about how the system works.

273
0:12:03.589,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And on that particular day,

274
0:12:04.98,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'm in a place called Soweto in South Africa,

275
0:12:07.529,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and I'm sitting in a place that sells funeral insurance.

276
0:12:11.99,000 --> 0:12:14,000
You know, in the US people spend crazy amounts of money on weddings?

277
0:12:15.902,000 --> 0:12:17,000
In South Africa, it's funerals.

278
0:12:18.365,000 --> 0:12:22,000
People spend up to a year or two years of income on funerals.

279
0:12:23.912,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And I sit in this place --

280
0:12:26.734,000 --> 0:12:3,000
by the way, before you judge the South Africans as being irrational with this,

281
0:12:31.73,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I just want to remind you

282
0:12:32.954,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that spending a lot of money on funerals compared to weddings,

283
0:12:36.282,000 --> 0:12:38,000
at least you know for sure you only have one.

284
0:12:38.813,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

285
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:53,000
OK, so I sit in this place that sells funeral insurance.

286
0:12:53.069,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And this guy comes in with his son -- his son is about 12 --

287
0:12:57.064,000 --> 0:13:,000
and he buys funeral insurance for a week.

288
0:13:00.821,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It will cover 90 percent of his funeral expense

289
0:13:03.475,000 --> 0:13:05,000
only if he dies in the next seven days.

290
0:13:06.353,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Right? These are very poor people, they buy small amounts of insurance

291
0:13:09.682,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and small amount of soap and such.

292
0:13:11.367,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And he gets that certificate,

293
0:13:13.194,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and in a very ceremonious way, he gives it to his son.

294
0:13:16.456,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And as he gives it to his son, I think to myself, why the ceremony?

295
0:13:19.729,000 --> 0:13:2,000
What is this father doing?

296
0:13:21.281,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Now, think about the breadwinner that decides on that particular day

297
0:13:25.34,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to direct some money into insurance or savings.

298
0:13:28.587,000 --> 0:13:3,000
What is the family going to see tonight?

299
0:13:31.939,000 --> 0:13:32,000
They're going to see less.

300
0:13:33.533,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Right? At that level of poverty, there'll be less food, less kerosene, less water --

301
0:13:37.615,000 --> 0:13:38,000
something less tonight.

302
0:13:39.494,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And what his father was doing and what our coin was trying to do

303
0:13:42.781,000 --> 0:13:44,000
is to say, yes, there's less food on the table,

304
0:13:45.373,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but there's another activity.

305
0:13:47.728,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You see, what happened is, there are many good, important economic activities,

306
0:13:51.542,000 --> 0:13:53,000
like savings and insurance, that are invisible.

307
0:13:54.62,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And now the question is: How do we make them visible?

308
0:13:58.105,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So let's go back to our rocket model.

309
0:14:02.373,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We have to, first of all, look at the system

310
0:14:04.671,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and see where there's little things we can fix, with friction,

311
0:14:08.394,000 --> 0:14:1,000
where is there that we can remove friction?

312
0:14:10.774,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And then the next thing we want to do is to think broadly about the system,

313
0:14:14.65,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and say: What other motivations can we bring in?

314
0:14:18.057,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And that's a much more difficult exercise,

315
0:14:20.103,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and we don't always know what would work best.

316
0:14:22.649,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Is it going to be money? Is it going to be loss aversion?

317
0:14:25.365,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Is it going to be something that is visible?

318
0:14:27.468,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We don't know, and we have to try different things.

319
0:14:30.118,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We also have to realize that our intuition sometimes misleads us.

320
0:14:33.208,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We don't always necessarily know what would work the best.

321
0:14:37.099,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So if we think about this gap

322
0:14:39.001,000 --> 0:14:41,000
between where we could be and where we are,

323
0:14:41.209,000 --> 0:14:44,000
it's a really sad thing to see this gap and to think about it.

324
0:14:44.962,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But the good news is, there's lots we can do.

325
0:14:47.904,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Some of the changes are easy, some of the changes are more complex.

326
0:14:51.159,000 --> 0:14:53,000
But if we'll attack each problem directly,

327
0:14:53.84,000 --> 0:14:56,000
not by just providing more information to people

328
0:14:57.336,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but trying to change the friction,

329
0:14:59.099,000 --> 0:15:,000
add motivation,

330
0:15:00.393,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I think we can ...

331
0:15:01.714,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Can we close the gap? No.

332
0:15:03.594,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But can we get much better? Absolutely, yes.

333
0:15:06.628,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Thank you very much.

334
0:15:07.868,000 --> 0:15:1,000

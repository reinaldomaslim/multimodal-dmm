1
0:00:25.626,000 --> 0:00:29,000
About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development

2
0:00:30.005,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to Swedish undergraduate students.

3
0:00:32.175,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That was after having spent about 20 years,

4
0:00:35.08,000 --> 0:00:36,000
together with African institutions,

5
0:00:36.981,000 --> 0:00:37,000
studying hunger in Africa.

6
0:00:38.603,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world.

7
0:00:42.625,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute,

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
an undergraduate course called Global Health.

9
0:00:49.554,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous.

10
0:00:52.4,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade

11
0:00:55.758,000 --> 0:00:57,000
you can get in the Swedish college system,

12
0:00:57.805,000 --> 0:01:,000
so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about.

13
0:01:01.194,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So I did a pretest when they came.

14
0:01:03.215,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one:

15
0:01:06.732,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?"

16
0:01:11.89,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I put them together so that in each pair of countries,

17
0:01:14.984,000 --> 0:01:17,000
one has twice the child mortality of the other.

18
0:01:18.453,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And this means that it's much bigger, the difference,

19
0:01:22.722,000 --> 0:01:23,000
than the uncertainty of the data.

20
0:01:24.548,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey,

21
0:01:26.883,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.

22
0:01:31.234,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And these were the results of the Swedish students.

23
0:01:33.68,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow.

24
0:01:36.874,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8 right answer out of five possible.

25
0:01:40.883,000 --> 0:01:43,000
That means there was a place for a professor of international health

26
0:01:44.118,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and for my course.

27
0:01:45.308,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:46.365,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But one late night, when I was compiling the report,

29
0:01:50.428,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I really realized my discovery.

30
0:01:53.018,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I have shown that Swedish top students know, statistically,

31
0:01:57.967,000 --> 0:02:,000
significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.

32
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Because the chimpanzee would score half right

34
0:02:06.483,000 --> 0:02:08,000
if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey.

35
0:02:09.137,000 --> 0:02:12,000
They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there.

36
0:02:12.583,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.

37
0:02:16.822,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I did also an unethical study

38
0:02:19.583,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of the professors of the Karolinska Institute,

39
0:02:22.134,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine,

40
0:02:24.699,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.

41
0:02:27.019,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:29.478,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate,

43
0:02:33.685,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because the data of what's happening in the world

44
0:02:36.613,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the child health of every country

45
0:02:38.598,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is very well aware.

46
0:02:39.959,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So we did this software, which displays it like this.

47
0:02:42.75,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Every bubble here is a country.

48
0:02:44.732,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This country over here is China.

49
0:02:49.745,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This is India.

50
0:02:50.932,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The size of the bubble is the population,

51
0:02:53.203,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and on this axis here, I put fertility rate.

52
0:02:56.783,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Because my students, what they said

53
0:02:59.25,000 --> 0:03:01,000
when they looked upon the world, and I asked them,

54
0:03:01.833,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"What do you really think about the world?"

55
0:03:04.58,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.

56
0:03:07.873,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:08.942,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And they said, "The world is still 'we' and 'them.'

58
0:03:11.481,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And 'we' is the Western world and 'them' is the Third World."

59
0:03:15.381,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"And what do you mean with 'Western world?'" I said.

60
0:03:17.915,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"Well, that's long life and small family.

61
0:03:19.916,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And 'Third World' is short life and large family."

62
0:03:23.058,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So this is what I could display here.

63
0:03:25.467,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I put fertility rate here --

64
0:03:27.148,000 --> 0:03:3,000
number of children per woman: one, two, three, four,

65
0:03:30.31,000 --> 0:03:32,000
up to about eight children per woman.

66
0:03:32.365,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about,

67
0:03:36.369,000 --> 0:03:38,000
on the size of families in all countries.

68
0:03:38.426,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The error margin is narrow.

69
0:03:39.825,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Here, I put life expectancy at birth,

70
0:03:41.857,000 --> 0:03:44,000
from 30 years in some countries, up to about 70 years.

71
0:03:45.348,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And in 1962, there was really a group of countries here

72
0:03:48.775,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that were industrialized countries,

73
0:03:50.656,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and they had small families and long lives.

74
0:03:53.774,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And these were the developing countries.

75
0:03:55.898,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They had large families and they had relatively short lives.

76
0:03:58.963,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change.

77
0:04:02.668,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Are the students right? It's still two types of countries?

78
0:04:05.629,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here?

79
0:04:09.389,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Or have they got longer lives and live up there?

80
0:04:11.711,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Let's see. We stopped the world then.

81
0:04:13.576,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This is all UN statistics that have been available.

82
0:04:16.086,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Here we go. Can you see there?

83
0:04:17.611,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there.

84
0:04:20.922,000 --> 0:04:23,000
All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families.

85
0:04:24.591,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries,

86
0:04:27.037,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and they get longer life, but not larger families.

87
0:04:30.962,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The Africans are the green here. They still remain here.

88
0:04:33.608,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.

89
0:04:36.273,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries.

90
0:04:40.403,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s --

91
0:04:43.655,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the imams start to promote family planning,

92
0:04:46.092,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they move up into that corner.

93
0:04:47.863,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic

94
0:04:51.185,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries.

95
0:04:54.718,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the rest of them all move up into the corner,

96
0:04:58.39,000 --> 0:05:,000
where we have long lives and small family,

97
0:05:00.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we have a completely new world.

98
0:05:02.938,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

99
0:05:13.561,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause ends)

100
0:05:15.567,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Let me make a comparison directly

101
0:05:17.404,000 --> 0:05:2,000
between the United States of America and Vietnam.

102
0:05:20.442,000 --> 0:05:21,000
1964:

103
0:05:22.538,000 --> 0:05:24,000
America had small families and long life;

104
0:05:25.173,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Vietnam had large families and short lives.

105
0:05:28.546,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And this is what happens.

106
0:05:29.853,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The data during the war indicate that even with all the death,

107
0:05:35.218,000 --> 0:05:37,000
there was an improvement of life expectancy.

108
0:05:37.471,000 --> 0:05:39,000
By the end of the year, family planning started in Vietnam,

109
0:05:40.279,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and they went for smaller families.

110
0:05:41.997,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And the United States up there is getting longer life,

111
0:05:44.59,000 --> 0:05:45,000
keeping family size.

112
0:05:45.802,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning

113
0:05:49.431,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and they go for market economy,

114
0:05:50.962,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it moves faster even than social life.

115
0:05:52.996,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And today, we have in Vietnam

116
0:05:55.356,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the same life expectancy and the same family size

117
0:06:00.182,000 --> 0:06:02,000
here in Vietnam, 2003,

118
0:06:02.969,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war.

119
0:06:07.513,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I think we all, if we don't look at the data,

120
0:06:10.833,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia,

121
0:06:14.078,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which was in social change before we saw the economic change.

122
0:06:18.793,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So let's move over to another way here

123
0:06:21.184,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in which we could display the distribution in the world

124
0:06:25.695,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of income.

125
0:06:26.999,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This is the world distribution of income of people.

126
0:06:31.499,000 --> 0:06:34,000
One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.

127
0:06:36.071,000 --> 0:06:39,000
There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth.

128
0:06:39.507,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There's a little hump here.

129
0:06:42.195,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But there are people all the way.

130
0:06:43.859,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And if we look where the income ends up,

131
0:06:48.269,000 --> 0:06:52,000
this is 100 percent of the world's annual income.

132
0:06:52.488,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And the richest 20 percent,

133
0:06:54.977,000 --> 0:06:58,000
they take out of that about 74 percent.

134
0:06:59.12,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent.

135
0:07:04.06,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And this shows that the concept of developing countries

136
0:07:06.839,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is extremely doubtful.

137
0:07:08.43,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We think about aid,

138
0:07:10.335,000 --> 0:07:13,000
like these people here giving aid to these people here.

139
0:07:13.972,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But in the middle, we have most of the world population,

140
0:07:17.116,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and they have now 24 percent of the income.

141
0:07:19.749,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We heard it in other forms.

142
0:07:21.429,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And who are these?

143
0:07:24.154,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Where are the different countries?

144
0:07:26.398,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I can show you Africa.

145
0:07:27.968,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This is Africa.

146
0:07:30.078,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Ten percent of the world population,

147
0:07:31.865,000 --> 0:07:32,000
most in poverty.

148
0:07:33.055,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This is OECD -- the rich countries, the country club of the UN.

149
0:07:37.454,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.

150
0:07:42.894,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And this is Latin America.

151
0:07:44.266,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest

152
0:07:47.645,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in Latin America.

153
0:07:49.042,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And on top of that, we can put East Europe,

154
0:07:52.173,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.

155
0:07:55.372,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And what did it look like if we go back in time,

156
0:07:58.526,000 --> 0:08:,000
to about 1970?

157
0:08:00.643,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Then, there was more of a hump.

158
0:08:04.242,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians.

159
0:08:08.025,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia.

160
0:08:10.996,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And if I now let the world move forward,

161
0:08:14.138,000 --> 0:08:16,000
you will see that while population increases,

162
0:08:16.774,000 --> 0:08:19,000
there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty,

163
0:08:20.111,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and some others getting into poverty,

164
0:08:22.1,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and this is the pattern we have today.

165
0:08:24.025,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And the best projection from the World Bank

166
0:08:26.12,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is that this will happen,

167
0:08:28.058,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we will not have a divided world.

168
0:08:29.93,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We'll have most people in the middle.

169
0:08:31.849,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here,

170
0:08:33.9,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but our concept of economy is growth with percent.

171
0:08:37.321,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase.

172
0:08:42.63,000 --> 0:08:46,000
If I change this and take GDP per capita instead of family income,

173
0:08:47.478,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and I turn these individual data

174
0:08:51.273,000 --> 0:08:54,000
into regional data of gross domestic product,

175
0:08:54.573,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and I take the regions down here,

176
0:08:56.485,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the size of the bubble is still the population.

177
0:08:58.748,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,

178
0:09:01.97,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we take off the Arab states there,

179
0:09:04.235,000 --> 0:09:06,000
coming both from Africa and from Asia,

180
0:09:06.477,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we put them separately,

181
0:09:08.167,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here,

182
0:09:13.288,000 --> 0:09:16,000
by adding the social values there, child survival.

183
0:09:16.661,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now I have money on that axis,

184
0:09:18.413,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and I have the possibility of children to survive there.

185
0:09:21.18,000 --> 0:09:25,000
In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age;

186
0:09:25.461,000 --> 0:09:26,000
others, only 70.

187
0:09:27.21,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD,

188
0:09:30.502,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Latin America, East Europe, East Asia,

189
0:09:33.78,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

190
0:09:37.689,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.

191
0:09:42.621,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.

192
0:09:45.941,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Health is there and better health is up there.

193
0:09:50.889,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.

194
0:09:55.375,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And when it bursts,

195
0:09:56.601,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the size of each country bubble is the size of the population.

196
0:10:00.271,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Sierra Leone down there, Mauritius is up there.

197
0:10:02.835,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers,

198
0:10:06.515,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles,

199
0:10:10.064,000 --> 0:10:13,000
on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.

200
0:10:13.802,000 --> 0:10:15,000
There's a huge difference [within] Africa.

201
0:10:15.958,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And Ghana is here in the middle.

202
0:10:17.85,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.

203
0:10:20.466,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Here in Uganda, development aid.

204
0:10:23.8,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday.

205
0:10:27.119,000 --> 0:10:29,000
There's tremendous variation within Africa,

206
0:10:29.885,000 --> 0:10:32,000
which we very often make that it's equal everything.

207
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle.

208
0:10:37.263,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.

209
0:10:41.727,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I can split Arab states. How are they?

210
0:10:43.886,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference.

211
0:10:48.042,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Even between neighbors --

212
0:10:49.288,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Yemen, civil war;

213
0:10:50.557,000 --> 0:10:54,000
United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used.

214
0:10:54.747,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Not as the myth is.

215
0:10:56.553,000 --> 0:11:,000
And that includes all the children of the foreign workers

216
0:11:00.686,000 --> 0:11:01,000
who are in the country.

217
0:11:02.284,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad.

218
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here:

219
0:11:09.167,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Cambodia, Singapore.

220
0:11:10.553,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data.

221
0:11:13.548,000 --> 0:11:17,000
East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time,

222
0:11:18.219,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but they come out after 10 years very, very differently.

223
0:11:21.455,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And there is Latin America.

224
0:11:24.212,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba

225
0:11:25.882,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to find a healthy country in Latin America.

226
0:11:27.934,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now.

227
0:11:32.592,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.

228
0:11:35.671,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And we get the whole pattern here of the world,

229
0:11:39.487,000 --> 0:11:41,000
which is more or less like this.

230
0:11:41.662,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And if we look at it, how the world looks,

231
0:11:46.658,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in 1960, it starts to move.

232
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China.

233
0:11:52.656,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And then he died.

234
0:11:53.846,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China,

235
0:11:56.482,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and brought them into the mainstream again.

236
0:11:58.56,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this,

237
0:12:02.742,000 --> 0:12:07,000
so it's sort of difficult to get an example country

238
0:12:08.671,000 --> 0:12:1,000
which shows the pattern of the world.

239
0:12:10.84,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960.

240
0:12:18.083,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one,

241
0:12:25.098,000 --> 0:12:28,000
with Brazil, which is this one.

242
0:12:29.154,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The label went away for me here.

243
0:12:30.96,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there.

244
0:12:34.699,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I can run it forward, like this.

245
0:12:39.748,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement,

246
0:12:46.768,000 --> 0:12:48,000
whereas Brazil is much slower.

247
0:12:49.377,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this,

248
0:12:55.545,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you can see again

249
0:12:57.972,000 --> 0:13:,000
that the speed of development is very, very different,

250
0:13:01.328,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate

251
0:13:07.112,000 --> 0:13:08,000
as money and health,

252
0:13:08.563,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but it seems you can move much faster

253
0:13:10.516,000 --> 0:13:12,000
if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first.

254
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates.

255
0:13:18.182,000 --> 0:13:2,000
They came from here, a mineral country.

256
0:13:20.88,000 --> 0:13:22,000
They cached all the oil; they got all the money;

257
0:13:23.371,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but health cannot be bought at the supermarket.

258
0:13:26.516,000 --> 0:13:29,000
You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling.

259
0:13:29.687,000 --> 0:13:32,000
You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population.

260
0:13:32.901,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way.

261
0:13:35.281,000 --> 0:13:38,000
In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.

262
0:13:39.268,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world,

263
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
where all countries tend to use their money

264
0:13:45.551,000 --> 0:13:47,000
better than they used it in the past.

265
0:13:49.269,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries --

266
0:13:56.271,000 --> 0:13:57,000
they are like this.

267
0:13:57.489,000 --> 0:14:,000
That's dangerous, to use average data,

268
0:14:00.922,000 --> 0:14:03,000
because there is such a lot of difference within countries.

269
0:14:04.791,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So if I go and look here,

270
0:14:07.309,000 --> 0:14:13,000
we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960.

271
0:14:13.878,000 --> 0:14:16,000
If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda.

272
0:14:17.69,000 --> 0:14:18,000
These are the quintiles of Uganda.

273
0:14:19.702,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.

274
0:14:21.906,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The poorest are down there.

275
0:14:23.401,000 --> 0:14:25,000
If I split South Africa, it's like this.

276
0:14:26.256,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And if I go down and look at Niger,

277
0:14:29.289,000 --> 0:14:32,000
where there was such a terrible famine [recently],

278
0:14:32.806,000 --> 0:14:33,000
it's like this.

279
0:14:33.981,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here,

280
0:14:36.762,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there,

281
0:14:39.555,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and yet we tend to discuss what solutions there should be in Africa.

282
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Everything in this world exists in Africa.

283
0:14:46.591,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [treatment]

284
0:14:49.89,000 --> 0:14:5,000
for that quintile up here

285
0:14:51.833,000 --> 0:14:53,000
with the same strategy as down here.

286
0:14:54.482,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized,

287
0:14:58.212,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level.

288
0:15:01.889,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We must be much more detailed.

289
0:15:04.07,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We find that students get very excited when they can use this.

290
0:15:07.42,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors

291
0:15:11.062,000 --> 0:15:14,000
would like to see how the world is changing.

292
0:15:14.747,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Now, why doesn't this take place?

293
0:15:16.646,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Why are we not using the data we have?

294
0:15:18.973,000 --> 0:15:21,000
We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies

295
0:15:22.807,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and in universities and other nongovernmental organizations.

296
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Because the data is hidden down in the databases.

297
0:15:28.761,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And the public is there, and the internet is there,

298
0:15:31.315,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but we have still not used it effectively.

299
0:15:33.499,000 --> 0:15:35,000
All that information we saw changing in the world

300
0:15:36.198,000 --> 0:15:38,000
does not include publicly funded statistics.

301
0:15:39.163,000 --> 0:15:41,000
There are some web pages like this, you know,

302
0:15:41.558,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but they take some nourishment down from the databases,

303
0:15:46.285,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.

304
0:15:51.281,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Laughter)

305
0:15:52.413,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And this won't work.

306
0:15:53.859,000 --> 0:15:55,000
(Applause)

307
0:15:56.439,000 --> 0:15:58,000
So what is needed? We have the databases.

308
0:15:58.885,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It's not a new database that you need.

309
0:16:00.776,000 --> 0:16:03,000
We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here.

310
0:16:04.605,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So we started a nonprofit venture linking data to design,

311
0:16:10.759,000 --> 0:16:11,000
we called "Gapminder,"

312
0:16:11.939,000 --> 0:16:14,000
from the London Underground, where they warn you, "Mind the gap."

313
0:16:15.06,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.

314
0:16:17.043,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And we started to write software which could link the data like this.

315
0:16:21.248,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And it wasn't that difficult.

316
0:16:22.819,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It took some person years, and we have produced animations.

317
0:16:26.566,000 --> 0:16:28,000
You can take a data set and put it there.

318
0:16:28.823,000 --> 0:16:32,000
We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization.

319
0:16:33.323,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world.

320
0:16:37.625,000 --> 0:16:4,000
But what we really need is, of course, a search function,

321
0:16:40.894,000 --> 0:16:44,000
a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format

322
0:16:45.42,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and get it out in the world.

323
0:16:46.962,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And what do we hear when we go around?

324
0:16:49.151,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I've done anthropology on the main statistical units.

325
0:16:52.293,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Everyone says, "It's impossible. This can't be done.

326
0:16:55.326,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Our information is so peculiar in detail,

327
0:16:57.86,000 --> 0:17:,000
so that cannot be searched as others can be searched.

328
0:17:00.988,000 --> 0:17:02,000
We cannot give the data free to the students,

329
0:17:03.367,000 --> 0:17:05,000
free to the entrepreneurs of the world."

330
0:17:06.256,000 --> 0:17:08,000
But this is what we would like to see, isn't it?

331
0:17:09.175,000 --> 0:17:11,000
The publicly funded data is down here.

332
0:17:11.623,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And we would like flowers to grow out on the net.

333
0:17:14.682,000 --> 0:17:17,000
One of the crucial points is to make them searchable,

334
0:17:17.976,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there.

335
0:17:22.287,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And I have pretty good news for you.

336
0:17:24.605,000 --> 0:17:26,000
I have good news that the [current],

337
0:17:26.823,000 --> 0:17:29,000
new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible.

338
0:17:30.333,000 --> 0:17:31,000
He only says, "We can't do it."

339
0:17:32.772,000 --> 0:17:35,000
(Laughter)

340
0:17:36.328,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And that's a quite clever guy, huh?

341
0:17:38.235,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Laughter)

342
0:17:40.108,000 --> 0:17:44,000
So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years.

343
0:17:44.497,000 --> 0:17:48,000
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways.

344
0:17:48.897,000 --> 0:17:53,000
This is the income distribution of China, 1970.

345
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:58,000
This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970.

346
0:17:58.82,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Almost no overlap.

347
0:18:00.695,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Almost no overlap.

348
0:18:02.13,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And what has happened?

349
0:18:03.87,000 --> 0:18:04,000
What has happened is this:

350
0:18:05.375,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer,

351
0:18:08.371,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States,

352
0:18:12.366,000 --> 0:18:14,000
almost like a ghost, isn't it?

353
0:18:14.682,000 --> 0:18:15,000
(Laughter)

354
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
It's pretty scary.

355
0:18:17.611,000 --> 0:18:19,000
(Laughter)

356
0:18:22.762,000 --> 0:18:25,000
But I think it's very important to have all this information.

357
0:18:26.696,000 --> 0:18:28,000
We need really to see it.

358
0:18:29.45,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And instead of looking at this,

359
0:18:32.357,000 --> 0:18:37,000
I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000.

360
0:18:37.764,000 --> 0:18:39,000
In this software, we access about 500 variables

361
0:18:40.712,000 --> 0:18:42,000
from all the countries quite easily.

362
0:18:43.003,000 --> 0:18:46,000
It takes some time to change for this,

363
0:18:46.161,000 --> 0:18:51,000
but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have.

364
0:18:52.003,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And the thing would be to get up the databases free,

365
0:18:56.41,000 --> 0:18:58,000
to get them searchable, and with a second click,

366
0:18:59.243,000 --> 0:19:04,000
to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them.

367
0:19:04.323,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say

368
0:19:07.773,000 --> 0:19:13,000
that this will not show the reality;

369
0:19:14.714,000 --> 0:19:16,000
we have to have statistical, analytical methods.

370
0:19:17.026,000 --> 0:19:18,000
But this is hypothesis-generating.

371
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:2,000
I end now with the world.

372
0:19:22.021,000 --> 0:19:23,000
There, the internet is coming.

373
0:19:23.53,000 --> 0:19:25,000
The number of internet users are going up like this.

374
0:19:26.037,000 --> 0:19:28,000
This is the GDP per capita.

375
0:19:28.172,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly,

376
0:19:31.696,000 --> 0:19:35,000
how well it fits to the economy of the countries.

377
0:19:35.747,000 --> 0:19:37,000
That's why the $100 computer will be so important.

378
0:19:38.763,000 --> 0:19:39,000
But it's a nice tendency.

379
0:19:40.192,000 --> 0:19:42,000
It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it?

380
0:19:42.987,000 --> 0:19:44,000
These countries are lifting more than the economy,

381
0:19:45.549,000 --> 0:19:47,000
and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year,

382
0:19:48.529,000 --> 0:19:51,000
as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.

383
0:19:52.203,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Thank you very much.

384
0:19:53.409,000 --> 0:19:56,000
(Applause)

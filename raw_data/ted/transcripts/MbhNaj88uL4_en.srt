0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Music)

2
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What you just heard

3
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings

4
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.

5
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.

6
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Every single bead, every single colored band,

7
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
represents a weather element

8
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that can also be read as a musical note.

9
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I find weather extremely fascinating.

10
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Weather is an amalgam of systems

11
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that is inherently invisible to most of us.

12
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I use sculpture and music

13
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to make it, not just visible,

14
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but also tactile and audible.

15
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
All of my work begins very simple.

16
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I extract information from a specific environment

17
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
using very low-tech data collecting devices --

18
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
generally anything I can find in the hardware store.

19
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet --

20
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
satellite images, weather data

21
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.

22
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That's both historical as well as real data.

23
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.

24
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
These clipboards are filled with numbers.

25
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And from all of these numbers,

26
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I start with only two or three variables.

27
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
That begins my translation process.

28
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
My translation medium is a very simple basket.

29
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.

30
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements,

31
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I can use the changes of those data points over time

32
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to create the form.

33
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I use natural reed,

34
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because natural reed has a lot of tension in it

35
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that I cannot fully control.

36
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That means that it is the numbers that control the form,

37
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
not me.

38
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
What I come up with are forms like these.

39
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
These forms are completely made up

40
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of weather data or science data.

41
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Every colored bead, every colored string,

42
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
represents a weather element.

43
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And together, these elements, not only construct the form,

44
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but they also reveal behavioral relationships

45
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that may not come across

46
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
through a two-dimensional graph.

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
When you step closer, you actually see

48
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that it is indeed all made up of numbers.

49
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The vertical elements

50
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
are assigned a specific hour of the day.

51
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline.

52
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But it's also used to assign a temperature range.

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings,

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases.

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I also translate weather data into musical scores.

56
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way

57
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of translating information

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
without compromising it.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So all of these scores are made up of weather data.

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Every single color, dot, every single line,

61
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
is a weather element.

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And together, these variables construct a score.

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is the 1913 Trio

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
performing one of my pieces

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
at the Milwaukee Art Museum.

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to translate into sculptural forms like this,

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that function still in the sense

70
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of being a three-dimensional weather visualization,

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but now they're embedding

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the visual matrix of the musical score,

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
so it can actually be read as a musical score.

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What I love about this work

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is that it challenges our assumptions

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.

77
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This piece here is read very differently

78
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
depending on where you place it.

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
You place it in a science museum,

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You place it in a music hall,

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And I really like that,

85
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because the viewer is really challenged

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
as to what visual language

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is part of science versus art versus music.

88
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
The other reason why I really like this

89
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is because it offers an alternative entry point

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
into the complexity of science.

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science.

92
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So for me, that was my way into it.

93
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Thank you.

94
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.662,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to speak about a forgotten conflict.

2
0:00:15.474,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines.

3
0:00:19.18,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It happens right here, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

4
0:00:24.244,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo,

5
0:00:28.842,000 --> 0:00:31,000
so let me give you a couple of key facts.

6
0:00:32.099,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The Congolese conflict is the deadliest conflict since World War II.

7
0:00:37.687,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It has caused almost four million deaths.

8
0:00:40.987,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past 18 years.

9
0:00:45.581,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world.

10
0:00:50.501,000 --> 0:00:53,000
That's why I first went to Congo in 2001.

11
0:00:54.162,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was a young humanitarian aid worker, and I met this woman who was my age.

12
0:00:59.294,000 --> 0:01:01,000
She was called Isabelle.

13
0:01:02.868,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Local militias had attacked Isabelle's village.

14
0:01:06.179,000 --> 0:01:09,000
They had killed many men, raped many women.

15
0:01:09.227,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They had looted everything.

16
0:01:11.224,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then they wanted to take Isabelle,

17
0:01:13.847,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but her husband stepped in,

18
0:01:15.224,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and he said, "No, please don't take Isabelle.

19
0:01:18.422,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Take me instead."

20
0:01:21.709,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So he had gone to the forest with the militias,

21
0:01:24.7,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and Isabelle had never seen him again.

22
0:01:28.871,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Well, it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband

23
0:01:32.841,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that I have devoted my career to studying this war

24
0:01:35.86,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that we know so little about.

25
0:01:38.638,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Although there is one story about Congo that you may have heard.

26
0:01:43.262,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's a story about minerals and rape.

27
0:01:47.214,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Policy statements and media reports

28
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:53,000
both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in Congo --

29
0:01:54.534,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources --

30
0:01:59.312,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and on a main consequence --

31
0:02:02.049,000 --> 0:02:07,000
sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war.

32
0:02:07.243,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So, not that these two issues aren't important and tragic. They are.

33
0:02:14.08,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But today I want to tell you a different story.

34
0:02:17.978,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause

35
0:02:21.596,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of the ongoing conflict.

36
0:02:24.283,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Violence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom-up conflicts

37
0:02:31.4,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that international peace efforts have failed to help address.

38
0:02:37.325,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The story starts from the fact that not only is Congo notable

39
0:02:42.568,000 --> 0:02:46,000
for being the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis,

40
0:02:46.885,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but it is also home to some of the largest

41
0:02:50.411,000 --> 0:02:54,000
international peacebuilding efforts in the world.

42
0:02:54.572,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Congo hosts the largest

43
0:02:56.685,000 --> 0:03:,000
and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world.

44
0:03:01.53,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It was also the site of the first European-led peacekeeping mission,

45
0:03:06.229,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and for its first cases ever,

46
0:03:08.903,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the International Criminal Court chose to prosecute Congolese warlords.

47
0:03:15.535,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In 2006, when Congo held the first free national elections in its history,

48
0:03:22.035,000 --> 0:03:28,000
many observers thought that an end to violence in the region had finally come.

49
0:03:28.171,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The international community lauded the successful organization of these elections

50
0:03:34.3,000 --> 0:03:38,000
as finally an example of successful international intervention

51
0:03:38.637,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in a failed state.

52
0:03:41.095,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But the eastern provinces

53
0:03:42.853,000 --> 0:03:45,000
have continued to face massive population displacements

54
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and horrific human rights violations.

55
0:03:49.833,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Shortly before I went back there last summer,

56
0:03:52.318,000 --> 0:03:56,000
there was a horrible massacre in the province of South Kivu.

57
0:03:57.217,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Thirty-three people were killed.

58
0:03:59.245,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They were mostly women and children,

59
0:04:01.977,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and many of them were hacked to death.

60
0:04:06.116,000 --> 0:04:07,000
During the past eight years,

61
0:04:08.069,000 --> 0:04:11,000
fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited

62
0:04:12.007,000 --> 0:04:15,000
full-scale civil and international war.

63
0:04:15.074,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So basically, every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace,

64
0:04:20.055,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the conflict explodes again.

65
0:04:22.897,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Why?

66
0:04:24.615,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Why have the massive international efforts

67
0:04:27.587,000 --> 0:04:33,000
failed to help Congo achieve lasting peace and security?

68
0:04:34.096,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Well, my answer to this question revolves around two central observations.

69
0:04:41.064,000 --> 0:04:47,000
First, one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in Congo

70
0:04:47.097,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is fundamentally local --

71
0:04:50.005,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and when I say local,

72
0:04:51.292,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I really mean at the level of the individual, the family,

73
0:04:54.823,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the clan, the municipality, the community, the district,

74
0:04:58.712,000 --> 0:05:01,000
sometimes the ethnic group.

75
0:05:01.951,000 --> 0:05:05,000
For instance, you remember the story of Isabelle that I told you.

76
0:05:06.479,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Well, the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village

77
0:05:10.683,000 --> 0:05:13,000
was because they wanted to take the land

78
0:05:13.793,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive.

79
0:05:18.508,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The second central observation is that international peace efforts

80
0:05:23.278,000 --> 0:05:26,000
have failed to help address local conflicts

81
0:05:27.242,000 --> 0:05:31,000
because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture.

82
0:05:32.161,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So what I mean is that

83
0:05:35.777,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Western and African diplomats,

84
0:05:38.15,000 --> 0:05:4,000
United Nations peacekeepers, donors,

85
0:05:40.997,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the staff of most nongovernmental organizations

86
0:05:43.601,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that work with the resolution of conflict,

87
0:05:46.437,000 --> 0:05:5,000
they all share a specific way of seeing the world.

88
0:05:51.215,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I was one of these people, and I shared this culture,

89
0:05:55.221,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so I know all too well how powerful it is.

90
0:05:59.213,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Throughout the world, and throughout conflict zones,

91
0:06:03.482,000 --> 0:06:06,000
this common culture shapes the intervener's understanding

92
0:06:07.29,000 --> 0:06:09,000
of the causes of violence

93
0:06:09.774,000 --> 0:06:15,000
as something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres.

94
0:06:16.517,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It shapes our understanding of the path toward peace

95
0:06:19.908,000 --> 0:06:22,000
as something again that requires top-down intervention

96
0:06:23.756,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to address national and international tensions.

97
0:06:27.879,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors

98
0:06:31.598,000 --> 0:06:36,000
as engaging in national and international peace processes.

99
0:06:37.159,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Even more importantly, this common culture

100
0:06:41.034,000 --> 0:06:47,000
enables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro-level tensions

101
0:06:47.234,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that often jeopardize the macro-level settlements.

102
0:06:52.48,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So for instance, in Congo,

103
0:06:54.581,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because of how they are socialized and trained,

104
0:06:58.795,000 --> 0:07:,000
United Nations officials, donors, diplomats,

105
0:07:01.181,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the staff of most nongovernmental organizations,

106
0:07:04.34,000 --> 0:07:11,000
they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a top-down problem.

107
0:07:11.35,000 --> 0:07:13,000
To them, the violence they see

108
0:07:13.574,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is the consequence of tensions between President Kabila

109
0:07:18.554,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and various national opponents,

110
0:07:21.224,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and tensions between Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.

111
0:07:26.217,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In addition, these international peacebuilders view local conflicts

112
0:07:32.288,000 --> 0:07:37,000
as simply the result of national and international tensions,

113
0:07:38.081,000 --> 0:07:4,000
insufficient state authority,

114
0:07:40.496,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and what they call the Congolese people's so-called inherent penchant for violence.

115
0:07:47.364,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The dominant culture also constructs intervention

116
0:07:51.316,000 --> 0:07:53,000
at the national and international levels

117
0:07:54.149,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as the only natural and legitimate task for United Nations staffers and diplomats.

118
0:08:01.362,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And it elevates the organization of general elections,

119
0:08:05.721,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which is now a sort of cure-all,

120
0:08:07.807,000 --> 0:08:1,000
as the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism

121
0:08:11.591,000 --> 0:08:14,000
over more effective state-building approaches.

122
0:08:15.116,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones.

123
0:08:21.343,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But let's dig deeper,

124
0:08:23.243,000 --> 0:08:26,000
into the other main sources of violence.

125
0:08:27.193,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In Congo, continuing violence

126
0:08:29.862,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is motivated not only by the national and international causes

127
0:08:34.875,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but also by longstanding bottom-up agendas

128
0:08:39.182,000 --> 0:08:42,000
whose main instigators are villagers, traditional chiefs,

129
0:08:43.143,000 --> 0:08:45,000
community chiefs or ethnic leaders.

130
0:08:46.141,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Many conflicts revolve around political, social and economic stakes

131
0:08:52.116,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that are distinctively local.

132
0:08:54.944,000 --> 0:08:56,000
For instance, there is a lot of competition

133
0:08:57.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
at the village or district level

134
0:09:00.308,000 --> 0:09:03,000
over who can be chief of village or chief of territory

135
0:09:03.894,000 --> 0:09:05,000
according to traditional law,

136
0:09:06.468,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and who can control the distribution of land

137
0:09:09.696,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and the exploitation of local mining sites.

138
0:09:13.215,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This competition often results in localized fighting,

139
0:09:17.436,000 --> 0:09:2,000
for instance in one village or territory,

140
0:09:21.22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and quite frequently, it escalates into generalized fighting,

141
0:09:25.163,000 --> 0:09:27,000
so across a whole province,

142
0:09:27.292,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and even at times into neighboring countries.

143
0:09:30.631,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Take the conflict between Congolese of Rwandan descent

144
0:09:35.698,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and the so-called indigenous communities of the Kivus.

145
0:09:40.609,000 --> 0:09:45,000
This conflict started in the 1930s during Belgian colonization,

146
0:09:45.995,000 --> 0:09:5,000
when both communities competed over access to land and to local power.

147
0:09:51.328,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Then, in 1960, after Congolese independence,

148
0:09:54.727,000 --> 0:09:59,000
it escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians,

149
0:10:00.578,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but still to advance their local agendas.

150
0:10:04.512,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And then, at the time of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,

151
0:10:08.88,000 --> 0:10:14,000
these local actors allied with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,

152
0:10:15.059,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the Kivus.

153
0:10:20.389,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And since then, these local disputes over land and local power

154
0:10:26.023,000 --> 0:10:27,000
have fueled violence,

155
0:10:27.743,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and they have regularly jeopardized

156
0:10:29.989,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the national and international settlements.

157
0:10:35.542,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So we can wonder why in these circumstances

158
0:10:39.347,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the international peacebuilders have failed to help implement

159
0:10:44.029,000 --> 0:10:47,000
local peacebuilding programs.

160
0:10:47.407,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And the answer is that international interveners

161
0:10:52.253,000 --> 0:10:55,000
deem the resolution of grassroots conflict

162
0:10:55.776,000 --> 0:11:,000
an unimportant, unfamiliar, and illegitimate task.

163
0:11:02.41,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally

164
0:11:08.389,000 --> 0:11:1,000
with existing cultural norms,

165
0:11:10.497,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and it threatens key organizational interests.

166
0:11:14.38,000 --> 0:11:18,000
For instance, the very identity of the United Nations

167
0:11:18.997,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as this macro-level diplomatic organization

168
0:11:22.353,000 --> 0:11:28,000
would be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts.

169
0:11:28.761,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And the result is that neither the internal resistance

170
0:11:33.486,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to the dominant ways of working

171
0:11:35.833,000 --> 0:11:37,000
nor the external shocks

172
0:11:38.576,000 --> 0:11:42,000
have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate

173
0:11:43.018,000 --> 0:11:46,000
their understanding of violence and intervention.

174
0:11:47.56,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And so far, there have been only very few exceptions.

175
0:11:51.333,000 --> 0:11:54,000
There have been exceptions, but only very few exceptions,

176
0:11:54.796,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to this broad pattern.

177
0:11:58.214,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So to wrap up, the story I just told you

178
0:12:01.526,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture

179
0:12:06.475,000 --> 0:12:1,000
shapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are,

180
0:12:11.282,000 --> 0:12:12,000
how peace is made,

181
0:12:12.963,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and what interventions should accomplish.

182
0:12:16.575,000 --> 0:12:19,000
These understandings enable international peacebuilders

183
0:12:20.324,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to ignore the micro-level foundations

184
0:12:23.402,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that are so necessary for sustainable peace.

185
0:12:28.051,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The resulting inattention to local conflicts

186
0:12:31.044,000 --> 0:12:35,000
leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term

187
0:12:35.062,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and potential war resumption in the long term.

188
0:12:39.068,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And what's fascinating is that this analysis

189
0:12:42.214,000 --> 0:12:46,000
helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict

190
0:12:46.224,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and international intervention failures, in Africa and elsewhere.

191
0:12:51.513,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Local conflicts fuel violence in most war and post-war environments,

192
0:12:57.074,000 --> 0:13:,000
from Afghanistan to Sudan to Timor-Leste,

193
0:13:00.765,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive,

194
0:13:04.366,000 --> 0:13:07,000
bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,

195
0:13:07.453,000 --> 0:13:12,000
these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable.

196
0:13:12.947,000 --> 0:13:14,000
One of the best examples is the contrast

197
0:13:15.757,000 --> 0:13:19,000
between the relatively peaceful situation in Somaliland,

198
0:13:20.168,000 --> 0:13:25,000
which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives,

199
0:13:25.378,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and the violence prevalent in the rest of Somalia,

200
0:13:29.586,000 --> 0:13:32,000
where peacebuilding has been mostly top-down.

201
0:13:32.945,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And there are several other cases

202
0:13:35.246,000 --> 0:13:38,000
in which local, grassroots conflict resolution

203
0:13:38.961,000 --> 0:13:41,000
has made a crucial difference.

204
0:13:41.98,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So if we want international peacebuilding to work,

205
0:13:46.052,000 --> 0:13:49,000
in addition to any top-down intervention,

206
0:13:49.874,000 --> 0:13:52,000
conflicts must be resolved from the bottom up.

207
0:13:53.545,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And again, it's not that national and international tensions don't matter.

208
0:13:58.197,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They do.

209
0:13:59.923,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And it's not that national and international peacebuilding

210
0:14:03.155,000 --> 0:14:04,000
isn't necessary.

211
0:14:04.617,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It is.

212
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Instead, it is that both macro-level and micro-level peacebuilding are needed

213
0:14:13.255,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to make peace sustainable,

214
0:14:15.972,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and local nongovernmental organizations,

215
0:14:18.113,000 --> 0:14:2,000
local authorities and civil society representatives

216
0:14:21.092,000 --> 0:14:25,000
should be the main actors in the bottom-up process.

217
0:14:25.702,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So of course, there are obstacles.

218
0:14:28.131,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Local actors often lack the funding

219
0:14:30.786,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity

220
0:14:34.323,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to implement effective, local peacebuilding programs.

221
0:14:38.857,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So international actors should expand their funding and support

222
0:14:43.913,000 --> 0:14:46,000
for local conflict resolution.

223
0:14:47.7,000 --> 0:14:5,000
As for Congo, what can be done?

224
0:14:51.056,000 --> 0:14:54,000
After two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions,

225
0:14:54.78,000 --> 0:14:57,000
it's clear that we need to change our approach.

226
0:14:58.545,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Based on my field research,

227
0:15:00.223,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I believe that international and Congolese actors

228
0:15:03.733,000 --> 0:15:06,000
should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict

229
0:15:07.159,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and the promotion of inter-community reconciliation.

230
0:15:11.679,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So for instance, in the province of the Kivus,

231
0:15:14.321,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners

232
0:15:17.589,000 --> 0:15:2,000
have set up inter-community forums

233
0:15:20.684,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land,

234
0:15:25.036,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence.

235
0:15:30.671,000 --> 0:15:33,000
That's the kind of program that is sorely needed

236
0:15:34.29,000 --> 0:15:36,000
throughout eastern Congo.

237
0:15:37.097,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It's with programs like this

238
0:15:38.975,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that we can help people like Isabelle and her husband.

239
0:15:43.925,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So these will not be magic wands,

240
0:15:46.448,000 --> 0:15:51,000
but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence,

241
0:15:52.116,000 --> 0:15:54,000
they could definitely be game-changers.

242
0:15:54.95,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thank you.

243
0:15:57.504,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

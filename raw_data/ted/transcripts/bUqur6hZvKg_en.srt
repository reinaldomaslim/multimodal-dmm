Transcriber: Ivana Korom Reviewer: Krystian Aparta

2
0:00:12.952,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I've been a journalist for more than 23 years,

3
0:00:15.668,000 --> 0:00:17,000
at the "Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"

4
0:00:17.897,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the "Pittsburgh Tribune Review"

5
0:00:19.579,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and most recently, "The Denver Post."

6
0:00:23.077,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:26.442,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When I started at "The Denver Post" in 2003,

8
0:00:30.079,000 --> 0:00:34,000
it was among the country's 10 largest newspapers,

9
0:00:34.364,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with an impressive subscriber base

10
0:00:36.491,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and nearly 300 journalists.

11
0:00:39.752,000 --> 0:00:41,000
At the time, I was in my 30s.

12
0:00:42.339,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Any ambitious journalist that age

13
0:00:44.15,000 --> 0:00:46,000
aspires to work for one of the big national papers,

14
0:00:46.771,000 --> 0:00:48,000
like "The New York Times" or "The Wall Street Journal."

15
0:00:49.522,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But I was simply blown away

16
0:00:51.427,000 --> 0:00:53,000
by my first few weeks at "The Denver Post,"

17
0:00:54.118,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I thought, "This is going to be my paper.

18
0:00:57.126,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I can make a career right here."

19
0:01:00.303,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Well, seven years passed,

20
0:01:02.342,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we were sold to a hedge fund,

21
0:01:04.533,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Alden Global Capital.

22
0:01:07.231,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Within a few years --

23
0:01:08.937,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughs)

24
0:01:10.127,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:11.864,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Some of you know this story.

26
0:01:13.315,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:16.617,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Within a few years,

28
0:01:18.133,000 --> 0:01:2,000
buyouts ordered by past and present owners

29
0:01:20.712,000 --> 0:01:22,000
would reduce the newsroom by nearly half.

30
0:01:24.507,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I understood.

31
0:01:26.261,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The rule of thumb used to be that 80 percent of a newspaper's revenue

32
0:01:31.047,000 --> 0:01:34,000
came from pricy print ads and classifieds.

33
0:01:34.45,000 --> 0:01:37,000
With emerging giants like Google and Facebook and Craigslist,

34
0:01:38.157,000 --> 0:01:4,000
those advertizing dollars were evaporating.

35
0:01:40.942,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The entire industry was undergoing a massive shift from print to digital.

36
0:01:45.712,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Alden's orders were to be digital first.

37
0:01:49.101,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Take advantage of blogs, video and social media.

38
0:01:53.411,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They said that one day,

39
0:01:55.443,000 --> 0:02:,000
the money we made online would make up for the money we lost in print.

40
0:02:01.547,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But that day never came.

41
0:02:04.008,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In 2013, we won a Pulitzer Prize

42
0:02:07.339,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for covering the Aurora theater shooting.

43
0:02:10.847,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Alden ordered that more journalists be cut.

44
0:02:15.109,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Again,

45
0:02:16.434,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and again,

46
0:02:17.68,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and again,

47
0:02:18.855,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and again.

48
0:02:20.093,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We were forced to say goodbye to talented, hardworking journalists

49
0:02:24.466,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we considered not just friends

50
0:02:26.617,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but family.

51
0:02:28.593,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Those of us left behind were stretched impossibly thin,

52
0:02:32.474,000 --> 0:02:35,000
covering multiple beats and writing rushed articles.

53
0:02:37.371,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Inside a windowless meeting room in March of 2018,

54
0:02:41.279,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we learned that 30 more would have to go.

55
0:02:45.826,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This paper that once had 300 journalists

56
0:02:48.871,000 --> 0:02:5,000
would now have 70.

57
0:02:53.149,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And it didn't make sense.

58
0:02:54.99,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Here, we'd won multiple Pulitzer Prizes.

59
0:02:58.234,000 --> 0:03:,000
We shifted our focus from print to digital,

60
0:03:00.393,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we hit ambitious targets

61
0:03:02.393,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and email from the brass talked up the Post's profit margins,

62
0:03:06.956,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which industry experts pegged at nearly 20 percent.

63
0:03:12.004,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So if our company was so successful and so profitable,

64
0:03:15.972,000 --> 0:03:19,000
why was our newsroom getting so much smaller and smaller?

65
0:03:22.135,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I knew that what was happening in Colorado was happening around the country.

66
0:03:27.206,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Since 2004,

67
0:03:29.167,000 --> 0:03:32,000
nearly 1,800 newsrooms have closed.

68
0:03:33.596,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You've heard of food deserts.

69
0:03:35.914,000 --> 0:03:36,000
These are news deserts.

70
0:03:38.081,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They are communities, often entire counties,

71
0:03:41.049,000 --> 0:03:44,000
with little to zero news coverage whatsoever.

72
0:03:45.143,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Making matters worse,

73
0:03:46.627,000 --> 0:03:49,000
many papers have become ghost ships,

74
0:03:49.793,000 --> 0:03:51,000
pretending to sail with a newsroom

75
0:03:51.92,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but really just wrapping ads around filler copy.

76
0:03:55.883,000 --> 0:04:,000
More and more newsrooms are being sold off to companies like Alden.

77
0:04:01.328,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And in that meeting,

78
0:04:02.859,000 --> 0:04:04,000
their intentions couldn't have been clearer.

79
0:04:06.174,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Harvest what you can,

80
0:04:08.095,000 --> 0:04:1,000
throw away what's left.

81
0:04:10.825,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So, working in secret with a team of eight writers,

82
0:04:15.474,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we prepared a special Sunday Perspective section

83
0:04:18.212,000 --> 0:04:2,000
on the importance of local news.

84
0:04:20.457,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:22.919,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The Denver rebellion launched like a missile,

86
0:04:25.569,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and went off like a hydrogen bomb.

(Laughter)

95
0:04:50.315,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And a year later, nothing's changed.

96
0:04:52.633,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"The Denver Post" is but a few lone journalists

97
0:04:55.339,000 --> 0:04:59,000
doing their admirable best in this husk of a once-great paper.

98
0:05:01.411,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, at least some of you are thinking to yourself,

99
0:05:06.323,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"So what?"

100
0:05:07.505,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Right?

101
0:05:08.686,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So what?

102
0:05:09.862,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Let this dying industry die.

103
0:05:11.902,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I kind of get that.

104
0:05:13.823,000 --> 0:05:17,000
For one thing, the local news has been in decline for so long

105
0:05:17.847,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that many of you may not even remember

106
0:05:19.887,000 --> 0:05:22,000
what it's like to have a great local paper.

107
0:05:23.894,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Maybe you've seen "Spotlight" or "The Paper,"

108
0:05:26.807,000 --> 0:05:29,000
movies that romanticize what journalism used to be.

109
0:05:31.581,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Well, I'm not here to be romantic or nostalgic.

110
0:05:35.153,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I'm here to warn you that when local news dies,

111
0:05:38.431,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so does our democracy.

112
0:05:40.99,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And that should concern you --

113
0:05:42.707,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Applause and cheers)

114
0:05:50.589,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And that should concern you,

115
0:05:51.97,000 --> 0:05:53,000
regardless of whether you subscribe.

116
0:05:54.47,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Here's why.

117
0:05:56.176,000 --> 0:05:59,000
A democracy is a government of the people.

118
0:06:00.014,000 --> 0:06:04,000
People are the ultimate source of power and authority.

119
0:06:04.919,000 --> 0:06:06,000
A great local newsroom acts like a mirror.

120
0:06:07.942,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Its journalists see the community and reflect it back.

121
0:06:12.18,000 --> 0:06:14,000
That information is empowering.

122
0:06:14.696,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Seeing, knowing, understanding --

123
0:06:17.046,000 --> 0:06:19,000
this is how good decisions are made.

124
0:06:20.03,000 --> 0:06:22,000
When you have a great local paper,

125
0:06:22.117,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you have journalists sitting in on every city council meeting.

126
0:06:26.198,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Listening in to state house and senate hearings.

127
0:06:29.77,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Those important but, let's face it,

128
0:06:32.04,000 --> 0:06:35,000
sometimes devastatingly boring committee hearings.

129
0:06:35.114,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:36.145,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Journalists discover the flaws and ill-conceived measures

131
0:06:39.9,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and those bills fail, because the public was well-informed.

132
0:06:43.812,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Readers go to the polls

133
0:06:45.781,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and they know the pros and cons behind every ballot measure,

134
0:06:49.338,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because journalists did the heavy lifting for them.

135
0:06:52.71,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Even better,

136
0:06:53.949,000 --> 0:06:56,000
researchers have found that reading a local paper

137
0:06:56.982,000 --> 0:07:,000
can mobilize 13 percent of nonvoters to vote.

138
0:07:02.133,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Thirteen percent.

139
0:07:03.537,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Applause)

140
0:07:08.625,000 --> 0:07:11,000
That's the number that can change the outcome of many elections.

141
0:07:12.45,000 --> 0:07:14,000
When you don't have a great local paper,

142
0:07:15.133,000 --> 0:07:17,000
voters are left stranded at the polls,

143
0:07:17.474,000 --> 0:07:18,000
confused,

144
0:07:18.656,000 --> 0:07:22,000
trying to make their best guess based on a paragraph of legalese.

145
0:07:24.069,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Flawed measures pass.

146
0:07:25.934,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Well-conceived but highly technical measures fail.

147
0:07:29.657,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Voters become more partisan.

148
0:07:33.718,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Recently in Colorado, our governor's race

149
0:07:36.69,000 --> 0:07:38,000
had more candidates than anyone can remember.

150
0:07:39.837,000 --> 0:07:4,000
In years past,

151
0:07:41.498,000 --> 0:07:43,000
journalists would have thoroughly vetted,

152
0:07:43.593,000 --> 0:07:46,000
scrutinized, fact-checked, profiled, debated

153
0:07:47.474,000 --> 0:07:49,000
every contender in the local paper.

154
0:07:50.585,000 --> 0:07:52,000
"The Denver Post" did its best.

155
0:07:53.046,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But in the place of past levels of rigorous reporting and research,

156
0:07:57.303,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the public is increasingly left to interpret

157
0:08:00.232,000 --> 0:08:03,000
dog-and-pony-show stump speeches and clever campaign ads

158
0:08:04.049,000 --> 0:08:05,000
for themselves.

159
0:08:06.292,000 --> 0:08:08,000
With advertizing costing what it does,

160
0:08:09.252,000 --> 0:08:11,000
electability comes down to money.

161
0:08:11.879,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So by the end of the primaries,

162
0:08:13.531,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the only candidates left standing were the wealthiest

163
0:08:17.052,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and best-funded.

164
0:08:18.712,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Many experienced and praise-worthy candidates

165
0:08:21.823,000 --> 0:08:22,000
never got oxygen,

166
0:08:23.831,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because when local news declines,

167
0:08:26.236,000 --> 0:08:29,000
even big-ticket races become pay-to-play.

168
0:08:30.419,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Is it any surprise that our new governor

169
0:08:33.467,000 --> 0:08:36,000
was the candidate worth more than 300 million dollars?

170
0:08:37.339,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Or that billionaire businessmen like Donald Trump and Howard Schultz

171
0:08:41.547,000 --> 0:08:43,000
can seize the political stage?

172
0:08:43.88,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I don't think this is what the Founding Fathers had in mind

173
0:08:47.864,000 --> 0:08:49,000
when they talked about free and fair elections.

174
0:08:50.214,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Applause and cheers)

175
0:08:57.981,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now this is exactly why we can't just rely on the big national papers,

176
0:09:03.861,000 --> 0:09:05,000
like "The Journal" and "The Times" and "The Post."

177
0:09:06.71,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Those are tremendous papers,

178
0:09:08.544,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and we need them now, my God, more than ever before.

179
0:09:12.504,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But there is no world in which they could cover

180
0:09:15.58,000 --> 0:09:18,000
every election in every county in the country.

181
0:09:19.246,000 --> 0:09:2,000
No.

182
0:09:20.421,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The newsroom best equipped to cover your local election

183
0:09:23.58,000 --> 0:09:25,000
ought to be your local newsroom.

184
0:09:26.411,000 --> 0:09:28,000
If you're lucky and still have one.

185
0:09:29.355,000 --> 0:09:31,000
When election day is over,

186
0:09:31.395,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a great local paper is still there, waiting like a watchdog.

187
0:09:36.895,000 --> 0:09:37,000
When they're being watched,

188
0:09:38.673,000 --> 0:09:4,000
politicians have less power,

189
0:09:40.799,000 --> 0:09:42,000
police do right by the public,

190
0:09:43.053,000 --> 0:09:46,000
even massive corporations are on their best behavior.

191
0:09:46.919,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This mechanism that for generations has helped inform and guide us

192
0:09:52.272,000 --> 0:09:54,000
no longer functions the way it used to.

193
0:09:55.867,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You know intimately what the poisoned national discourse feels like,

194
0:10:00.331,000 --> 0:10:03,000
what a mockery of reasoned debate it has become.

195
0:10:04.109,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This is what happens when local newsrooms shutter

196
0:10:07.506,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and communities across the country go unwatched and unseen.

197
0:10:12.788,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Until we recognize that the decline of local news

198
0:10:16.208,000 --> 0:10:18,000
has serious consequences for our society,

199
0:10:19.105,000 --> 0:10:22,000
this situation will not improve.

200
0:10:22.53,000 --> 0:10:25,000
A properly staffed local newsroom isn't profitable,

201
0:10:25.998,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and in this age of Google and Facebook,

202
0:10:28.514,000 --> 0:10:29,000
it's not going to be.

203
0:10:30.688,000 --> 0:10:33,000
If newspapers are vital to our democracy,

204
0:10:33.839,000 --> 0:10:36,000
then we should fund them like they're vital to our democracy.

205
0:10:37.228,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Applause and cheers)

206
0:10:43.807,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We cannot stand by and let our watchdogs be put down.

207
0:10:47.895,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We can't let more communities vanish into darkness.

208
0:10:51.355,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It is time to debate a public funding option

209
0:10:54.188,000 --> 0:10:56,000
before the fourth estate disappears,

210
0:10:56.482,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and with it, our grand democratic experiment.

211
0:10:59.966,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We need much more than a rebellion.

212
0:11:02.323,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It is time for a revolution.

213
0:11:05.065,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Thank you.

214
0:11:06.251,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause and cheers)

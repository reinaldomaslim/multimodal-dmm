1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and it was a really cool device.

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.

4
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I was fascinated.

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.

6
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth

7
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
between the memory, the RAM and the ALU,

8
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the arithmetic and logic unit.

9
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy

10
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
just to keep all this data moving through the system.

11
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But nobody was really worried about this.

12
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
When computers were first introduced,

13
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they were said to be a million times faster than neurons.

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip

15
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the capacity of the brain.

16
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:

17
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question

18
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as to ask a person."

19
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.

20
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing

21
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?

22
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,

23
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is that we pay a huge price for the speed

24
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that we claim is a big advantage of these computers.

25
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Let's take a look at some numbers.

26
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.

27
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process

28
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
10 quadrillion bits of information per second.

29
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.

30
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So that would be really great, if you could add that

31
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to the production capacity in Tanzania.

32
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It would really boost the economy.

33
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Just to go back to the States,

34
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
if you translate the amount of power or electricity

35
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
this computer uses to the amount of households in the States,

36
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you get 1,200 households in the U.S.

37
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That's how much power this computer uses.

38
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now, let's compare this with the brain.

39
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.

40
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford.

41
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that

42
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.

43
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So that's true love, right there.

45
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now, how much computation does the brain do?

46
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,

47
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.

48
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So that's the question. The question is, how much --

49
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --

50
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?

51
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And it's actually as much as your laptop computer:

52
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
it's just 10 watts.

53
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So what we are doing right now with computers

54
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,

55
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.

56
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?

57
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And let me just summarize. So the bottom line:

58
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy

59
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
than we do right now with this computer technology that we have.

60
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
How is the brain able to do this?

61
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Let's just take a look about how the brain works,

62
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and then I'll compare that with how computers work.

63
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."

64
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It shows you these cells that process information.

65
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They are called neurons.

66
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,

67
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and where they contact each other, those little pulses

68
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.

69
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That process is called a synapse.

70
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --

71
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
about 100 million of them,

72
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.

73
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.

74
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
How does that compare with the way computers work?

75
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In the computer, you have all the data

76
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
going through the central processing unit,

77
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,

78
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,

79
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and the data just really flows through a network of connections

80
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.

81
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's really a network in the literal sense of the word.

82
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The net is doing the work in the brain.

83
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
If you just look at these two pictures,

84
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
these kind of words pop into your mind.

85
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,

86
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
everything has to happen in lockstep --

87
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
whereas this is parallel and it's fluid.

88
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive.

89
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:

90
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them."

91
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Brian actually said this in 1995.

93
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And nobody was listening then,

94
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but now people are beginning to listen

95
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.

96
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.

97
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence

98
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
between the devices that we use to compute in computers,

99
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and the devices that our brains use to compute.

100
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.

101
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current

102
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
from the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.

103
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And that current, electrical current,

104
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.

105
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,

106
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.

107
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.

108
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,

109
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the absence of current to represent a zero.

110
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,

111
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
they no longer behave like this.

112
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,

113
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which is called an ion channel.

114
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And this is a little protein molecule.

115
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I mean, neurons have thousands of these.

116
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.

117
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And these are individual potassium ions

118
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that are flowing through that pore.

119
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, this pore can open and close.

120
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up

121
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --

122
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
it's a sporadic flow of current.

123
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,

124
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --

125
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
even when it's closed, because these ions are so small,

126
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.

127
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So, what you have is that when the pore is open,

128
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you get some current sometimes.

129
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.

130
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And when it's closed, you have a zero,

131
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but you have a few ones thrown in.

132
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, this is starting to happen in transistors.

133
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --

134
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough

135
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.

136
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.

137
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And that means that a transistor corresponds

138
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to about 12 ion channels in parallel.

139
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.

140
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.

141
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte

142
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of stuff on them -- before, it was 256.

143
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,

144
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and technology has really benefitted from that.

145
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,

146
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that it corresponds to only one electron at a time

147
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
can flow through that channel,

148
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and that corresponds to a single ion channel.

149
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.

150
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The current will turn on and off at random,

151
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
even when it's supposed to be on.

152
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And that means your computer is going to get

153
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.

154
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So, we are at the stage where we

155
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.

156
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now

157
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.

158
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
OK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,

159
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it sends it into the processor or the ALU,

160
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and then it puts the result back into memory.

161
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
That's the red path that's highlighted.

162
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.

163
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And the way they represent information is

164
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they break up that data into little pieces

165
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that are represented by pulses and different neurons.

166
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So you have all these pieces of data

167
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
distributed throughout the network.

168
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And then the way that you process that data to get a result

169
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,

170
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
just by it flowing through the network.

171
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So you set up these connections

172
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
such that the input pattern just flows

173
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and generates the output pattern.

174
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
What you see here is that there's these redundant connections.

175
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,

176
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part

177
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
with these redundant connections.

178
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So even when you go to these crappy devices

179
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,

180
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
there's redundancy in the network

181
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that can actually recover the missing information.

182
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It makes the brain inherently robust.

183
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
What you have here is a system where you store data locally.

184
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,

185
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system

186
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.

187
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
What I want to basically talk about is my dream,

188
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
which is to build a computer that works like the brain.

189
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.

190
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And I'm going to show you a system that we designed

191
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to model the retina,

192
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.

193
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.

194
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
In fact, the processing that happens

195
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in that little piece of brain is very similar

196
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to the kind of processing that computers

197
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
do when they stream video over the Internet.

198
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
They want to compress the information --

199
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --

200
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and that is how your eyeball

201
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,

202
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to send to the rest of the brain.

203
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,

204
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we went and talked to neurobiologists

205
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.

206
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And they figured out all the different cells,

207
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and they figured out the network, and we just took that network

208
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.

209
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,

210
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.

211
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And these transistors are behaving essentially

212
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
just like ion channels behave in the brain.

213
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.

214
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like.

215
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.

216
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video

217
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that the silicon retina put out of its output

218
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,

219
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
who's the student who designed this chip.

220
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Let me explain what you're going to see, OK,

221
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because it's putting out different kinds of information,

222
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
it's not as straightforward as a camera.

223
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.

224
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It extracts regions with dark contrast,

225
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
which will show up on the video as red.

226
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast,

227
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
which will show up on the video as green.

228
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This is Kareem's dark eyes

229
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and that's the white background that you see here.

230
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And then it also extracts movement.

231
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When Kareem moves his head to the right,

232
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
you will see this blue activity there;

233
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,

234
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that's where it's going from dark to light.

235
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And you also see this yellow activity,

236
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
which represents regions where contrast is decreasing;

237
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's going from light to dark.

238
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And these four types of information --

239
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,

240
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and 900,000 of those fibers

241
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
send these four types of information.

242
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.

243
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
What you notice here is that these snapshots

244
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?

245
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,

246
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.

247
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And this is the same thing you see

248
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,

249
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,

250
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons

251
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.

252
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.

253
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So this image here is going to look like these ones,

254
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,

255
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.

256
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And so, here you go.

257
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Yes, so that's the idea.

258
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.

259
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
But when it's moving back and forth,

260
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the retina picks up these changes.

261
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here

262
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and something happens in your background,

263
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
you merely move your eyes to it.

264
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
There are these cells that detect change

265
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and you move your attention to it.

266
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So those are very important for catching somebody

267
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
who's trying to sneak up on you.

268
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens

269
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
when you put Africa in a piano, OK.

270
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
This is a steel drum here that has been modified,

271
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.

272
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,

273
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and come up with a new kind of computer

274
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.

275
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Thank you.

276
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(Applause)

277
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Chris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.

278
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing,

279
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
the future of Africa, this conference --

280
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
what connections can we make, if any, between them?

281
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,

282
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.

283
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.

284
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It was very brute force; it was very inelegant.

285
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I don't think that I would've had that reaction,

286
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,

287
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,

288
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
buying into this hype about computers.

289
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I was coming at it from a different perspective,

290
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
where I was bringing that different perspective

291
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to bear on the problem.

292
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,

293
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and I think that's going to impact technology.

294
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.

295
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,

296
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to come up with new things,

297
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
because you're coming from a different perspective.

298
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.

299
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
CA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting.

300
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Thank you.

301
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000

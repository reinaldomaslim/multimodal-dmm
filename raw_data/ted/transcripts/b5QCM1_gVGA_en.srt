1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Good morning.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I've come here to share with you an experiment

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.

6
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.

7
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Music)

8
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,

9
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
what use do we have for a blind woman?

10
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.

11
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.

12
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,

13
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,

14
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
their independence, and their status in the family.

15
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.

16
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And the irony is that they don't need to be.

17
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,

18
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.

19
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If we add to that the many of us here now

20
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,

21
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,

22
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a staggering 200 million people.

23
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.

24
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence

25
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about 30 years back

26
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.

27
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
He started this with no money.

28
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
He had to mortgage all his life savings

29
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to make a bank loan.

30
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,

31
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,

32
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers

33
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
as a hub-and-spoke model.

34
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And then more recently we started managing hospitals

35
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in other parts of the country

36
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.

37
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The last three decades,

38
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,

39
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
a vast majority of them for the poor people.

40
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.

41
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,

42
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
maybe see about 6,000 patients,

43
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,

44
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
lots of telemedicine consultations,

45
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and, on top of that, do a lot of training,

46
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.

47
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,

48
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.

49
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks

50
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
put in place by Dr. V.,

51
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a value system, an efficient delivery process,

52
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and fostering the culture of innovation.

53
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Music)

54
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,

55
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,

56
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you seem to be one with him.

57
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.

58
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.

59
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
An implicit faith in you

60
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and then you respond to it.

61
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.

62
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
When we grow in spiritual consciousness,

63
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,

64
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
so there is no exploitation.

65
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It is ourselves we are helping.

66
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It is ourselves we are healing.

67
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Applause)

68
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization

69
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and systems that support it.

70
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,

71
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.

72
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.

73
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They feel they can train people all over the world,

74
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,

75
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
to produce a product in the same way

76
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and deliver it in the same manner

77
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in hundreds of places.

78
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,

79
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and none of it made any sense to us.

80
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He wanted to create a franchise,

81
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a mechanism of delivery of eye care

82
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
with the efficiency of McDonald's.

83
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,

84
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
techniques, methods, all in the same way,

85
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and make it available in every corner of the world.

86
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The problem of blindness is gone.

87
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,

88
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
as American or African,

89
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.

90
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,

91
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and that was the fundamental principle that we followed

92
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
when we designed the delivery systems.

93
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,

94
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we are talking of millions of people,

95
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
very little resource to deal with it,

96
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.

97
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.

98
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And one of the early innovations, which still continues,

99
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is to create ownership in the community to the problem,

100
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and then engage with them as a partner,

101
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and here is one such event.

102
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Here a community camp just organized

103
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
by the community themselves,

104
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
where they find a place, organize volunteers,

105
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,

106
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is

107
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and then determine what further testing should be done,

108
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and then those tests are done by technicians

109
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
who check for glasses,

110
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
or check for glaucoma.

111
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,

112
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and then prescribes a line of treatment,

113
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,

114
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
usually under a tree.

115
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,

116
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and that's very important because I think glasses,

117
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in addition to helping people see,

118
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.

119
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So they get it in about 20 minutes

120
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and those who require surgery, are counseled,

121
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and then there are buses waiting,

122
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
which will transport them to the base hospital.

123
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,

124
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
many people like this would probably never get services,

125
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and certainly not when they most need it.

126
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They receive surgery the following day,

127
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and then they will stay for a day or two,

128
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and then they are put back on the buses

129
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to be taken back to where they came from,

130
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.

131
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Applause)

132
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And this happens several thousand times each year.

133
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,

134
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
very efficient process,

135
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but we looked at, are we solving the problem?

136
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We did a study, a scientifically designed process,

137
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and then, to our dismay,

138
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,

139
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.

140
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So we had to do something different,

141
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.

142
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
These are truly paperless offices

143
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with completely electronic medical records and so on.

144
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
They receive comprehensive eye exams.

145
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,

146
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.

147
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The effect of this has been that, within the first year,

148
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,

149
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
which is over 50,000 people.

150
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And the second year went up to 75 percent.

151
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So I think we have a process by which

152
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
we can really penetrate into the market

153
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and reach everyone who needs it,

154
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and in this process of using technology, make sure

155
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that most don't need to come to the base hospital.

156
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And how much will they pay for this?

157
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We fixed the pricing, taking into account

158
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,

159
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.

160
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause)

161
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech

162
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or more advanced treatment and care?

163
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We designed a van with a VSAT,

164
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which sends out images of patients to the base hospital

165
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
where it is diagnosed,

166
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,

167
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it gets printed out, the patient gets it,

168
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --

169
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,

170
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and then this happens as a way of

171
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
bridging the technology competence.

172
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,

173
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because it focused on the non-customer,

174
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and then by reaching the unreached,

175
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
we're able to significantly grow the market.

176
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently

177
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
when you have very few ophthalmologists?

178
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,

179
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and then you see on the other side,

180
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
another patient is getting ready.

181
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So, as they finish the surgery,

182
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
they just swing the microscope over,

183
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,

184
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,

185
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.

186
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And then to support the surgeon,

187
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we require a certain workforce.

188
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,

189
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and then they really are the backbone of the organization.

190
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.

191
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.

192
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
With the result we have very high productivity,

193
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
very high quality at very, very low cost.

194
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So, putting all this together, what really happened was

195
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the productivity of our staff was

196
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
significantly higher than anyone else.

197
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Applause)

198
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
This is a very busy table,

199
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but what this really is conveying is that,

200
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
when it comes to quality, we have put in

201
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
very good quality-assurance systems.

202
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
As a result, our complications are significantly lower

203
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,

204
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.

205
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Applause)

206
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So the final part of the puzzle is,

207
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
how do you make all this work financially,

208
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
especially when the people can't pay for it?

209
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,

210
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,

211
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
nothing more, and often much less.

212
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.

213
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I think that has been a big savior, even now.

214
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away

215
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
what you have as a surplus.

216
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The result has been, over the years,

217
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the expenditure has increased with volumes.

218
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The revenues increase at a higher level,

219
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
giving us a healthy margin

220
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
while you're treating a large number of people for free.

221
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I think in absolute terms,

222
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,

223
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.

224
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

225
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But this really requires going beyond what we do,

226
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
or what we have done,

227
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.

228
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.

229
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We created competition for ourselves,

230
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and then we made eye care affordable

231
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
by making low-cost consumables.

232
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We proactively and systematically

233
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
promoted these practices to many hospitals in India,

234
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.

235
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
The impact of this has been that these hospitals,

236
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in the second year after our consultation,

237
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
are double their output

238
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and then achieve financial recovery as well.

239
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The other part was how do you address

240
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
this increase in cost of technology?

241
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
There was a time when we failed to negotiate

242
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,

243
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
so we set up a manufacturing unit.

244
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly

245
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.

246
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,

247
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and they're used in about 120-odd countries.

248
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,

249
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
or is it just India or developing countries?

250
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.

251
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent

252
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
of the volume of what the UK does,

253
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.

254
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And we do about 300,000.

255
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists

256
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
against the 70 trained by them,

257
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.

258
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So we're really comparing apples to apples.

259
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We looked at cost.

260
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Laughter)

261
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
(Applause)

262
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So, I think it is simple to say

263
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.

264
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I think there is more to it.

265
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.

266
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Maybe there is --

267
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the solution to the cost could be in productivity,

268
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,

269
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,

270
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
or regulations, their defensive practice.

271
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So, I think decoding this can probably bring

272
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
answers to most developed countries

273
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
including the U.S., and maybe

274
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Obama's ratings can go up again.

275
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Laughter)

276
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,

277
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
in conditions where the problem is very large,

278
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
which cuts across all economic strata,

279
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
where we have a good solution,

280
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I think the process I described,

281
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,

282
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
can give an answer,

283
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and there are many which fit this paradigm.

284
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.

285
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
There are many where this paradigm can now play,

286
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but I think probably one of the most challenging things

287
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
is on the softer side.

288
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Now, how do you create compassion?

289
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Now, how do you make people own the problem,

290
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
want to do something about it?

291
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
There are a bit harder issues.

292
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.

293
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.

294
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,

295
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
we identify with all that is in the world

296
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
so there is no exploitation.

297
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
It is ourselves we are helping.

298
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
It is ourselves we are healing.

299
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
TR: Thank you very much.

300
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.839,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So how many of you have ever been in a cave before?

2
0:00:15.576,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Okay, a few of you.

3
0:00:16.987,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When you think of a cave, most of you think

4
0:00:18.619,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of a tunnel going through solid rock,

5
0:00:20.78,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and in fact, that's how most caves are.

6
0:00:22.711,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Around this half of the country,

7
0:00:24.094,000 --> 0:00:26,000
most of your caves are made of limestone.

8
0:00:26.1,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Back where I'm from, most of our caves are made of lava rock,

9
0:00:29.048,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because we have a lot of volcanoes out there.

10
0:00:30.881,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But the caves I want to share with you today are made

11
0:00:32.931,000 --> 0:00:35,000
completely of ice, specifically glacier ice

12
0:00:36.044,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain

13
0:00:38.042,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.

14
0:00:41.125,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now Mount Hood's only one hour's drive from Portland,

15
0:00:44.188,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the largest city in Oregon,

16
0:00:45.911,000 --> 0:00:47,000
where over two million people live.

17
0:00:48.14,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer

18
0:00:50.387,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is to find a new cave

19
0:00:51.944,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and be the first human to ever go into it.

20
0:00:54.157,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer

21
0:00:56.124,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is to be the first one to make a map of a cave.

22
0:00:58.555,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now these days, with so many people hiking around,

23
0:01:00.763,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it's pretty hard to find a new cave,

24
0:01:02.688,000 --> 0:01:03,000
so you can imagine how excited we were

25
0:01:04.218,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to find three new caves

26
0:01:05.989,000 --> 0:01:07,000
within sight of Oregon's largest city

27
0:01:08.025,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and realize that they had never been explored

28
0:01:10.071,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or mapped before.

29
0:01:11.402,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was kind of like being an astronaut,

30
0:01:12.598,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because we were getting to see things and go places

31
0:01:15.285,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that no one had ever seen or gone to before.

32
0:01:18.569,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So what is a glacier?

33
0:01:20.303,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Well, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow,

34
0:01:22.216,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you know that it's really light,

35
0:01:23.499,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air.

36
0:01:27.22,000 --> 0:01:29,000
If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball,

37
0:01:29.63,000 --> 0:01:31,000
it gets really small, hard and dense.

38
0:01:31.828,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Well, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows

39
0:01:33.58,000 --> 0:01:34,000
over 20 feet a year,

40
0:01:35.361,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it crushes the air out of it

41
0:01:37.304,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and gradually forms it into hard blue ice.

42
0:01:40.485,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now each year, more and more ice stacks up on top of it,

43
0:01:43.445,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and eventually it gets so heavy

44
0:01:45.357,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that it starts to slide down the mountain

45
0:01:47.143,000 --> 0:01:48,000
under its own weight,

46
0:01:48.581,000 --> 0:01:5,000
forming a slow-moving river of ice.

47
0:01:50.879,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When ice packed like that starts to move,

48
0:01:53.224,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we call it a glacier, and we give it a name.

49
0:01:55.334,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The name of the glacier these caves are formed in

50
0:01:57.154,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is the Sandy Glacier.

51
0:01:58.83,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,

52
0:02:02.283,000 --> 0:02:03,000
it melts in the summer sun,

53
0:02:03.95,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice,

54
0:02:06.809,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier,

55
0:02:09.686,000 --> 0:02:1,000
forming big networks of caves,

56
0:02:11.614,000 --> 0:02:14,000
sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock.

57
0:02:14.919,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now the crazy thing about glacier caves

58
0:02:16.991,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is that each year, new tunnels form.

59
0:02:20.098,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Different waterfalls pop up or move around

60
0:02:22.091,000 --> 0:02:24,000
from place to place inside the cave.

61
0:02:24.223,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Warm water from the top of the ice

62
0:02:26.068,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is boring its way down,

63
0:02:27.545,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and warm air from below the mountain

64
0:02:29.485,000 --> 0:02:31,000
actually rises up, gets into the cave,

65
0:02:31.926,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and melts the ceilings back taller and taller.

66
0:02:34.469,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But the weirdest thing about glacier caves

67
0:02:36.596,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is that the entire cave is moving,

68
0:02:38.702,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because it's formed inside a block of ice

69
0:02:40.582,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the size of a small city

70
0:02:42.273,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that's slowly sliding down the mountain.

71
0:02:44.67,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now this is Brent McGregor,

72
0:02:46.497,000 --> 0:02:47,000
my cave exploration partner.

73
0:02:48.469,000 --> 0:02:5,000
He and I have both been exploring caves a long time

74
0:02:51.084,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and we've been climbing mountains a long time,

75
0:02:53.052,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before.

76
0:02:56.132,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video

77
0:02:59.177,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves.

78
0:03:02.804,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There were no GPS coordinates for it,

79
0:03:04.824,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and all we knew was that it was somewhere

80
0:03:06.367,000 --> 0:03:07,000
out on the Sandy Glacier.

81
0:03:08.047,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,

82
0:03:10.646,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and we found a big crack in the ice.

83
0:03:12.624,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We had to build snow and ice anchors

84
0:03:14.825,000 --> 0:03:17,000
so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole.

85
0:03:18.017,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is me looking into the entrance crevasse.

86
0:03:20.753,000 --> 0:03:22,000
At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel

87
0:03:23.304,000 --> 0:03:24,000
going right up the mountain

88
0:03:24.795,000 --> 0:03:26,000
underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.

89
0:03:27.328,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We followed this cave back for about a half mile

90
0:03:29.732,000 --> 0:03:3,000
until it came to an end,

91
0:03:31.371,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and then with the help of our survey tools

92
0:03:33.497,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we made a three-dimensional map of the cave

93
0:03:35.565,000 --> 0:03:36,000
on our way back out.

94
0:03:37.088,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So how do you map a cave?

95
0:03:39.146,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps

96
0:03:41.874,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels.

97
0:03:45.098,000 --> 0:03:46,000
To make a cave map, you have to set up

98
0:03:46.702,000 --> 0:03:48,000
survey stations every few feet inside the cave,

99
0:03:49.597,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations.

100
0:03:52.888,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Then you use a compass and an inclinometer

101
0:03:55.327,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to measure the direction the cave is headed

102
0:03:57.263,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.

103
0:03:59.979,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now those of you taking trigonometry,

104
0:04:01.709,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that particular type of math is very useful

105
0:04:03.82,000 --> 0:04:04,000
for making maps like this

106
0:04:05.353,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because it allows you to measure heights and distances

107
0:04:07.598,000 --> 0:04:08,000
without actually having to go there.

108
0:04:09.503,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,

109
0:04:11.882,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the more useful I found all that math

110
0:04:13.913,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that I originally hated in school to be.

111
0:04:16.155,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So when you're done surveying,

112
0:04:18.028,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you take all this data and you punch it into a computer

113
0:04:20.455,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and you find someone that can draw really well,

114
0:04:23.075,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and you have them draft up a map

115
0:04:24.723,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that looks something like this,

116
0:04:26.276,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage

117
0:04:29.544,000 --> 0:04:31,000
as well as a profile view of the passage,

118
0:04:31.994,000 --> 0:04:32,000
kind of like an ant farm view.

119
0:04:33.714,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave

120
0:04:35.713,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow.

121
0:04:38.761,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now later this summer, as more snow melted off the glacier,

122
0:04:41.273,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we found more caves, and we realized they were all connected.

123
0:04:44.94,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon,

124
0:04:47.099,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Brent discovered this new cave not very far away.

125
0:04:50.119,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The inside of it was coated with ice,

126
0:04:52.258,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons

127
0:04:55.185,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so we could walk around without slipping.

128
0:04:57.489,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This cave was amazing.

129
0:04:59.35,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green

130
0:05:01.606,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because the sunlight from far above

131
0:05:03.344,000 --> 0:05:05,000
was shining through the ice and lighting it all up.

132
0:05:06.319,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And we couldn't understand why this cave

133
0:05:08.227,000 --> 0:05:09,000
was so much colder than Snow Dragon

134
0:05:09.873,000 --> 0:05:11,000
until we got to the end and we found out why.

135
0:05:12.782,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin

136
0:05:15.7,000 --> 0:05:18,000
going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier.

137
0:05:19.335,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Cold air from the top of the mountain

138
0:05:21.146,000 --> 0:05:23,000
was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave,

139
0:05:23.96,000 --> 0:05:25,000
freezing everything inside of it.

140
0:05:26.043,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And we were so excited about finding this new pit,

141
0:05:28.254,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we actually came back in January the following year

142
0:05:30.562,000 --> 0:05:32,000
so we could be the first ones to explore it.

143
0:05:33.357,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It was so cold outside,

144
0:05:34.782,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we actually had to sleep inside the cave.

145
0:05:37.04,000 --> 0:05:4,000
There's our camp on the left side of this entrance room.

146
0:05:40.768,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The next morning, we climbed out of the cave

147
0:05:43.377,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,

148
0:05:45.386,000 --> 0:05:47,000
where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit

149
0:05:47.614,000 --> 0:05:48,000
for the very first time.

150
0:05:49.381,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Brent named this cave Pure Imagination,

151
0:05:51.468,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there

152
0:05:53.485,000 --> 0:05:55,000
were beyond what we could have ever imagined.

153
0:05:56.067,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So besides really cool ice, what else is inside these caves?

154
0:05:59.23,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Well not too much lives in them because they're so cold

155
0:06:01.816,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and the entrance is actually covered up with snow

156
0:06:03.826,000 --> 0:06:04,000
for about eight months of the year.

157
0:06:05.535,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But there are some really cool things in there.

158
0:06:07.471,000 --> 0:06:09,000
There's weird bacteria living in the water

159
0:06:09.834,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that actually eat and digest rocks

160
0:06:12.098,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to make their own food

161
0:06:13.452,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to live under this ice.

162
0:06:15.168,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In fact, this past summer, scientists collected

163
0:06:17.27,000 --> 0:06:18,000
samples of water and ice

164
0:06:19.1,000 --> 0:06:21,000
specifically to see if things called extremophiles,

165
0:06:22.035,000 --> 0:06:25,000
tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions,

166
0:06:25.874,000 --> 0:06:26,000
might be living under the ice,

167
0:06:27.311,000 --> 0:06:3,000
kind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday.

168
0:06:30.989,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Another really cool things is that,

169
0:06:32.45,000 --> 0:06:35,000
as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die,

170
0:06:35.706,000 --> 0:06:36,000
they get buried in the snow

171
0:06:37.35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and gradually become part of the glacier,

172
0:06:39.14,000 --> 0:06:41,000
sinking deeper and deeper into the ice.

173
0:06:41.514,000 --> 0:06:44,000
As these caves form and melt their way up into the ice,

174
0:06:44.757,000 --> 0:06:46,000
they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling

175
0:06:47.206,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and fall onto the cave floor, where we end up finding them.

176
0:06:49.935,000 --> 0:06:52,000
For example, this is a noble fir seed we found.

177
0:06:52.961,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,

178
0:06:55.186,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and it's just now starting to sprout.

179
0:06:57.895,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This mallard duck feather

180
0:06:59.59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
was found over 1,800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave.

181
0:07:02.911,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This duck died on the surface of the glacier long, long ago,

182
0:07:05.869,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice

183
0:07:09.324,000 --> 0:07:11,000
before falling inside the cave.

184
0:07:11.508,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And this beautiful quartz crystal

185
0:07:13.04,000 --> 0:07:15,000
was also found in the back of Snow Dragon.

186
0:07:15.165,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Even now, Brent and I find it hard to believe

187
0:07:17.437,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard,

188
0:07:20.781,000 --> 0:07:22,000
hidden away, just waiting to be found.

189
0:07:23.481,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Like I said earlier, the idea of discovering

190
0:07:25.754,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in this busy world we live in

191
0:07:27.161,000 --> 0:07:29,000
kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now,

192
0:07:30.061,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but that's not true.

193
0:07:31.559,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Every year, new caves get discovered

194
0:07:33.837,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that no one has ever been in before.

195
0:07:35.602,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So it's actually not too late for one of you

196
0:07:37.849,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to become a discoverer yourself.

197
0:07:39.71,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You just have to be willing to look

198
0:07:41.571,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and go where people don't often go

199
0:07:44.207,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and focus your eyes and your mind

200
0:07:46.185,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to recognize the discovery when you see it,

201
0:07:48.402,000 --> 0:07:5,000
because it might be in your own backyard.

202
0:07:50.733,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Thank you very much.

203
0:07:52.587,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Applause)

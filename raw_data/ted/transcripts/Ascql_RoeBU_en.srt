1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And so here's the challenge:

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I want you to help me create a fully 3D, dynamic, parameterized contact model.

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The translation of that is, could you help me build a foot?

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And it is a true challenge, and I do want you to help me.

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Of course, in the challenge there is a prize.

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's not quite the TED Prize, but it is an exclusive t-shirt from our lab.

9
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot.

10
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now if we want to design a foot, what do we have to do?

11
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We have to first know what a foot is.

12
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
If we go to the dictionary, it says, "It's the lower extremity of a leg

13
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking"

14
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
That's the traditional definition.

15
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But if you wanted to really do research, what do you have to do?

16
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet.

17
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So you go to the literature. (Laughter)

18
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Maybe you're familiar with this literature.

19
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The problem is, there are many, many feet.

20
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
How do you do this?

21
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I want you to help me do that in this next clip.

23
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
As you see this clip, look for principles,

24
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and also think about experiments that you might design

25
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in order to understand how a foot works.

26
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
See any common themes? Principles?

27
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What would you do?

28
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
What experiments would you run?

29
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Wow. (Applause)

30
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion

31
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot.

32
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's a design inspired by nature, but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at,

33
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many, many feet.

34
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere.

35
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw --

36
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in the probability of contact, the movement of that surface

37
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the type of footholds that are present.

38
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
If you want to study how a foot works,

39
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we're going to have to simulate those surfaces, or simulate that debris.

40
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
When we did that, here's a new experiment that we did:

41
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we put an animal and had it run -- this grass spider --

42
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
on a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed.

43
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But it didn't even slow down the animal.

44
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.

45
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now how could it do that? Well, look more carefully.

46
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
When we slow it down 50 times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris.

47
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The leg is acting as a foot.

48
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And in fact, the animal contacts other parts of its leg

49
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
more frequently than the traditionally defined foot.

50
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The foot is distributed along the whole leg.

51
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot,

52
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you can remove its foot.

53
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet.

54
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Without a foot, here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down.

55
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It can run the same speed without even that segment.

56
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
No problem for the cockroach -- they can grow them back, if you care.

57
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
How do they do it?

58
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Look carefully: this is slowed down 100 times,

59
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg.

60
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's acting, again, as a distributed foot --

61
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
very effective.

62
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now, the question we had is, how general is a distributed foot?

63
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it.

64
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Journalists, this is off the record; it's embargoed.

65
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Take a look at what that is!

66
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut.

67
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It was discovered by Christina Huffard

68
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and filmed by Sea Studios, right here from Monterey.

69
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We've also described another species of bipedal octopus.

70
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This one disguises itself as floating algae.

71
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen.

72
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Applause)

73
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain.

74
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there --

75
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
truly extraordinary.

76
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
In 1951, Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy.

77
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But we know that art imitates life,

78
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and it turns out nature, three million years ago, evolved the next animal.

79
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's a shrimp-like animal called the stomatopod,

80
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama:

81
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
it actually rolls, and it can even roll uphill.

82
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's the ultimate distributed foot: its whole body in this case is acting like its foot.

83
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So, if we want to then, to our blueprint, add the first important feature,

84
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we want to add distributed foot contact.

85
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Not just with the traditional foot, but also the leg,

86
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and even of the body.

87
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots?

88
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We biologically inspired this robot, named RHex,

89
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years.

90
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
RHex's foot started off to be quite simple,

91
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
then it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle.

92
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Why is that? The video will show you.

93
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Watch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.

94
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
What you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.

95
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Watch it go over this.

96
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You can see it here well on this debris.

97
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Extraordinary. No sensing, all the control is built right into the tuned legs.

98
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Really simple, but beautiful.

99
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, you might have noticed something else about the animals

100
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
when they were running over the rough terrain.

101
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And my assistant's going to help me here.

102
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
When you touched the cockroach leg -- can you get the microphone for him?

103
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
When you touched the cockroach leg, what did it feel like?

104
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Did you notice something?

105
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Boy: Spiny.

106
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Robert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts.

107
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach.

108
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

109
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Chris Anderson: Did you touch it?

110
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
RF: So if you look carefully at this, what you see is that they have spines

111
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and until a few weeks ago, no one knew what they did.

112
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
They assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures.

113
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We found that they're for something else -- here's a segment of that spine.

114
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction

115
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to pull the leg out from debris,

116
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface.

117
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now crabs don't miss footholds, because they normally move on sand --

118
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
until they come to our lab.

119
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh,

120
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
because they don't have spines.

121
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The crabs are missing spines, so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain.

122
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But of course, we can deal with that

123
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because we can produce artificial spines.

124
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We can make spines that catch on simulated debris

125
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and collapse on removal to easily pull them out.

126
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs,

127
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
as you see here, and then we tested them.

128
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Do we really understand that principle of tuning? The answer is, yes!

129
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This is slowed down 20-fold, and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris.

130
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

131
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
A little better than nature.

132
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So to our blueprint, we need to add tuned spines.

133
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots?

134
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Well, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails -- on smooth rails, as you see here.

135
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So why not add a spine? My colleagues did this at U. Penn.

136
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot,

137
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails. No problem!

138
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
How does it do it?

139
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action.

140
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Watch the leg come around, and you'll see it grab on right there.

141
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It couldn't do that before; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over.

142
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And watch again, right there -- successful.

143
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines

144
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces.

145
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
This is really, really difficult.

146
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But look at this animal do it!

147
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
One of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate.

148
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's extraordinary how fast it can do it --

149
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary.

150
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look --

151
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and doing, actually, terribly, with respect to grabbing on the surface.

152
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It looks, in fact, like it's swimming up the surface.

153
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid, if you look at it.

154
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The distributed foot, actually, is working more like a paddle.

155
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand.

156
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Watch its feet.

157
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's actually functioning as a paddle

158
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
even though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid.

159
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered

160
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself.

161
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Can you use this to make a better robot?

162
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Martin Buehler did -- who's now at Boston Dynamics --

163
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
he took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex.

164
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So here's RHex with paddles,

165
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot.

166
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
For rough surfaces, though, animals add claws.

167
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And you probably feel them if you grabbed it.

168
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Did you touch it?

169
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
CA: I did.

170
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
RF: And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws.

171
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University, one of my collaborators, is an extraordinary engineer

172
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing,

173
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot.

174
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit.

175
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So to our blueprint, let's attach claws.

176
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Now if we look at animals, though, to be really maneuverable in all surfaces,

177
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the animals use hybrid mechanisms

178
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that include claws, and spines, and hairs, and pads, and glue, and capillary adhesion

179
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and a whole bunch of other things.

180
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
These are all from different insects.

181
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
There's an ant crawling up a vertical surface.

182
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Let's look at that ant.

183
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
This is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here.

184
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This is when its foot's in the air.

185
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich.

186
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
You see what happens?

187
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is.

188
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Here from underneath is an ant foot,

189
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and when the claws don't dig in, that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything.

190
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It just extrudes.

191
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And this was a hard shot to get -- I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings.

192
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So it's pretty tough to do.

193
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
This is what it looks like close up --

194
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
here's the ant foot, and there's the glue.

195
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And we discovered this glue may be an interesting two-phase mixture.

196
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It certainly helps it to hold on.

197
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So to our blueprint, we stick on some sticky pads.

198
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here.

199
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Now we have something better here.

200
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
The gecko's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature.

201
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
These are its feet.

202
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They're -- almost look alien. And the secret, which they stick on with,

203
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
involves their hairy toes.

204
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
They can run up a surface at a meter per second,

205
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
take 30 steps in that one second -- you can hardly see them.

206
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
If we slow it down, they attach their feet at eight milliseconds,

207
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and detach them in 16 milliseconds.

208
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And when you watch how they detach it, it is bizarre.

209
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
They peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape.

210
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Very strange. How do they stick?

211
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
If you look at their feet, they have leaf-like structures called linalae

212
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
with millions of hairs.

213
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible.

214
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends,

215
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and that's the secret, because it allows intimate contact.

216
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The gecko has a billion of these 200-nanometer-sized split ends.

217
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And they don't stick by glue, or they don't work like Velcro, or they don't work with suction.

218
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone.

219
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So to our blueprint, we split some hairs.

220
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This has inspired the design of the first self-cleaning dry adhesive --

221
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the patent issued, we're happy to say.

222
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And here's the simplest version in nature,

223
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt

224
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane.

225
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And here's the first attempt to have it work on some load.

226
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
There's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields.

227
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
You could think of a thousand possible uses, I'm sure.

228
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Lots of people have, and we're excited about realizing this as a product.

229
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We have imagined products; for example, this one:

230
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
we imagined a bio-inspired Band-Aid, where we took the glue off the Band-Aid.

231
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We took some hairs from a molting gecko;

232
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
put three rolls of them on here, and then made this Band-Aid.

233
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
This is an undergraduate volunteer --

234
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
we have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them --

235
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that's actually just a red pen mark.

236
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
But it makes an incredible Band-Aid.

237
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It's aerated, it can be peeled off easily, it doesn't cause any irritation, it works underwater.

238
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research --

239
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we just wondered how they climbed up something --

240
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
can lead to things that you could never imagine.

241
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It's just an example of why we need to support curiosity-based research.

242
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Here you are, pulling off the Band-Aid.

243
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So we've redefined, now, what a foot is.

244
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The question is, can we use these secrets, then,

245
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to inspire the design of a better foot, better than one that we see in nature?

246
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Here's the new project:

247
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets --

248
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces.

249
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I call the new robot RiSE, for "Robot in Scansorial Environment" -- that's a climbing environment --

250
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot.

251
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And here is RiSE.

252
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
It's six-legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree.

253
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.

254
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
You have the audio? You can hear it go up.

255
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And here it is coming up at you, in its first steps up a wall.

256
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Now it's only using its simplest feet here, so this is very new.

257
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot.

258
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Mark Cutkosky, though, is taking it a step further.

259
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
He's the one able to build this shape-deposition manufactured feet and toes.

260
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
The next step is to make compliant toes,

261
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives.

262
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
So the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right,

263
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
attempt to make that climb, and ultimately put it on the robot.

264
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And that's exactly what he's done.

265
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
He's built, in fact, a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature.

266
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design.

267
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
So these are tuned toes -- there are six of them,

268
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint.

269
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
So this is not using any suction, any glue,

270
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and it will ultimately, when it's attached to the robot --

271
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
it's as biologically inspired as the animal --

272
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface.

273
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Here you see it, next, going up the side of a building at Stanford.

274
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
It's sped up -- again, it's a foot climbing.

275
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
It's not the whole robot yet, we're working on it --

276
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
now you can see how it's attaching.

277
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
These tuned structures allow the spines, friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs

278
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
to grab onto very challenging, difficult surfaces.

279
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sped up 20 times --

280
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor? OK?

281
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
You can visualize this now; it's not impossible.

282
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
It's a very challenging task. But more to come later.

283
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
To finish: we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built.

284
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
We've learned we should distribute control to smart parts.

285
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Don't put it all in the brain,

286
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
but put some of the control in tuned feet, legs and even body.

287
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
That nature uses hybrid solutions, not a single solution, to these problems,

288
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and they're integrated and beautifully robust.

289
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And third, we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology,

290
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there

291
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
to make -- potentially -- something better than nature.

292
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
So there's a clear message:

293
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
whether you care about a fundamental, basic research

294
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
of really interesting, bizarre, wonderful animals,

295
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
or you want to build a search-and-rescue robot

296
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
that can help you in an earthquake, or to save someone in a fire,

297
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
or you care about medicine, we must preserve nature's designs.

298
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

299
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Thank you.

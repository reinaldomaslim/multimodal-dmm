1
0:00:12.996,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Computers have become truly incredible.

2
0:00:16.523,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We are walking around with supercomputers in our pocket.

3
0:00:19.488,000 --> 0:00:21,000
How amazing is that?

4
0:00:21.666,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So it is disappointing

5
0:00:23.675,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that the way we use computers, the way we interact with them,

6
0:00:27.088,000 --> 0:00:3,000
hasn't really changed in the last 50 years.

7
0:00:30.521,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We still use a mouse and keyboards. We're clicking on screens and buttons.

8
0:00:34.329,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Mobile phones are the same.

9
0:00:36.526,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We're just using fingers instead of a mouse.

10
0:00:39.98,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So is that it?

11
0:00:41.641,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Is that what the future looks like?

12
0:00:43.47,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We're going to be stuck in the screens

13
0:00:45.539,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with our faces not seeing the world around us?

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That's not the future I imagine, or the future I'm attracted to.

15
0:00:53.043,000 --> 0:00:55,000
What I've been always interested in is things,

16
0:00:55.9,000 --> 0:00:58,000
physical things we use every day, like things on this table

17
0:00:59.058,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that the family doesn't pay attention to.

18
0:01:01.558,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Things tell our story. They tell who we are.

19
0:01:03.717,000 --> 0:01:04,000
They tell a lot about us.

20
0:01:05.938,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Let me give you an example.

21
0:01:08.075,000 --> 0:01:13,000
These are photographs of things a person touched during 24 hours.

22
0:01:13.107,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What can you tell about him?

23
0:01:15.266,000 --> 0:01:16,000
He loves his motorcycle. Right?

24
0:01:17.289,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The biggest thing in his picture.

25
0:01:19.398,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What can you tell about this girl?

26
0:01:21.774,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She spends all her time on the beach.

27
0:01:23.576,000 --> 0:01:24,000
There's a surfboard.

28
0:01:25.013,000 --> 0:01:26,000
She lives by the sea.

29
0:01:27.333,000 --> 0:01:29,000
What can you tell about this guy?

30
0:01:29.527,000 --> 0:01:3,000
He's a chef.

31
0:01:31.029,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Look at all the ingredients he touched during the day,

32
0:01:33.754,000 --> 0:01:34,000
while he was preparing the food,

33
0:01:35.367,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the computer is a tiny part of his life,

34
0:01:38.434,000 --> 0:01:4,000
this sad thing in the corner.

35
0:01:41.804,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So if we are using things all the time,

36
0:01:44.741,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and this is a big part of our lives,

37
0:01:46.86,000 --> 0:01:5,000
can things become the way for us to interact with our digital life?

38
0:01:52.795,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Can the world become your interface?

39
0:01:56.709,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That was my idea.

40
0:01:58.079,000 --> 0:02:,000
I've been working for 20 years on it.

41
0:02:00.772,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My idea is that in order to interact in digital life,

42
0:02:03.781,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you don't need to have screens and keyboards and mouses.

43
0:02:08.557,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You can interact with your digital life

44
0:02:10.763,000 --> 0:02:12,000
just by using the things you use every day.

45
0:02:14.057,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And to realize this idea, I need to solve three big challenges.

46
0:02:17.879,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Let me tell you about them.

47
0:02:20.51,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The first one, obviously: Is it even possible?

48
0:02:24.578,000 --> 0:02:27,000
How can you take an everyday thing you use every day

49
0:02:28.436,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and turn it into a computer interface?

50
0:02:31.57,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now I was inspired by the book "Hackers."

51
0:02:33.612,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I read it when I was a teenager,

52
0:02:35.293,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and one of the essential ideas of this book

53
0:02:39.331,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is that you can change the purpose of things

54
0:02:42.61,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by inventing new technology and then hacking into things

55
0:02:45.919,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and changing them.

56
0:02:47.161,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So I've been thinking what kind of technology I can invent

57
0:02:51.359,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so that I can hack into things you use every day

58
0:02:55.359,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and make them interactive.

59
0:02:57.763,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So when I was working on this thing, I invented this sensor

60
0:03:00.55,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which injects structured electric fields into objects

61
0:03:03.502,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and turns them into gesture interfaces.

62
0:03:05.446,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So this doorknob, unmodified, can become a gesture sensor.

63
0:03:09.005,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It can know how you're touching it. It can feel how you're touching it.

64
0:03:12.363,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It makes a circle, or can I grasp.

65
0:03:15.377,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And this doorknob isn't modified.

66
0:03:17.005,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There's nothing special about doorknobs.

67
0:03:18.985,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Anything can become interactive.

68
0:03:20.683,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What about plants?

69
0:03:22.948,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So plants are interesting, because with plants,

70
0:03:25.201,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they can know where you're touching.

71
0:03:26.941,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You can see the line moving up and down on the image.

72
0:03:29.519,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And that can turn into a musical interface.

73
0:03:31.703,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Musical tones)

74
0:03:36.515,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, we do have also practical applications:

75
0:03:39.817,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a calendar plant for those who are obsessed about practicality.

76
0:03:44.374,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:48.114,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We can give things a personality.

78
0:03:51.376,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Low notes changing in pitch)

79
0:03:53.193,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So in this particular example,

80
0:03:55.963,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the orchid can communicate to you

81
0:03:59.057,000 --> 0:04:02,000
through images and sounds.

82
0:04:02.311,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It doesn't like to be touched, so it's created these electric images

83
0:04:05.596,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that are hissing at you.

84
0:04:08.842,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This plant, for example,

85
0:04:10.857,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is more robust, it's a snake plant,

86
0:04:13.629,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and it likes playing with you. It engages you.

87
0:04:16.146,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So every thing can be different,

88
0:04:17.993,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and every thing can represent what it feels.

89
0:04:22.849,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So everything can be hacked, all the things, including your body.

90
0:04:26.916,000 --> 0:04:28,000
In this example, we hacked your body

91
0:04:29.195,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so you can measure how you're folding your hands

92
0:04:31.898,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and then using your hand gestures to control something else,

93
0:04:34.775,000 --> 0:04:37,000
so if you don't want to listen to some music thousands of times,

94
0:04:37.851,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you simply can cover your ears to turn it off.

95
0:04:40.978,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So everything can be hacked, and research is important,

96
0:04:43.939,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but the second challenge we have

97
0:04:46.041,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is how can we go from R and D, and prototypes, to real products?

98
0:04:50.915,000 --> 0:04:53,000
How can we make real things that are also interfaces?

99
0:04:56.138,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And you may ask yourself, who would do this?

100
0:04:58.67,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Silicon Valley?

101
0:04:59.976,000 --> 0:05:,000
Is it through Shenzhen?

102
0:05:01.534,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now the challenge there is that the world of things is huge.

103
0:05:05.757,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Every year, the apparel industry produces 150 billion garments.

104
0:05:10.597,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In comparison, the technology industry only makes 1.4 billion phones.

105
0:05:15.963,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The world of things is much bigger than the world of technology.

106
0:05:20.15,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The technology world cannot change the world of things.

107
0:05:23.665,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Instead, we need to create technology which changes makers of things,

108
0:05:28.984,000 --> 0:05:3,000
people who make your chairs and clothes and everything else,

109
0:05:31.819,000 --> 0:05:33,000
into makers of smart things,

110
0:05:33.86,000 --> 0:05:34,000
enable them to do that.

111
0:05:37.207,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So to test this challenge, we came up with a very simple idea and challenge:

112
0:05:42.611,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Can a tailor make a wearable?

113
0:05:46.603,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now we don't want to take a tailor

114
0:05:48.372,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and turn the tailor into an electrical engineer.

115
0:05:51.182,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We still want to have some tailors around.

116
0:05:54.214,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But what we would like to do is create technology

117
0:05:56.579,000 --> 0:06:01,000
which looks, feels and behaves like a raw material used by the tailor

118
0:06:02.48,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to make their clothes.

119
0:06:06.791,000 --> 0:06:1,000
For example, a touch panel made for a tailor would look like this,

120
0:06:10.959,000 --> 0:06:13,000
made out of textiles, so you can cut it with scissors and sew it in.

121
0:06:15.618,000 --> 0:06:17,000
At the same time, it has to retain the performance.

122
0:06:18.024,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The way to make this textile touch panel

123
0:06:20.704,000 --> 0:06:23,000
also requires a very different approach than for making consumer electronics.

124
0:06:24.395,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In our case, we have to go to the mountains of Tokyo

125
0:06:28.109,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to a small factory which was making kimono garments for generations.

126
0:06:31.799,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We worked with my collaborators,

127
0:06:34.291,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who were not engineers.

128
0:06:36.806,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It was an artisan who knows how to make things

129
0:06:40.208,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and an artist who knows how to make things beautiful.

130
0:06:44.121,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Working with them, we created one of the best yarns in the world,

131
0:06:49.066,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which consists of thin metallic alloys

132
0:06:51.532,000 --> 0:06:54,000
wrapped around with polyester fibers and cotton fibers.

133
0:06:54.788,000 --> 0:06:56,000
These yarns were made in the same machines

134
0:06:57.273,000 --> 0:07:,000
which were making yarns for kimonos for generations.

135
0:07:01.374,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We then took these yarns and gave them to the factory,

136
0:07:03.977,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which is making textiles,

137
0:07:05.889,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and we wove our smart textile using regular machines

138
0:07:09.334,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in a variety of colors and materials,

139
0:07:11.239,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and we gave those textiles to a tailor

140
0:07:14.369,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in Savile Row in London.

141
0:07:17.959,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So tailors are traditionalists, particularly in Savile Row.

142
0:07:20.961,000 --> 0:07:21,000
They don't use computers.

143
0:07:23.093,000 --> 0:07:25,000
They don't use machines.

144
0:07:25.82,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They use hands and they cut.

145
0:07:27.583,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They fit their products on the human body,

146
0:07:29.71,000 --> 0:07:3,000
not on 3-D avatars.

147
0:07:33.084,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Technology is not a part of their vocabulary,

148
0:07:35.291,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but they are modern people.

149
0:07:37.188,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They know how to use technology.

150
0:07:39.307,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So if technology can be formed and shaped

151
0:07:41.617,000 --> 0:07:44,000
like a button, like a textile, like something they can use,

152
0:07:45.014,000 --> 0:07:47,000
they absolutely can make a wearable,

153
0:07:47.578,000 --> 0:07:49,000
a garment which can place a phone call.

154
0:07:50.967,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Phone rings)

155
0:07:53.489,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So now we've proven that you can actually make a wearable,

156
0:07:56.387,000 --> 0:08:,000
not by an electronic company, but by a tailor.

157
0:08:00.918,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We worked and collaborated with Levi's,

158
0:08:03.774,000 --> 0:08:05,000
our partners and our neighbors,

159
0:08:06.78,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to make a real product,

160
0:08:08.477,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and this product is this jacket I'm wearing right now.

161
0:08:12.381,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You can buy it. It's on sale.

162
0:08:14.492,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It was made in the same factories which make all their products,

163
0:08:18.755,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and you have noticed

164
0:08:20.073,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I've been controlling my presentation from the sleeve of the jacket.

165
0:08:23.918,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I go like this, it goes forward. Like this, it goes backward.

166
0:08:28.905,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And of course, I can do more things.

167
0:08:30.674,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's not just to control a presentation.

168
0:08:32.603,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I can now control my navigation, control my music,

169
0:08:35.873,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but most importantly, it stays a jacket, it stays a thing,

170
0:08:39.894,000 --> 0:08:41,000
which makes me look great.

171
0:08:42.517,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:44.562,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Applause)

173
0:08:49.125,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And that's the most important thing.

174
0:08:51.625,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:55.425,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So OK, we proved we can turn things into interfaces.

176
0:08:58.356,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We proved that these things can be made by makers of things

177
0:09:02.379,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and not by technology companies.

178
0:09:03.999,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I look awesome. Are we done?

179
0:09:06.062,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:07.316,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Not yet.

181
0:09:08.498,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The third challenge:

182
0:09:10.055,000 --> 0:09:12,000
How can we scale?

183
0:09:12.249,000 --> 0:09:15,000
How can we go from one product to many products?

184
0:09:15.498,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And that's what we're working on right now.

185
0:09:17.536,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Let me tell you how we're going to do this.

186
0:09:19.655,000 --> 0:09:21,000
First of all, I want to make myself clear --

187
0:09:21.742,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I am not talking about the Internet of Things.

188
0:09:24.423,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I'm not talking about creating another gadget

189
0:09:27.876,000 --> 0:09:29,000
you get bored with and throw in the back of your drawer

190
0:09:30.788,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and forget about.

191
0:09:31.963,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I am talking about the foundational, important principle which guides my work:

192
0:09:36.693,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"Technology has to make existing things better."

193
0:09:41.299,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It makes them better by connecting them to your digital life

194
0:09:46.113,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and adds new usefulness and new functionality

195
0:09:50.187,000 --> 0:09:52,000
while remaining the same original purpose,

196
0:09:52.68,000 --> 0:09:53,000
not changing it.

197
0:09:54.824,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This jacket I am wearing can control my mobile phone and presentation,

198
0:10:00.084,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but it still remains a jacket.

199
0:10:02.828,000 --> 0:10:07,000
That means that once we start making all things interactive and connected,

200
0:10:07.965,000 --> 0:10:11,000
every thing would have its own set of actuators, displays and sensors

201
0:10:12.107,000 --> 0:10:14,000
specific for those things.

202
0:10:14.214,000 --> 0:10:16,000
A pair of running shoes does not need to have a touch sensor.

203
0:10:17.097,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Why would it have one?

204
0:10:18.945,000 --> 0:10:19,000
If you have a sensor,

205
0:10:20.302,000 --> 0:10:22,000
it should measure your running performance

206
0:10:22.381,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or knee impact,

207
0:10:23.556,000 --> 0:10:25,000
while remaining a great pair of shoes.

208
0:10:26.309,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Makers of things will have to start thinking

209
0:10:29.388,000 --> 0:10:33,000
what kind of digital functionality they have to offer to their consumers.

210
0:10:35.002,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They will have to become service providers,

211
0:10:38.755,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or they may become irrelevant.

212
0:10:41.262,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We will have to provide and create a service ecosystem

213
0:10:44.787,000 --> 0:10:46,000
just like we've done for mobile phones,

214
0:10:46.945,000 --> 0:10:48,000
where you have apps and services and everything else,

215
0:10:49.445,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and sometimes, you're still making a phone call.

216
0:10:52.081,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now to make this ecosystem possible, we have to avoid fragmentation.

217
0:10:56.461,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We have to avoid different interfaces for different people for different things.

218
0:11:00.343,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We have to create uniform user experience

219
0:11:02.454,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and, for that reason, we have to create a single computing platform

220
0:11:06.856,000 --> 0:11:07,000
which powers all those things.

221
0:11:08.801,000 --> 0:11:09,000
What is the platform going to be?

222
0:11:10.705,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And I think the answer is obvious:

223
0:11:12.441,000 --> 0:11:14,000
it's a cloud, cloud computing.

224
0:11:15.342,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now you cannot connect things directly to the cloud, obviously.

225
0:11:18.466,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So you have to develop a small device which can be plugged into all the things

226
0:11:23.92,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and make them connected to the cloud

227
0:11:25.66,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to unlock their potential and add new functionality.

228
0:11:29.323,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So let me show, for the first time, the real device which we've built.

229
0:11:33.137,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We are showing this for the first time.

230
0:11:35.716,000 --> 0:11:36,000
That's what it looks like,

231
0:11:38.223,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and it's a small device

232
0:11:39.397,000 --> 0:11:43,000
which will be connected to things we want to make smart

233
0:11:43.573,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and connected and interactive.

234
0:11:45.031,000 --> 0:11:46,000
How is it going to work?

235
0:11:46.206,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So on the back, you have a few electrodes.

236
0:11:50.318,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So when you plug them into different things,

237
0:11:53.342,000 --> 0:11:54,000
like here,

238
0:11:55.019,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the device will recognize where you're plugging them

239
0:11:57.814,000 --> 0:12:,000
and then reconfigure itself to enable specific functionality

240
0:12:01.815,000 --> 0:12:03,000
for this particular thing.

241
0:12:04.019,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We would like to give this device to makers of things,

242
0:12:06.599,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the people who make your clothing and furniture,

243
0:12:08.95,000 --> 0:12:11,000
so they can use it just like they use a button or a zipper.

244
0:12:13.239,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And what they're going to make with them is up to them.

245
0:12:15.835,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We don't want to dictate the use cases.

246
0:12:17.757,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We would like to let people who make those things --

247
0:12:20.906,000 --> 0:12:23,000
artists and designers, brands and craftsmen --

248
0:12:24.271,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to imagine and create this new world

249
0:12:27.493,000 --> 0:12:28,000
where things are connected

250
0:12:29.413,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and have all this new, exciting digital functionality.

251
0:12:32.148,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We don't need keyboards and screens and mouses to interact with your computer.

252
0:12:37.886,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So I've been working on this idea for 20 years,

253
0:12:40.465,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and now it's taking shape,

254
0:12:42.132,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and as it's taking shape, what we are realizing

255
0:12:44.98,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is that I always thought I was working on computer interfaces,

256
0:12:47.925,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I always thought of myself as an interaction designer,

257
0:12:50.473,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but I'm realizing that I'm not building interfaces.

258
0:12:54.235,000 --> 0:12:57,000
What I realized is that me and my team,

259
0:12:58.861,000 --> 0:13:,000
we're building a new kind of computer,

260
0:13:01.184,000 --> 0:13:02,000
an ambient computer.

261
0:13:02.903,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Thank you.

262
0:13:04.078,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Applause)

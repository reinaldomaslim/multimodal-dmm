1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So this is a story

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of a place that I now call home.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's a story of public education

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and of rural communities

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and of what design might do to improve both.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So this is Bertie County,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
North Carolina, USA.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
To give you an idea of the "where:"

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's about two hours east

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
driving-time from Raleigh.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And it's very flat. It's very swampy.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's mostly farmland.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The entire county

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So there's only 27 people per square mile,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which comes down to about 10 people

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
per square kilometer.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Bertie County is kind of a prime example

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in the demise of rural America.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We've seen this story all over the country

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and even in places beyond the American borders.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We know the symptoms.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's the hollowing out of small towns.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns.

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The brain drain --

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's the dependence on farm subsidies

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and under-performing schools

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and higher poverty rates in rural areas

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
than in urban.

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And Bertie County is no exception to this.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
like many communities similar to it,

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is that there's no

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
shared, collective investment

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the future of rural communities.

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
benefits rural communities,

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and yet 20 percent of our population lives there.

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It is the poorest county in the state.

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It has one in three of its children living in poverty,

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto."

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The economy is mostly agricultural.

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The county seat is Windsor.

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's home to only 2,000 people,

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and like a lot of other small towns

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it has been hollowed out over the years.

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
than occupied and in use.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You can count the number of restaurants in the county

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
on one hand --

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop,

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
there's no Internet cafe,

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
There isn't even a Walmart.

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Racially, the county

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is about 60 percent African-American,

66
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but what happens in the public schools

67
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is most of the privileged white kids

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
go to the private Lawrence Academy.

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So the public school students

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
are about 86 percent African-American.

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,

72
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and you can see the difference is pretty stark.

73
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So to say that the public education system

74
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in Bertie County is struggling

75
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
would be a huge understatement.

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There's basically no pool

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of qualified teachers to pull from,

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and only eight percent of the people in the county

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
have a bachelor's degree or higher.

80
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So there isn't a big legacy

81
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in the pride of education.

82
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In fact, two years ago,

83
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders

84
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
were passing the state standard

85
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in both English and math.

86
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,

87
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but I promise there is good news.

88
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The biggest asset, in my opinion,

89
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:

90
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is Dr. Chip Zullinger,

91
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
fondly known as Dr. Z.

92
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
He was brought in in October 2007

93
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
as the new superintendent

94
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to basically fix this broken school system.

95
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And he previously was a superintendent

96
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in Charleston, South Carolina

97
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and then in Denver, Colorado.

98
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
He started some of the country's first charter schools

99
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in the late '80s in the U.S.

100
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,

101
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and he is the reason that I now live and work there.

102
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So in February of 2009,

103
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design --

104
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which is a non-profit design firm that I founded --

105
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to come to Bertie and to partner with him

106
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
on the repair of this school district

107
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.

108
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And he invited us in particular

109
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because we have a very specific

110
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
type of design process --

111
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
one that results in appropriate design solutions

112
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in places that don't usually have access

113
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to design services or creative capital.

114
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Specifically, we use these six design directives,

115
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
probably the most important being number two:

116
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we design with, not for --

117
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,

118
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
it's not about designing for clients anymore.

119
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's about designing with people,

120
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.

121
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So at the time of being invited down there,

122
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we were based in San Francisco,

123
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and so we were going back and forth

124
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for basically the rest of 2009,

125
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
spending about half our time in Bertie County.

126
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And when I say we, I mean Project H,

127
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,

128
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.

129
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there.

130
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,

131
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because he would kill me if he knew I was using it

132
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because of the sweatsuits.

133
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But this is our front porch. We live there.

134
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We now call this place home.

135
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,

136
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we realized we had fallen in love with the place.

137
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We had fallen in love with the place and the people

138
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and the work that we're able to do

139
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in a rural place like Bertie County,

140
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that, as designers and builders,

141
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you can't do everywhere.

142
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
There's space to experiment

143
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and to weld and to test things.

144
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.

145
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
There's a nobility of real, hands-on,

146
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
dirt-under-your-fingernails work.

147
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,

148
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
there is a huge need.

149
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.

150
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.

151
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And so we saw an opportunity

152
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to bring design as this untouched tool,

153
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,

154
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and to be sort of the -- to usher that in

155
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
as a new type of tool in their tool kit.

156
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The initial goal became using design

157
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --

158
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that was why we were there.

159
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But beyond that, we recognized

160
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that Bertie County, as a community,

161
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
was in dire need of a fresh perspective

162
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of pride and connectedness

163
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and of the creative capital

164
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that they were so much lacking.

165
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,

166
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but then to figure out how to make education

167
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
a great vehicle for community development.

168
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches

169
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to the intersection of design and education.

170
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,

171
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but I feel pretty confident that they could work

172
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in a lot of other rural communities

173
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.

174
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So the first of the three is design for education.

175
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This is the most kind of direct, obvious

176
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
intersection of the two things.

177
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It's the physical construction

178
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of improved spaces and materials and experiences

179
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
for teachers and students.

180
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers

181
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and the outdated textbooks

182
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.

183
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways.

184
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.

185
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So traditionally, the computer labs,

186
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,

187
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
where they have to benchmark test every other week,

188
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the computer lab is a kill-and-drill

189
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
testing facility.

190
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,

192
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to create a more convivial and social space

193
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that was more engaging, more accessible,

194
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and also to increase the ability for teachers

195
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to use these spaces for technology-based instruction.

196
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So this is the lab at the high school,

197
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and the principal there is in love with this room.

198
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.

199
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers

200
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
of this educational playground system

201
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
called the learning landscape.

202
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects

203
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
through game play and activity

204
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and running around and screaming and being a kid.

205
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So this game that the kids are playing here --

206
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in this case they were learning basic multiplication

207
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
through a game called Match Me.

208
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,

209
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
one team on each side of the playground,

210
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the teacher will take a piece of chalk

211
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and just write a number on each of the tires.

212
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And then she'll call out a math problem --

213
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so let's say four times four --

214
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and then one student from each team has to compete

215
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to figure out that four times four is 16

216
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.

217
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires

218
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then your team wins.

219
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And the impact of the learning landscape

220
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
has been pretty surprising and amazing.

221
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,

222
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
a greater comfort level with the material,

223
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
especially with the boys,

224
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that in going outside and playing,

225
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
they aren't afraid to take on

226
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a double-digit multiplication problem --

227
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and also that the teachers are able

228
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to use these as assessment tools

229
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to better gauge how their students

230
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
are understanding new material.

231
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So with design for education, I think the most important thing

232
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,

233
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.

234
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.

235
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
He came out for one of our teacher-training days

236
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.

237
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

238
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So the second approach is redesigning education itself.

239
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
This is the most complex.

240
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's a systems-level look

241
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
at how education is administered

242
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and what is being offered and to whom.

243
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So in many cases this is not so much about making change

244
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
as it is creating the conditions

245
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
under which change is possible

246
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the incentive to want to make change,

247
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
which is easier said than done in rural communities

248
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and in inside-the-box education systems

249
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in rural communities.

250
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So for us, this was a graphic public campaign

251
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
called Connect Bertie.

252
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.

253
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And this was for a fund that the school district had

254
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection

255
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
in every home

256
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
with a child in the public school system.

257
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Right now I should say,

258
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
there are only 10 percent of the houses

259
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that actually have an in-home Internet connection.

260
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And the only places to get WiFi

261
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,

262
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
which I find myself squatting outside of a lot.

263
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Aside from, you know, getting people excited

264
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,

265
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it asked the school system

266
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to envision how it might become a catalyst

267
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
for a more connected community.

268
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls

269
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and to think about how they could play a role

270
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in the community's development.

271
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So the first batch of computers

272
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
are being installed later this summer,

273
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies

274
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
around how we might connect the classroom and the home

275
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to extend learning beyond the school day.

276
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,

277
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
which is where we are now,

278
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is: design as education.

279
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So "design as education" means

280
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that we could actually teach design within public schools,

281
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and not design-based learning --

282
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket,"

283
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but actually learning design-thinking

284
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
coupled with real construction and fabrication skills

285
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
put towards a local community purpose.

286
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It also means that designers are no longer consultants,

287
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but we're teachers,

288
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and we are charged with growing creative capital

289
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
within the next generation.

290
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And what design offers as an educational framework

291
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is an antidote

292
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction

293
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that so many of these school districts are plagued by.

294
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face,

295
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
it requires an active engagement,

296
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning

297
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in real ways.

298
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So we started thinking

299
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
about the legacy of shop class

300
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --

301
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
historically, has been something

302
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
intended for kids who aren't going to go to college.

303
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It's a vocational training path.

304
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's working-class; it's blue-collar.

305
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The projects are things like,

306
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.

307
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class

308
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
has gone away entirely.

309
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,

310
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but this time orient the projects

311
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
around things that the community needed,

312
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and to infuse shop class

313
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.

314
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So we took this kind of nebulous idea

315
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year

316
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
on writing this as a one-year curriculum

317
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
offered at the high school level to the junior class.

318
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And so this starts in four weeks,

319
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
at the end of the summer,

320
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and my partner and I, Matthew and I,

321
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process

322
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.

323
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And this is what it looks like.

324
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So over the course of two semesters,

325
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
the Fall and the Spring,

326
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the students spend three hours a day every single day

327
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
in our 4,500 square foot

328
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
studio/shop space.

329
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And during that time, they're doing everything

330
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,

331
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
coming back into the studio,

332
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
doing the brainstorming and design visualization

333
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to come up with concepts that might work,

334
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and then moving into the shop and actually testing them,

335
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
building them, prototyping them,

336
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
figuring out if they are going to work and refining that.

337
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.

338
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
They're paid as employees of Project H

339
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to be the construction crew with us

340
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to build these projects in the community.

341
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So the first project, which will be built next summer,

342
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is an open-air farmers' market downtown,

343
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year

344
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and home improvements for the elderly in the third year.

345
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So these are real visible projects

346
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that hopefully the students can point to and say,

347
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
"I built that, and I'm proud of it."

348
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So I want you to meet three of our students.

349
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
This is Ryan.

350
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
She is 15 years old.

351
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.

352
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,

353
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
because that's where her family is from, where she calls home,

354
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and she feels very strongly about giving back

355
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.

356
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So what Studio H might offer her

357
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is a way to develop skills

358
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.

359
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is Eric. He plays for the football team.

360
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
He is really into dirtbike racing,

361
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and he wants to be an architect.

362
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So for him, Studio H offers him

363
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,

364
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
everything from drafting to wood and metal construction

365
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to how to do research for a client.

366
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And then this is Anthony.

367
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside

368
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and doing anything with his hands,

369
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and so for him, Studio H means

370
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that he can stay interested in his education

371
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
through that hands-on engagement.

372
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,

373
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
so if he ends up not going to college,

374
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.

375
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
What design and building really offers to public education

376
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
is a different kind of classroom.

377
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So this building downtown,

378
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,

379
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is now the classroom.

380
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors

381
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
about what kind of food they buy

382
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and from where and why --

383
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
that's a homework assignment.

384
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer

385
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public --

386
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that's the final exam.

387
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And for the community, what design and building offers

388
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
is real, visible, built progress.

389
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It's one project per year,

390
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and it makes the youth the biggest asset

391
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and the biggest untapped resource

392
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in imagining a new future.

393
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year,

394
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
is a small story --

395
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
13 students, it's two teachers,

396
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
it's one project in one place.

397
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But we feel like this could work in other places.

398
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,

399
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
because it is so difficult

400
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
to do humanitarian work at a global scale.

401
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Because, when you zoom out that far,

402
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
you lose the ability to view people as humans.

403
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Ultimately, design itself is a process

404
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
of constant education

405
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
for the people that we work with and for

406
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and for us as designers.

407
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.

408
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,

409
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
we need to work outside of our comfort zones more,

410
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.

411
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So while this is a very small story,

412
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we hope that it represents a step in the right direction

413
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
for the future of rural communities

414
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and for the future of public education

415
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and hopefully also for the future of design.

416
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thank you.

417
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Applause)

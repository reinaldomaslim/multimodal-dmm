1
0:00:12.916,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The Philippines: an idyllic country

2
0:00:15.286,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with some of the clearest water and bluest skies on the planet.

3
0:00:19.063,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It is also the epicenter

4
0:00:20.679,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world.

5
0:00:24.494,000 --> 0:00:27,000
On the surface, it seems as if we are just a late bloomer.

6
0:00:28.326,000 --> 0:00:3,000
However, the reasons for our current epidemic

7
0:00:31.193,000 --> 0:00:32,000
are much more complicated

8
0:00:33.041,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and may foreshadow a global resurgence of HIV.

9
0:00:38.128,000 --> 0:00:42,000
While overall new cases of HIV continue to drop in the world,

10
0:00:42.633,000 --> 0:00:44,000
this trend may be short-lived

11
0:00:45.117,000 --> 0:00:48,000
when the next wave of more aggressive and resistant viruses arrive.

12
0:00:49.601,000 --> 0:00:54,000
HIV has a potential to transform itself into a new and different virus

13
0:00:55.447,000 --> 0:00:56,000
every time it infects a cell.

14
0:00:57.7,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Despite the remarkable progress we've made in reversing the epidemic,

15
0:01:01.787,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the truth is that we are just a few viral mutations away from disaster.

16
0:01:07.125,000 --> 0:01:1,000
To appreciate the profound way in which HIV transforms itself

17
0:01:11.128,000 --> 0:01:12,000
every time it reproduces,

18
0:01:12.825,000 --> 0:01:13,000
let's make a genetic comparison.

19
0:01:15.161,000 --> 0:01:18,000
If we look at the DNA variation among humans of different races

20
0:01:18.78,000 --> 0:01:19,000
from different continents,

21
0:01:20.417,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the actual DNA difference is only 0.1 percent.

22
0:01:24.469,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If we look at the genetic difference

23
0:01:26.587,000 --> 0:01:3,000
between humans, great apes, and rhesus macaques,

24
0:01:30.745,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that number is seven percent.

25
0:01:33.348,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In contrast, the genetic difference between HIV subtypes

26
0:01:37.483,000 --> 0:01:38,000
from different patients

27
0:01:39.082,000 --> 0:01:41,000
may be as much as 35 percent.

28
0:01:42.094,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Within a person infected with HIV,

29
0:01:44.865,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the genetic difference between an infecting mother virus

30
0:01:48.285,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and subsequent daughter viruses

31
0:01:50.634,000 --> 0:01:52,000
has been shown to be as much as five percent.

32
0:01:53.376,000 --> 0:01:57,000
This is the equivalent of a gorilla giving birth to a chimpanzee,

33
0:01:58.043,000 --> 0:01:59,000
then to an orangutan,

34
0:01:59.895,000 --> 0:02:,000
then to a baboon,

35
0:02:01.478,000 --> 0:02:03,000
then to any random great ape within its lifetime.

36
0:02:04.375,000 --> 0:02:07,000
There are nearly 100 subtypes of HIV,

37
0:02:08.34,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with new subtypes being discovered regularly.

38
0:02:11.448,000 --> 0:02:16,000
HIV in the developed world is almost all of one subtype:

39
0:02:16.784,000 --> 0:02:17,000
subtype B.

40
0:02:18.85,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Mostly everything we know and do to treat HIV

41
0:02:22.724,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is based on studies on subtype B,

42
0:02:26.305,000 --> 0:02:28,000
even though it only accounts for 12 percent

43
0:02:28.967,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of the total number of cases of HIV in the world.

44
0:02:33.182,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But because of the profound genetic difference

45
0:02:35.817,000 --> 0:02:37,000
among different subtypes,

46
0:02:38.191,000 --> 0:02:41,000
some subtypes are more likely to become drug-resistant

47
0:02:42.168,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or progress to AIDS faster.

48
0:02:44.763,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We discovered that the explosion of HIV cases in the Philippines

49
0:02:49.509,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is due to a shift from the Western subtype B

50
0:02:53.765,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to a more aggressive Southeast Asian subtype AE.

51
0:02:58.794,000 --> 0:03:,000
We are seeing younger and sicker patients

52
0:03:01.549,000 --> 0:03:02,000
with high rates of drug resistance.

53
0:03:04.195,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Initial encroachment of this subtype

54
0:03:07.092,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is already occurring in developed countries,

55
0:03:09.827,000 --> 0:03:12,000
including Australia, Canada and the United States.

56
0:03:13.591,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We may soon see a similar explosion of cases in these countries.

57
0:03:19.393,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And while we think that HIV is done

58
0:03:22.422,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and that the tide has turned for it,

59
0:03:24.444,000 --> 0:03:26,000
just like with real tides, it can come right back.

60
0:03:27.834,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In the early 1960s, malaria was on the ropes.

61
0:03:31.294,000 --> 0:03:32,000
As the number of cases dropped,

62
0:03:33.313,000 --> 0:03:35,000
people and governments stopped paying attention.

63
0:03:36.106,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The result was a deadly resurgence of drug-resistant malaria.

64
0:03:41.562,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We need to think of HIV

65
0:03:43.274,000 --> 0:03:46,000
not as a single virus that we think we've figured out,

66
0:03:46.995,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but as a collection of rapidly evolving and highly unique viruses,

67
0:03:53.213,000 --> 0:03:55,000
each of which can set off the next deadly epidemic.

68
0:03:56.474,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We are incorporating more powerful and new tools

69
0:04:00.034,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to help us detect the next deadly HIV strain,

70
0:04:03.193,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and this needs to go hand in hand with urgent research

71
0:04:07.245,000 --> 0:04:11,000
on the behavior and proper treatment of non-B subtypes.

72
0:04:12.201,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We need to convince our governments

73
0:04:14.035,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and our funding agencies

74
0:04:15.709,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that HIV is not yet done.

75
0:04:20.357,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Over 35 million people have died of HIV.

76
0:04:25.098,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We are on the verge of an AIDS-free generation.

77
0:04:28.532,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We need to pay attention.

78
0:04:30.749,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We need to remain vigilant

79
0:04:33.106,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and follow through.

80
0:04:34.627,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Otherwise, millions more will die.

81
0:04:37.554,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Thank you.

82
0:04:38.777,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
which is what we do research on at the University of California.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Just think about this problem for a second.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which you can hold in the palm of your hand.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
ask questions about the meaning of its own existence,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about the nature of God.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
How does this all come about?

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We're looking at neurons here.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
with other neurons in the brain.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And based on this, people have calculated

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So, how do you go about studying the brain?

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
One approach is to look at patients who had lesions

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
This is what I spoke about in the last TED.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Today I'll talk about a different approach,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, one recent discovery that has been made

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
by researchers in Italy, in Parma,

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues,

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is a group of neurons called mirror neurons,

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, it turns out there are neurons

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain,

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which have been known for over 50 years.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple,

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire.

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire,

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
commanding me to pull that object.

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But what Rizzolatti found was

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a subset of these neurons,

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something,

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And this is truly astonishing.

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Because it's as though this neuron is adopting

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the other person's point of view.

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of the other person's action.

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, what is the significance of these mirror neurons?

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Because to imitate a complex act

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view.

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So, this is important for imitation and emulation.

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Well, why is that important?

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Well, let's take a look at the next slide.

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important?

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation.

63
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
let's look at human evolution, it turns out

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.

67
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
of a number of skills that are unique to human beings

69
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
like tool use,

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,

71
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and the ability to read somebody else's mind

72
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and interpret that person's behavior.

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
All of that happened relatively quickly.

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Even though the human brain had achieved its present size

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
almost three or four hundred thousand years ago,

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And I claim that what happened was

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
by one member of the group, say the use of fire,

82
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,

83
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian,

86
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
instead of Darwinian.

87
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
A polar bear, to evolve a coat,

89
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.

90
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
A human being, a child, can just watch its parent

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
kill another polar bear,

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,

93
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and learn it in one step. What the polar bear

94
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
took 100,000 years to learn,

95
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.

96
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And then once it's learned this it spreads

97
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in geometric proportion across a population.

98
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.

100
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now there is another kind of mirror neuron,

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which is involved in something quite different.

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And that is, there are mirror neurons,

103
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.

104
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In other words, if somebody touches me,

105
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex

106
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in the sensory region of the brain fires.

107
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire

108
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
when I simply watch another person being touched.

109
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So, it's empathizing the other person being touched.

110
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, most of them will fire when I'm touched

111
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
in different locations. Different neurons for different locations.

112
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else

113
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
being touched in the same location.

114
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So, here again you have neurons

115
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which are enrolled in empathy.

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,

117
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation

118
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
merely by watching somebody being touched?

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.

120
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,

121
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain

122
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.

123
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So, empathize, by all means, with the other person,

124
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but do not actually experience the touch,

125
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
otherwise you'll get confused and muddled."

126
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Okay, so there is a feedback signal

127
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron

128
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.

129
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,

130
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
so you put an injection into my arm,

131
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,

132
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and there is no sensations coming in,

133
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
if I now watch you being touched,

134
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I literally feel it in my hand.

135
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In other words, you have dissolved the barrier

136
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
between you and other human beings.

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.

138
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense.

140
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
All that's separating you from him,

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
from the other person, is your skin.

142
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Remove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.

143
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.

144
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,

145
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and that is there is no real independent self,

146
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world,

147
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
inspecting other people.

148
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,

149
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.

150
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.

151
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And there is no real distinctiveness

152
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.

153
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.

155
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed

156
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else

157
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
being touched, you feel it in your phantom.

158
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now the astonishing thing is,

159
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,

160
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
massage the other person's hand,

161
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
that relieves the pain in your phantom hand,

162
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
almost as though the neuron

163
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
were obtaining relief from merely

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
watching somebody else being massaged.

165
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So, here you have my last slide.

166
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
For the longest time people have regarded science

167
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and humanities as being distinct.

168
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:

169
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
science on the one hand, humanities on the other;

170
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
never the twain shall meet.

171
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface

172
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,

173
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
representation of self,

174
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
what separates you from other human beings,

175
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
what allows you to empathize with other human beings,

176
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,

177
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which is unique to human beings. Thank you.

178
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

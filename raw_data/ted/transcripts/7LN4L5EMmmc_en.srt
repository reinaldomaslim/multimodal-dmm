There are no bad buttons, there are only bad people.

0:00:14.575,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How does that sound? OK?

7
0:00:23.311,000 --> 0:00:25,000
No one knows who invented the button.

8
0:00:25.407,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It might have shown up as early as 2000 BCE.

9
0:00:28.865,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It was decorative when it first started,

10
0:00:31.172,000 --> 0:00:33,000
just something pretty sewn onto your clothes.

11
0:00:33.42,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Then about 3,000 years later,

12
0:00:35.683,000 --> 0:00:37,000
someone finally invented the buttonhole,

13
0:00:38.438,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and buttons were suddenly useful.

14
0:00:40.289,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The button and the buttonhole is such a great invention.

15
0:00:44.064,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Not only does it slip through the buttonhole,

16
0:00:46.254,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but then it kind of falls into place,

17
0:00:48.123,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and so you're completely secure, like it's never going to open.

18
0:00:51.21,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The design of a button hasn't changed much since the Middle Ages.

19
0:00:55.059,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's one of the most enduring designs in history.

20
0:00:58.371,000 --> 0:01:01,000
For me, the best buttons are usually round.

21
0:01:01.616,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There's either a dome button with a little shank,

22
0:01:04.019,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or there's just this sort of round thing with either a rim or not a rim,

23
0:01:08.577,000 --> 0:01:09,000
either two holes or four holes.

24
0:01:10.465,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Almost more important than the button is the buttonhole.

25
0:01:13.198,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the way you figure that out is:

26
0:01:15.384,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the diameter of the button plus the width of the button,

27
0:01:18.098,000 --> 0:01:19,000
plus a little bit of ease.

28
0:01:19.452,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Before buttons, clothes were bigger --

29
0:01:22.524,000 --> 0:01:23,000
they were more kind of amorphous,

30
0:01:24.422,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and people, like, wriggled into them

31
0:01:26.223,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or just kind of wrapped themselves in things.

32
0:01:28.537,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But then fashion moved closer to the body

33
0:01:32.29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
as we discovered uses for the button.

34
0:01:34.545,000 --> 0:01:4,000
At one time, it was the one way to make clothes fit against the body.

35
0:01:41.014,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I think the reason buttons have endured for so long, historically,

36
0:01:44.713,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is because they actually work to keep our clothes shut.

37
0:01:47.725,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Zippers break;

38
0:01:48.901,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Velcro makes a lot of noise, and it wears out after a while.

39
0:01:51.814,000 --> 0:01:53,000
If a button falls off, you just literally sew that thing on.

40
0:01:54.679,000 --> 0:01:56,000
A button is kind of there for the long run.

41
0:01:57.195,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's not just the most elemental design ever,

42
0:02:00.553,000 --> 0:02:04,000
it's also such a crazy fashion statement.

43
0:02:04.653,000 --> 0:02:07,000
When I was a kid, my mom knit me this beautiful sweater.

44
0:02:08.042,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I didn't like it.

45
0:02:09.218,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And then I found these buttons,

46
0:02:10.784,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and the minute the buttons were on the sweater, I loved it.

47
0:02:13.602,000 --> 0:02:15,000
If you don't have good taste and you can't pick out a button,

48
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:17,000
then let someone else do it, you know?

49
0:02:18.503,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I mean that.

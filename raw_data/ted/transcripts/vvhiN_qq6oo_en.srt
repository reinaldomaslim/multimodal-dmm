1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is Shivdutt Yadav,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in Uttar Pradesh,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and he discovered

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that official records were listing him as dead.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
His land was no longer registered

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in his name.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
were also listed as dead.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Family members had bribed officials

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
by having the brothers declared dead,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
allowing them to inherit

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
their father's share of the ancestral farmland.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Because of this, all three brothers and their families

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
had to vacate their home.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
According to the Yadav family,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the local court has been scheduling a case review

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
since 2001,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but a judge has never appeared.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of people dying

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
before their case is given a proper review.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
led to this corruption.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
He was laid to rest in the Ganges River,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Photographing these brothers

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
was a disorienting exchange

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
because on paper they don't exist,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Yet, these men remain dead.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This quandary led to the title of the project,

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which considers in many ways

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that we are all the living dead

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and that we in some ways represent

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
ghosts of the past and the future.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So this story is the first of 18 chapters

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
in my new body of work titled "A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters."

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And for this work,

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I traveled around the world over a four-year period

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
researching and recording bloodlines

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and their related stories.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I was interested in ideas surrounding fate

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and whether our fate is determined

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
by blood, chance or circumstance.

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The subjects I documented

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
ranged from feuding families in Brazil

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to victims of genocide in Bosnia

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to the first woman to hijack an airplane

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and the living dead in India.

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In each chapter, you can see the external forces

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of governance, power and territory or religion

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
colliding with the internal forces

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of psychological and physical inheritance.

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Each work that I make

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is comprised of three segments.

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
On the left are one or more portrait panels

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in which I systematically order

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the members of a given bloodline.

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form,

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in which I construct

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
the narrative at stake.

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's a space that's more intuitive

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in which I present fragments of the story,

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
beginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And it's meant to kind of reflect

71
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,

72
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in a less linear form.

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So it's more disordered.

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And this disorder is in direct contrast

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to the unalterable order of a bloodline.

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In my past projects I've often worked in serial form,

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
documenting things that have

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the appearance of being comprehensive

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
through a determined title and a determined presentation,

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but in fact, are fairly abstract.

81
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction

82
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and find an absolute catalog,

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
something that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This led me to blood.

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
A bloodline is determined and ordered.

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But the project centers

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on the collision of order and disorder --

88
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the order of blood butting up against the disorder

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
represented in the often chaotic and violent stories

90
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that are the subjects of my chapters.

91
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
He was sent in 1907 to Palestine

93
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
by the Zionist organization

94
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to look at areas for Jewish settlement

95
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and acquire land for Jewish settlement.

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
He oversaw land acquisition

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company

98
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
whose work led to the establishment

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of a Jewish state.

100
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,

101
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I wanted to look at the early paperwork

102
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of the establishment of the Jewish state.

103
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I found these maps which you see here.

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And these are studies

105
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
commissioned by the Zionist organization

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
for alternative areas for Jewish settlement.

107
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In this, I was interested in the consequences

108
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of geography

109
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and imagining how the world would be different

110
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
if Israel were in Uganda,

111
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which is what these maps demonstrate.

112
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
These archives in Jerusalem,

113
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
they maintain a card index file

114
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration

115
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to Palestine, and later Israel,

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from 1919 to 1965.

117
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Chapter three:

118
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo

119
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya

120
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,

121
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
mental illness, evil spirits.

122
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
He's most often paid for his services

123
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in cash, cows or goats.

124
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But sometimes when his female patients

125
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
can't afford his services,

126
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
their families give the women to Jura

127
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in exchange for medical treatment.

128
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
As a result of these transactions,

129
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Jura has nine wives,

130
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
32 children

131
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and 63 grandchildren.

132
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.

133
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Two of his wives were brought to him

134
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
suffering from infertility

135
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and he cured them,

136
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
three for evil spirits,

137
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain

138
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love,

139
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
paying their families a total of 16 cows.

140
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
One wife deserted him

141
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.

142
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.

143
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's common among a privileged class

144
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
capable of paying numerous dowries

145
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and keeping multiple homes.

146
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Instances of prominent social and political figures

147
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in polygamous relationships

148
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
has led to the perception of polygamy

149
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
as a symbol of wealth, status and power.

150
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed

151
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
there are empty portraits.

152
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
These empty portraits represent individuals,

153
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
living individuals, who couldn't be present.

154
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.

155
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
They include dengue fever,

156
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
imprisonment, army service,

157
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
women not allowed to be photographed

158
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
for religious and cultural reasons.

159
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And in this particular chapter,

160
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it's children whose mothers

161
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot

162
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.

163
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Twenty-four European rabbits

164
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
were brought to Australia in 1859

165
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
by a British settler

166
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
for sporting purposes, for hunting.

167
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And within a hundred years,

168
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.

169
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,

170
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and it competes with native wildlife

171
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and damages native plants

172
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and degrades the land.

173
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Since the 1950s,

174
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Australia has been introducing lethal diseases

175
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
into the wild rabbit population

176
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to control growth.

177
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
These rabbits were bred at a government facility,

178
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Biosecurity Queensland,

179
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits

180
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and have infected them with a lethal disease

181
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and are monitoring their progress

182
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to see if it will effectively kill them.

183
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So they're testing its virulence.

184
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,

185
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
except for a few, which were euthanized.

186
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Haigh's Chocolate,

187
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in collaboration

188
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia,

189
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate

190
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.

191
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now this was done to counter

192
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the annual celebration of rabbits

193
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and presumably make the public more comfortable

194
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
with the killing of rabbits

195
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and promote an animal that's native to Australia,

196
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and actually an animal that is threatened

197
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
by the European rabbit.

198
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In chapter seven, I focus on the effects

199
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of a genocidal act

200
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
on one bloodline.

201
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So over a two-day period,

202
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
six individuals from this bloodline

203
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

204
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is the only work

205
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in which I visually represent the dead.

206
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But I only represent those

207
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre,

208
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe

209
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
since the Second World War.

210
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And during this massacre,

211
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys

212
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
were systematically executed.

213
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So when you look at a detail of this work,

214
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
you can see, the man on the upper-left

215
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is the father of the woman sitting next to him.

216
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Her name is Zumra.

217
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
She is followed by her four children,

218
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.

219
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister

220
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
who is then followed by her children

221
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who were killed as well.

222
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
During the time I was in Bosnia,

223
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son

224
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
were exhumed from a mass grave.

225
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I was therefore able to photograph

226
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the fully assembled remains.

227
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
However, the other individuals

228
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
are represented by these blue slides,

229
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
which show tooth and bone samples

230
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members

231
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to prove they were the identities

232
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of those individuals.

233
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They've all been given a proper burial,

234
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
so what remains are these blue slides

235
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
at the International Commission for Missing Persons.

236
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
These are personal effects

237
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
dug up from a mass grave

238
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that are awaiting identification from family members

239
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory,

240
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying,

241
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and also the Serbian soldiers later

242
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
during the times of the executions.

243
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial,

244
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
which from top to bottom

245
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
shows a Serbian scorpion unit

246
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
being blessed by an Orthodox priest

247
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
before rounding up the boys and men

248
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and killing them.

249
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Chapter 15 is more of a performance piece.

250
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009

251
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to select a multi-generational bloodline

252
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to represent China for this project.

253
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
They chose a large family from Beijing for its size,

254
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and they declined to give me

255
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
any further reasoning for their choice.

256
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
This is one of the rare situations

257
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
where I have no empty portraits.

258
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Everyone showed up.

259
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy

260
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
as it travels through the bloodline.

261
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda,

262
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the State Council Information Office

263
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.

264
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It controls all foreign media and image production

265
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
outside of China

266
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
from foreign media working within China.

267
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It also monitors the Internet

268
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and instructs local media

269
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
on how to handle any potentially controversial issues,

270
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
including Tibet, ethnic minorities,

271
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Human Rights, religion,

272
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
democracy movements and terrorism.

273
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
For the footnote panel in this work,

274
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
this office instructed me

275
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to photograph their central television tower in Beijing.

276
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me

277
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
when I left.

278
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
These are the descendants of Hans Frank

279
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who was Hitler's personal legal advisor

280
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and governor general of occupied Poland.

281
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits,

282
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
highlighting a complex relationship

283
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to one's family history.

284
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The reasons for these absences

285
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
include people who declined participation.

286
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
There's also parents who participated

287
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
who wouldn't let their children participate

288
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.

289
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Another section of the family

290
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
presented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence,

291
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because they didn't want to be identified

292
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with the past that I was highlighting.

293
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And finally, another individual

294
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
sat for me from behind

295
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and later rescinded his participation,

296
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.

297
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
In the footnote panel that accompanies this work

298
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp

299
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and an imitation of that stamp

300
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
produced by British Intelligence

301
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
with Hans Frank's image on it.

302
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It was released in Poland

303
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to create friction between Frank and Hitler,

304
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
so that Hitler would imagine

305
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Frank was trying to usurp his power.

306
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Again, talking about fate,

307
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I was interested in the stories and fate

308
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
of particular works of art.

309
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
These paintings were taken by Hans Frank

310
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
during the time of the Third Reich.

311
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.

312
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
They are Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine,"

313
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Rembrandt's "Landscape With Good Samaritan"

314
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and Raphael's "Portrait of a Youth,"

315
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
which has never been found.

316
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Chapter 12 highlights

317
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
people being born into a battle that is not of their making,

318
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but becomes their own.

319
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So this is the Ferraz family

320
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and the Novaes family.

321
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And they are in an active blood feud.

322
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
This feud has been going on since 1991

323
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco,

324
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and it involved the deaths

325
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
of 20 members of the families

326
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and 40 others associated with the feud,

327
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
including hired hit men, innocent bystanders

328
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and friends.

329
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Tensions between these two families date back to 1913

330
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
when there was a dispute over local political power.

331
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But it got violent in the last two decades

332
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and includes decapitation

333
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and the death of two mayors.

334
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Installed into a protective wall

335
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes,

336
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
who's the head of the Novaes family,

337
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
are these turret holes,

338
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
which were used for shooting and looking.

339
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco

340
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is one of the nation's most violent regions.

341
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice,

342
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
or an eye for an eye,

343
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
so retaliatory killings

344
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
have led to several deaths in the area.

345
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
This story, like many of the stories in my chapters,

346
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
reads almost as an archetypal episode,

347
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
like something out of Shakespeare,

348
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that's happening now and will happen again in the future.

349
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I'm interested in these ideas of repetition.

350
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So after I returned home, I received word

351
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that one member of the family

352
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
had been shot 30 times in the face.

353
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Chapter 17

354
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline

355
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and the absence of a history.

356
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage

357
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
are between the ages of six and 16.

358
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
This piece is ordered by age

359
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
because it can't be ordered by blood.

360
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,

361
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
only one child had been adopted.

362
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Children have to leave the orphanage at age 16,

363
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.

364
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
It's commonly reported in Ukraine

365
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that children, when leaving the orphanage

366
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
are targeted for human trafficking,

367
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
child pornography and prostitution.

368
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,

369
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and high rates of suicide are recorded.

370
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
This is a boys' bedroom.

371
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage

372
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and not enough warm clothing.

373
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Children bathe infrequently

374
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
because the hot water isn't turned on until October.

375
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
This is a girls' bedroom.

376
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs

377
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
as an industrial size washing machine and dryer,

378
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
four vacuum cleaners, two computers,

379
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
a video projector, a copy machine,

380
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
winter shoes and a dentist's drill.

381
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
This photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms,

382
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
shows a sign which I had translated when I got home.

383
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And it reads: "Those who do not know their past

384
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
are not worthy of their future."

385
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
There are many more chapters in this project.

386
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
This is just an abridged rendering

387
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
of over a thousand images.

388
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And this mass pile of images and stories

389
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
forms an archive.

390
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And within this accumulation of images and texts,

391
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I'm struggling to find patterns

392
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead

393
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
are just as coded as blood itself.

394
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
But archives exist

395
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.

396
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Something is said in the gaps

397
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
between all the information that's collected.

398
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And there's this relentless persistence

399
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
of birth and death

400
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and an unending collection of stories in between.

401
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
It's almost machine-like

402
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
the way people are born and people die,

403
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and the stories keep coming and coming.

404
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And in this, I'm considering,

405
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
is this actual accumulation

406
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
leading to some sort of evolution,

407
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
or are we on repeat

408
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
over and over again?

409
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Thank you.

410
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Applause)

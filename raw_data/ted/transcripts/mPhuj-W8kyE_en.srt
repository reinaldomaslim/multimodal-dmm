1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.

4
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003,

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and since then we and our growing global team of contributors

6
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions

7
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that are out there, right now and on the near horizon.

8
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items --

9
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas --

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
all providing a path to a future

11
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.

12
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.

13
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There are tons of places to go, online and off,

14
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
if what you want to find is the latest bit of news

15
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving.

16
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.

17
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We focus primarily on the planet's environment,

18
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but we also address issues of global development,

19
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies,

20
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower

21
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and much, much more.

22
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad,

23
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met

24
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.

25
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface,

26
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but to give you a sense of what we cover:

27
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
tools for rapid disaster relief,

28
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
such as this inflatable concrete shelter;

29
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
innovative uses of bioscience,

30
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines;

31
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices;

32
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
distributed power generation using solar power, wind power,

33
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
ocean power, other clean energy sources;

34
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future;

35
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now;

36
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and better urban design,

37
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
so you don't need to drive as much in the first place;

38
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of

39
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings;

40
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
distributed computing projects

41
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that will help us model the future of the climate.

42
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week

43
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging:

44
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs,

45
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the consequences of extreme longevity,

46
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.

47
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
As a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er,

48
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday,

49
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging

50
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
has convinced me, much to my own surprise,

51
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that successful responses to the world's problems

52
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
are nonetheless possible.

53
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes

54
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
can really blind you to the very possibility of success.

55
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed,

56
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...

57
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In difficult times, pessimism is

58
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence."

59
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The truth is, we can build a better world,

60
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and we can do so right now.

61
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago,

62
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and we're coming up with new ones all the time.

63
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We have the knowledge,

64
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and our understanding of the planet improves every day.

65
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Most importantly, we have the motive:

66
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.

67
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out

68
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and write up every day have some important aspects in common:

69
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment,

70
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science!

71
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging

73
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you

74
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a few concrete examples of how these principles combine

75
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in world-changing ways.

76
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools

77
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to make the invisible visible -- that is,

78
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to make apparent the conditions of the world around us

79
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that would otherwise be largely imperceptible.

80
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We know that people often change their behavior

81
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.

82
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
As a small example, many of us have experienced

83
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the change in driving behavior that comes from having

84
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a real time display of mileage showing precisely

85
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.

86
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations

87
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in how we measure and display aspects of the world

88
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.

89
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices

90
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that display how much power your household is using,

91
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights --

92
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
these can actually have a direct positive impact

93
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
on your energy footprint.

94
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you

95
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising

96
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or a natural disaster is unfolding,

97
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.

98
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions,

99
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps,

100
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
allow us to better understand the context and the flow

101
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of processes that affect us all.

102
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We can see world-changing values in research projects

103
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that seek to meet the world's medical needs

104
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
through open access to data and collaborative action.

105
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers,

106
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions

107
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
are far more important.

108
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science,

109
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
make cutting-edge scientific research free to all --

110
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
everyone in the world.

111
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And actually, a growing number of science publishers

112
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
are adopting this model.

113
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers

114
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
around the world worked together

115
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible

116
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
for some of the developing world's worst diseases:

117
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.

118
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That genome data can now be found

119
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
on open-access genetic data banks around the world,

120
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and it's an enormous boon to researchers

121
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
trying to come up with treatments.

122
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But my favorite example has to be the global response

123
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on

124
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.

125
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The U.S. National Research Council

126
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically

127
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason

128
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.

129
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we can see world-changing values

130
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in something as humble as a cell phone.

131
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room

132
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
who do not use a mobile phone --

133
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't?

134
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
For many of us, cell phones have really become

136
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
almost an extension of ourselves,

137
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and we're really now beginning to see the social changes

138
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that mobile phones can bring about.

139
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You may already know some of the big-picture aspects:

140
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
globally, more camera phones were sold last year

141
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
than any other kind of camera,

142
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens,

143
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books.

144
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.

145
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
A study last year showed a direct correlation

146
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
between the growth of mobile phone use

147
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and subsequent GDP increases across Africa.

148
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In Kenya, mobile phone minutes

149
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
have actually become an alternative currency.

150
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either,

151
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government,

152
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to the Blairwatch Project in the UK,

153
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.

154
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And it's just going to get more wild.

156
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video,

157
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket,

158
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.

159
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone

160
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
may be among the world's most important technologies.

161
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And in this rapidly evolving context,

162
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes

163
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
something far more than a medium for social interaction.

164
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I've long admired the Witness project,

165
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday,

166
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in his profoundly moving presentation.

167
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news

168
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal

169
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones

170
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to send in their recordings over the Internet,

171
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
rather than just hand-carrying the videotape.

172
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue

173
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
for documenting abuses,

174
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.

175
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.

176
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence

177
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of what's happening to the planet:

178
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds,

179
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
from activists and researchers

180
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to businesspeople and political figures.

181
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It would highlight the changes that are underway,

182
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but would more importantly give voice

183
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to the people who are willing to work

184
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to see a new world, a better world, come about.

185
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It would give everyday citizens

186
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.

187
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.

188
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness"

189
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand,

190
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
for what this imaginary project could aspire to,

191
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.

192
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project,"

193
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"Smart Mobs for Natural Security" --

194
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.

195
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness

196
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise,

197
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
especially environmental crimes

198
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.

199
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
That's understandable and important.

200
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet

201
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.

202
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.

203
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
In the best Worldchanging tradition,

204
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects

205
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.

206
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Earth Witness would show us two worlds:

207
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the world we're leaving behind,

208
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and the world we're building for generations to come.

209
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is

210
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we could do it today.

211
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The key components are already widely available.

212
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.

213
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet

214
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to always-on, widely available information tools.

215
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us

216
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.

217
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
You could even imagine a version of this scenario

218
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
in which people actually build their own phones.

219
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers

220
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
have come up with multiple models

221
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
for usable, Linux-based mobile phones,

222
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.

223
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
At the other end of the network, there'd be

224
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
a server for people to send photos and messages to,

225
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service,

226
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.

227
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about,

228
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but for those of you for whom that last sentence

229
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this:

230
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the online part of the Earth Witness project

231
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
would be created by the users, working together and working openly.

232
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle

233
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.

234
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot

235
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet

236
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.

237
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet,

238
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but students and engineers around the world

239
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers

240
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons --

241
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine,

242
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
using bird-mounted sensors

243
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.

244
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing

245
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
on a phone carried by a person.

246
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new:

247
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath,

248
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.

249
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes

250
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field,

251
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
uploading the data, displaying the results.

252
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act,

253
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
designing a prototype phone

254
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.

255
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors

256
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together

257
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels,

258
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
the presence of some biotoxins --

259
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.

260
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
You could see that some kind of system like this

261
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
would actually be a really good fit

262
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.

263
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information

264
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.

265
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And that's worth noting in particular.

266
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two

267
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
has been simply phenomenal.

268
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Developers around the world have come up with

269
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps,

270
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
from bus routes and crime statistics

271
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to the global progress of avian flu.

272
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see

273
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.

274
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished

275
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
if something like this ever existed.

276
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge

277
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
of what's happening on our planet environmentally

278
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
than could be gathered with satellites

279
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and a handful of government sensor nets alone.

280
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach

281
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to environmental awareness and protection,

282
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way --

283
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.

284
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And most important,

285
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.

286
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This is a system that could put the next generation

287
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
at the front lines of gathering environmental data.

288
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate

289
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the worst effects of climate disruption,

290
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
every little bit of information matters.

291
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us

292
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately,

293
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the improvement of the planet itself.

294
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Now, as I suggested at the outset,

295
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there,

296
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
so why have I spent the bulk of my time

297
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
telling you about something that doesn't exist?

298
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Because this is what tomorrow could look like:

299
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration

300
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.

301
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other.

302
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together,

303
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
making use of technological innovations and human communities alike,

304
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
we might just be able to fix it ourselves.

305
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models,

306
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
powerful tools, and innovative ideas

307
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.

308
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all;

309
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.

310
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
There's a staggering array of wonders out there,

311
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing:

312

success can be ours if we're willing to try.

313
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And as we say at Worldchanging,

314
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
another world isn't just possible; another world is here.

315
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.

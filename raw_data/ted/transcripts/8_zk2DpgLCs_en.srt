1
0:00:16.307,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft.

2
0:00:22.085,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Imagine a plane full of smoke.

3
0:00:25.622,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack.

4
0:00:29.603,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It sounds scary.

5
0:00:31.482,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Well, I had a unique seat that day.

6
0:00:33.367,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was sitting in 1D.

7
0:00:35.11,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.

8
0:00:38.296,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So I looked at them right away,

9
0:00:40.017,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds."

10
0:00:43.019,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The pilot had already turned the plane around,

11
0:00:45.215,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and we weren't that far.

12
0:00:46.509,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You could see Manhattan.

13
0:00:49.379,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Two minutes later,

14
0:00:50.61,000 --> 0:00:51,000
three things happened at the same time.

15
0:00:54.156,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.

16
0:00:58.453,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That's usually not the route.

17
0:01:00.21,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:01.922,000 --> 0:01:02,000
He turns off the engines.

19
0:01:04.662,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound.

20
0:01:07.981,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And then he says three words.

21
0:01:10.158,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The most unemotional three words I've ever heard.

22
0:01:13.015,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He says, "Brace for impact."

23
0:01:16.473,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.

24
0:01:19.114,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:21.801,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.

26
0:01:24.412,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Life was over.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.

28
0:01:31.45,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I learned that it all changes in an instant.

29
0:01:34.942,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We have this bucket list,

30
0:01:36.688,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we have these things we want to do in life,

31
0:01:39.055,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,

32
0:01:42.596,000 --> 0:01:44,000
all the fences I wanted to mend,

33
0:01:44.752,000 --> 0:01:46,000
all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.

34
0:01:48.523,000 --> 0:01:5,000
As I thought about that later on,

35
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I came up with a saying,

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which is, "I collect bad wines."

37
0:01:55.357,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.

38
0:01:58.69,000 --> 0:02:,000
I no longer want to postpone anything in life.

39
0:02:01.932,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.

40
0:02:06.498,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The second thing I learned that day --

41
0:02:08.604,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge,

42
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which was by not a lot --

43
0:02:13.468,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:15.067,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret.

45
0:02:18.772,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I've lived a good life.

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In my own humanity and mistakes,

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I've tried to get better at everything I tried.

48
0:02:25.118,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.

49
0:02:29.302,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter

50
0:02:33.577,000 --> 0:02:34,000
with people that matter.

51
0:02:36.057,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And I thought about my relationship with my wife,

52
0:02:38.46,000 --> 0:02:39,000
with my friends, with people.

53
0:02:41.122,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And after, as I reflected on that,

54
0:02:43.087,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.

55
0:02:45.638,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.

56
0:02:48.042,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.

57
0:02:50.806,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It feels great.

58
0:02:52.042,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I no longer try to be right;

59
0:02:54.366,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I choose to be happy.

60
0:02:57.314,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The third thing I learned --

61
0:02:58.799,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13."

62
0:03:03.264,000 --> 0:03:04,000
You can see the water coming.

63
0:03:04.724,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I'm saying, "Please blow up."

64
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces

65
0:03:08.427,000 --> 0:03:1,000
like you've seen in those documentaries.

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And as we're coming down,

67
0:03:13.545,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.

68
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.

69
0:03:21.963,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But it was very sad.

70
0:03:23.622,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I didn't want to go; I love my life.

71
0:03:26.467,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And that sadness really framed in one thought,

72
0:03:30.716,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which is, I only wish for one thing.

73
0:03:34.072,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.

74
0:03:37.757,000 --> 0:03:4,000
About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter --

75
0:03:41.258,000 --> 0:03:43,000
first-grader, not much artistic talent --

76
0:03:43.989,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:45.087,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Yet!

78
0:03:46.214,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:48.092,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid.

80
0:03:53.264,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And it made all the sense in the world to me.

81
0:03:55.844,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots,

82
0:03:59.609,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that the only thing that matters in my life

83
0:04:01.975,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is being a great dad.

84
0:04:04.152,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Above all, above all,

85
0:04:06.883,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.

86
0:04:10.58,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I was given the gift of a miracle,

87
0:04:13.129,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of not dying that day.

88
0:04:14.657,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I was given another gift,

89
0:04:16.494,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which was to be able to see into the future

90
0:04:19.045,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and come back

91
0:04:20.346,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and live differently.

92
0:04:23.158,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I challenge you guys that are flying today,

93
0:04:26.174,000 --> 0:04:28,000
imagine the same thing happens on your plane --

94
0:04:28.849,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and please don't --

95
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but imagine, and how would you change?

96
0:04:32.877,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What would you get done

97
0:04:34.181,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever?

98
0:04:37.881,000 --> 0:04:38,000
How would you change your relationships

99
0:04:39.852,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and the negative energy in them?

100
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?

101
0:04:45.004,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Thank you.

102
0:04:46.061,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause)

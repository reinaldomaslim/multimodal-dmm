2
0:00:12.389,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

3
0:00:15.629,000 --> 0:00:17,000
where I work as a curator.

4
0:00:18.189,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,

5
0:00:21.237,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and that it grows,

6
0:00:23.213,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and basically it means I collect dead animals.

7
0:00:28.565,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Back in 1995,

8
0:00:30.956,000 --> 0:00:34,000
we got a new wing next to the museum.

9
0:00:35.452,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It was made of glass,

10
0:00:37.593,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and this building really helped me to do my job good.

11
0:00:43.099,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The building was a true bird-killer.

12
0:00:47.225,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You may know that birds don't understand

13
0:00:49.803,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the concept of glass. They don't see it,

14
0:00:52.965,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so they fly into the windows and get killed.

15
0:00:56.571,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The only thing I had to do was go out,

16
0:00:58.811,000 --> 0:01:02,000
pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.

17
0:01:02.868,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:05.986,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And in those days,

19
0:01:07.765,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I developed an ear to identify birds

20
0:01:11.203,000 --> 0:01:16,000
just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.

21
0:01:16.789,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And it was on June 5, 1995,

22
0:01:20.771,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that I heard a loud bang against the glass

23
0:01:24.537,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that changed my life and ended that of a duck.

24
0:01:29.147,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.

25
0:01:34.942,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is the dead duck. It flew against the window.

26
0:01:38.126,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's laying dead on its belly.

27
0:01:39.82,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But next to the dead duck is a live duck,

28
0:01:43.175,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and please pay attention.

29
0:01:45.489,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Both are of the male sex.

30
0:01:50.41,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And then this happened.

31
0:01:53.083,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The live duck mounted the dead duck,

32
0:01:55.789,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and started to copulate.

33
0:01:58.452,000 --> 0:02:,000
Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.

34
0:02:01.177,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I said, "Something's wrong here."

35
0:02:03.925,000 --> 0:02:08,000
One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.

36
0:02:09.897,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I look. Both are of the male sex.

37
0:02:12.779,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Homosexual necrophilia.

38
0:02:17.418,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So I -- (Laughter)

39
0:02:22.463,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I took my camera, I took my notebook,

40
0:02:25.407,000 --> 0:02:3,000
took a chair, and started to observe this behavior.

41
0:02:30.818,000 --> 0:02:35,000
After 75 minutes — (Laughter) —

42
0:02:36.435,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I had seen enough, and I got hungry,

43
0:02:41.244,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and I wanted to go home.

44
0:02:43.883,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So I went out, collected the duck,

45
0:02:47.443,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and before I put it in the freezer,

46
0:02:49.399,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.

47
0:02:54.275,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,

48
0:02:57.883,000 --> 0:03:,000
so it was indeed of the male sex.

49
0:03:00.924,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds

50
0:03:04.219,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and only 300 possess a penis.

51
0:03:08.81,000 --> 0:03:1,000
[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)]

52
0:03:11.197,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I knew I'd seen something special,

53
0:03:15.131,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but it took me six years to decide to publish it.

54
0:03:20.553,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:23.408,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party

56
0:03:26.939,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or at the coffee machine,

57
0:03:28.678,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but to share this among your peers is something different.

58
0:03:31.988,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I didn't have the framework.

59
0:03:33.806,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,

60
0:03:36.851,000 --> 0:03:39,000
so I published "The first case of homosexual necrophilia

61
0:03:40.155,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in the mallard."

62
0:03:41.75,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And here's the situation again.

63
0:03:44.299,000 --> 0:03:46,000
A is my office,

64
0:03:46.851,000 --> 0:03:48,000
B is the place where the duck hit the glass,

65
0:03:49.315,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and C is from where I watched it.

66
0:03:52.373,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And here are the ducks again.

67
0:03:55.07,000 --> 0:03:57,000
As you probably know, in science,

68
0:03:57.077,000 --> 0:03:59,000
when you write a kind of special paper,

69
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
only six or seven people read it.

70
0:04:02.259,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:08.844,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But then something good happened.

72
0:04:11.444,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,

73
0:04:15.952,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:

74
0:04:20.805,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the Ig Nobel Prize."

75
0:04:24.488,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And the Ig Nobel Prize —

76
0:04:26.402,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter) (Applause) —

77
0:04:30.819,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the Ig Nobel Prize honors research

78
0:04:32.838,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,

79
0:04:35.915,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with the ultimate goal to make more people

80
0:04:38.699,000 --> 0:04:41,000
interested in science.

81
0:04:41.763,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.

82
0:04:45.899,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:48.588,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams

84
0:04:52.344,000 --> 0:04:53,000
didn't call me from Stockholm.

85
0:04:53.917,000 --> 0:04:55,000
He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

86
0:04:56.07,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,

87
0:04:59.017,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony

88
0:05:02.472,000 --> 0:05:04,000
held at Harvard University, and this ceremony

89
0:05:04.825,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is a very nice experience.

90
0:05:10.065,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.

91
0:05:13.346,000 --> 0:05:14,000
That's the first thing.

92
0:05:14.759,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And there are nine other winners who get prizes.

93
0:05:17.793,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton

94
0:05:21.169,000 --> 0:05:26,000
who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,

95
0:05:26.23,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans

96
0:05:30.209,000 --> 0:05:32,000
under farming conditions in Britain."

97
0:05:32.645,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:36.925,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And I think there are one or two more

99
0:05:40.081,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room.

100
0:05:43.002,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Dan, where are you? Dan Ariely?

101
0:05:46.729,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Applause for Dan.

102
0:05:48.651,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:51.953,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Dan won his prize in medicine

104
0:05:55.697,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine

105
0:05:59.872,000 --> 0:06:01,000
works better than low-priced fake medicine.

106
0:06:02.729,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So here's my one minute of fame,

108
0:06:09.818,000 --> 0:06:13,000
my acceptance speech,

109
0:06:14.295,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and here's the duck.

110
0:06:16.508,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.

111
0:06:21.43,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I'm going to pass it around.

112
0:06:24.104,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:29.393,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Yeah?

114
0:06:30.87,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You can pass it around.

115
0:06:32.179,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Please note it's a museum specimen,

116
0:06:34.56,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu.

117
0:06:39.978,000 --> 0:06:43,000
After winning this prize, my life changed.

118
0:06:43.984,000 --> 0:06:45,000
In the first place, people started to send me

119
0:06:46.114,000 --> 0:06:49,000
all kinds of duck-related things,

120
0:06:49.661,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and I got a real nice collection.

121
0:06:52.713,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:55.04,000 --> 0:07:01,000
More importantly,

123
0:07:01.704,000 --> 0:07:05,000
people started to send me their observations

124
0:07:05.776,000 --> 0:07:07,000
of remarkable animal behavior,

125
0:07:08.31,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,

126
0:07:11.482,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I know about it.

127
0:07:13.183,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:17.531,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This is a moose.

129
0:07:22.313,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's a moose trying to copulate

130
0:07:23.84,000 --> 0:07:26,000
with a bronze statue of a bison.

131
0:07:27.329,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This is in Montana, 2008.

132
0:07:31.122,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.

133
0:07:35.202,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is the Netherlands, 2011.

134
0:07:38.433,000 --> 0:07:42,000
These are cane toads in Australia.

135
0:07:42.709,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is roadkill.

136
0:07:43.964,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Please note that this is necrophilia.

137
0:07:47.208,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's remarkable: the position.

138
0:07:48.916,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.

139
0:07:53.348,000 --> 0:07:57,000
These are pigeons in Rotterdam.

140
0:07:59.895,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Barn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.

141
0:08:03.373,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is a turkey in Wisconsin

142
0:08:07.137,000 --> 0:08:13,000
on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.

143
0:08:13.216,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It took all day,

144
0:08:15.664,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and the prisoners had a great time.

145
0:08:20.795,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So what does this mean?

146
0:08:22.727,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I mean, the question I ask myself,

147
0:08:25.975,000 --> 0:08:26,000
why does this happen in nature?

148
0:08:27.676,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Well, what I concluded

149
0:08:29.487,000 --> 0:08:31,000
from reviewing all these cases

150
0:08:31.946,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is that it is important that this happens

151
0:08:35.914,000 --> 0:08:39,000
only when death is instant

152
0:08:39.961,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and in a dramatic way

153
0:08:42.176,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and in the right position for copulation.

154
0:08:45.113,000 --> 0:08:5,000
At least, I thought it was till I got these slides.

155
0:08:50.771,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And here you see a dead duck.

156
0:08:53.194,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's been there for three days,

157
0:08:55.786,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and it's laying on its back.

158
0:08:57.84,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So there goes my theory of necrophilia.

159
0:09:03.698,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Another example of the impact

160
0:09:05.088,000 --> 0:09:06,000
of glass buildings on the life of birds.

161
0:09:07.081,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.

162
0:09:10.426,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The only thing this bird did was fly against this window

163
0:09:16.312,000 --> 0:09:2,000
from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.

164
0:09:21.264,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Here he goes, and here's a short video.

165
0:09:24.213,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Music) (Clunk)

166
0:09:32.073,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Clunk)

167
0:09:46.377,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Clunk)

168
0:09:56.905,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Clunk)

169
0:09:59.128,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So what this bird does

170
0:10:01.175,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is fight his own image.

171
0:10:05.273,000 --> 0:10:07,000
He sees an intruder in his territory,

172
0:10:07.551,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and it's coming all the time and he's there,

173
0:10:10.623,000 --> 0:10:11,000
so there is no end to it.

174
0:10:12.466,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years --

175
0:10:15.649,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?

176
0:10:18.895,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's not. I show you here some slides,

177
0:10:21.943,000 --> 0:10:23,000
some frames from the video,

178
0:10:23.994,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and at the last moment before he hits the glass,

179
0:10:27.241,000 --> 0:10:29,000
he puts his feet in front,

180
0:10:29.252,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and then he bangs against the glass.

181
0:10:34.071,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.

182
0:10:38.715,000 --> 0:10:4,000
That's on June 5 every year.

183
0:10:41.417,000 --> 0:10:44,000
At five minutes to six in the afternoon,

184
0:10:44.649,000 --> 0:10:47,000
we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

185
0:10:48.563,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the duck comes out of the museum,

186
0:10:51.202,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and we try to discuss new ways

187
0:10:53.697,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to prevent birds from colliding with windows.

188
0:10:57.551,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And as you know, or as you may not know,

189
0:10:59.986,000 --> 0:11:01,000
this is one of the major causes of death

190
0:11:02.585,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for birds in the world.

191
0:11:04.09,000 --> 0:11:06,000
In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die

192
0:11:06.961,000 --> 0:11:09,000
in collision with glass buildings.

193
0:11:10.186,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant

194
0:11:16.113,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and we have a six-course duck dinner.

195
0:11:20.871,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I hope to see you

196
0:11:23.721,000 --> 0:11:26,000
next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,

197
0:11:26.776,000 --> 0:11:27,000
for Dead Duck Day.

198
0:11:28.123,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Thank you.

199
0:11:29.394,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Applause)

200
0:11:31.412,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Oh, sorry.

201
0:11:37.124,000 --> 0:11:39,000
May I have my duck back, please?

202
0:11:39.233,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

203
0:11:42.341,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thank you.

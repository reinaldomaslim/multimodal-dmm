1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I work in marketing, which I love,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but my first passion was physics,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
when I had a little less gray hair.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So he taught me

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that physics is cool

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because it teaches us so much about the world around us.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that physics can teach us something about marketing.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So quick show of hands --

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
who studied some marketing in university?

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Who studied some physics in university?

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Pretty good. And at school?

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Okay, lots of you.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So, physics and marketing.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"The force equals mass times acceleration."

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
should have studied a bit more carefully

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
before they ran this campaign.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But if we rearrange this formula quickly,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which means

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that for a larger particle -- a larger mass --

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it requires more force to change its direction.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's the same with brands:

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the more force is needed to change its positioning.

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And that's one of the reasons why

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
rather than try to persuade the world

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that Andersen's could stand for something

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
other than accountancy.

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It explains why Hoover

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
found it very difficult to persuade the world

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that it was more than vacuum cleaners,

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and why companies like Unilever and P&G

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
keep brands separate,

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
like Ariel and Pringles and Dove

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
rather than having one giant parent brand.

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the more force is needed

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to change its direction.

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The marketing is, the bigger a brand,

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the more difficult it is to reposition it.

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So think about a portfolio of brands

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or maybe new brands for new ventures.

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Getting a little more technical now.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So this says that

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it's impossible, by definition,

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the momentum of a particle,

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and you shine a light on it,

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
then the photon of light has momentum,

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which knocks the particle,

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
By measuring it,

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the act of measurement changes it.

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The act of observation changes it.

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's the same in marketing.

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Think about the group of moms

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
who stuff their trolleys

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
full of fresh green vegetables and fruit,

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but don't shop like that any other day.

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And if you think about the number of people

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
who claim in surveys

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to regularly look for porn on the Web,

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it's very few.

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So luckily, the science --

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
more digital media consumption,

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you can measure more what consumers actually do,

86
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
rather than what they say they do.

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So the physics is

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
you can never accurately and exactly

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
measure a particle,

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because the observation changes it.

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that try to measure what consumers actually do,

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
rather than what they say they'll do

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or anticipate they'll do.

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So next, the scientific method --

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
an axiom of physics, of all science --

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you can only disprove it.

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
What this means is you can gather more and more data

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
around a hypothesis or a positioning,

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.

102
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And only one contrary data point

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
can blow your theory out of the water.

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So if we take an example --

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory

106
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that the planets would rotate around the Earth.

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to blow that idea out of the water.

109
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And there are parallels for marketing --

110
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
you can invest for a long time in a brand,

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but a single contrary observation of that positioning

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
will destroy consumers' belief.

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Take BP --

114
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they spent millions of pounds over many years

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but then one little accident.

117
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Think about Toyota.

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It was, for a long time, revered

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
as the most reliable of cars,

120
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and then they had the big recall incident.

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And Tiger Woods, for a long time,

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the perfect brand ambassador.

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Well, you know the story.

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So the physics is

126
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that you cannot prove a hypothesis,

127
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but it's easy to disprove it --

128
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
any hypothesis is shaky.

129
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And the marketing is

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that not matter how much you've invested in your brand,

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
one bad week can undermine decades of good work.

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that can undermine your brand.

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy --

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the second law of thermodynamics.

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This says that entropy,

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
which is a measure of the disorder of a system,

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
will always increase.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
The same is true of marketing.

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
If we go back 20 years,

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
could pretty much define a brand.

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But where we are today, things have changed.

144
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You can get a strong brand image

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or a message

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and put it out there like the Conservative Party did

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
earlier this year with their election poster.

148
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But then you lose control of it.

149
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools

150
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that are available now to every consumer,

151
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it's impossible to control where it goes.

152
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Your brand starts being dispersed,

153
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it gets more chaotic.

155
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

156
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's out of your control.

157
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.

159
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But while this may be unsettling for marketers,

160
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
it's actually a good thing.

161
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This distribution of brand energy

162
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
gets your brand closer to the people,

163
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
more in with the people.

164
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which is ultimately good for your brand.

166
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, the lesson from physics is

167
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You can't fight it, so embrace it

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and find a way to work with it.

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So to close,

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me

173
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that physics is cool,

174
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and hopefully, I've convinced you

175
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.

176
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Thank you.

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

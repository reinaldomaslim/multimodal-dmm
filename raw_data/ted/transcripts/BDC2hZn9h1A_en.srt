1
0:00:15.063,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The archive.

2
0:00:17.317,000 --> 0:00:2,000
One may envision rooms and shelves

3
0:00:20.683,000 --> 0:00:22,000
stocked with boxes and cartons of old stuff.

4
0:00:23.623,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And yet, for those who are patient enough to dig through it,

5
0:00:27.322,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the archive provides the precious opportunity

6
0:00:30.123,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to touch the past,

7
0:00:31.901,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to feel and learn from the experiences

8
0:00:34.45,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of once-living people who now seem dead and buried deeply in the archive.

9
0:00:40.038,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But what if there was a way to bring the archive to life?

10
0:00:44.387,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Jon Michael Reese: "The world is thinking wrong about race."

11
0:00:47.25,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Melissa Joyner: "This country insists upon judging the Negro."

12
0:00:50.477,000 --> 0:00:51,000
JMR: "Because it does not know."

13
0:00:52.08,000 --> 0:00:53,000
AYGTK: What if one could make it breathe?

14
0:00:54.073,000 --> 0:00:56,000
MJ: "By his lowest and most vicious representatives."

15
0:00:56.755,000 --> 0:00:57,000
AYGTK: Speak.

16
0:00:57.929,000 --> 0:00:59,000
JMR: "An honest, straightforward exhibit."

17
0:00:59.992,000 --> 0:01:,000
AYGTK: And even sing to us,

18
0:01:01.335,000 --> 0:01:03,000
so that the archive becomes accessible to everyone.

19
0:01:03.776,000 --> 0:01:05,000
What would performing the archive look like?

20
0:01:06.331,000 --> 0:01:09,000
A performance that is not simply based on a true story

21
0:01:10.264,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but one that allows us to come face-to-face

22
0:01:13.622,000 --> 0:01:15,000
with things we thought were once dead and buried.

23
0:01:16.212,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Piano music)

24
0:01:17.253,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This is what "At Buffalo," a new musical we're developing,

25
0:01:20.03,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is all about.

26
0:01:21.212,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Using collections from over 30 archival institutions,

27
0:01:24.768,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"At Buffalo" performs the massive archive of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition,

28
0:01:30.596,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the first World's Fair of the 20th century,

29
0:01:32.643,000 --> 0:01:33,000
held in Buffalo, New York.

30
0:01:33.938,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now, if you've heard of this fair,

31
0:01:35.643,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it might be because this is where then-US president, William McKinley,

32
0:01:38.966,000 --> 0:01:39,000
was assassinated.

33
0:01:40.156,000 --> 0:01:42,000
For nearly 17 years,

34
0:01:42.403,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I've stayed inside the gates and the archive of this fair,

35
0:01:45.498,000 --> 0:01:46,000
not only because of that story

36
0:01:47.506,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but because of a real life-and-death racial drama

37
0:01:50.982,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that played out on the fairgrounds.

38
0:01:53.411,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Here, in a place that was like Disney World, the Olympics,

39
0:01:56.72,000 --> 0:01:58,000
carnivals, museums, all in one,

40
0:01:58.998,000 --> 0:02:02,000
there were three conflicting displays of what it meant to be black

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in the United States.

42
0:02:04.831,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The archive says white showmen presented

43
0:02:07.568,000 --> 0:02:09,000
a savage black origin

44
0:02:09.711,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in the form of 98 West and Central Africans,

45
0:02:12.87,000 --> 0:02:13,000
living and performing war dances

46
0:02:14.6,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in a recreated village called Darkest Africa.

47
0:02:18.633,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And across the street,

48
0:02:21.093,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a happy slave life,

49
0:02:23.99,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the form of 150 Southern black performers,

50
0:02:27.728,000 --> 0:02:28,000
picking cotton,

51
0:02:29.109,000 --> 0:02:31,000
singing and dancing minstrel shows

52
0:02:31.379,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in a recreated antebellum attraction called Old Plantation.

53
0:02:37.284,000 --> 0:02:38,000
As a response,

54
0:02:39.014,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the black Buffalo community championed the third display of blackness:

55
0:02:43.506,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the Negro Exhibit.

56
0:02:45.395,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Codesigned by African American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois,

57
0:02:49.038,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it curated photographs, charts, books and more,

58
0:02:53.697,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to show black Americans as a high-achieving race,

59
0:02:56.65,000 --> 0:02:58,000
capable of education and progress.

60
0:03:00.373,000 --> 0:03:02,000
When I first encountered this story,

61
0:03:02.648,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I understood from my own life experience

62
0:03:04.981,000 --> 0:03:07,000
what was at stake to have members of the African diaspora

63
0:03:08.021,000 --> 0:03:09,000
see each other like this.

64
0:03:10.046,000 --> 0:03:14,000
For me, as the child of immigrant parents from Ghana, West Africa,

65
0:03:14.212,000 --> 0:03:15,000
born in the American South,

66
0:03:16.18,000 --> 0:03:18,000
raised in Manhattan, Kansas,

67
0:03:18.949,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:20.148,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and having attended the same elite school as Du Bois,

69
0:03:23.299,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I could see that the Buffalo fair effectively pitted

70
0:03:26.061,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the black Northerner against the Southerner,

71
0:03:28.15,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the educated against the uneducated,

72
0:03:30.013,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and the African American against the African.

73
0:03:33.51,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And I wanted to know:

74
0:03:35.322,000 --> 0:03:4,000
How did these three distinct groups of black folk navigate this experience?

75
0:03:41.021,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Unfortunately, the archive had answers to questions like this

76
0:03:44.895,000 --> 0:03:46,000
underneath racial caricature,

77
0:03:47.196,000 --> 0:03:5,000
conflicting information and worse -- silence.

78
0:03:51.212,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Piano music)

79
0:03:54.331,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Still, I could hear musical melodies

80
0:03:58.763,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and see dance numbers

81
0:04:00.07,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and the rhythms of the words

82
0:04:01.478,000 --> 0:04:03,000
coming off the pages of old newspaper articles.

83
0:04:04.001,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And learning that this World's Fair

84
0:04:05.699,000 --> 0:04:08,000
had music playing everywhere on its fairgrounds,

85
0:04:09.665,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I knew that live, immersive, spectacular musical theater,

86
0:04:13.585,000 --> 0:04:16,000
with the latest technologies of our time,

87
0:04:16.625,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is the closest experience that can bring the archival story of the 1901 fair

88
0:04:21.284,000 --> 0:04:23,000
out of boxes and into life.

89
0:04:24.585,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Stories, like Tannie and Henrietta,

90
0:04:27.624,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a husband and wife vaudeville duo in love

91
0:04:30.433,000 --> 0:04:33,000
who become at odds over performing these "coon" minstrel shows

92
0:04:33.577,000 --> 0:04:35,000
while striving for their five-dollar-a-week dream

93
0:04:35.901,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in the Old Plantation attraction.

94
0:04:37.942,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Like African businessman John Tevi,

95
0:04:40.681,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from present-day Togo,

96
0:04:42.387,000 --> 0:04:45,000
who must outwit the savage rules of the human zoo

97
0:04:45.815,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in which he has become trapped.

98
0:04:47.95,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And stories like Mary Talbert,

99
0:04:51.514,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a wealthy leader of the black Buffalo elite,

100
0:04:54.014,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who must come to terms

101
0:04:55.24,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with the racial realities of her home town.

102
0:04:57.903,000 --> 0:04:59,000
MJ: "The dominant race in this country

103
0:04:59.952,000 --> 0:05:01,000
insists upon judging the Negro

104
0:05:02.014,000 --> 0:05:04,000
by his lowest and most vicious representatives."

105
0:05:04.569,000 --> 0:05:06,000
AYGTK: Like Old Plantation and Darkest Africa.

106
0:05:06.903,000 --> 0:05:09,000
MJ: "... instead of by the more intelligent and worthy classes."

107
0:05:10.117,000 --> 0:05:12,000
AYGTK: When fair directors ignored Mary Talbert

108
0:05:12.582,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the local black Buffalo community's request to participate in the fair,

109
0:05:16.141,000 --> 0:05:18,000
newspapers say that Mary Talbert

110
0:05:18.299,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and her club of educated African American women

111
0:05:20.911,000 --> 0:05:22,000
held a rousing protest meeting.

112
0:05:23.276,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But the details of that meeting,

113
0:05:25.117,000 --> 0:05:27,000
even down to the fiery speech she gave,

114
0:05:27.434,000 --> 0:05:28,000
were not fully captured in the archive.

115
0:05:29.45,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, "At Buffalo" takes the essence of Mary's speech

116
0:05:33.236,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and turns it into song.

117
0:05:36.251,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(All singing) We must, we are unanimous.

118

We must, we are unanimous.

120
0:05:46.027,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we're going to teach a lesson in Buffalo.

121
0:05:49.741,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It would benefit the nation

122
0:05:53.326,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to see our growth since emancipation.

123
0:05:57.389,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Colored people should be represented in this Pan-American exposition,

124
0:06:03.469,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it would benefit the nation

125
0:06:07.088,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to see our growth since emancipation.

126
0:06:11.516,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(All singing) They made a great mistake

127
0:06:18.351,000 --> 0:06:23,000
not to appoint someone from the race.

128
0:06:25.382,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We must, we are unanimous.

129
0:06:28.844,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We must, we are unanimous.

130

We must, we are unanimous.

131
0:06:33.939,000 --> 0:06:37,000
AYGTK: Mary Talbert successfully demands that the Negro Exhibit come to the fair.

132
0:06:38.805,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And to have the Negro Exhibit in Buffalo

133
0:06:41.186,000 --> 0:06:45,000
means that the musical must tell the story behind why Du Bois cocreated it ...

134
0:06:47.694,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and why Mary and the black elite felt it was urgently needed.

0:08:29.03,000 --> 0:08:34,000
against the page.

162
0:08:34.148,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The crisis has multiplied.

163
0:08:37.601,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Our people are lynched and died.

164
0:08:40.331,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Oh, Lord.

165
0:08:42.712,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Something must change.

166
0:08:50.762,000 --> 0:08:54,000
AYGTK: Something must change.

167
0:08:56.397,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"At Buffalo" reveals how the United States today

168
0:08:59.657,000 --> 0:09:02,000
stands at similar crossroads as 1901 America.

169
0:09:03.617,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Just as the name of Sam Hose filled newspapers back then,

170
0:09:07.196,000 --> 0:09:09,000
today's media carries the names of:

171
0:09:09.858,000 --> 0:09:1,000
JMR: Oscar Grant.

172
0:09:12.101,000 --> 0:09:13,000
MJ: Jacqueline Culp.

173
0:09:13.91,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Pianist: Trayvon Martin.

174
0:09:16.021,000 --> 0:09:17,000
AYGTK: Sandra Bland.

175
0:09:18.133,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And too many others.

176
0:09:20.834,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The 1901 fair's legacies persist

177
0:09:24.873,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in more ways than we can imagine.

178
0:09:30.315,000 --> 0:09:31,000
MJ: Mary Talbert

179
0:09:31.522,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and the National Association of Colored Women

180
0:09:33.647,000 --> 0:09:35,000
started movements against lynching

181
0:09:36.546,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and the myth of black criminality

182
0:09:38.561,000 --> 0:09:41,000
just as black women today started Black Lives Matter.

183
0:09:42.601,000 --> 0:09:44,000
JMR: And some of the same people who fought for

184
0:09:45.505,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and created the Negro Exhibit,

185
0:09:47.381,000 --> 0:09:48,000
including Du Bois,

186
0:09:49.316,000 --> 0:09:51,000
came to Buffalo, four years after the fair,

187
0:09:51.944,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to start the Niagara Movement,

188
0:09:54.159,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which set the groundwork for the creation of the NAACP.

189
0:09:57.53,000 --> 0:09:58,000
AYGTK: It's not just black folks

190
0:09:59.236,000 --> 0:10:01,000
who had a peculiar experience at the 1901 fair.

191
0:10:02.403,000 --> 0:10:04,000
An official handbook informed fair-goers:

192
0:10:05.334,000 --> 0:10:07,000
MJ: "Please remember:"

193
0:10:07.373,000 --> 0:10:08,000
JMR: "... once you get inside the gate,"

194
0:10:09.372,000 --> 0:10:11,000
AYGTK: "... you are a part of the show."

195
0:10:13.071,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Performing the archive in "At Buffalo"

196
0:10:15.165,000 --> 0:10:17,000
allows audiences to ask themselves,

197
0:10:17.792,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"Are we still inside the gates,

198
0:10:20.331,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and are we all still part of the show?"

199
0:10:29.072,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Music ends)

200
0:10:32.509,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Applause and cheers)

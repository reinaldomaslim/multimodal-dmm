1
0:00:12.37,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a lexicographer.

2
0:00:13.928,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I make dictionaries.

3
0:00:15.682,000 --> 0:00:16,000
And my job as a lexicographer

4
0:00:17.121,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is to try to put all the words possible into the dictionary.

5
0:00:20.841,000 --> 0:00:26,000
My job is not to decide what a word is; that is your job.

6
0:00:26.924,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Everybody who speaks English decides together

7
0:00:29.821,000 --> 0:00:31,000
what's a word and what's not a word.

8
0:00:32.153,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other.

9
0:00:37.305,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, sometimes when people are trying to decide whether a word is good or bad,

10
0:00:41.909,000 --> 0:00:42,000
they don't really have a good reason.

11
0:00:43.677,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So they say something like, "Because grammar!"

12
0:00:46.488,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:48.862,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I don't actually really care about grammar too much -- don't tell anybody.

14
0:00:52.425,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But the word "grammar," actually, there are two kinds of grammar.

15
0:00:55.564,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain,

16
0:00:58.434,000 --> 0:01:,000
and if you're a native speaker of a language

17
0:01:00.543,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or a good speaker of a language,

18
0:01:02.132,000 --> 0:01:05,000
it's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language.

19
0:01:05.531,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child.

20
0:01:08.552,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And here's an example:

21
0:01:10.189,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This is a wug, right?

22
0:01:11.714,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's a wug.

23
0:01:13.775,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now there is another one.

24
0:01:15.471,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There are two of these.

25
0:01:16.634,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There are two ...

26
0:01:17.923,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Audience: Wugs.

27
0:01:19.107,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Erin McKean: Exactly! You know how to make the plural of wug.

28
0:01:22.82,000 --> 0:01:23,000
That rule lives in your brain.

29
0:01:24.301,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You never had to be taught this rule, you just understand it.

30
0:01:27.25,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is an experiment that was invented by a professor at [Boston University]

31
0:01:30.879,000 --> 0:01:33,000
named Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.

32
0:01:34.024,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So we've been talking about this for a long time.

33
0:01:37.049,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, these kinds of natural rules that exist in your brain,

34
0:01:40.563,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they're not like traffic laws, they're more like laws of nature.

35
0:01:44.785,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And nobody has to remind you to obey a law of nature, right?

36
0:01:48.14,000 --> 0:01:5,000
When you leave the house in the morning, your mom doesn't say,

37
0:01:51.093,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"Hey, honey, I think it's going to be cold, take a hoodie,

38
0:01:53.972,000 --> 0:01:55,000
don't forget to obey the law of gravity."

39
0:01:56.439,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Nobody says this.

40
0:01:58.325,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature.

41
0:02:05.182,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So you can think of a word as like a hat.

42
0:02:08.046,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Once you know how hats work,

43
0:02:10.296,000 --> 0:02:12,000
nobody has to tell you, "Don't wear hats on your feet."

44
0:02:13.163,000 --> 0:02:16,000
What they have to tell you is, "Can you wear hats inside?

45
0:02:16.507,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Who gets to wear a hat?

46
0:02:18.264,000 --> 0:02:21,000
What are the kinds of hats you get to wear?"

47
0:02:21.396,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Those are more of the second kind of grammar,

48
0:02:23.818,000 --> 0:02:27,000
which linguists often call usage, as opposed to grammar.

49
0:02:28.121,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, sometimes people use this kind of rules-based grammar

50
0:02:32.255,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to discourage people from making up words.

51
0:02:35.043,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I think that is, well, stupid.

52
0:02:37.727,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So, for example, people are always telling you,

53
0:02:40.993,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"Be creative, make new music, do art, invent things, science and technology."

54
0:02:46.233,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But when it comes to words, they're like,

55
0:02:48.271,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Don't! No. Creativity stops right here, whippersnappers. Give it a rest."

56
0:02:53.004,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:54.421,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But that makes no sense to me.

58
0:02:56.142,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Words are great. We should have more of them.

59
0:02:58.474,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I want you to make as many new words as possible.

60
0:03:02.53,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English.

61
0:03:07.55,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The first way is the simplest way.

62
0:03:09.639,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Basically, steal them from other languages.

63
0:03:11.862,000 --> 0:03:13,000
["Go rob other people"] (Laughter)

64
0:03:15.936,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Linguists call this borrowing,

65
0:03:17.764,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but we never give the words back , so I'm just going to be honest

66
0:03:20.824,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and call it stealing.

67
0:03:22.784,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We usually take words for things that we like, like delicious food.

68
0:03:26.154,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We took "kumquat" from Chinese, we took "caramel" from French.

69
0:03:29.944,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We also take words for cool things like "ninja," right?

70
0:03:32.851,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We took that from Japanese,

71
0:03:34.301,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which is kind of a cool trick because ninjas are hard to steal from.

72
0:03:37.57,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:39.684,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So another way that you can make words in English

74
0:03:42.944,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is by squishing two other English words together.

75
0:03:45.885,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is called compounding.

76
0:03:47.572,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Words in English are like Lego:

77
0:03:49.082,000 --> 0:03:52,000
If you use enough force, you can put any two of them together.

78
0:03:52.447,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:54.832,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We do this all the time in English:

80
0:03:56.627,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Words like "heartbroken," "bookworm," "sandcastle" all are compounds.

81
0:04:02.105,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So go ahead and make words like "duckface," just don't make duckface.

82
0:04:05.606,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:07.835,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Another way that you can make words in English is kind of like compounding,

84
0:04:11.848,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together

85
0:04:16.899,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that some parts fall off.

86
0:04:18.534,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So these are blend words,

87
0:04:20.215,000 --> 0:04:23,000
like "brunch" is a blend of "breakfast" and "lunch."

88
0:04:24.064,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"Motel" is a blend of "motor" and "hotel."

89
0:04:26.796,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Who here knew that "motel" was a blend word?

90
0:04:29.737,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Yeah, that word is so old in English

91
0:04:31.581,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that lots of people don't know that there are parts missing.

92
0:04:34.692,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"Edutainment" is a blend of "education" and "entertainment."

93
0:04:38.987,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And of course, "electrocute" is a blend of "electric" and "execute."

94
0:04:44.197,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:46.007,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You can also make words by changing how they operate.

96
0:04:49.328,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This is called functional shift.

97
0:04:50.941,000 --> 0:04:52,000
You take a word that acts as one part of speech,

98
0:04:53.242,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and you change it into another part of speech.

99
0:04:55.522,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Okay, who here knew that "friend" hasn't always been a verb?

100
0:05:00.881,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Friend" used to be noun and then we verbed it.

101
0:05:05.076,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Almost any word in English can be verbed.

102
0:05:08.345,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You can also take adjectives and make them into nouns.

103
0:05:10.978,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"Commercial" used to be an adjective and now it's a noun.

104
0:05:14.705,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And of course, you can "green" things.

105
0:05:17.151,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Another way to make words in English is back-formation.

106
0:05:20.489,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit.

107
0:05:23.747,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So for example, in English we had the word "editor" before we had the word "edit."

108
0:05:28.568,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"Edit" was formed from "editor."

109
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Sometimes these back-formations sound a little silly:

110
0:05:33.065,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Bulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle and burglers burgle.

111
0:05:37.453,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:39.278,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Another way to make words in English

113
0:05:41.05,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is to take the first letters of something and squish them together.

114
0:05:44.22,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So National Aeronautics and Space Administration becomes NASA.

115
0:05:47.251,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And of course you can do this with anything, OMG!

116
0:05:50.963,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So it doesn't matter how silly the words are.

117
0:05:56.602,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They can be really good words of English.

118
0:05:58.608,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"Absquatulate" is a perfectly good word of English.

119
0:06:02.626,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Mugwump" is a perfectly good word of English.

120
0:06:05.489,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So the words don't have have to sound normal, they can sound really silly.

121
0:06:10.067,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Why should you make words?

122
0:06:12.256,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You should make words because every word

123
0:06:14.397,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is a chance to express your idea and get your meaning across.

124
0:06:18.918,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And new words grab people's attention.

125
0:06:21.514,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They get people to focus on what you're saying

126
0:06:24.163,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and that gives you a better chance to get your meaning across.

127
0:06:27.427,000 --> 0:06:29,000
A lot of people on this stage today have said,

128
0:06:30.376,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"In the future, you can do this,

129
0:06:31.938,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you can help with this, you can help us explore, you can help us invent."

130
0:06:35.471,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You can make a new word right now.

131
0:06:37.1,000 --> 0:06:39,000
English has no age limit.

132
0:06:39.433,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Go ahead, start making words today,

133
0:06:41.859,000 --> 0:06:44,000
send them to me, and I will put them in my online dictionary, Wordnik.

134
0:06:45.546,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Thank you so much.

135
0:06:46.835,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Applause)

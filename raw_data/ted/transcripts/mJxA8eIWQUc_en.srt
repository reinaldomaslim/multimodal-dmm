1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times.

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I review gadgets and stuff.

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What I'm mostly doing this year

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is going on cable TV and answering the same question:

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"What are the tech trends for next year?"

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?"

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most, and that is the

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You know, I found that volcano on Google Images,

12
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.

13
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Anyway, this all started a few years ago,

15
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line,

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and we've come a long way since that.

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, it works just like a regular phone.

21
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone,

22
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone,

23
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended.

24
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It could be anything. It could be salsa music

25
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or a comedy routine -- it doesn't matter.

26
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The little box has your phone number.

27
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So that's really cool -- you can take it to London or Siberia,

28
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring,

29
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because it's got everything in the box.

30
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They've got every feature known to man in there,

31
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
because adding a new feature is just software.

32
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And as a result of Voice Over IP --

33
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I hate that term -- Voice Over Internet --

34
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years.

35
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.

36
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular

37
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
VOIP service in the world: It's Skype.

38
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC,

39
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world

40
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd.

41
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's not your phone -- it's your computer.

42
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money,

43
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
believe me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone.

44
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's really cute seeing middle-aged people

45
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
like me, try out Skype for the first time,

46
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.

47
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They don't want to pay the international fees,

48
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
so they're like, "Timmy! Is that you?"

49
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's really cute.

51
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But I -- at least it was when I did it --

52
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting

54
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is when they start putting it on cell phones.

55
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone,

56
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and any time you were in a wireless hotspot --

57
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
free calls anywhere in the world,

58
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
never pay the cellular company a nickel.

59
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It'd be really, really cool -- and yet,

60
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
even though the technology for this has been available

61
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
for five years, incredibly,

62
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the number of standard cell phones

63
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
offered by US carriers with free VOIP

64
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is zero!

65
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I can't figure out why!

66
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Actually, I need to update that. There's one now.

68
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.

69
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It comes from T-Mobile.

70
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I am not paid by T-Mobile.

71
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I'm not plugging T-Mobile.

72
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.

73
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.

74
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Basically, the reason you haven't heard about this program

76
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is because it was introduced last year

77
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
on June 29.

78
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?

79
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.

80
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'm like, can you imagine being the

81
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
T-Mobile PR lady? You know?

82
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"Hi, we have an announcement to -- WAH!!!"

83
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But it's actually really, really cool. You have a choice of phones,

85
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and we're not talking smartphones --

86
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
ordinary phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi.

87
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot,

88
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
all your calls are free.

89
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.

90
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?"

91
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The answer is, "All the time!"

92
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Because they give you

93
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a regular wireless router that works with the phone,

94
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for your house.

95
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Which is really ingenious, because we all know that

96
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.

97
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.

98
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right?

100
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us

101
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program.

102
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We're putting it in our homes for them!

103
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Anyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe.

104
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before

105
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
is, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range,

106
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the call is handed off in mid-syllable,

107
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
seamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies

108
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we use at the New York Times to test this gear.

109
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is me with a camcorder on a phone

110
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
going like this.

111
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot

113
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
into the cellular network on a call with my wife --

114
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
look at the upper left. That's the Wi-Fi signal.

115
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Video): Jennifer Pogue: Hello?

116
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
David Pogue: Hi babes, it's me.

117
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
JP: Oh, hi darling, how are you?

118
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
DP: You're on Wi-Fi. How does it sound?

119
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
JP: Oh, it sounds pretty good.

120
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now, I'm leaving the house. DP: I'm going for a walk -- do you mind?

121
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
JP: No not at all. I'm having a great day with the kids.

122
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
DP: What are you guys doing?

123
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Right there!

124
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.

125
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that.

126
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The bottom line is that the boundaries,

128
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because of the Internet plus cell phone, are melting.

129
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The cool thing about the T-Mobile phones

130
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is that although switching technologies is very advanced,

131
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
the billing technology has not caught up.

132
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So what I mean is that you can start a call

133
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot,

134
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead --

135
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which would be like 10 minutes --

136
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And the call will continue to be free.

138
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Because they don't, they haven't --

139
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
well, no, wait! Not so fast.

140
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It also works the other way.

141
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So if you start a call on your cellular network

142
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and you come home, you keep being billed.

143
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Which is why most people with this service

144
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
get into the habit of saying,

145
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?"

146
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now you get it.

147
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas,

148
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.

149
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,

150
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
right? Nobody knows you're in Pakistan.

151
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You can make free unlimited calls

152
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
home to the US with these phones. So, very, very interesting.

153
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is another favorite of mine.

154
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Does anyone here have a working cell phone

155
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?

156
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
OK. Would you call me please right now? [Phone number given.]

157
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer.

158
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I have two cell phones, so this going to be very odd, if it works.

160
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I should know not to do technology demos

161
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in front of an audience. It's just, like, absurd.

162
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This one is going off. And -- oh, I have the ringer off. Tsh! Great.

163
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Anyway, this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time.

164
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Excuse me one second.

165
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Hello?

166
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Oh. Where are you calling from?

167
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
No, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that.

168
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I didn't even know it was you -- I was looking at this guy.

169
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Oh great! Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now!

170
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
All right! We've made the point.

172
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
All right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action.

173
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So this is Grand Central at work -- it's a --

175
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
oh, for gods sake!

176
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I have your numbers now!

178
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
You will pay.

180
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Grand Central is this really brilliant idea

181
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
where they give you a new phone number,

182
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.

183
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Your home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone

184
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(this is the EG crowd).

185
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The beauty of that is you never miss a call.

187
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I know a lot of you are like,

188
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour."

189
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But the beauty is it's all going through the internet,

190
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
so you get all of these really cool features --

191
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
like you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours.

192
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And I want these people to hear this greeting,

193
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message."

194
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And then your wife calls, and, "Hi honey, leave me a message."

195
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Very, very customizable.

196
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Google bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.

197
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method.

198
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
By the way, this is something that really bothers me.

199
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I don't know if you realize this. When you call 411 on your cell phone,

200
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they charge you two bucks.

201
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Did you know that? It's an outrage.

202
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.

203
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.

204
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
What you're going to use is Google Cellular.

205
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's totally free -- there's not even ads.

206
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.

207
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it.

208
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You send a text message to the word "Google,"

209
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which turns out to be 46645.

210
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Leave off the last "e" for savings.

211
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Anyway, so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago.

212
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.

213
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You hit send, and in five seconds,

214
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they will send you back the two closest drugstores,

215
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
complete with name address and phone number.

216
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Here it comes.

217
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And it's already written down -- so, like, if you're driving,

218
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh."

219
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It works with weather, too.

220
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
You can say "Weather," and the name of the city you're going to travel to.

221
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And then in five seconds, they send you back

222
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the complete weather forecast for that town.

223
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.

224
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Here we go. And those are just the beginning.

225
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will --

226
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
yeah! You're all trying to write this down.

227
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me.

228
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside

229
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is that it requires you to know how to text --

230
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
send a text message. Nobody over 40 knows how to do that.

231
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So I'm going to teach you something even better.

232
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
This is called Google Info.

233
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.

234
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's speech recognition like you've never heard before.

235
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So lets say I'm in Monterey,

236
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and I want what?

237
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I want to find what? Bagels. OK.

238
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Google: Say the business and the city and state.

239
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
DP: Bagels, Monterey, California.

240
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I got the Chinese line.

241
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Laughter)

242
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Google: Bagels, Monterey, California.

243
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Top eight results: Number one,

244
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street.

245
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
To select number one, you can press one or say "number one."

246
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Number two: Bagel Bakery, commissary department.

247
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Number Two. Number Two. Two.

248
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

249
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Why do I listen to people in the audience?

250
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Well anyway -- oh! Here we go!

251
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Google: ... commissary department on McClellan Avenue, Monterey.

252
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I'll connect you, or say "details," or "go back."

253
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
DP: He's connecting me! He doesn't even tell me the phone number.

254
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet.

255
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Google: Hold on.

256
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Laughter)

257
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
DP: Hi, could I have 400 with a schmear?

258
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
No, no, no -- just kidding, no no.

259
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So anyway, you never even find out the number.

260
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It's just so amazing.

261
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.

262
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial.

263
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
This you can ask by voice any question.

264
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Who won the 1958 World Series?

265
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
What's the recipe for a certain cocktail?

266
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer.

267
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.

268
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
"Which actors have played James Bond?"

269
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
They text me back this: "Sean Connery,

270
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."

271
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Right! And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl.

272
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like,

273
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
when the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?"

274
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Just to see how the recognition was.

275
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
They texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."

276
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Which I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976.

277
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You know, there's a lot of people wondering, "How on earth are they going to

278
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
make money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line.

279
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
They put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.

280
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?

281
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
How can it be so good? It's as though there is a human being

282
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
on the other end of the line."

283
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Because there is one!

284
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
They have 10,000 people

285
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
who are being paid 20 cents per answer.

286
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
As you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.

287
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That's who can afford to do that.

288
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many

289
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
tough positions like, "When's the last flight out of Chicago?"

290
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
You know. It's just absolutely amazing.

291
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today --

292
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology.

293
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
When I call to leave you a message,

294
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I get 15 seconds of instructions

295
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
from a third-grade teacher on Ambien!

296
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

297
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
"To page this person ... "

298
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Page? What is this, 1975?

299
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Nobody has pagers anymore.

300
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
"You may begin speaking at the tone.

301
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
When you have finished recording,

302
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
you may hang up." No!

303
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Laughter)

304
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And then it gets worse:

305
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
when I call to retrieve my messages,

306
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
first of all: "You have 87 messages.

307
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
To listen to your messages ... "

308
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Why else am I calling?

309
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

310
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Of course I want to listen to the messages!

311
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Laughter)

312
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Oh! You all have cell phones too.

313
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So last year I went to Milan, Italy,

314
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and I got to speak to an audience

315
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.

316
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And I said as a joke -- as a joke, I said,

317
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
"I did the math. Verizon has 70 million customers.

318
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
If you check your voicemail twice a day,

319
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that's 100 million dollars a year.

320
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?"

321
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
No chuckle. They're like this --

322
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Laughter)

323
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Where is the outrage, people? Rise up!

324
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

325
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Sorry. I'm not bitter.

326
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Laughter)

327
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that.

328
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
There are these services that transcribe

329
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
your voicemail into text.

330
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And they send it either to your email

331
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
or as text messages to your phone.

332
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It is a life-changer.

333
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And by the way, they don't always get the words right,

334
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
because it's over the phone and all that.

335
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email

336
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
so you can listen to double-check.

337
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
The services are called things like Spinvox,

338
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Phonetag -- this is the one I use --

339
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Callwave. A lot of people say, "How are they doing this?

340
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I don't really want people listening in to my calls."

341
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The executives at these companies told me,

342
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
"Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti -- " you know.

343
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in.

344
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The reason I think that is that

345
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
on the first day I tried one of these services,

346
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson,

347
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe, and it was misspelled.

348
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
The other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh,

349
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
with the silent 'h'. Nailed that one.

350
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Laughter)

351
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So you be the judge.

352
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Laughter)

353
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Anyway, this service, Callwave, promises

354
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that it's all software -- nobody is listening to your messages.

355
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist

356
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
of your messages.

357
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Laughter)

358
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So I thought I'd see how that goes.

359
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This is me testing it out.

360
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Video): Hello, this is Michael.

361
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good.

362
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Hey, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.

363
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.

364
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.

365
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
She's in room -- emergency room 53W.

366
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
OK, talk to you later -- bye.

367
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
(Laughter)

368
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I love my job.

369
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Laughter)

370
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.

371
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
It's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that,

372
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I got the text message version. Now remember,

373
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
a text message can only be 160 characters long.

374
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?

375
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I'm not kidding you. The message said,

376
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
"Was walking along the street" and "sky was blue" and "emergency"!

377
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Laughter)

378
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
What the f -- ?

379
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Laughter)

380
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Well I guess that was the gist.

381
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
(Laughter)

382
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.

383
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com.

384
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Basically, you're going to go on some

385
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
iffy date, or a potentially bad meeting.

386
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So you go and you type in your phone number,

387
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and at the exact minute where you want to be called --

388
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Laughter)

389
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And at that moment your phone will ring.

390
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And you're like, "I'm sorry. I've got to take this."

391
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
The really beautiful thing is,

392
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of

393
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
hear a little bit of the caller.

394
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
So they give you a choice

395
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
of what you want to hear on the other end.

396
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Here's the girlfriend.

397
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Phone: Hey you, what's going on?

398
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
DP: I'm kinda, like, giving a talk right now.

399
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Phone: Well, that's good.

400
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
DP: What are you doing?

401
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Phone: I was just wondering what you were up to.

402
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
DP: Right, I can't really talk right now.

403
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
This is the -- I love this -- the boss call.

404
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Phone: Hey, this is Mr. Johnson calling from the office.

405
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
DP: Oh, hi, sir.

406
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Phone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago? That photocopier training?

407
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
DP: Oh -- sorry I forgot.

408
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Phone: Yeah, well so when was the last time you used the photocopier?

409
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
DP: It was like three weeks ago.

410
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
Phone: Well, I don't know if you heard, you might have heard from Lenny, but --

411
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
(Laughter)

412
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I think the biggest change when Internet met phone

413
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
was with the iPhone.

414
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism.

415
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
It was when in the fall of 2006,

416
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone.

417
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
(Laughter)

418
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
I looked like a moron. However, my logic was good,

419
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
because -- I don't know if you realize this, but -- until the iPhone came along,

420
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
the carriers -- Verizon, AT&T, Cingular --

421
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
held veto power over every aspect

422
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
of every design of every phone.

423
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
I know the people who worked on the Treo.

424
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
They went around to these carriers and said,

425
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
"Look at these cool features." And Verizon is like, "Hmm, no.

426
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
I don't think so."

427
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
It was not very conducive to innovation.

428
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs

429
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
went around and said, "Tell you what -- I'll give you a five-year exclusive

430
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
if you'll let me design this phone in peace --

431
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and you won't even see it till it's done."

432
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
Actually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.

433
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Finally Cingular said OK.

434
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.

435
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
Please don't corner me at the party tonight

436
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?"

437
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
- you know. I'm not.

438
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece.

439
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.

440
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
But it did change a few things. The first thing it changed

441
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
was that all those carriers saw

442
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
that they sold 10 million of these things in a year.

443
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
And they said, "Oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.

444
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones."

445
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:31,000
(Applause)

446
0:20:31.16,000 --> 0:20:34,000
Another thing was that it let 10 million people,

447
0:20:34.16,000 --> 0:20:37,000
for the first time, experience being online all the time.

448
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:39,000
Not using these 60-dollar-a-month

449
0:20:39.16,000 --> 0:20:42,000
cellular cards for their laptops.

450
0:20:42.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
I don't understand why we're not there yet.

451
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
When I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren,

452
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
"When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email,

453
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did!"

454
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
(Laughter)

455
0:21:00.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
"We had wireless base stations that could

456
0:21:02.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
broadcast -- yay, about 150 feet across."

457
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
(Laughter)

458
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
It's absurd. We have power outlets

459
0:21:08.16,000 --> 0:21:1,000
in every room of every building. We have running water.

460
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:12,000
What's the problem?

461
0:21:12.16,000 --> 0:21:15,000
Anyway -- but this teaches people what it's like.

462
0:21:15.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
You have to go to YouTube

463
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
and type in "iPhone Shuffle."

464
0:21:19.16,000 --> 0:21:21,000
This guy did a mock video of one

465
0:21:21.16,000 --> 0:21:24,000
that's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.

466
0:21:24.16,000 --> 0:21:27,000
It's like, "It only has one button.

467
0:21:27.16,000 --> 0:21:3,000
Touch it and it dials a number at random."

468
0:21:30.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
(Laughter)

469
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:33,000
"Who the hell is this?"

470
0:21:33.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
(Laughter)

471
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:36,000
But the other thing it did

472
0:21:36.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
is it opened up this idea of an app store.

473
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
It downloads right to the phone.

474
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:44,000
And you can use the tilt sensor

475
0:21:44.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
to steer this car using this game.

476
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:49,000
These programs can use all the components

477
0:21:49.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
of the iPhone -- the touch screen.

478
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:53,000
This is the Etch-A-Sketch program -- the theme of EG 2008.

479
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
You know how you erase it?

480
0:21:55.16,000 --> 0:21:57,000
Of course. You shake it.

481
0:21:57.16,000 --> 0:22:,000
Right, of course. We shake it to erase, like this.

482
0:22:00.16,000 --> 0:22:02,000
They have 10,000 of these programs.

483
0:22:02.16,000 --> 0:22:05,000
This is the translator program. They have every language in the world.

484
0:22:05.16,000 --> 0:22:09,000
You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.

485
0:22:09.16,000 --> 0:22:13,000
This is amazing. This is Midomi.

486
0:22:13.16,000 --> 0:22:15,000
A song is running through your head --

487
0:22:15.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
you sing it into the thing:

488
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:21,000
do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...

489
0:22:21.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
OK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.

490
0:22:32.16,000 --> 0:22:36,000
I know. It's insane, right?

491
0:22:36.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio --

492
0:22:39.16,000 --> 0:22:41,000
you type in a band or a song name.

493
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:44,000
It will immediately play you that song or that band.

494
0:22:44.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.

495
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:49,000
You say if you like this song or not.

496
0:22:49.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
If you like it, it tries another song on you

497
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:54,000
from a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals,

498
0:22:54.16,000 --> 0:22:56,000
theme and tempo.

499
0:22:56.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
If you like that one, or don't like it,

500
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:01,000
you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down. Over time it tailors the songs

501
0:23:01.16,000 --> 0:23:05,000
so that it completely stops playing bad songs.

502
0:23:05.16,000 --> 0:23:07,000
It eventually only plays songs you like.

503
0:23:07.16,000 --> 0:23:11,000
This is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing.

504
0:23:11.16,000 --> 0:23:13,000
You want to find a place to eat. You shake it.

505
0:23:13.16,000 --> 0:23:16,000
It proposes a restaurant.

506
0:23:16.16,000 --> 0:23:2,000
It gives you the price, and the location and ratings.

507
0:23:20.16,000 --> 0:23:23,000
Video: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.

508
0:23:25.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
Anyway, just amazing, amazing things.

509
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:29,000
Of course, its not just about the iPhone.

510
0:23:29.16,000 --> 0:23:31,000
The iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.

511
0:23:31.16,000 --> 0:23:35,000
But now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system

512
0:23:35.16,000 --> 0:23:38,000
that will soon be on handsets -- phones from 34 companies.

513
0:23:38.16,000 --> 0:23:4,000
Touch screen -- very, very nice.

514
0:23:40.16,000 --> 0:23:43,000
Also with its own app store, where you can download programs.

515
0:23:43.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
This is amazing. In the wake of all this,

516
0:23:46.16,000 --> 0:23:49,000
Verizon, the most calcified, corporate,

517
0:23:49.16,000 --> 0:23:51,000
conservative carrier of all,

518
0:23:51.16,000 --> 0:23:54,000
said, "You can use any phone you want on our network."

519
0:23:54.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
I love the Wired headline:

520
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:23:58,000
Pigs Fly, Hell Freezes Over

521
0:23:58.16,000 --> 0:24:01,000
and Verizon Opens Up Its Network -- No. Really.

522
0:24:01.16,000 --> 0:24:03,000
So everything is changing. We've entered

523
0:24:03.16,000 --> 0:24:08,000
a new world of innovation, where the cell phone becomes your laptop,

524
0:24:08.16,000 --> 0:24:1,000
customized the way you want it.

525
0:24:10.16,000 --> 0:24:13,000
Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on.

526
0:24:13.16,000 --> 0:24:17,000
Can I do one more one-minute song? Thank you.

527
0:24:17.16,000 --> 0:24:2,000
(Applause)

528
0:24:20.16,000 --> 0:24:24,000
Just to round it up -- this is the new Apple Power Music Stand.

529
0:24:24.16,000 --> 0:24:26,000
It's only three pounds,

530
0:24:26.16,000 --> 0:24:29,000
or 12 if you install Microsoft Office.

531
0:24:29.16,000 --> 0:24:31,000
(Laughter)

532
0:24:31.16,000 --> 0:24:34,000
Sorry, that was mean.

533
0:24:34.16,000 --> 0:24:37,000
This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video.

534
0:24:37.16,000 --> 0:24:4,000
Ladies and gentlemen, for seven blissful hours

535
0:24:40.16,000 --> 0:24:43,000
it was the number one video on YouTube.

536
0:24:43.697,000 --> 0:24:44,000
(To the tune of "My Way")

537
0:24:45.043,000 --> 0:24:49,000
And now the end is near.

538
0:24:49.16,000 --> 0:24:51,000
I'm sick to death

539
0:24:51.16,000 --> 0:24:54,000
of this old cell phone.

540
0:24:54.16,000 --> 0:24:57,000
Bad sound, the signal's weak,

541
0:24:57.16,000 --> 0:24:59,000
the software stinks.

542
0:24:59.16,000 --> 0:25:02,000
A made-in-Hell phone.

543
0:25:02.16,000 --> 0:25:06,000
I've heard there's something new --

544
0:25:06.16,000 --> 0:25:1,000
a million times more rad than my phone.

545
0:25:10.16,000 --> 0:25:14,000
I too will join the cult.

546
0:25:14.16,000 --> 0:25:19,000
I want an iPhone.

547
0:25:19.16,000 --> 0:25:24,000
Concerns -- I have a few. It's got some flaws;

548
0:25:24.16,000 --> 0:25:27,000
we may just face it.

549
0:25:27.16,000 --> 0:25:3,000
No keys, no memory card,

550
0:25:30.16,000 --> 0:25:32,000
the battery's sealed --

551
0:25:32.16,000 --> 0:25:35,000
you can't replace it.

552
0:25:35.16,000 --> 0:25:38,000
But God, this thing is sweet.

553
0:25:38.16,000 --> 0:25:43,000
A multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.

554
0:25:43.16,000 --> 0:25:47,000
You had me from, "Hello."

555
0:25:47.16,000 --> 0:25:51,000
I want an iPhone.

556
0:25:51.16,000 --> 0:25:55,000
I want to touch its precious screen.

557
0:25:55.16,000 --> 0:25:59,000
I want to wipe the smudges clean.

558
0:25:59.16,000 --> 0:26:03,000
I want my friends to look and drool.

559
0:26:03.16,000 --> 0:26:07,000
I want to say, "Look -- now I'm cool"

560
0:26:07.16,000 --> 0:26:11,000
I stood in line and I'll get mine.

561
0:26:11.16,000 --> 0:26:15,000
I want an iPhone.

562
0:26:15.16,000 --> 0:26:17,000
For what is a man?

563
0:26:17.16,000 --> 0:26:2,000
What has he got? If not iPhone,

564
0:26:20.16,000 --> 0:26:23,000
then he's got squat.

565
0:26:23.16,000 --> 0:26:26,000
It's all the things a phone should be.

566
0:26:26.16,000 --> 0:26:3,000
Who cares if it's AT&T?

567
0:26:30.16,000 --> 0:26:36,000
I took a stand, paid half a grand!

568
0:26:36.16,000 --> 0:26:43,000
And I got an iPhone!

569
0:26:43.16,000 --> 0:26:46,000
(Applause)

570
0:26:46.16,000 --> 0:26:48,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

571
0:26:48.16,000 --> 0:26:54,000
(Applause)

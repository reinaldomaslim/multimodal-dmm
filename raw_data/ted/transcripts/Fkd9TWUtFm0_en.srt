2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've always had a fascination for computers and technology,

3
0:00:19.63,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I made a few apps for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.

4
0:00:23.354,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'd like to share a couple with you today.

5
0:00:26.449,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My first app was a unique fortune teller called "Earth Fortune"

6
0:00:30.544,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that would display different colors of Earth

7
0:00:32.957,000 --> 0:00:33,000
depending on what your fortune was.

8
0:00:35.53,000 --> 0:00:38,000
My favorite and most successful app

9
0:00:39.277,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is "Bustin Jieber," which is --

10
0:00:41.162,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:42.409,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole.

12
0:00:45.127,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:46.46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I created it because a lot of people at school

14
0:00:49.867,000 --> 0:00:51,000
disliked Justin Bieber a little bit,

15
0:00:52.208,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so I decided to make the app.

16
0:00:54.978,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So I went to work programming it,

17
0:00:57.157,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I released it just before the holidays in 2010.

18
0:01:01.984,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A lot of people ask me, how did I make these?

19
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:07,000
A lot of times it's because the person who asked the question

20
0:01:08.676,000 --> 0:01:1,000
wants to make an app also.

21
0:01:10.722,000 --> 0:01:13,000
A lot of kids these days like to play games,

22
0:01:13.849,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but now they want to make them, and it's difficult,

23
0:01:17.403,000 --> 0:01:21,000
because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program.

24
0:01:22.363,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I mean, for soccer, you could go to a soccer team.

25
0:01:24.882,000 --> 0:01:27,000
For violin, you could get lessons for a violin.

26
0:01:27.923,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But what if you want to make an app?

27
0:01:29.934,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young,

28
0:01:33.965,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but not many parents have written apps.

29
0:01:35.847,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:38.178,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Where do you go to find out how to make an app?

31
0:01:40.751,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Well, this is how I approached it, this is what I did.

32
0:01:43.511,000 --> 0:01:48,000
First of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages

33
0:01:48.709,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to get the basics down,

34
0:01:50.743,000 --> 0:01:53,000
such as Python, C, Java, etc.

35
0:01:55.021,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And then Apple released the iPhone,

36
0:01:57.518,000 --> 0:02:,000
and with it, the iPhone software development kit,

37
0:02:00.556,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and the software development kit is a suite of tools

38
0:02:04.159,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for creating and programming an iPhone app.

39
0:02:08.148,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me,

40
0:02:11.5,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and after playing with the software development kit a little bit,

41
0:02:14.794,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I made a couple of apps, I made some test apps.

42
0:02:18.705,000 --> 0:02:2,000
One of them happened to be "Earth Fortune,"

43
0:02:20.872,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and I was ready to put "Earth Fortune" on the App Store,

44
0:02:23.764,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and so I persuaded my parents to pay the 99 dollar fee

45
0:02:28.163,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to be able to put my apps on the App Store.

46
0:02:30.983,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store.

47
0:02:35.34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement

48
0:02:37.647,000 --> 0:02:4,000
from my family, friends, teachers and even people at the Apple Store,

49
0:02:41.34,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and that's been a huge help to me.

50
0:02:44.376,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs,

51
0:02:47.502,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and I've started an app club at school,

52
0:02:50.435,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club.

53
0:02:56.081,000 --> 0:03:,000
Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app.

54
0:03:02.534,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is so I can share my experiences with others.

55
0:03:06.664,000 --> 0:03:09,000
There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program,

56
0:03:10.226,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and some districts have them.

57
0:03:12.82,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.

58
0:03:15.503,000 --> 0:03:18,000
A big challenge is, how should the iPads be used,

59
0:03:19.526,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and what apps should we put on the iPads?

60
0:03:22.974,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school

61
0:03:26.8,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to see what kind of apps they'd like.

62
0:03:28.892,000 --> 0:03:3,000
When we design the app and we sell it,

63
0:03:31.7,000 --> 0:03:36,000
it will be free to local districts; and other districts that we sell to --

64
0:03:38.143,000 --> 0:03:41,000
all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations.

65
0:03:43.036,000 --> 0:03:48,000
These days, students usually know a little bit more than teachers

66
0:03:48.138,000 --> 0:03:49,000
with the technology.

67
0:03:49.722,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:54.061,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So --

69
0:03:55.309,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:58.272,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Sorry.

71
0:03:59.482,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:02.796,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So this is a resource to teachers,

73
0:04:04.899,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it.

74
0:04:09.018,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:11.593,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future.

76
0:04:16.333,000 --> 0:04:19,000
First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.

77
0:04:20.336,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I'm working with a third party company to make an app.

78
0:04:24.001,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'd like to get into Android programming and development,

79
0:04:27.919,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I'd like to continue my app club,

80
0:04:30.23,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.

81
0:04:33.879,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Thank you.

82
0:04:35.062,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Applause)

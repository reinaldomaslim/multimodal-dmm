1
0:00:12.786,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I want to tell you about someone.

2
0:00:15.077,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to call him Ravi Nanda.

3
0:00:17.326,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm changing his name to protect his safety.

4
0:00:20.592,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Ravi's from a community of herdspeople in Gujarat

5
0:00:24.331,000 --> 0:00:26,000
on the western coast of India,

6
0:00:26.556,000 --> 0:00:27,000
same place my own family comes from.

7
0:00:30.048,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When he was 10 years old, his entire community was forced to move

8
0:00:35.458,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because a multinational corporation

9
0:00:37.57,000 --> 0:00:4,000
constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived.

10
0:00:42.263,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Then, 20 years later, the same company built a cement factory

11
0:00:48.156,000 --> 0:00:5,000
100 meters from where they live now.

12
0:00:51.708,000 --> 0:00:55,000
India has got strong environmental regulations on paper,

13
0:00:56.184,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but this company has violated many of them.

14
0:00:59.873,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Dust from that factory covers Ravi's mustache

15
0:01:02.934,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and everything he wears.

16
0:01:05.135,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I spent just two days in his place, and I coughed for a week.

17
0:01:10.3,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village

18
0:01:15.398,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or drink the water,

19
0:01:17.103,000 --> 0:01:18,000
they get sick.

20
0:01:19.673,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He says children now walk long distances with cattle and buffalo

21
0:01:24.491,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to find uncontaminated grazing land.

22
0:01:28.396,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He says many of those kids have dropped out of school,

23
0:01:31.903,000 --> 0:01:32,000
including three of his own.

24
0:01:35.045,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Ravi has appealed to the company for years.

25
0:01:38.767,000 --> 0:01:42,000
He said, "I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with them.

26
0:01:43.062,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They wouldn't need to buy any wood."

27
0:01:44.866,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:47.268,000 --> 0:01:51,000
He said the company ignored every one of those letters,

29
0:01:51.885,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and so in 2013,

30
0:01:53.899,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Ravi Nanda decided to use the last means of protest

31
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
he thought he had left.

32
0:02:00.058,000 --> 0:02:05,000
He walked to the gates of that factory with a bucket of petrol in his hands,

33
0:02:05.732,000 --> 0:02:07,000
intending to set himself on fire.

34
0:02:10.639,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Ravi is not alone in his desperation.

35
0:02:14.759,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The UN estimates that worldwide,

36
0:02:16.736,000 --> 0:02:2,000
four billion people live without basic access to justice.

37
0:02:22.596,000 --> 0:02:26,000
These people face grave threats to their safety, their livelihoods,

38
0:02:27.449,000 --> 0:02:28,000
their dignity.

39
0:02:29.455,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There are almost always laws on the books that would protect these people,

40
0:02:34.202,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but they've often never heard of those laws,

41
0:02:36.985,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and the systems that are supposed to enforce those laws

42
0:02:40.295,000 --> 0:02:43,000
are corrupt or broken or both.

43
0:02:45.276,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We are living with a global epidemic of injustice,

44
0:02:51.308,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but we've been choosing to ignore it.

45
0:02:54.522,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Right now, in Sierra Leone,

46
0:02:57.626,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in Cambodia, in Ethiopia,

47
0:03:00.252,000 --> 0:03:02,000
farmers are being cajoled

48
0:03:02.325,000 --> 0:03:06,000
into putting their thumbprints on 50-year lease agreements,

49
0:03:07.111,000 --> 0:03:1,000
signing away all the land they've ever known for a pittance

50
0:03:10.571,000 --> 0:03:12,000
without anybody even explaining the terms.

51
0:03:14.7,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Governments seem to think that's OK.

52
0:03:18.123,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Right now, in the United States,

53
0:03:20.775,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in India, in Slovenia,

54
0:03:23.751,000 --> 0:03:26,000
people like Ravi are raising their children

55
0:03:26.862,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in the shadow of factories or mines

56
0:03:29.807,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that are poisoning their air and their water.

57
0:03:33.121,000 --> 0:03:35,000
There are environmental laws that would protect these people,

58
0:03:36.054,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but many have never seen those laws,

59
0:03:37.794,000 --> 0:03:39,000
let alone having a shot at enforcing them.

60
0:03:40.971,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And the world seems to have decided that's OK.

61
0:03:45.234,000 --> 0:03:46,000
What would it take to change that?

62
0:03:48.437,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Law is supposed to be the language we use

63
0:03:52.687,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to translate our dreams about justice

64
0:03:55.555,000 --> 0:03:58,000
into living institutions that hold us together.

65
0:03:59.76,000 --> 0:04:,000
Law is supposed to be the difference

66
0:04:01.777,000 --> 0:04:03,000
between a society ruled by the most powerful

67
0:04:04.626,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and one that honors the dignity of everyone,

68
0:04:07.134,000 --> 0:04:08,000
strong or weak.

69
0:04:09.491,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's why I told my grandmother 20 years ago

70
0:04:11.889,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that I wanted to go to law school.

71
0:04:14.482,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Grandma didn't pause. She didn't skip a beat.

72
0:04:16.84,000 --> 0:04:18,000
She said to me, "Lawyer is liar."

73
0:04:20.744,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:23.759,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That was discouraging.

75
0:04:25.926,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:29.243,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But grandma's right, in a way.

77
0:04:30.929,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Something about law and lawyers has gone wrong.

78
0:04:35.194,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We lawyers are usually expensive, first of all,

79
0:04:39.273,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and we tend to focus on formal court channels

80
0:04:42.098,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that are impractical for many of the problems people face.

81
0:04:46.474,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Worse, our profession has shrouded law in a cloak of complexity.

82
0:04:52.528,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Law is like riot gear on a police officer.

83
0:04:55.804,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's intimidating and impenetrable,

84
0:04:59.212,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and it's hard to tell there's something human underneath.

85
0:05:02.856,000 --> 0:05:06,000
If we're going to make justice a reality for everyone,

86
0:05:07.046,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we need to turn law from an abstraction or a threat

87
0:05:11.086,000 --> 0:05:16,000
into something that every single person can understand, use and shape.

88
0:05:18.376,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Lawyers are crucial in that fight, no doubt,

89
0:05:22.152,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but we can't leave it to lawyers alone.

90
0:05:25.147,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In health care, for example,

91
0:05:27.472,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we don't just rely on doctors to serve patients.

92
0:05:30.849,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We have nurses and midwives and community health workers.

93
0:05:35.925,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The same should be true of justice.

94
0:05:39.767,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Community legal workers,

95
0:05:41.815,000 --> 0:05:43,000
sometimes we call them community paralegals,

96
0:05:44.244,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or barefoot lawyers,

97
0:05:46.392,000 --> 0:05:47,000
can be a bridge.

98
0:05:48.095,000 --> 0:05:5,000
These paralegals are from the communities they serve.

99
0:05:51.577,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They demystify law,

100
0:05:53.401,000 --> 0:05:55,000
break it down into simple terms,

101
0:05:55.637,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and then they help people look for a solution.

102
0:05:59.142,000 --> 0:06:,000
They don't focus on the courts alone.

103
0:06:00.929,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They look everywhere:

104
0:06:02.656,000 --> 0:06:06,000
ministry departments, local government, an ombudsman's office.

105
0:06:07.933,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Lawyers sometimes say to their clients,

106
0:06:10.536,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"I'll handle it for you. I've got you."

107
0:06:12.883,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Paralegals have a different message,

108
0:06:15.376,000 --> 0:06:17,000
not "I'm going to solve it for you,"

109
0:06:18.041,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but "We're going to solve it together,

110
0:06:20.317,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and in the process, we're both going to grow."

111
0:06:23.957,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Community paralegals saved my own relationship to law.

112
0:06:28.377,000 --> 0:06:3,000
After about a year in law school, I almost dropped out.

113
0:06:31.104,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I was thinking maybe I should have listened to my grandmother.

114
0:06:34.259,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It was when I started working with paralegals

115
0:06:36.863,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in Sierra Leone, in 2003,

116
0:06:39.666,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that I began feeling hopeful about the law again,

117
0:06:43.416,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and I have been obsessed ever since.

118
0:06:47.158,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Let me come back to Ravi.

119
0:06:50.173,000 --> 0:06:54,000
2013, he did reach the gates of that factory

120
0:06:54.355,000 --> 0:06:56,000
with the bucket of petrol in his hands,

121
0:06:56.896,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but he was arrested before he could follow through.

122
0:07:00.503,000 --> 0:07:01,000
He didn't have to spend long in jail,

123
0:07:02.289,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but he felt completely defeated.

124
0:07:05.962,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Then, two years later, he met someone.

125
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'm going to call him Kush.

126
0:07:10.903,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Kush is part of a team of community paralegals

127
0:07:14.327,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that works for environmental justice on the Gujarat coast.

128
0:07:18.144,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Kush explained to Ravi that there was law on his side.

129
0:07:22.762,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Kush translated into Gujarati something Ravi had never seen.

130
0:07:26.473,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's called the "consent to operate."

131
0:07:28.508,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's issued by the state government,

132
0:07:30.429,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and it allows the factory to run

133
0:07:32.481,000 --> 0:07:35,000
only if it complies with specific conditions.

134
0:07:36.539,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So together, they compared the legal requirements with reality,

135
0:07:40.651,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they collected evidence,

136
0:07:42.302,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and they drafted an application --

137
0:07:44.207,000 --> 0:07:48,000
not to the courts, but to two administrative institutions,

138
0:07:48.917,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the Pollution Control Board and the district administration.

139
0:07:52.945,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Those applications started turning the creaky wheels of enforcement.

140
0:07:59.096,000 --> 0:08:02,000
A pollution officer came for a site inspection,

141
0:08:02.565,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and after that, the company started running an air filtration system

142
0:08:06.918,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it was supposed to have been using all along.

143
0:08:10.121,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It also started covering the 100 trucks

144
0:08:13.422,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that come and go from that plant every day.

145
0:08:17.447,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Those two measures reduced the air pollution considerably.

146
0:08:22.144,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The case is far from over,

147
0:08:24.146,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but learning and using law gave Ravi hope.

148
0:08:30.318,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There are people like Kush walking alongside people like Ravi

149
0:08:36.235,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in many places.

150
0:08:37.743,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Today, I work with a group called Namati.

151
0:08:40.056,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Namati helps convene a global network

152
0:08:43.112,000 --> 0:08:44,000
dedicated to legal empowerment.

153
0:08:45.434,000 --> 0:08:47,000
All together, we are over a thousand organizations

154
0:08:48.413,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in 120 countries.

155
0:08:50.224,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Collectively, we deploy tens of thousands of community paralegals.

156
0:08:55.28,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Let me give you another example.

157
0:08:58.544,000 --> 0:08:59,000
This is Khadija Hamsa.

158
0:09:01.011,000 --> 0:09:07,000
She is one of five million people in Kenya who faces a discriminatory vetting process

159
0:09:07.601,000 --> 0:09:09,000
when trying to obtain a national ID card.

160
0:09:10.965,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It is like the Jim Crow South in the United States.

161
0:09:14.848,000 --> 0:09:16,000
If you are from a certain set of tribes,

162
0:09:17.267,000 --> 0:09:18,000
most of them Muslim,

163
0:09:18.539,000 --> 0:09:2,000
you get sent to a different line.

164
0:09:21.915,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Without an ID, you can't apply for a job.

165
0:09:24.826,000 --> 0:09:25,000
You can't get a bank loan.

166
0:09:26.48,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You can't enroll in university.

167
0:09:28.75,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You are excluded from society.

168
0:09:32.066,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Khadija tried off and on to get an ID for eight years, without success.

169
0:09:37.415,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Then she met a paralegal working in her community

170
0:09:40.773,000 --> 0:09:41,000
named Hassan Kassim.

171
0:09:42.992,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Hassan explained to Khadija how vetting works,

172
0:09:46.19,000 --> 0:09:48,000
he helped her gather the documents she needed,

173
0:09:48.357,000 --> 0:09:5,000
helped prep her to go before the vetting committee.

174
0:09:51.072,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Finally, she was able to get an ID with Hassan's help.

175
0:09:55.405,000 --> 0:09:56,000
First thing she did with it

176
0:09:57.238,000 --> 0:10:,000
was use it to apply for birth certificates for her children,

177
0:10:00.754,000 --> 0:10:02,000
which they need in order to go to school.

178
0:10:05.593,000 --> 0:10:08,000
In the United States, among many other problems,

179
0:10:09.318,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we have a housing crisis.

180
0:10:13.697,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In many cities,

181
0:10:14.879,000 --> 0:10:18,000
90 percent of the landlords in housing court have attorneys,

182
0:10:19.103,000 --> 0:10:21,000
while 90 percent of the tenants do not.

183
0:10:22.434,000 --> 0:10:24,000
In New York, a new crew of paralegals --

184
0:10:25.316,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they're called Access to Justice Navigators --

185
0:10:27.813,000 --> 0:10:3,000
helps people to understand housing law and to advocate for themselves.

186
0:10:32.52,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Normally in New York,

187
0:10:34.052,000 --> 0:10:37,000
one out of nine tenants brought to housing court

188
0:10:37.607,000 --> 0:10:38,000
gets evicted.

189
0:10:39.666,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Researchers took a look at 150 cases

190
0:10:42.27,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in which people had help from these paralegals,

191
0:10:44.968,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and they found no evictions at all,

192
0:10:48.112,000 --> 0:10:49,000
not one.

193
0:10:49.966,000 --> 0:10:51,000
A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way.

194
0:10:53.831,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I see the beginnings of a real movement,

195
0:10:58.378,000 --> 0:11:,000
but we're nowhere near what's necessary.

196
0:11:01.208,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Not yet.

197
0:11:02.889,000 --> 0:11:03,000
In most countries around the world,

198
0:11:04.639,000 --> 0:11:07,000
governments do not provide a single dollar of support

199
0:11:07.899,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.

200
0:11:11.001,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Most governments don't even recognize the role paralegals play,

201
0:11:14.818,000 --> 0:11:15,000
or protect paralegals from harm.

202
0:11:17.711,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I also don't want to give you the impression

203
0:11:19.846,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that paralegals and their clients win every time.

204
0:11:23.957,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Not at all.

205
0:11:25.147,000 --> 0:11:27,000
That cement factory behind Ravi's village,

206
0:11:27.957,000 --> 0:11:3,000
it's been turning off the filtration system at night,

207
0:11:31.355,000 --> 0:11:34,000
when it's least likely that the company would get caught.

208
0:11:34.633,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Running that filter costs money.

209
0:11:36.85,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Ravi WhatsApps photos of the polluted night sky.

210
0:11:40.976,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This is one he sent to Kush in May.

211
0:11:44.706,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Ravi says the air is still unbreathable.

212
0:11:48.465,000 --> 0:11:5,000
At one point this year, Ravi went on hunger strike.

213
0:11:51.806,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Kush was frustrated.

214
0:11:53.438,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He said, "We can win if we use the law."

215
0:11:56.31,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Ravi said, "I believe in the law, I do,

216
0:11:59.047,000 --> 0:12:,000
but it's not getting us far enough."

217
0:12:02.778,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Whether it's India, Kenya, the United States or anywhere else,

218
0:12:08.026,000 --> 0:12:11,000
trying to squeeze justice out of broken systems

219
0:12:11.379,000 --> 0:12:12,000
is like Ravi's case.

220
0:12:13.422,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Hope and despair are neck and neck.

221
0:12:18.426,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And so not only do we urgently need to support and protect

222
0:12:22.283,000 --> 0:12:24,000
the work of barefoot lawyers around the world,

223
0:12:25.204,000 --> 0:12:28,000
we need to change the systems themselves.

224
0:12:29.68,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Every case a paralegal takes on

225
0:12:32.498,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is a story about how a system is working in practice.

226
0:12:37.793,000 --> 0:12:38,000
When you put those stories together,

227
0:12:39.556,000 --> 0:12:42,000
it gives you a detailed portrait of the system as a whole.

228
0:12:43.207,000 --> 0:12:44,000
People can use that information

229
0:12:45.031,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to demand improvements to laws and policies.

230
0:12:48.867,000 --> 0:12:52,000
In India, paralegals and clients have drawn on their case experience

231
0:12:53.257,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to propose smarter regulations for the handling of minerals.

232
0:12:57.836,000 --> 0:13:01,000
In Kenya, paralegals and clients are using data from thousands of cases

233
0:13:02.606,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to argue that vetting is unconstitutional.

234
0:13:07.852,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This is a different way of approaching reform.

235
0:13:10.369,000 --> 0:13:13,000
This is not a consultant flying into Myanmar

236
0:13:13.671,000 --> 0:13:16,000
with a template he's going to cut and paste from Macedonia,

237
0:13:17.083,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and this is not an angry tweet.

238
0:13:21.07,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This is about growing reforms from the experience of ordinary people

239
0:13:24.987,000 --> 0:13:26,000
trying to make the rules and systems work.

240
0:13:29.154,000 --> 0:13:35,000
This transformation in the relationship between people and law

241
0:13:35.78,000 --> 0:13:36,000
is the right thing to do.

242
0:13:38.748,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It's also essential for overcoming

243
0:13:41.877,000 --> 0:13:44,000
all of the other great challenges of our times.

244
0:13:46.995,000 --> 0:13:5,000
We are not going to avert environmental collapse

245
0:13:51.634,000 --> 0:13:53,000
if the people most affected by pollution

246
0:13:54.554,000 --> 0:13:58,000
don't have a say in what happens to the land and the water,

247
0:13:58.849,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and we won't succeed in reducing poverty or expanding opportunity

248
0:14:03.522,000 --> 0:14:06,000
if poor people can't exercise their basic rights.

249
0:14:07.879,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I believe we won't overcome

250
0:14:11.389,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the despair that authoritarian politicians prey upon

251
0:14:16.509,000 --> 0:14:18,000
if our systems stay rigged.

252
0:14:20.9,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I called Ravi before coming here to ask permission to share his story.

253
0:14:27.37,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I asked if there was any message he wanted to give people.

254
0:14:31.566,000 --> 0:14:33,000
He said, "[Gujarati]."

255
0:14:35.193,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Wake up.

256
0:14:38.101,000 --> 0:14:4,000
"[Gujarati]."

257
0:14:40.499,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Don't be afraid.

258
0:14:42.699,000 --> 0:14:43,000
"[Gujarati]."

259
0:14:44.049,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Fight with paper.

260
0:14:45.694,000 --> 0:14:48,000
By that I think he means fight using law rather than guns.

261
0:14:49.752,000 --> 0:14:54,000
"[Gujarati]."

262
0:14:55.229,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Maybe not today, maybe not this year, maybe not in five years,

263
0:14:58.916,000 --> 0:15:,000
but find justice.

264
0:15:04.035,000 --> 0:15:1,000
If this guy, whose entire community is being poisoned every single day,

265
0:15:10.282,000 --> 0:15:12,000
who was ready to take his own life --

266
0:15:12.894,000 --> 0:15:14,000
if he's not giving up on seeking justice,

267
0:15:15.878,000 --> 0:15:16,000
then the world can't give up either.

268
0:15:19.159,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Ultimately, what Ravi calls "fighting with paper"

269
0:15:22.653,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is about forging a deeper version of democracy

270
0:15:27.167,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in which we the people,

271
0:15:28.482,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we don't just cast ballots every few years,

272
0:15:30.87,000 --> 0:15:36,000
we take part daily in the rules and institutions that hold us together,

273
0:15:37.239,000 --> 0:15:4,000
in which everyone, even the least powerful,

274
0:15:40.763,000 --> 0:15:43,000
can know law, use law and shape law.

275
0:15:45.405,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Making that happen, winning that fight,

276
0:15:48.526,000 --> 0:15:49,000
requires all of us.

277
0:15:50.357,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Thank you guys. Thank you.

278
0:15:52.11,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Applause)

279
0:16:01.166,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Kelo Kubu: Thanks, Vivek.

280
0:16:03.103,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So I'm going to make a few assumptions

281
0:16:06.261,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that people in this room know what the Sustainable Development Goals are

282
0:16:09.863,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and how the process works,

283
0:16:12.615,000 --> 0:16:14,000
but I want us to talk a little bit

284
0:16:15.481,000 --> 0:16:19,000
about Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions.

285
0:16:20.512,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Vivek Maru: Yeah. Anybody remember the Millennium Development Goals?

286
0:16:24.228,000 --> 0:16:29,000
They were adopted in 2000 by the UN and governments around the world,

287
0:16:29.366,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and they were for essential, laudable things.

288
0:16:31.486,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It was reduce child mortality by two thirds, cut hunger in half,

289
0:16:35.104,000 --> 0:16:36,000
crucial things.

290
0:16:36.317,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But there was no mention of justice or fairness

291
0:16:39.367,000 --> 0:16:41,000
or accountability or corruption,

292
0:16:41.713,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and we have made progress during the 15 years

293
0:16:44.451,000 --> 0:16:45,000
when those goals were in effect,

294
0:16:46.371,000 --> 0:16:48,000
but we are way behind what justice demands,

295
0:16:49.301,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and we're not going to get there unless we take justice into account.

296
0:16:53.309,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And so when the debate started about the next development framework,

297
0:16:56.935,000 --> 0:16:58,000
the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,

298
0:16:59.795,000 --> 0:17:01,000
our community came together around the world

299
0:17:02.331,000 --> 0:17:05,000
to argue that access to justice and legal empowerment

300
0:17:06.218,000 --> 0:17:08,000
should be a part of that new framework.

301
0:17:08.321,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And there was a lot of resistance.

302
0:17:10.337,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Those things are more political, more contentious than the other ones,

303
0:17:13.733,000 --> 0:17:16,000
so we didn't know until the night before whether it was going to come through.

304
0:17:17.43,000 --> 0:17:18,000
We squeaked by.

305
0:17:18.618,000 --> 0:17:22,000
The 16th out of 17 goals commits to access to justice for all,

306
0:17:22.838,000 --> 0:17:23,000
which is a big deal.

307
0:17:24.581,000 --> 0:17:27,000
It's a big deal, yes. Let's clap for justice.

308
0:17:27.852,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Applause)

309
0:17:29.622,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Here's the scandal, though.

310
0:17:31.541,000 --> 0:17:33,000
The day the goals were adopted,

311
0:17:34.493,000 --> 0:17:37,000
most of them were accompanied by big commitments:

312
0:17:38.017,000 --> 0:17:4,000
a billion dollars from the Gates Foundation

313
0:17:40.112,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and the British government for nutrition;

314
0:17:42.112,000 --> 0:17:46,000
25 billion in public-private financing for health care for women and children.

315
0:17:46.85,000 --> 0:17:48,000
On access to justice, we had the words on the paper,

316
0:17:49.588,000 --> 0:17:51,000
but nobody pledged a penny,

317
0:17:52.134,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and so that is the opportunity and the challenge that we face right now.

318
0:17:56.038,000 --> 0:17:59,000
The world recognizes more than ever before

319
0:17:59.133,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that you can't have development without justice,

320
0:18:02.021,000 --> 0:18:05,000
that people can't improve their lives if they can't exercise their rights,

321
0:18:05.91,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and what we need to do now is turn that rhetoric,

322
0:18:09.314,000 --> 0:18:11,000
turn that principle, into reality.

323
0:18:12.964,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

324
0:18:17.925,000 --> 0:18:19,000
KK: How can we help? What can people in this room do?

325
0:18:20.556,000 --> 0:18:23,000
VM: Great question. Thank you for asking.

326
0:18:23.797,000 --> 0:18:24,000
I would say three things.

327
0:18:25.378,000 --> 0:18:26,000
One is invest.

328
0:18:27.111,000 --> 0:18:3,000
If you have 10 dollars, or a hundred dollars, a million dollars,

329
0:18:30.341,000 --> 0:18:33,000
consider putting some of it towards grassroots legal empowerment.

330
0:18:33.504,000 --> 0:18:34,000
It's important in its own right

331
0:18:35.034,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and it's crucial for just about everything else we care about.

332
0:18:38.433,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Number two,

333
0:18:39.694,000 --> 0:18:43,000
push your politicians and your governments to make this a public priority.

334
0:18:45.905,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Just like health or education, access to justice

335
0:18:48.5,000 --> 0:18:51,000
should be one of the things that a government owes its people,

336
0:18:51.89,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and we're nowhere close to that,

337
0:18:53.581,000 --> 0:18:55,000
neither in rich countries or poor countries.

338
0:18:55.985,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Number three is: be a paralegal in your own life.

339
0:19:00.596,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Find an injustice or a problem where you live.

340
0:19:03.413,000 --> 0:19:04,000
It's not hard to find, if you look.

341
0:19:05.111,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Is the river being contaminated,

342
0:19:06.763,000 --> 0:19:08,000
the one that passes through the city where you live?

343
0:19:09.236,000 --> 0:19:11,000
Are there workers getting paid less than minimum wage

344
0:19:11.763,000 --> 0:19:12,000
or who are working without safety gear?

345
0:19:13.677,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Get to know the people most affected,

346
0:19:16.218,000 --> 0:19:17,000
find out what the rules say,

347
0:19:17.862,000 --> 0:19:2,000
see if you can use those rules to get a solution.

348
0:19:21.587,000 --> 0:19:24,000
If it doesn't work, see if you can come together to improve those rules.

349
0:19:25.429,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Because if we all start knowing law, using law and shaping law,

350
0:19:31.516,000 --> 0:19:34,000
then we will be building that deeper version of democracy

351
0:19:34.801,000 --> 0:19:36,000
that I believe our world desperately needs.

352
0:19:39.029,000 --> 0:19:4,000
(Applause)

353
0:19:40.054,000 --> 0:19:42,000
KK: Thanks so much, Vivek. VM: Thank you.

1
0:00:15.539,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I study the future

2
0:00:18.362,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of crime and terrorism,

3
0:00:22.647,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and frankly, I'm afraid.

4
0:00:25.007,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm afraid by what I see.

5
0:00:26.969,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I sincerely want to believe

6
0:00:29.114,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that technology can bring us

7
0:00:31.906,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the techno-utopia that we've been promised,

8
0:00:34.963,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but, you see,

9
0:00:36.699,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've spent a career in law enforcement,

10
0:00:39.812,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and that's informed my perspective on things.

11
0:00:42.585,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I've been a street police officer,

12
0:00:44.218,000 --> 0:00:46,000
an undercover investigator,

13
0:00:46.289,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a counter-terrorism strategist,

14
0:00:48.297,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I've worked in more than 70 countries

15
0:00:50.522,000 --> 0:00:51,000
around the world.

16
0:00:51.988,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I've had to see more than my fair share

17
0:00:53.644,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of violence and the darker underbelly of society,

18
0:00:56.889,000 --> 0:01:,000
and that's informed my opinions.

19
0:01:01.35,000 --> 0:01:02,000
My work with criminals and terrorists

20
0:01:02.937,000 --> 0:01:04,000
has actually been highly educational.

21
0:01:05.057,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able

22
0:01:07.766,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to share some of these observations with you.

23
0:01:11.665,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Today I'm going to show you the flip side

24
0:01:13.984,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of all those technologies that we marvel at,

25
0:01:17.999,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the ones that we love.

26
0:01:19.862,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In the hands of the TED community,

27
0:01:21.728,000 --> 0:01:23,000
these are awesome tools which will bring about

28
0:01:24.641,000 --> 0:01:27,000
great change for our world,

29
0:01:28.1,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but in the hands of suicide bombers,

30
0:01:30.826,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the future can look quite different.

31
0:01:34.262,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I started observing

32
0:01:36.415,000 --> 0:01:37,000
technology and how criminals were using it

33
0:01:38.311,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as a young patrol officer.

34
0:01:40.302,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In those days, this was the height of technology.

35
0:01:44.758,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Laugh though you will,

36
0:01:46.327,000 --> 0:01:47,000
all the drug dealers and gang members

37
0:01:47.622,000 --> 0:01:49,000
with whom I dealt had one of these

38
0:01:49.823,000 --> 0:01:53,000
long before any police officer I knew did.

39
0:01:54.114,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Twenty years later, criminals are still using

40
0:01:56.974,000 --> 0:01:59,000
mobile phones, but they're also building

41
0:02:00.857,000 --> 0:02:02,000
their own mobile phone networks,

42
0:02:03.206,000 --> 0:02:05,000
like this one, which has been deployed

43
0:02:05.438,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.

44
0:02:09.238,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They have a national encrypted

45
0:02:11.374,000 --> 0:02:14,000
radio communications system.

46
0:02:14.583,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Think about that.

47
0:02:16.693,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Think about the innovation that went into that.

48
0:02:20.075,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Think about the infrastructure to build it.

49
0:02:22.972,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And then think about this:

50
0:02:24.377,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter)

51
0:02:28.427,000 --> 0:02:33,000
How is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause)

52
0:02:33.514,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We consistently underestimate

53
0:02:34.872,000 --> 0:02:37,000
what criminals and terrorists can do.

54
0:02:38.176,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Technology has made our world

55
0:02:39.784,000 --> 0:02:41,000
increasingly open, and for the most part,

56
0:02:41.864,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that's great, but all of this openness

57
0:02:44.217,000 --> 0:02:46,000
may have unintended consequences.

58
0:02:46.262,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.

59
0:02:50.978,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The men that carried that attack out were armed

60
0:02:54.136,000 --> 0:02:57,000
with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades.

61
0:02:57.606,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They threw these hand grenades

62
0:02:59.438,000 --> 0:03:02,000
at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes

63
0:03:02.638,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and waited to catch trains on their way home from work.

64
0:03:07.491,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations.

65
0:03:10.844,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Guns and bombs are nothing new.

66
0:03:13.248,000 --> 0:03:14,000
What was different this time

67
0:03:14.484,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is the way that the terrorists used

68
0:03:17.172,000 --> 0:03:19,000
modern information communications technologies

69
0:03:19.908,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to locate additional victims and slaughter them.

70
0:03:25.264,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They were armed with mobile phones.

71
0:03:27.477,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They had BlackBerries.

72
0:03:29.076,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They had access to satellite imagery.

73
0:03:31.313,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.

74
0:03:36.278,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But perhaps their greatest innovation was this.

75
0:03:39.265,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We've all seen pictures like this

76
0:03:41.353,000 --> 0:03:44,000
on television and in the news. This is an operations center.

77
0:03:44.709,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And the terrorists built their very own op center

78
0:03:47.136,000 --> 0:03:5,000
across the border in Pakistan,

79
0:03:50.567,000 --> 0:03:51,000
where they monitored the BBC,

80
0:03:51.848,000 --> 0:03:55,000
al Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations.

81
0:03:56.438,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They also monitored the Internet and social media

82
0:04:01.466,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to monitor the progress of their attacks

83
0:04:03.588,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and how many people they had killed.

84
0:04:05.958,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They did all of this in real time.

85
0:04:09.026,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The innovation of the terrorist operations center

86
0:04:12.364,000 --> 0:04:15,000
gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness

87
0:04:16.338,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and tactical advantage over the police

88
0:04:18.564,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and over the government.

89
0:04:21.207,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What did they do with this?

90
0:04:22.472,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They used it to great effect.

91
0:04:24.448,000 --> 0:04:26,000
At one point during the 60-hour siege,

92
0:04:26.497,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the terrorists were going room to room

93
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
trying to find additional victims.

94
0:04:31.221,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They came upon a suite on the top floor

95
0:04:32.872,000 --> 0:04:33,000
of the hotel, and they kicked down the door

96
0:04:34.777,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they found a man hiding by his bed.

97
0:04:37.664,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And they said to him, "Who are you,

98
0:04:39.691,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and what are you doing here?"

99
0:04:41.08,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And the man replied,

100
0:04:42.8,000 --> 0:04:45,000
"I'm just an innocent schoolteacher."

101
0:04:46.474,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Of course, the terrorists knew

102
0:04:48.638,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj.

103
0:04:52.483,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They picked up his identification,

104
0:04:54.075,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room,

105
0:04:57.598,000 --> 0:04:59,000
where the terrorist war room Googled him,

106
0:05:00.422,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and found a picture and called their operatives

107
0:05:03.063,000 --> 0:05:04,000
on the ground and said,

108
0:05:04.256,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"Your hostage, is he heavyset?

109
0:05:08.935,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Is he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?"

110
0:05:13.413,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Yes, yes, yes," came the answers.

111
0:05:18.019,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The op center had found him and they had a match.

112
0:05:20.006,000 --> 0:05:21,000
He was not a schoolteacher.

113
0:05:21.373,000 --> 0:05:24,000
He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India,

114
0:05:25.247,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and after discovering this information,

115
0:05:26.892,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the terrorist war room gave the order

116
0:05:29.947,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai.

117
0:05:32.573,000 --> 0:05:35,000
("Kill him.")

118
0:05:35.699,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We all worry about our privacy settings

119
0:05:39.14,000 --> 0:05:4,000
on Facebook,

120
0:05:40.876,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but the fact of the matter is,

121
0:05:43.301,000 --> 0:05:46,000
our openness can be used against us.

122
0:05:46.763,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Terrorists are doing this.

123
0:05:48.669,000 --> 0:05:51,000
A search engine can determine

124
0:05:52.175,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who shall live and who shall die.

125
0:05:56.13,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is the world that we live in.

126
0:05:59.159,000 --> 0:06:,000
During the Mumbai siege,

127
0:06:00.728,000 --> 0:06:02,000
terrorists were so dependent on technology

128
0:06:03.354,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that several witnesses reported that

129
0:06:05.6,000 --> 0:06:07,000
as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand,

130
0:06:08.479,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they were checking their mobile phone messages

131
0:06:10.855,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in the very other hand.

132
0:06:13.31,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In the end, 300 people were gravely wounded

133
0:06:16.46,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and over 172 men, women and children

134
0:06:20.365,000 --> 0:06:24,000
lost their lives that day.

135
0:06:24.716,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Think about what happened.

136
0:06:26.481,000 --> 0:06:29,000
During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai,

137
0:06:29.492,000 --> 0:06:33,000
10 men armed not just with weapons,

138
0:06:33.907,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but with technology,

139
0:06:35.801,000 --> 0:06:38,000
were able to bring a city of 20 million people

140
0:06:39.331,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to a standstill.

141
0:06:41.493,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Ten people brought 20 million people

142
0:06:43.463,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to a standstill, and this traveled around the world.

143
0:06:47.657,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is what radicals can do with openness.

144
0:06:53.967,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This was done nearly four years ago.

145
0:06:56.485,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What could terrorists do today

146
0:06:58.026,000 --> 0:07:,000
with the technologies available that we have?

147
0:07:00.939,000 --> 0:07:03,000
What will they do tomorrow?

148
0:07:04.274,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The ability of one to affect many

149
0:07:06.653,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is scaling exponentially,

150
0:07:09.069,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil.

151
0:07:13.35,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's not just about terrorism, though.

152
0:07:15.604,000 --> 0:07:17,000
There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime.

153
0:07:17.914,000 --> 0:07:21,000
You see, you can now commit more crime as well.

154
0:07:22.207,000 --> 0:07:24,000
In the old days, it was a knife and a gun.

155
0:07:24.487,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Then criminals moved to robbing trains.

156
0:07:26.879,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You could rob 200 people on a train, a great innovation.

157
0:07:30.519,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Moving forward, the Internet

158
0:07:32.22,000 --> 0:07:34,000
allowed things to scale even more.

159
0:07:34.388,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In fact, many of you will remember

160
0:07:35.94,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the recent Sony PlayStation hack.

161
0:07:37.676,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In that incident, over 100 million people were robbed.

162
0:07:44.173,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Think about that.

163
0:07:45.899,000 --> 0:07:46,000
When in the history of humanity

164
0:07:47.365,000 --> 0:07:49,000
has it ever been possible for one person

165
0:07:49.567,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to rob 100 million?

166
0:07:54.966,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Of course, it's not just about stealing things.

167
0:07:56.765,000 --> 0:07:58,000
There are other avenues of technology

168
0:07:59.052,000 --> 0:08:,000
that criminals can exploit.

169
0:08:00.497,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Many of you will remember this super cute video

170
0:08:03.789,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from the last TED,

171
0:08:06.181,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute.

172
0:08:11.251,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They don't all have drumsticks.

173
0:08:13.398,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Some can be armed with HD cameras

174
0:08:15.256,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and do countersurveillance on protesters,

175
0:08:17.759,000 --> 0:08:19,000
or, as in this little bit of movie magic,

176
0:08:20.655,000 --> 0:08:23,000
quadcopters can be loaded with firearms

177
0:08:24.358,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and automatic weapons.

178
0:08:27.916,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Little robots are cute when they play music to you.

179
0:08:30.629,000 --> 0:08:32,000
When they swarm and chase you down the block

180
0:08:33.397,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to shoot you, a little bit less so.

181
0:08:37.029,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Of course, criminals and terrorists weren't the first

182
0:08:39.078,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to give guns to robots. We know where that started.

183
0:08:41.916,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But they're adapting quickly.

184
0:08:43.252,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Recently, the FBI arrested

185
0:08:45.232,000 --> 0:08:46,000
an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States,

186
0:08:47.039,000 --> 0:08:48,000
who was planning on using these remote-controlled

187
0:08:48.96,000 --> 0:08:5,000
drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives

188
0:08:51.887,000 --> 0:08:53,000
into government buildings in the United States.

189
0:08:54.496,000 --> 0:08:59,000
By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.

190
0:08:59.883,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Every time a new technology is being introduced,

191
0:09:02.257,000 --> 0:09:04,000
criminals are there to exploit it.

192
0:09:04.898,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We've all seen 3D printers.

193
0:09:06.345,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We know with them that you can print

194
0:09:07.777,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in many materials ranging from plastic

195
0:09:10.609,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to chocolate to metal and even concrete.

196
0:09:14.974,000 --> 0:09:15,000
With great precision

197
0:09:16.36,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I actually was able to make this

198
0:09:18.419,000 --> 0:09:19,000
just the other day, a very cute little ducky.

199
0:09:25.343,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But I wonder to myself,

200
0:09:27.187,000 --> 0:09:33,000
for those people that strap bombs to their chests

201
0:09:34.1,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and blow themselves up,

202
0:09:35.181,000 --> 0:09:38,000
how might they use 3D printers?

203
0:09:38.938,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Perhaps like this.

204
0:09:43.051,000 --> 0:09:45,000
You see, if you can print in metal,

205
0:09:45.244,000 --> 0:09:48,000
you can print one of these,

206
0:09:48.591,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and in fact

207
0:09:54.75,000 --> 0:09:57,000
you can also print one of these too.

208
0:10:00.793,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws.

209
0:10:05.344,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore.

210
0:10:07.465,000 --> 0:10:08,000
You just bring the 3D printer

211
0:10:09.12,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and print the gun while you're here,

212
0:10:11.955,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and, of course, the magazines for your bullets.

213
0:10:15.06,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But as these get bigger in the future,

214
0:10:16.596,000 --> 0:10:18,000
what other items will you be able to print?

215
0:10:18.741,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The technologies are allowing bigger printers.

216
0:10:22.029,000 --> 0:10:23,000
As we move forward,

217
0:10:23.377,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we'll see new technologies also, like the Internet of Things.

218
0:10:26.069,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives

219
0:10:28.1,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to the Internet, which means

220
0:10:30.693,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that the Internet of Things will soon be

221
0:10:34.919,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the Internet of Things To Be Hacked.

222
0:10:36.683,000 --> 0:10:38,000
All of the physical objects in our space

223
0:10:38.706,000 --> 0:10:4,000
are being transformed into information technologies,

224
0:10:41.57,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and that has a radical implication for our security,

225
0:10:45.125,000 --> 0:10:48,000
because more connections to more devices

226
0:10:48.135,000 --> 0:10:5,000
means more vulnerabilities.

227
0:10:50.714,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Criminals understand this.

228
0:10:52.462,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this.

229
0:10:54.341,000 --> 0:10:57,000
If you control the code, you control the world.

230
0:10:57.504,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This is the future that awaits us.

231
0:11:02.175,000 --> 0:11:04,000
There has not yet been an operating system

232
0:11:05.012,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or a technology that hasn't been hacked.

233
0:11:07.612,000 --> 0:11:09,000
That's troubling, since the human body itself

234
0:11:10.35,000 --> 0:11:13,000
is now becoming an information technology.

235
0:11:13.448,000 --> 0:11:16,000
As we've seen here, we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs.

236
0:11:17.015,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Every year, thousands of cochlear implants,

237
0:11:19.567,000 --> 0:11:21,000
diabetic pumps, pacemakers

238
0:11:21.785,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and defibrillators are being implanted in people.

239
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
In the United States, there are 60,000 people

240
0:11:26.648,000 --> 0:11:28,000
who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet.

241
0:11:29.61,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance

242
0:11:32.974,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to give a shock to a heart

243
0:11:34.764,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in case a patient needs it.

244
0:11:37.114,000 --> 0:11:39,000
But if you don't need it,

245
0:11:39.205,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and somebody else gives you the shock,

246
0:11:40.981,000 --> 0:11:43,000
it's not a good thing.

247
0:11:44.372,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Of course, we're going to go even deeper than the human body.

248
0:11:47.994,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We're going down to the cellular level these days.

249
0:11:50.244,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Up until this point, all the technologies

250
0:11:52.387,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I've been talking about have been silicon-based, ones and zeroes,

251
0:11:56.182,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but there's another operating system out there:

252
0:11:58.873,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the original operating system, DNA.

253
0:12:03.569,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And to hackers, DNA is just another operating system

254
0:12:08.009,000 --> 0:12:09,000
waiting to be hacked.

255
0:12:10.008,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It's a great challenge for them.

256
0:12:11.504,000 --> 0:12:12,000
There are people already working on hacking the software of life,

257
0:12:14.804,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and while most of them are doing this to great good

258
0:12:17.761,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and to help us all,

259
0:12:19.162,000 --> 0:12:22,000
some won't be.

260
0:12:22.698,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So how will criminals abuse this?

261
0:12:24.36,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Well, with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things.

262
0:12:26.643,000 --> 0:12:29,000
For example, I predict that we will move away

263
0:12:29.839,000 --> 0:12:32,000
from a plant-based narcotics world

264
0:12:32.95,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore?

265
0:12:36.009,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You can just take the DNA code from marijuana

266
0:12:39.126,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or poppies or coca leaves

267
0:12:43.918,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and cut and past that gene

268
0:12:46.238,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and put it into yeast,

269
0:12:48.915,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and you can take those yeast

270
0:12:50.317,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and make them make the cocaine for you,

271
0:12:53.589,000 --> 0:12:56,000
or the marijuana, or any other drug.

272
0:12:57.373,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So how we use yeast in the future

273
0:12:59.157,000 --> 0:13:,000
is going to be really interesting.

274
0:13:01.047,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer

275
0:13:03.391,000 --> 0:13:06,000
as we go into this next century.

276
0:13:07.214,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously.

277
0:13:11.212,000 --> 0:13:13,000
It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace,

278
0:13:13.6,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but then in 2008, something changed.

279
0:13:15.566,000 --> 0:13:16,000
The technologies got better,

280
0:13:17.238,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace

281
0:13:21.084,000 --> 0:13:24,000
five times that of Moore's Law.

282
0:13:24.202,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That has significant implications for us.

283
0:13:28.026,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It took us 30 years to get from

284
0:13:30.769,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the introduction of the personal computer

285
0:13:32.925,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to the level of cybercrime we have today,

286
0:13:35.154,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly,

287
0:13:38.781,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do,

288
0:13:40.445,000 --> 0:13:42,000
we may get there a lot faster

289
0:13:43.314,000 --> 0:13:44,000
with biocrime in the future.

290
0:13:45.183,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It will be easy for anybody to go ahead

291
0:13:47.222,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and print their own bio-virus,

292
0:13:49.102,000 --> 0:13:51,000
enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax,

293
0:13:51.864,000 --> 0:13:52,000
weaponized flu.

294
0:13:53.622,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We recently saw a case where some researchers

295
0:13:56.411,000 --> 0:14:01,000
made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.

296
0:14:01.437,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It already has a 70 percent mortality rate

297
0:14:04.903,000 --> 0:14:05,000
if you get it, but it's hard to get.

298
0:14:06.493,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Engineers, by moving around a small number

299
0:14:09.301,000 --> 0:14:1,000
of genetic changes,

300
0:14:10.957,000 --> 0:14:11,000
were able to weaponize it

301
0:14:12.656,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and make it much more easy for human beings to catch,

302
0:14:15.918,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so that not thousands of people would die,

303
0:14:18.101,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but tens of millions.

304
0:14:19.814,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You see, you can go ahead and create

305
0:14:22.304,000 --> 0:14:23,000
new pandemics, and the researchers who did this

306
0:14:24.285,000 --> 0:14:25,000
were so proud of their accomplishments,

307
0:14:25.797,000 --> 0:14:26,000
they wanted to publish it openly

308
0:14:27.686,000 --> 0:14:29,000
so that everybody could see this

309
0:14:29.789,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and get access to this information.

310
0:14:33.933,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But it goes deeper than that.

311
0:14:35.728,000 --> 0:14:36,000
DNA researcher Andrew Hessel

312
0:14:37.67,000 --> 0:14:38,000
has pointed out quite rightly

313
0:14:39.067,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that if you can use cancer treatments,

314
0:14:41.35,000 --> 0:14:42,000
modern cancer treatments,

315
0:14:42.478,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells

316
0:14:45.427,000 --> 0:14:46,000
around it intact,

317
0:14:47.083,000 --> 0:14:51,000
then you can also go after any one person's cell.

318
0:14:51.227,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Personalized cancer treatments

319
0:14:53.205,000 --> 0:14:55,000
are the flip side of personalized bioweapons,

320
0:14:55.819,000 --> 0:14:58,000
which means you can attack any one individual,

321
0:14:59.205,000 --> 0:15:03,000
including all the people in this picture.

322
0:15:03.388,000 --> 0:15:07,000
How will we protect them in the future?

323
0:15:07.516,000 --> 0:15:09,000
What to do? What to do about all this?

324
0:15:10.326,000 --> 0:15:12,000
That's what I get asked all the time.

325
0:15:12.821,000 --> 0:15:13,000
For those of you who follow me on Twitter,

326
0:15:14.408,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I will be tweeting out the answer later on today. (Laughter)

327
0:15:18.938,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Actually, it's a bit more complex than that,

328
0:15:21.573,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and there are no magic bullets.

329
0:15:23.652,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I don't have all the answers,

330
0:15:25.364,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but I know a few things.

331
0:15:27.028,000 --> 0:15:29,000
In the wake of 9/11,

332
0:15:29.725,000 --> 0:15:31,000
the best security minds

333
0:15:32.515,000 --> 0:15:33,000
put together all their innovation

334
0:15:34.499,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and this is what they created for security.

335
0:15:38.638,000 --> 0:15:42,000
If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you

336
0:15:42.659,000 --> 0:15:45,000
from the coming robopocalypse — (Laughter)

337
0:15:46.375,000 --> 0:15:48,000
— uh, you may want to have a backup plan. (Laughter)

338
0:15:49.327,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Just saying. Just think about that. (Applause)

339
0:15:55.526,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Law enforcement is currently a closed system.

340
0:15:58.445,000 --> 0:16:,000
It's nation-based, while the threat is international.

341
0:16:01.247,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Policing doesn't scale globally. At least, it hasn't,

342
0:16:05.195,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences

343
0:16:09.478,000 --> 0:16:12,000
are outdated in the new world into which we're moving.

344
0:16:12.589,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats,

345
0:16:14.865,000 --> 0:16:16,000
like attacking a president or a prime minister?

346
0:16:17.288,000 --> 0:16:19,000
This would be the natural government response,

347
0:16:19.425,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to hide away all our government leaders

348
0:16:21.702,000 --> 0:16:22,000
in hermetically sealed bubbles.

349
0:16:23.513,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But this is not going to work.

350
0:16:25.345,000 --> 0:16:28,000
The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial.

351
0:16:28.481,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future.

352
0:16:31.726,000 --> 0:16:34,000
So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this.

353
0:16:35.183,000 --> 0:16:36,000
What happens if we were to take

354
0:16:37.111,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the President's DNA, or a king or queen's,

355
0:16:40.311,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and put it out to a group of a few hundred

356
0:16:42.647,000 --> 0:16:43,000
trusted researchers so they could

357
0:16:44.543,000 --> 0:16:46,000
study that DNA and do penetration testing against it

358
0:16:47.479,000 --> 0:16:49,000
as a means of helping our leaders?

359
0:16:49.687,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand?

360
0:16:51.944,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Or, controversially, and not without its risks,

361
0:16:54.606,000 --> 0:16:56,000
what happens if we just gave it to the whole public?

362
0:16:57.465,000 --> 0:17:,000
Then we could all be engaged in helping.

363
0:17:01.03,000 --> 0:17:03,000
We've already seen examples of this working well.

364
0:17:03.646,000 --> 0:17:05,000
The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project

365
0:17:06.574,000 --> 0:17:07,000
is staffed by journalists and citizens

366
0:17:08.246,000 --> 0:17:09,000
where they are crowd-sourcing

367
0:17:09.982,000 --> 0:17:11,000
what dictators and terrorists are doing

368
0:17:12.595,000 --> 0:17:13,000
with public funds around the world,

369
0:17:14.277,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and, in a more dramatic case,

370
0:17:15.944,000 --> 0:17:17,000
we've seen in Mexico,

371
0:17:18.248,000 --> 0:17:19,000
a country that has been racked

372
0:17:19.872,000 --> 0:17:23,000
by 50,000 narcotics-related murders

373
0:17:23.885,000 --> 0:17:24,000
in the past six years.

374
0:17:25.651,000 --> 0:17:26,000
They're killing so many people

375
0:17:27.026,000 --> 0:17:29,000
they can't even afford to bury them all

376
0:17:29.306,000 --> 0:17:3,000
in anything but these unmarked graves

377
0:17:31.075,000 --> 0:17:34,000
like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez.

378
0:17:34.48,000 --> 0:17:37,000
What can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective.

379
0:17:37.588,000 --> 0:17:4,000
So in Mexico, citizens, at great risk to themselves,

380
0:17:40.725,000 --> 0:17:44,000
are fighting back to build an effective solution.

381
0:17:44.804,000 --> 0:17:48,000
They're crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers.

382
0:17:48.988,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Whether or not you realize it,

383
0:17:50.78,000 --> 0:17:53,000
we are at the dawn of a technological arms race,

384
0:17:54.465,000 --> 0:17:55,000
an arms race between people

385
0:17:56.243,000 --> 0:17:57,000
who are using technology for good

386
0:17:58.005,000 --> 0:18:,000
and those who are using it for ill.

387
0:18:00.213,000 --> 0:18:04,000
The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now.

388
0:18:04.574,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are.

389
0:18:08.007,000 --> 0:18:1,000
My personal belief is that,

390
0:18:10.11,000 --> 0:18:11,000
rather than having a small, elite force

391
0:18:12.055,000 --> 0:18:14,000
of highly trained government agents

392
0:18:14.095,000 --> 0:18:15,000
here to protect us all,

393
0:18:15.816,000 --> 0:18:16,000
we're much better off

394
0:18:17.519,000 --> 0:18:19,000
having average and ordinary citizens

395
0:18:19.598,000 --> 0:18:21,000
approaching this problem as a group

396
0:18:22.022,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and seeing what we can do.

397
0:18:23.335,000 --> 0:18:24,000
If we all do our part,

398
0:18:24.584,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I think we'll be in a much better space.

399
0:18:26.911,000 --> 0:18:27,000
The tools to change the world

400
0:18:28.378,000 --> 0:18:29,000
are in everybody's hands.

401
0:18:30.071,000 --> 0:18:32,000
How we use them is not just up to me,

402
0:18:32.91,000 --> 0:18:34,000
it's up to all of us.

403
0:18:35.392,000 --> 0:18:37,000
This was a technology I would frequently deploy

404
0:18:38.025,000 --> 0:18:39,000
as a police officer.

405
0:18:39.946,000 --> 0:18:42,000
This technology has become outdated in our current world.

406
0:18:43.734,000 --> 0:18:45,000
It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally,

407
0:18:46.446,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and it surely doesn't work virtually.

408
0:18:48.518,000 --> 0:18:51,000
We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism.

409
0:18:51.786,000 --> 0:18:55,000
They call for a shift to a more open form

410
0:18:56.133,000 --> 0:19:,000
and a more participatory form of law enforcement.

411
0:19:01.03,000 --> 0:19:03,000
So I invite you to join me.

412
0:19:03.669,000 --> 0:19:08,000
After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals.

413
0:19:08.857,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Thank you. (Applause)

414
0:19:11.664,000 --> 0:19:18,000
(Applause)

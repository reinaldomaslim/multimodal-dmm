1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This story begins in 1985,

2
0:00:15.96,000 --> 0:00:16,000
when at age 22,

3
0:00:17.96,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I became the World Chess Champion

4
0:00:20.36,000 --> 0:00:23,000
after beating Anatoly Karpov.

5
0:00:24.48,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Earlier that year,

6
0:00:25.76,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I played what is called simultaneous exhibition

7
0:00:29.4,000 --> 0:00:33,000
against 32 of the world's best chess-playing machines

8
0:00:33.72,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in Hamburg, Germany.

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I won all the games,

10
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and then it was not considered much of a surprise

11
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that I could beat 32 computers at the same time.

12
0:00:46.48,000 --> 0:00:48,000
To me, that was the golden age.

13
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:51.2,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Machines were weak,

15
0:00:53.68,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and my hair was strong.

16
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:58.72,000 --> 0:01:,000
Just 12 years later,

18
0:01:00.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was fighting for my life against just one computer

19
0:01:05.44,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in a match

20
0:01:07.36,000 --> 0:01:09,000
called by the cover of "Newsweek"

21
0:01:09.44,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"The Brain's Last Stand."

22
0:01:11.24,000 --> 0:01:12,000
No pressure.

23
0:01:12.48,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:15.04,000 --> 0:01:17,000
From mythology to science fiction,

25
0:01:17.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
human versus machine

26
0:01:20.4,000 --> 0:01:22,000
has been often portrayed as a matter of life and death.

27
0:01:23.96,000 --> 0:01:24,000
John Henry,

28
0:01:25.56,000 --> 0:01:26,000
called the steel-driving man

29
0:01:27.28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in the 19th century African American folk legend,

30
0:01:31.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
was pitted in a race

31
0:01:32.48,000 --> 0:01:34,000
against a steam-powered hammer

32
0:01:35.24,000 --> 0:01:37,000
bashing a tunnel through mountain rock.

33
0:01:38.8,000 --> 0:01:42,000
John Henry's legend is a part of a long historical narrative

34
0:01:43.68,000 --> 0:01:46,000
pitting humanity versus technology.

35
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And this competitive rhetoric is standard now.

36
0:01:51.56,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We are in a race against the machines,

37
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in a fight or even in a war.

38
0:01:57.88,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Jobs are being killed off.

39
0:01:59.52,000 --> 0:02:02,000
People are being replaced as if they had vanished from the Earth.

40
0:02:04.24,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's enough to think that the movies like "The Terminator" or "The Matrix"

41
0:02:07.76,000 --> 0:02:08,000
are nonfiction.

42
0:02:11.64,000 --> 0:02:15,000
There are very few instances of an arena

43
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:21,000
where the human body and mind can compete on equal terms

44
0:02:21.639,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with a computer or a robot.

45
0:02:24.28,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Actually, I wish there were a few more.

46
0:02:27.76,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Instead,

47
0:02:29.84,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it was my blessing and my curse

48
0:02:34.52,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to literally become the proverbial man

49
0:02:37.24,000 --> 0:02:4,000
in the man versus machine competition

50
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that everybody is still talking about.

51
0:02:45.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In the most famous human-machine competition since John Henry,

52
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I played two matches

53
0:02:52.76,000 --> 0:02:55,000
against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.

54
0:02:59.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Nobody remembers that I won the first match --

55
0:03:01.24,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:03.6,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Applause)

57
0:03:07.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch the following year in New York.

58
0:03:12.92,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But I guess that's fair.

59
0:03:16.32,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There is no day in history, special calendar entry

60
0:03:21.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for all the people who failed to climb Mt. Everest

61
0:03:24.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay

62
0:03:27.72,000 --> 0:03:28,000
made it to the top.

63
0:03:29.96,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And in 1997, I was still the world champion

64
0:03:36.52,000 --> 0:03:4,000
when chess computers finally came of age.

65
0:03:41.52,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I was Mt. Everest,

66
0:03:43.52,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and Deep Blue reached the summit.

67
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I should say of course, not that Deep Blue did it,

68
0:03:50.68,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but its human creators --

69
0:03:52.84,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.

70
0:03:56.2,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Hats off to them.

71
0:03:58.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
As always, machine's triumph was a human triumph,

72
0:04:03.28,000 --> 0:04:07,000
something we tend to forget when humans are surpassed by our own creations.

73
0:04:10.36,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Deep Blue was victorious,

74
0:04:13.4,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but was it intelligent?

75
0:04:15.36,000 --> 0:04:16,000
No, no it wasn't,

76
0:04:18.2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
at least not in the way Alan Turing and other founders of computer science

77
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:24,000
had hoped.

78
0:04:25.24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It turned out that chess could be crunched by brute force,

79
0:04:30.04,000 --> 0:04:34,000
once hardware got fast enough

80
0:04:34.32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and algorithms got smart enough.

81
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Although by the definition of the output,

82
0:04:42.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
grandmaster-level chess,

83
0:04:45.72,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Deep Blue was intelligent.

84
0:04:49.32,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But even at the incredible speed,

85
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:55,000
200 million positions per second,

86
0:04:57.36,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Deep Blue's method

87
0:04:59.36,000 --> 0:05:05,000
provided little of the dreamed-of insight into the mysteries of human intelligence.

88
0:05:08.96,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Soon,

89
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
machines will be taxi drivers

90
0:05:13.4,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and doctors and professors,

91
0:05:15.84,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but will they be "intelligent?"

92
0:05:19.84,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I would rather leave these definitions

93
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to the philosophers and to the dictionary.

94
0:05:27.44,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What really matters is how we humans

95
0:05:32.32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
feel about living and working with these machines.

96
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
When I first met Deep Blue in 1996 in February,

97
0:05:43.44,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I had been the world champion for more than 10 years,

98
0:05:48.08,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and I had played 182 world championship games

99
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions.

100
0:05:57.24,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I knew what to expect from my opponents

101
0:06:02.32,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and what to expect from myself.

102
0:06:04.68,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I was used to measure their moves

103
0:06:09.88,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and to gauge their emotional state

104
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
by watching their body language and looking into their eyes.

105
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And then I sat across the chessboard from Deep Blue.

106
0:06:24.96,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I immediately sensed something new,

107
0:06:27.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
something unsettling.

108
0:06:31.44,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You might experience a similar feeling

109
0:06:35.32,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the first time you ride in a driverless car

110
0:06:37.88,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or the first time your new computer manager issues an order at work.

111
0:06:45.8,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But when I sat at that first game,

112
0:06:50.08,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I couldn't be sure

113
0:06:52.24,000 --> 0:06:55,000
what is this thing capable of.

114
0:06:56.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Technology can advance in leaps, and IBM had invested heavily.

115
0:07:00.68,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I lost that game.

116
0:07:04.32,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I couldn't help wondering,

117
0:07:06.12,000 --> 0:07:07,000
might it be invincible?

118
0:07:08.6,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Was my beloved game of chess over?

119
0:07:12.8,000 --> 0:07:16,000
These were human doubts, human fears,

120
0:07:16.96,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and the only thing I knew for sure

121
0:07:19.4,000 --> 0:07:21,000
was that my opponent Deep Blue had no such worries at all.

122
0:07:22.32,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

123
0:07:25.92,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I fought back

124
0:07:28.4,000 --> 0:07:29,000
after this devastating blow

125
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to win the first match,

126
0:07:32.96,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but the writing was on the wall.

127
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I eventually lost to the machine

128
0:07:38.56,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry

129
0:07:41.64,000 --> 0:07:44,000
who won but died with his hammer in his hand.

130
0:07:44.718,000 --> 0:07:46,000
[John Henry Died with a Hammer in His Hand Palmer C. Hayden]

131
0:07:47.58,000 --> 0:07:49,000
[The Museum of African American Art, Los Angeles]

132
0:07:49.91,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It turned out that the world of chess

133
0:07:52.28,000 --> 0:07:55,000
still wanted to have a human chess champion.

134
0:07:56.92,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And even today,

135
0:08:00.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
when a free chess app on the latest mobile phone

136
0:08:03.56,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is stronger than Deep Blue,

137
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:06,000
people are still playing chess,

138
0:08:08.68,000 --> 0:08:1,000
even more than ever before.

139
0:08:11.8,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Doomsayers predicted that nobody would touch the game

140
0:08:15.04,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that could be conquered by the machine,

141
0:08:17.32,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and they were wrong, proven wrong,

142
0:08:19.56,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but doomsaying has always been a popular pastime

143
0:08:23.04,000 --> 0:08:24,000
when it comes to technology.

144
0:08:26.36,000 --> 0:08:28,000
What I learned from my own experience

145
0:08:29.12,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is that we must face our fears

146
0:08:33.8,000 --> 0:08:36,000
if we want to get the most out of our technology,

147
0:08:38.36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and we must conquer those fears

148
0:08:40.76,000 --> 0:08:45,000
if we want to get the best out of our humanity.

149
0:08:48.12,000 --> 0:08:49,000
While licking my wounds,

150
0:08:49.919,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I got a lot of inspiration

151
0:08:53.08,000 --> 0:08:55,000
from my battles against Deep Blue.

152
0:08:55.799,000 --> 0:08:58,000
As the old Russian saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.

153
0:09:00.88,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Then I thought,

154
0:09:02.28,000 --> 0:09:04,000
what if I could play with a computer --

155
0:09:04.64,000 --> 0:09:07,000
together with a computer at my side, combining our strengths,

156
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
human intuition plus machine's calculation,

157
0:09:12.96,000 --> 0:09:14,000
human strategy, machine tactics,

158
0:09:15.68,000 --> 0:09:17,000
human experience, machine's memory.

159
0:09:18.12,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Could it be the perfect game ever played?

160
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:23,000
My idea came to life

161
0:09:24.92,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess

162
0:09:28.32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
when I played this human-plus-machine competition against another elite player.

163
0:09:35.28,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But in this first experiment,

164
0:09:37.2,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we both failed to combine human and machine skills effectively.

165
0:09:46.92,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Advanced Chess found its home on the internet,

166
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and in 2005, a so-called freestyle chess tournament

167
0:09:55.04,000 --> 0:09:56,000
produced a revelation.

168
0:09:59.24,000 --> 0:10:02,000
A team of grandmasters and top machines participated,

169
0:10:02.8,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but the winners were not grandmasters,

170
0:10:05.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
not a supercomputer.

171
0:10:07.68,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The winners were a pair of amateur American chess players

172
0:10:12.04,000 --> 0:10:15,000
operating three ordinary PCs at the same time.

173
0:10:17.56,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Their skill of coaching their machines

174
0:10:20.6,000 --> 0:10:25,000
effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge

175
0:10:26.4,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of their grandmaster opponents

176
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and much greater computational power of others.

177
0:10:33.6,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And I reached this formulation.

178
0:10:36.56,000 --> 0:10:39,000
A weak human player plus a machine

179
0:10:39.96,000 --> 0:10:42,000
plus a better process is superior

180
0:10:43.24,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to a very powerful machine alone,

181
0:10:45.68,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but more remarkably, is superior to a strong human player

182
0:10:49.6,000 --> 0:10:5,000
plus machine

183
0:10:53.12,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and an inferior process.

184
0:10:58.36,000 --> 0:11:,000
This convinced me that we would need

185
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
better interfaces to help us coach our machines

186
0:11:06.52,000 --> 0:11:07,000
towards more useful intelligence.

187
0:11:10.32,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Human plus machine isn't the future,

188
0:11:13.64,000 --> 0:11:14,000
it's the present.

189
0:11:14.88,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Everybody that's used online translation

190
0:11:19.04,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to get the gist of a news article from a foreign newspaper,

191
0:11:23.36,000 --> 0:11:24,000
knowing its far from perfect.

192
0:11:25.68,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Then we use our human experience

193
0:11:27.8,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to make sense out of that,

194
0:11:29.92,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and then the machine learns from our corrections.

195
0:11:32.72,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This model is spreading and investing in medical diagnosis, security analysis.

196
0:11:38.44,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The machine crunches data,

197
0:11:41.32,000 --> 0:11:42,000
calculates probabilities,

198
0:11:43.08,000 --> 0:11:46,000
gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,

199
0:11:46.76,000 --> 0:11:5,000
making it easier for analysis

200
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and decision-making of the human party.

201
0:11:54.28,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But you are not going to send your kids

202
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to school in a self-driving car with 90 percent accuracy,

203
0:12:04.6,000 --> 0:12:05,000
even with 99 percent.

204
0:12:07.56,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So we need a leap forward

205
0:12:10.44,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to add a few more crucial decimal places.

206
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Twenty years after my match with Deep Blue,

207
0:12:24.2,000 --> 0:12:25,000
second match,

208
0:12:25.84,000 --> 0:12:31,000
this sensational "The Brain's Last Stand" headline

209
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
has become commonplace

210
0:12:33.76,000 --> 0:12:35,000
as intelligent machines

211
0:12:36.32,000 --> 0:12:37,000
move

212
0:12:38.56,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in every sector, seemingly every day.

213
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But unlike in the past,

214
0:12:45.28,000 --> 0:12:46,000
when machines replaced

215
0:12:48.48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
farm animals, manual labor,

216
0:12:50.88,000 --> 0:12:52,000
now they are coming after people with college degrees

217
0:12:53.4,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and political influence.

218
0:12:56.12,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And as someone who fought machines and lost,

219
0:12:58.24,000 --> 0:13:,000
I am here to tell you this is excellent, excellent news.

220
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Eventually, every profession

221
0:13:05.24,000 --> 0:13:07,000
will have to feel these pressures

222
0:13:07.36,000 --> 0:13:12,000
or else it will mean humanity has ceased to make progress.

223
0:13:14.76,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We don't

224
0:13:17.44,000 --> 0:13:18,000
get to choose

225
0:13:20.48,000 --> 0:13:22,000
when and where technological progress stops.

226
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We cannot

227
0:13:27.96,000 --> 0:13:28,000
slow down.

228
0:13:29.48,000 --> 0:13:3,000
In fact,

229
0:13:31.32,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we have to speed up.

230
0:13:36.6,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Our technology excels at removing

231
0:13:41.2,000 --> 0:13:44,000
difficulties and uncertainties from our lives,

232
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and so we must seek out

233
0:13:49.84,000 --> 0:13:5,000
ever more difficult,

234
0:13:51.72,000 --> 0:13:55,000
ever more uncertain challenges.

235
0:14:00.2,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Machines have

236
0:14:03.88,000 --> 0:14:04,000
calculations.

237
0:14:05.72,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We have understanding.

238
0:14:07.32,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Machines have instructions.

239
0:14:10.84,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We have purpose.

240
0:14:12.72,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Machines have

241
0:14:17.08,000 --> 0:14:18,000
objectivity.

242
0:14:18.32,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We have passion.

243
0:14:20.6,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We should not worry about what our machines can do today.

244
0:14:26.6,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Instead, we should worry about what they still cannot do today,

245
0:14:31.2,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because we will need the help of the new, intelligent machines

246
0:14:36.72,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to turn our grandest dreams into reality.

247
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And if we fail,

248
0:14:44.24,000 --> 0:14:48,000
if we fail, it's not because our machines are too intelligent,

249
0:14:48.92,000 --> 0:14:49,000
or not intelligent enough.

250
0:14:51.2,000 --> 0:14:54,000
If we fail, it's because we grew complacent

251
0:14:55.68,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and limited our ambitions.

252
0:14:58.52,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Our humanity is not defined by any skill,

253
0:15:03.28,000 --> 0:15:05,000
like swinging a hammer or even playing chess.

254
0:15:06.56,000 --> 0:15:09,000
There's one thing only a human can do.

255
0:15:09.6,000 --> 0:15:1,000
That's dream.

256
0:15:12.12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So let us dream big.

257
0:15:14.68,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Thank you.

258
0:15:15.92,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Applause)

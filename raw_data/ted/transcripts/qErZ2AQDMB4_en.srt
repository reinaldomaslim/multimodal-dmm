0:00:12.586,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The will to live life differently can start

3
0:00:15.424,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in some of the most unusual places.

4
0:00:18.87,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This is where I come from, Todmorden.

5
0:00:20.816,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's a market town in the north of England,

6
0:00:22.836,000 --> 0:00:24,000
15,000 people, between Leeds and Manchester,

7
0:00:25.507,000 --> 0:00:27,000
fairly normal market town.

8
0:00:27.58,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It used to look like this,

9
0:00:29.75,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and now it's more like this,

10
0:00:32.498,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.

11
0:00:36.223,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We call it propaganda gardening. (Laughter)

12
0:00:40.94,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Corner row railway, station car park,

13
0:00:43.955,000 --> 0:00:46,000
front of a health center, people's front gardens,

14
0:00:47.707,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and even in front of the police station. (Laughter)

15
0:00:51.244,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We've got edible canal towpaths,

16
0:00:54.234,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and we've got sprouting cemeteries.

17
0:00:56.4,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The soil is extremely good. (Laughter)

18
0:01:02.901,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We've even invented a new form of tourism.

19
0:01:05.144,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not,

20
0:01:08.751,000 --> 0:01:11,000
people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds,

21
0:01:12.675,000 --> 0:01:14,000
even when there's not much growing. (Laughter)

22
0:01:15.659,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But it starts a conversation. (Laughter)

23
0:01:19.289,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored. (Laughter)

24
0:01:23.297,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We're doing it because we want to start a revolution.

25
0:01:28.114,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We tried to answer this simple question:

26
0:01:29.432,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age

27
0:01:32.322,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and income and culture that will help people themselves

28
0:01:36.539,000 --> 0:01:37,000
find a new way of living,

29
0:01:38.2,000 --> 0:01:4,000
see spaces around them differently,

30
0:01:40.325,000 --> 0:01:42,000
think about the resources they use differently,

31
0:01:42.928,000 --> 0:01:43,000
interact differently?

32
0:01:44.921,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Can we find that language?

33
0:01:47.29,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And then, can we replicate those actions?

34
0:01:51.257,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And the answer would appear to be yes,

35
0:01:54.015,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the language would appear to be food.

36
0:01:57.418,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So, three and a half years ago, a few of us

37
0:01:59.437,000 --> 0:02:,000
sat around a kitchen table and

38
0:02:01.056,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we just invented the whole thing. (Laughter)

39
0:02:04.424,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Applause)

40
0:02:07.661,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting.

41
0:02:10.252,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We did not consult. We did not write a report.

42
0:02:12.565,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Enough of all that. (Laughter)

43
0:02:15.14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden,

44
0:02:18.158,000 --> 0:02:2,000
look, let's imagine that our town

45
0:02:21.104,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is focused around three plates:

46
0:02:22.86,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives;

47
0:02:25.084,000 --> 0:02:28,000
a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school

48
0:02:28.132,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and what new skills we share amongst ourselves;

49
0:02:30.893,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket

50
0:02:34.012,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and which businesses we choose to support.

51
0:02:35.833,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, let's imagine those plates agitated

52
0:02:38.64,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with community actions around food.

53
0:02:41.28,000 --> 0:02:43,000
If we start one of those community plates spinning,

54
0:02:43.521,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that's really great, that really starts to empower people,

55
0:02:46.905,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but if we can then spin that community plate

56
0:02:48.992,000 --> 0:02:5,000
with the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate,

57
0:02:51.888,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we've got a real show there, we've got some action theater.

58
0:02:55.624,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We're starting to build resilience ourselves.

59
0:02:58.969,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We're starting to reinvent community ourselves,

60
0:03:02.36,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.

61
0:03:05.827,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Applause)

62
0:03:11.138,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And here's the thing as well.

63
0:03:13.93,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We've not asked anybody's permission to do this,

64
0:03:16.346,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we're just doing it. (Laughter)

65
0:03:18.639,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And we are certainly not waiting for that check

66
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to drop through the letterbox before we start,

67
0:03:23.138,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and most importantly of all, we are not daunted

68
0:03:25.47,000 --> 0:03:26,000
by the sophisticated arguments that say,

69
0:03:27.322,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems,"

70
0:03:31.218,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because I have seen the power of small actions,

71
0:03:34.886,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and it is awesome.

72
0:03:36.957,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So, back to the public meeting. (Laughter)

73
0:03:40.07,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds,

74
0:03:42.959,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and then the room exploded.

75
0:03:44.667,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.

76
0:03:48.555,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it's been the same in every single room, in every town

77
0:03:51.937,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that we've ever told our story.

78
0:03:53.492,000 --> 0:03:57,000
People are ready and respond to the story of food.

79
0:03:57.836,000 --> 0:03:59,000
They want positive actions they can engage in,

80
0:04:00.093,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and in their bones, they know it's time

81
0:04:02.692,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to take personal responsibility

82
0:04:04.581,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and invest in more kindness to each other

83
0:04:07.152,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and to the environment.

84
0:04:10.075,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago,

85
0:04:13.389,000 --> 0:04:16,000
it's been a heck of a roller coaster.

86
0:04:16.639,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We started with a seed swap, really simple stuff,

87
0:04:19.535,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and then we took an area of land, a strip on the side

88
0:04:21.784,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically,

89
0:04:24.286,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.

90
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We took the corner of the car park in the station

91
0:04:29.926,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that you saw, and we made vegetable beds

92
0:04:31.661,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for everybody to share and pick from themselves.

93
0:04:35.185,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We went to the doctors. We've just had

94
0:04:36.494,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden,

95
0:04:39.399,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and for some reason that I cannot comprehend,

96
0:04:42.087,000 --> 0:04:45,000
it has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter)

97
0:04:45.88,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"

98
0:04:48.969,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They said, "Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission

99
0:04:51.323,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate,"

100
0:04:53.245,000 --> 0:04:55,000
so we did — (Laughter) — and now there are fruit trees

101
0:04:56.035,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and bushes and herbs and vegetables

102
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
around that doctor's surgery.

103
0:05:02.56,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And there's been lots of other examples, like the corn

104
0:05:04.836,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that was in front of the police station,

105
0:05:06.692,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and the old people's home that we've planted it with food

106
0:05:08.509,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that they can pick and grow.

107
0:05:10.481,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But it isn't just about growing,

108
0:05:12.191,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because we all are part of this jigsaw.

109
0:05:14.736,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's about taking those artistic people in your community

110
0:05:17.61,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds

111
0:05:19.843,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to explain to people what's growing there,

112
0:05:21.914,000 --> 0:05:23,000
because there's so many people that don't really recognize

113
0:05:24.13,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic

114
0:05:26.018,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter)

115
0:05:28.09,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we have some people who designed these things,

116
0:05:30.986,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this,

117
0:05:33.003,000 --> 0:05:34,000
help yourself."

118
0:05:34.98,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This is about sharing and investing in kindness.

119
0:05:37.849,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And for those people that don't want to do either

120
0:05:39.706,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of those things, maybe they can cook,

121
0:05:41.705,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street,

122
0:05:44.578,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or in the pub, or in the church,

123
0:05:46.811,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or wherever people are living their lives.

124
0:05:48.443,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This is about us going to the people and saying,

125
0:05:50.985,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"We are all part of the local food jigsaw,

126
0:05:53.394,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we are all part of a solution."

127
0:05:56.049,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists

128
0:05:58.265,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic,

129
0:06:00.973,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?

130
0:06:03.549,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So we invented, without asking, of course,

131
0:06:05.953,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the Incredible Edible Green Route.

132
0:06:08.059,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this is a route of exhibition gardens,

133
0:06:10.784,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story

134
0:06:15.495,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of pollinators, and it's a route that we designed

135
0:06:18.363,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that takes people through the whole of our town,

136
0:06:20.969,000 --> 0:06:23,000
past our cafes and our small shops, through our market,

137
0:06:24.188,000 --> 0:06:27,000
not just to and fro from the supermarket,

138
0:06:27.601,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall

139
0:06:29.899,000 --> 0:06:31,000
around our town, we're also changing their behavior.

140
0:06:32.754,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And then there's the second plate, the learning plate.

141
0:06:36.474,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, we're in partnership with a high school.

142
0:06:38.054,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We've created a company. We are designing and building

143
0:06:41.127,000 --> 0:06:43,000
an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare

144
0:06:43.175,000 --> 0:06:44,000
at the back of the high school, like you do,

145
0:06:45.082,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables

146
0:06:47.275,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in an orchard with bees,

147
0:06:49.824,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the kids are helping us build that,

148
0:06:52.082,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and the kids are on the board, and because the community

149
0:06:54.895,000 --> 0:06:55,000
was really keen on working with the high school,

150
0:06:56.427,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the high school is now teaching agriculture,

151
0:06:59.795,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think,

152
0:07:02.911,000 --> 0:07:04,000
how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification

153
0:07:05.694,000 --> 0:07:07,000
before in their lives but are really excited about growing,

154
0:07:08.245,000 --> 0:07:09,000
how can we give them some more experience?

155
0:07:09.949,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So we got some land that was donated

156
0:07:11.908,000 --> 0:07:12,000
by a local garden center.

157
0:07:13.166,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way,

158
0:07:16.5,000 --> 0:07:18,000
totally voluntary-led, we have turned that

159
0:07:19.11,000 --> 0:07:21,000
into a market garden training center,

160
0:07:21.307,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and that is polytunnels and raised beds

161
0:07:24.271,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers

162
0:07:26.975,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.

163
0:07:29.296,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And because we were doing that, some local academics said,

164
0:07:31.504,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"You know, we could help design

165
0:07:32.836,000 --> 0:07:33,000
a commercial horticulture course for you.

166
0:07:34.608,000 --> 0:07:35,000
There's not one that we know of."

167
0:07:36.003,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year,

168
0:07:38.647,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.

169
0:07:41.232,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And then there's the third plate,

170
0:07:42.851,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because if you walk through an edible landscape,

171
0:07:44.669,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get

172
0:07:47.264,000 --> 0:07:49,000
interested in what's growing seasonally,

173
0:07:49.312,000 --> 0:07:5,000
you might just want to spend more of your own money

174
0:07:51.224,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in support of local producers,

175
0:07:53.304,000 --> 0:07:54,000
not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer

176
0:07:55.056,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and whatever else it might be.

177
0:07:57.135,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But then, we're just a community group, you know.

178
0:07:59.872,000 --> 0:08:,000
We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?

179
0:08:01.83,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we did some really simple things.

180
0:08:03.58,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We fundraised, we got some blackboards,

181
0:08:05.367,000 --> 0:08:06,000
we put "Incredible Edible" on the top,

182
0:08:06.537,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we gave it every market trader that was selling locally,

183
0:08:08.713,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.

184
0:08:11.64,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Really popular. People congregated around it.

185
0:08:14.096,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Sales were up.

186
0:08:15.744,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said,

187
0:08:18.74,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"We're really serious about this,"

188
0:08:19.717,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought,

189
0:08:22.135,000 --> 0:08:24,000
okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create

190
0:08:24.76,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a campaign around one product and show them

191
0:08:27.334,000 --> 0:08:29,000
there is local loyalty to that product,

192
0:08:29.377,000 --> 0:08:31,000
maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.

193
0:08:31.72,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me --

194
0:08:34.711,000 --> 0:08:36,000
called Every Egg Matters. (Laughter)

195
0:08:36.784,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And what we did was we put people on our egg map.

196
0:08:40.405,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's a stylized map of Togmorden.

197
0:08:42.556,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Anybody that's selling their excess eggs

198
0:08:44.195,000 --> 0:08:46,000
at the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors,

199
0:08:46.733,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we've stuck on there. We started with four,

200
0:08:49.15,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was

201
0:08:51.424,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that people were then going into shops

202
0:08:52.924,000 --> 0:08:54,000
asking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that

203
0:08:55.605,000 --> 0:08:57,000
was, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got

204
0:08:57.894,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds,

205
0:09:00.003,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and although these are really, really small steps,

206
0:09:02.584,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that increasing local economic confidence

207
0:09:07.273,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is starting to play out in a number of ways,

208
0:09:09.85,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and we now have farmers doing cheese

209
0:09:11.152,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs,

210
0:09:12.941,000 --> 0:09:13,000
they're doing pasties and pies and things

211
0:09:14.349,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that they would have never done before.

212
0:09:16.722,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We've got increasing market stalls selling local food,

213
0:09:19.343,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent

214
0:09:23.557,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line

215
0:09:26.51,000 --> 0:09:28,000
had increased because of what we were actually doing.

216
0:09:28.916,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.

217
0:09:32.006,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

218
0:09:33.41,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now, none of this is rocket science.

219
0:09:35.82,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It certainly is not clever, and it's not original.

220
0:09:38.699,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.

221
0:09:42.506,000 --> 0:09:44,000
This is not a movement for those people

222
0:09:44.629,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that are going to sort themselves out anyway.

223
0:09:46.551,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This is a movement for everyone.

224
0:09:49.447,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We have a motto: If you eat, you're in. (Laughter)

225
0:09:53.313,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

226
0:09:59.402,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Across age, across income, across culture.

227
0:10:04.479,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's been really quite a roller coaster experience,

228
0:10:08.086,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but going back to that first question that we asked,

229
0:10:10.559,000 --> 0:10:13,000
is it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.

230
0:10:13.818,000 --> 0:10:15,000
More than 30 towns in England now are spinning

231
0:10:16.632,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the Incredible Edible plate.

232
0:10:18.76,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Whichever way they want to do it, of their own volition,

233
0:10:22.255,000 --> 0:10:24,000
they're trying to make their own lives differently,

234
0:10:24.949,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and worldwide, we've got communities across America

235
0:10:27.697,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and Japan -- it's incredible, isn't it? I mean,

236
0:10:29.441,000 --> 0:10:31,000
America and Japan and New Zealand.

237
0:10:31.956,000 --> 0:10:33,000
People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us

238
0:10:34.48,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness

239
0:10:37.531,000 --> 0:10:41,000
around local growing into the heart of Christchurch.

240
0:10:42.183,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And none of this takes more money

241
0:10:45.03,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and none of this demands a bureaucracy,

242
0:10:48.157,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but it does demand that you think things differently

243
0:10:51.02,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs

244
0:10:54.717,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in order to create that supportive framework

245
0:10:56.845,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that communities can bounce off.

246
0:10:59.559,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And there's some great ideas already in our patch.

247
0:11:02.475,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Our local authority has decided to make everywhere

248
0:11:05.259,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Incredible Edible, and in support of that

249
0:11:07.921,000 --> 0:11:08,000
have decided to do two things.

250
0:11:09.406,000 --> 0:11:12,000
First, they're going to create an asset register of spare land

251
0:11:12.515,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities

252
0:11:14.746,000 --> 0:11:15,000
can use that wherever they live,

253
0:11:16.482,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they're going to underpin that with a license.

254
0:11:18.659,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And then they've said to every single one of their workforce,

255
0:11:21.04,000 --> 0:11:23,000
if you can, help those communities grow,

256
0:11:23.537,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and help them to maintain their spaces.

257
0:11:25.65,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Suddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground

258
0:11:27.689,000 --> 0:11:29,000
from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.

259
0:11:29.969,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded

260
0:11:34.394,000 --> 0:11:36,000
of us, and there's lots more you could do.

261
0:11:36.573,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting

262
0:11:38.933,000 --> 0:11:41,000
prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.

263
0:11:42.301,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Laughter) Secondly, please create -- please, please create

264
0:11:45.703,000 --> 0:11:47,000
edible landscapes so that our children start to walk

265
0:11:48.482,000 --> 0:11:5,000
past their food day in, day out, on our high streets,

266
0:11:50.665,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in our parks, wherever that might be.

267
0:11:53.251,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart

268
0:11:56.945,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of the town and the city plan, not relegate them

269
0:12:00.208,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.

270
0:12:03.528,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Encourage all our schools to take this seriously.

271
0:12:06.345,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This isn't a second class exercise.

272
0:12:08.578,000 --> 0:12:1,000
If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow,

273
0:12:11.546,000 --> 0:12:14,000
then please let us say to every school,

274
0:12:14.595,000 --> 0:12:17,000
create a sense of purpose around the importance

275
0:12:18.575,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to the environment, local food and soils.

276
0:12:21.375,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Put that at the heart of your school culture,

277
0:12:23.262,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and you will create a different generation.

278
0:12:26.424,000 --> 0:12:28,000
There are so many things you can do, but ultimately

279
0:12:28.863,000 --> 0:12:3,000
this is about something really simple.

280
0:12:31.151,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Through an organic process, through

281
0:12:34.776,000 --> 0:12:38,000
an increasing recognition of the power of small actions,

282
0:12:39.063,000 --> 0:12:42,000
we are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again,

283
0:12:42.888,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us,

284
0:12:46.729,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to build a different and a kinder future,

285
0:12:51.122,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and in my book, that's incredible.

286
0:12:53.545,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Thank you. (Applause)

287
0:12:57.41,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Applause)

288
0:13:07.902,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

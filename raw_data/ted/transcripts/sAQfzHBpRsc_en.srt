1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Back in New York, I am the head of development

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
for a non-profit called Robin Hood.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Now in our town,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
you have to get to the fire scene pretty early

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to get in on any action.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I remember my first fire.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I was the second volunteer on the scene,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to get to the captain in charge

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to find out what our assignments would be.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When I found the captain,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
he was having a very engaging conversation

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with the homeowner,

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Here it was, the middle of the night,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
she was standing outside in the pouring rain,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
while her house was in flames.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
let's call him Lex Luther --

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
got to the captain first

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and was asked to go inside

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and save the homeowner's dog.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Here was some lawyer or money manager

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that he went into a burning building

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to save a living creature,

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
just because he beat me by five seconds.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Well, I was next.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The captain waved me over.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I swear.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So, not exactly what I was hoping for,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
but off I went --

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now I know what you're thinking,

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but I'm no hero.

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I carried my payload back downstairs

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
where I met my nemesis

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the precious dog by the front door.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where, not surprisingly,

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
his received much more attention than did mine.

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A few weeks later,

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the department received a letter from the homeowner

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
thanking us for the valiant effort displayed

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in saving her home.

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The act of kindness she noted above all others:

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
In both my vocation at Robin Hood

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
on a monumental scale,

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
on an individual basis.

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And you know what I've learned?

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They all matter.

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So as I look around this room

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
at people who either have achieved,

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
or are on their way to achieving,

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
remarkable levels of success,

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I would offer this reminder:

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
don't wait.

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Don't wait until you make your first million

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to make a difference in somebody's life.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If you have something to give,

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
give it now.

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park.

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Be a mentor.

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Not every day is going to offer us a chance

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to save somebody's life,

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So get in the game. Save the shoes.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Thank you.

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Applause)

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Mark Bezos: Thank you.

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like to introduce you to a tiny microorganism

2
0:00:16.88,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that you've probably never heard of:

3
0:00:18.64,000 --> 0:00:19,000
its name is Prochlorococcus,

4
0:00:20.64,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and it's really an amazing little being.

5
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
For one thing, its ancestors

6
0:00:26.6,000 --> 0:00:29,000
changed the earth in ways that made it possible for us to evolve,

7
0:00:30.44,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and hidden in its genetic code

8
0:00:32.52,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is a blueprint

9
0:00:34.32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that may inspire ways to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel.

10
0:00:40.48,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But the most amazing thing

11
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is that there are three billion billion billion

12
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of these tiny cells on the planet,

13
0:00:46.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and we didn't know they existed until 35 years ago.

14
0:00:51.28,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So to tell you their story,

15
0:00:52.76,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I need to first take you way back,

16
0:00:55.8,000 --> 0:00:58,000
four billion years ago, when the earth might have looked something like this.

17
0:01:00.48,000 --> 0:01:01,000
There was no life on the planet,

18
0:01:02.36,000 --> 0:01:04,000
there was no oxygen in the atmosphere.

19
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So what happened to change that planet into the one we enjoy today,

20
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
teeming with life,

21
0:01:12.84,000 --> 0:01:13,000
teeming with plants and animals?

22
0:01:15.48,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Well, in a word, photosynthesis.

23
0:01:19.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
About two and a half billion years ago,

24
0:01:21.2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
some of these ancient ancestors of Prochlorococcus evolved

25
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so that they could use solar energy

26
0:01:27.52,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and absorb it

27
0:01:28.84,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and split water into its component parts of oxygen and hydrogen.

28
0:01:33.88,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And they used the chemical energy produced

29
0:01:36.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to draw CO2, carbon dioxide, out of the atmosphere

30
0:01:40.24,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and use it to build sugars and proteins and amino acids,

31
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:46,000
all the things that life is made of.

32
0:01:47.56,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And as they evolved and grew more and more

33
0:01:50.68,000 --> 0:01:52,000
over millions and millions of years,

34
0:01:52.76,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere.

35
0:01:57.48,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Until about 500 million years ago,

36
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
there was enough in the atmosphere that larger organisms could evolve.

37
0:02:03.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
There was an explosion of life-forms,

38
0:02:05.68,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and, ultimately, we appeared on the scene.

39
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:1,000
While that was going on,

40
0:02:11.44,000 --> 0:02:14,000
some of those ancient photosynthesizers died

41
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and were compressed and buried,

42
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and became fossil fuel

43
0:02:19.28,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with sunlight buried in their carbon bonds.

44
0:02:23.44,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They're basically buried sunlight in the form of coal and oil.

45
0:02:29.08,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Today's photosynthesizers,

46
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:35,000
their engines are descended from those ancient microbes,

47
0:02:36.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and they feed basically all of life on earth.

48
0:02:40.44,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Your heart is beating using the solar energy

49
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that some plant processed for you,

50
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and the stuff your body is made out of

51
0:02:48.48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
is made out of CO2

52
0:02:50.12,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that some plant processed for you.

53
0:02:53.48,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Basically, we're all made out of sunlight and carbon dioxide.

54
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:,000
Fundamentally, we're just hot air.

55
0:03:00.72,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:04.56,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So as terrestrial beings,

57
0:03:06.28,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we're very familiar with the plants on land:

58
0:03:09.36,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the trees, the grasses, the pastures, the crops.

59
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But the oceans are filled with billions of tons of animals.

60
0:03:17.84,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Do you ever wonder what's feeding them?

61
0:03:21.4,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Well there's an invisible pasture

62
0:03:23.8,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of microscopic photosynthesizers called phytoplankton

63
0:03:27.6,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that fill the upper 200 meters of the ocean,

64
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and they feed the entire open ocean ecosystem.

65
0:03:35.44,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Some of the animals live among them and eat them,

66
0:03:37.88,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and others swim up to feed on them at night,

67
0:03:40.44,000 --> 0:03:43,000
while others sit in the deep and wait for them to die and settle down

68
0:03:44.44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and then they chow down on them.

69
0:03:47.32,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So these tiny phytoplankton,

70
0:03:50.44,000 --> 0:03:54,000
collectively, weigh less than one percent of all the plants on land,

71
0:03:54.6,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but annually they photosynthesize as much as all of the plants on land,

72
0:03:58.92,000 --> 0:04:,000
including the Amazon rainforest

73
0:04:01.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that we consider the lungs of the planet.

74
0:04:04.28,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Every year, they fix 50 billion tons of carbon

75
0:04:08.28,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in the form of carbon dioxide into their bodies

76
0:04:11.56,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that feeds the ocean ecosystem.

77
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
How does this tiny amount of biomass

78
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:19,000
produce as much as all the plants on land?

79
0:04:19.8,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Well, they don't have trunks and stems

80
0:04:22.36,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and flowers and fruits and all that to maintain.

81
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:27,000
All they have to do is grow and divide and grow and divide.

82
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They're really lean little photosynthesis machines.

83
0:04:33.519,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They really crank.

84
0:04:39.4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So there are thousands of different species of phytoplankton,

85
0:04:43.32,000 --> 0:04:45,000
come in all different shapes and sizes,

86
0:04:45.52,000 --> 0:04:48,000
all roughly less than the width of a human hair.

87
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Here, I'm showing you some of the more beautiful ones,

88
0:04:52.4,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the textbook versions.

89
0:04:54.64,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I call them the charismatic species of phytoplankton.

90
0:05:00.12,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And here is Prochlorococcus.

91
0:05:04.12,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I know,

92
0:05:05.68,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it just looks like a bunch of schmutz on a microscope slide.

93
0:05:08.64,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

94
0:05:10.24,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But they're in there,

95
0:05:12.08,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I'm going to reveal them to you in a minute.

96
0:05:15.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But first I want to tell you how they were discovered.

97
0:05:20.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
About 38 years ago,

98
0:05:22.24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we were playing around with a technology in my lab called flow cytometry

99
0:05:27.04,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that was developed for biomedical research for studying cells like cancer cells,

100
0:05:33.08,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but it turns out we were using it for this off-label purpose

101
0:05:36.4,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which was to study phytoplankton, and it was beautifully suited to do that.

102
0:05:41.48,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And here's how it works:

103
0:05:43.28,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so you inject a sample in this tiny little capillary tube,

104
0:05:47.84,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the cells go single file by a laser,

105
0:05:51.36,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and as they do, they scatter light according to their size

106
0:05:55.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and they emit light according to whatever pigments they might have,

107
0:05:59.12,000 --> 0:06:01,000
whether they're natural or whether you stain them.

108
0:06:01.76,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And the chlorophyl of phytoplankton,

109
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which is green,

110
0:06:06.52,000 --> 0:06:09,000
emits red light when you shine blue light on it.

111
0:06:10.28,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And so we used this instrument for several years

112
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to study our phytoplankton cultures,

113
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:18,000
species like those charismatic ones that I showed you,

114
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
just studying their basic cell biology.

115
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But all that time, we thought, well wouldn't it be really cool

116
0:06:25.12,000 --> 0:06:27,000
if we could take an instrument like this out on a ship

117
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and just squirt seawater through it

118
0:06:29.68,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and see what all those diversity of phytoplankton would look like.

119
0:06:34.44,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So I managed to get my hands

120
0:06:36.56,000 --> 0:06:39,000
on what we call a big rig in flow cytometry,

121
0:06:39.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a large, powerful laser

122
0:06:43.24,000 --> 0:06:45,000
with a money-back guarantee from the company

123
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that if it didn't work on a ship, they would take it back.

124
0:06:48.96,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And so a young scientist that I was working with at the time,

125
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Rob Olson, was able to take this thing apart,

126
0:06:54.6,000 --> 0:06:57,000
put it on a ship, put it back together and take it off to sea.

127
0:06:58.48,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And it worked like a charm.

128
0:06:59.84,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We didn't think it would, because we thought the ship's vibrations

129
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
would get in the way of the focusing of the laser,

130
0:07:05.4,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but it really worked like a charm.

131
0:07:07.08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And so we mapped the phytoplankton distributions across the ocean.

132
0:07:10.6,000 --> 0:07:13,000
For the first time, you could look at them one cell at a time in real time

133
0:07:14.24,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and see what was going on -- that was very exciting.

134
0:07:17.08,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But one day, Rob noticed some faint signals

135
0:07:20.12,000 --> 0:07:21,000
coming out of the instrument

136
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that we dismissed as electronic noise

137
0:07:25.36,000 --> 0:07:27,000
for probably a year

138
0:07:27.68,000 --> 0:07:3,000
before we realized that it wasn't really behaving like noise.

139
0:07:31.04,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It had some regular patterns to it.

140
0:07:34.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
To make a long story short,

141
0:07:36.64,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it was tiny, tiny little cells,

142
0:07:39.2,000 --> 0:07:42,000
less than one-one hundredth the width of a human hair

143
0:07:42.6,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that contain chlorophyl.

144
0:07:44.44,000 --> 0:07:45,000
That was Prochlorococcus.

145
0:07:47.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So remember this slide that I showed you?

146
0:07:50.68,000 --> 0:07:52,000
If you shine blue light on that same sample,

147
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
this is what you see:

148
0:07:55.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
two tiny little red light-emitting cells.

149
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Those are Prochlorococcus.

150
0:08:02.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They are the smallest and most abundant photosynthetic cell on the planet.

151
0:08:09.071,000 --> 0:08:1,000
At first, we didn't know what they were,

152
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,000
so we called the "little greens."

153
0:08:12.8,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It was a very affectionate name for them.

154
0:08:14.8,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Ultimately, we knew enough about them to give them the name Prochlorococcus,

155
0:08:18.44,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which means "primitive green berry."

156
0:08:20.68,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And it was about that time

157
0:08:23.48,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that I became so smitten by these little cells

158
0:08:26.28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that I redirected my entire lab to study them and nothing else,

159
0:08:31.76,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and my loyalty to them has really paid off.

160
0:08:34.8,000 --> 0:08:37,000
They've given me a tremendous amount, including bringing me here.

161
0:08:39.88,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Applause)

162
0:08:45.799,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So over the years, we and others, many others,

163
0:08:48.799,000 --> 0:08:51,000
have studied Prochlorococcus across the oceans

164
0:08:52.2,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and found that they're very abundant over wide, wide ranges

165
0:08:56.8,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in the open ocean ecosystem.

166
0:08:59.68,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They're particularly abundant in what are called the open ocean gyres.

167
0:09:03.8,000 --> 0:09:06,000
These are sometimes referred to as the deserts of the oceans,

168
0:09:07.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but they're not deserts at all.

169
0:09:09.6,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Their deep blue water is teeming

170
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
with a hundred million Prochlorococcus cells per liter.

171
0:09:16.36,000 --> 0:09:18,000
If you crowd them together like we do in our cultures,

172
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you can see their beautiful green chlorophyl.

173
0:09:22.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
One of those test tubes has a billion Prochlorococcus in it,

174
0:09:27.2,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and as I told you earlier,

175
0:09:28.68,000 --> 0:09:31,000
there are three billion billion billion of them on the planet.

176
0:09:31.88,000 --> 0:09:33,000
That's three octillion,

177
0:09:34.12,000 --> 0:09:35,000
if you care to convert.

178
0:09:36.48,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:38.2,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And collectively, they weigh more than the human population

180
0:09:42.12,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and they photosynthesize as much as all of the crops on land.

181
0:09:47.08,000 --> 0:09:5,000
They're incredibly important in the global ocean.

182
0:09:51.12,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So over the years, as we were studying them

183
0:09:53.64,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and found how abundant they were,

184
0:09:55.84,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we thought, hmm, this is really strange.

185
0:09:57.8,000 --> 0:10:,000
How can a single species be so abundant across so many different habitats?

186
0:10:02.64,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And as we isolated more into culture,

187
0:10:04.68,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we learned that they are different ecotypes.

188
0:10:06.84,000 --> 0:10:08,000
There are some that are adapted to the high-light intensities

189
0:10:09.76,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in the surface water,

190
0:10:11.04,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and there are some that are adapted to the low light in the deep ocean.

191
0:10:14.64,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In fact, those cells that live in the bottom of the sunlit zone

192
0:10:18.24,000 --> 0:10:22,000
are the most efficient photosynthesizers of any known cell.

193
0:10:23.04,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And then we learned that there are some strains

194
0:10:25.4,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that grow optimally along the equator,

195
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:29,000
where there are higher temperatures,

196
0:10:30.6,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and some that do better at the cooler temperatures

197
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
as you go north and south.

198
0:10:34.28,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So as we studied these more and more and kept finding more and more diversity,

199
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we thought, oh my God, how diverse are these things?

200
0:10:41.04,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And about that time, it became possible to sequence their genomes

201
0:10:44.32,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and really look under the hood and look at their genetic makeup.

202
0:10:49.28,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And we've been able to sequence the genomes of cultures that we have,

203
0:10:53.72,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but also recently, using flow cytometry,

204
0:10:56.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
we can isolate individual cells from the wild

205
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and sequence their individual genomes,

206
0:11:01.2,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and now we've sequenced hundreds of Prochlorococcus.

207
0:11:04.84,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And although each cell has roughly 2,000 genes --

208
0:11:08.8,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that's one tenth the size of the human genome --

209
0:11:12.4,000 --> 0:11:13,000
as you sequence more and more,

210
0:11:13.88,000 --> 0:11:17,000
you find that they only have a thousand of those in common

211
0:11:18.6,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and the other thousand for each individual strain

212
0:11:21.72,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is drawn from an enormous gene pool,

213
0:11:24.32,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and it reflects the particular environment that the cell might have thrived in,

214
0:11:30.96,000 --> 0:11:32,000
not just high or low light or high or low temperature,

215
0:11:33.96,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but whether there are nutrients that limit them

216
0:11:36.76,000 --> 0:11:38,000
like nitrogen, phosphorus or iron.

217
0:11:39.24,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It reflects the habitat that they come from.

218
0:11:42.4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Think of it this way.

219
0:11:45.04,000 --> 0:11:48,000
If each cell is a smartphone

220
0:11:48.32,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and the apps are the genes,

221
0:11:51.08,000 --> 0:11:54,000
when you get your smartphone, it comes with these built-in apps.

222
0:11:54.56,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Those are the ones that you can't delete if you're an iPhone person.

223
0:11:57.8,000 --> 0:12:,000
You press on them and they don't jiggle and they don't have x's.

224
0:12:00.88,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Even if you don't want them, you can't get rid of them.

225
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

226
0:12:06.12,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Those are like the core genes of Prochlorococcus.

227
0:12:09.28,000 --> 0:12:11,000
They're the essence of the phone.

228
0:12:11.36,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But you have a huge pool of apps to draw upon

229
0:12:16.36,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to make your phone custom-designed for your particular lifestyle and habitat.

230
0:12:22.12,000 --> 0:12:25,000
If you travel a lot, you'll have a lot of travel apps,

231
0:12:25.96,000 --> 0:12:29,000
if you're into financial things, you might have a lot of financial apps,

232
0:12:30.8,000 --> 0:12:31,000
or if you're like me,

233
0:12:32.36,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you probably have a lot of weather apps,

234
0:12:34.32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
hoping one of them will tell you what you want to hear.

235
0:12:36.96,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Laughter)

236
0:12:38.32,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And I've learned the last couple days in Vancouver

237
0:12:40.72,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that you don't need a weather app -- you just need an umbrella.

238
0:12:43.72,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So --

239
0:12:44.96,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

240
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause)

241
0:12:49.88,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So just as your smartphone tells us something about how you live your life,

242
0:12:55.84,000 --> 0:12:56,000
your lifestyle,

243
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
reading the genome of a Prochlorococcus cell

244
0:12:59.8,000 --> 0:13:03,000
tells us what the pressures are in its environment.

245
0:13:04.68,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It's like reading its diary,

246
0:13:06.68,000 --> 0:13:09,000
not only telling us how it got through its day or its week,

247
0:13:10.48,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but even its evolutionary history.

248
0:13:14.2,000 --> 0:13:17,000
As we studied -- I said we've sequenced hundreds of these cells,

249
0:13:17.44,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and we can now project

250
0:13:19.32,000 --> 0:13:23,000
what is the total genetic size --

251
0:13:23.48,000 --> 0:13:24,000
gene pool --

252
0:13:24.72,000 --> 0:13:27,000
of the Prochlorococcus federation, as we call it.

253
0:13:28.24,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's like a superorganism.

254
0:13:29.92,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And it turns out that projections are

255
0:13:32.56,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that the collective has 80,000 genes.

256
0:13:35.6,000 --> 0:13:37,000
That's four times the size of the human genome.

257
0:13:38.56,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And it's that diversity of gene pools

258
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that makes it possible for them

259
0:13:45.04,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to dominate these large regions of the oceans

260
0:13:47.32,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and maintain their stability

261
0:13:49.08,000 --> 0:13:5,000
year in and year out.

262
0:13:52.68,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So when I daydream about Prochlorococcus,

263
0:13:55.88,000 --> 0:13:57,000
which I probably do more than is healthy --

264
0:13:58.36,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

265
0:14:00.08,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I imagine them floating out there,

266
0:14:03.48,000 --> 0:14:04,000
doing their job,

267
0:14:04.8,000 --> 0:14:05,000
maintaining the planet,

268
0:14:06.36,000 --> 0:14:09,000
feeding the animals.

269
0:14:09.56,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But also I inevitably end up

270
0:14:11.76,000 --> 0:14:14,000
thinking about what a masterpiece they are,

271
0:14:15.2,000 --> 0:14:18,000
finely tuned by millions of years of evolution.

272
0:14:19.12,000 --> 0:14:21,000
With 2,000 genes,

273
0:14:21.96,000 --> 0:14:23,000
they can do what all of our human ingenuity

274
0:14:24.44,000 --> 0:14:26,000
has not figured out how to do yet.

275
0:14:26.72,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They can take solar energy, CO2

276
0:14:29.72,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and turn it into chemical energy in the form of organic carbon,

277
0:14:33.24,000 --> 0:14:36,000
locking that sunlight in those carbon bonds.

278
0:14:37.76,000 --> 0:14:4,000
If we could figure out exactly how they do this,

279
0:14:41.32,000 --> 0:14:44,000
it could inspire designs

280
0:14:44.36,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that could reduce our dependency on fossil fuels,

281
0:14:47.32,000 --> 0:14:49,000
which brings my story full circle.

282
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
The fossil fuels that are buried that we're burning

283
0:14:54.08,000 --> 0:14:58,000
took millions of years for the earth to bury those,

284
0:14:58.92,000 --> 0:15:01,000
including those ancestors of Prochlorococcus,

285
0:15:01.96,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and we're burning that now in the blink of an eye

286
0:15:04.88,000 --> 0:15:05,000
on geological timescales.

287
0:15:06.84,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere.

288
0:15:09.76,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's a greenhouse gas.

289
0:15:11.36,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The oceans are starting to warm.

290
0:15:13.48,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So the question is, what is that going to do

291
0:15:16.24,000 --> 0:15:18,000
for my Prochlorococcus?

292
0:15:18.76,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And I'm sure you're expecting me to say that my beloved microbes are doomed,

293
0:15:23.72,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but in fact they're not.

294
0:15:25.96,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Projections are that their populations will expand as the ocean warms

295
0:15:31.64,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to 30 percent larger by the year 2100.

296
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Does that make me happy?

297
0:15:38.32,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Well, it makes me happy for Prochlorococcus of course --

298
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Laughter)

299
0:15:43.32,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but not for the planet.

300
0:15:46.48,000 --> 0:15:47,000
There are winners and losers

301
0:15:47.88,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in this global experiment that we've undertaken,

302
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and it's projected that among the losers

303
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
will be some of those larger phytoplankton,

304
0:15:56.24,000 --> 0:15:57,000
those charismatic ones

305
0:15:57.56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
which are expected to be reduced in numbers,

306
0:16:00.4,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and they're the ones that feed the zooplankton that feed the fish

307
0:16:03.92,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that we like to harvest.

308
0:16:08.6,000 --> 0:16:12,000
So Prochlorococcus has been my muse for the past 35 years,

309
0:16:13.08,000 --> 0:16:15,000
but there are legions of other microbes out there

310
0:16:15.48,000 --> 0:16:17,000
maintaining our planet for us.

311
0:16:18.36,000 --> 0:16:2,000
They're out there

312
0:16:20.44,000 --> 0:16:24,000
ready and waiting for us to find them so they can tell their stories, too.

313
0:16:24.72,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Thank you.

314
0:16:25.96,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

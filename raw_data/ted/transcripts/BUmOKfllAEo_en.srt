1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Welcome. If I could have the first slide, please?

2
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Contrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly,

3
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
dolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb

4
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
up the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have,

5
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is to try to allow each of you to experience

6
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the thrill of revealing nature's design.

7
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.

8
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.

9
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The challenge of looking at nature's designs --

10
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.

11
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The challenge, of course, is to answer this question:

12
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
what permits this extraordinary performance of animals

13
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that allows them basically to go anywhere?

14
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And if we could figure that out, how can we implement those designs?

15
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Well, many biologists will tell engineers, and others,

16
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
organisms have millions of years to get it right;

17
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well.

18
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.

19
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We know from working on animals that the truth is

20
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that's exactly what you don't want to do -- because evolution works

21
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
on the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.

22
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it,

23
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.

24
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you

25
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that you had to build an automobile, but it had to start off to be this big,

26
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way.

27
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also -- inside it --

28
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile.

29
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

30
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history

31
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.

32
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So, organisms have this important history.

33
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer.

34
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And this is really important when you begin to look at animals.

35
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Instead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.

36
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You need to discover the general principles of nature,

37
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and then use these analogies when they're advantageous.

38
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is a real challenge to do this, because animals,

39
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when you start to really look inside them -- how they work --

40
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history

41
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of the design plans, you can't go look it up anywhere.

42
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They have way too many motions for their joints, too many muscles.

43
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Even the simplest animal we think of, something like an insect,

44
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine.

45
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
How can you make sense of this? Well, we believed --

46
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply,

47
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is if the control of their movements

48
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
tended to be built into their bodies themselves.

49
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
What we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals

50
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
all produce the same forces on the ground when they move.

51
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.

52
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system

53
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick.

54
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true?

55
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Well, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog,

56
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect,

57
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or four legs as one of a trotting crab.

58
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And then they alternate in their propulsion,

59
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way

60
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
-- you'll see next week, I'll give you a hint,

61
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things

62
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
like T. rex probably couldn't do this, but you'll see that next week.

63
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, what's interesting is the animals, then -- we said -- bounce along

64
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the vertical plane this way, and in our collaborations with Pixar,

65
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in "A Bug's Life," we discussed the

66
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
bipedal nature of the characters of the ants.

67
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.

68
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And they asked us this question. They say, "Why model

69
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane,

70
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
when you're telling us these animals are moving

71
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in the horizontal plane?" This is a good question.

72
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way.

73
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving

74
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs,

75
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we collapsed them down as one.

76
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We got some of the best mathematicians in the world

77
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from Princeton to work on this problem.

78
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And we were able to create a model

79
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where animals are not only bouncing up and down,

80
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.

81
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.

82
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, why is this important to have this model?

83
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Because it's very interesting. When you take this model

84
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and you perturb it, you give it a push,

85
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain

86
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
or no reflexes, just by the structure alone.

87
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics.

88
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
That's enough!

90
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The animals, when you look at them running,

92
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
appear to be self-stabilizing like this,

93
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
using basically springy legs. That is, the legs can do

94
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
computations on their own; the control algorithms, in a sense,

95
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are embedded in the form of the animal itself.

96
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries?

97
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Well, I would argue that human technologies are really different from

98
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
natural technologies, at least they have been so far.

99
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Think about the typical kind of robot that you see.

100
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Human technologies have tended to be large, flat,

101
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
with right angles, stiff, made of metal. They have rolling devices

102
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and axles. There are very few motors, very few sensors.

103
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Whereas nature tends to be small, and curved,

104
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and it bends and twists, and has legs instead, and appendages,

105
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and has many muscles and many, many sensors.

106
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So it's a very different design. However, what's changing,

107
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
what's really exciting -- and I'll show you some of that next --

108
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics

109
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of nature, then nature really can become a much more useful teacher.

110
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And here's one example that's really exciting.

111
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This is a collaboration we have with Stanford.

112
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing.

113
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape

114
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that they like, and put in the material properties.

115
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.

116
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
For example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff,

117
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.

118
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It just bends by itself beautifully.

119
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So, you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off

120
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl.

121
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Our work has also inspired another robot, a biologically inspired bouncing robot,

122
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
from the University of Michigan and McGill

123
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
named RHex, for robot hexapod, and this one's autonomous.

124
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Let's go to the video, and let me show you some of these animals moving

125
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and then some of the simple robots

126
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that have been inspired by our discoveries.

127
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Here's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside,

128
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
not on a treadmill.

129
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Here's what we do.

130
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

131
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach

132
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
you think you don't have in your kitchen.

133
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede.

134
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks --

135
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that

136
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in this ghost crab, from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina.

137
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It goes up to four meters per second when it runs.

138
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases

139
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
when it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.

140
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human

141
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
like Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo,

142
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.

143
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now, what good are springy legs then? What can they do?

144
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals

145
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to have greater stability and maneuverability.

146
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height

147
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of the animals that we're looking at.

148
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.

149
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!

150
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.

151
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us

152
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs,

153
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built.

154
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford

155
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Shape Deposition Manufactured robot, named Sprawl.

156
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It has six legs -- there are the tuned, springy legs.

157
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It moves in a gait that an insect uses, and here it is

158
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
going on the treadmill. Now, what's important about this robot,

159
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
compared to other robots, is that it can't see anything,

160
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
it can't feel anything, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can maneuver

161
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever.

162
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's this technique of building the properties into the form.

163
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project --

164
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
very robust, if a graduate student

165
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
does that to his thesis project.

166
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

167
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex,

168
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
making its first outing in a demo.

169
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Laughter)

170
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Same principle: it only has six moving parts,

171
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
six motors, but it has springy, tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect.

172
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front,

173
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod,

174
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal.

175
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

176
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Voice: Oh my God.)

177
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Applause)

178
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Robert Full: It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand --

179
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
although we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.

180
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Here's RHex entering the woods.

181
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

182
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything,

183
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system,

184
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.

185
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Voice: Ah, I love him, Bob.) RF: Here's it going down a pathway.

186
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA, and they said

187
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice,

188
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and life, ultimately, on Mars. And he said --

189
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
especially with legged-robots, because they're way too complicated.

190
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video

191
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them

192
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we should go to Mars in 2011, I tinted the video orange

193
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
just to give them the sense of being on Mars.

194
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Laughter)

195
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Applause)

196
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance,

197
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and can go anywhere, is because they have an effective interaction

198
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you,

199
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that we studied to look at this, is the gecko.

200
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on.

201
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video.

202
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
One of the animals is going to be running on the level,

203
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which?

204
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left

205
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is running up the wall?

206
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Applause)

207
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell, isn't it? It's incredible,

208
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell.

209
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second,

210
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this?

211
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.

212
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
How do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes

213
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out,

214
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and then peel off the surface, like tape.

215
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Like if we had a piece of tape now, we'd peel it this way.

216
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
They do this with their toes. It's bizarre! This peeling inspired

217
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
iRobot -- that we work with -- to build Mecho-Geckos.

218
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Here's a legged version and a tractor version, or a bulldozer version.

219
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Let's see some of the geckos move with some video,

220
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.

221
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes,

222
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
in real time. There it goes again. Obviously, we have to slow this down a little bit.

223
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
You can't use regular cameras.

224
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
You have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this.

225
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.

226
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.

227
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Do you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out --

228
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.

229
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley,

230
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley

231
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill.

232
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

233
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
It's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt,

234
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
so we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them

235
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
through the treadmill belt, to see how they move.

236
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Here's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface.

237
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Pick a foot and try to watch a toe, and see if you can see what the animal's doing.

238
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
See it uncurl and then peel these toes.

239
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It can do this in 14 milliseconds. It's unbelievable.

240
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Here are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.

241
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
First we'll see the animals toes peeling -- look at that.

242
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.

243
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
It uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it.

244
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho-Gecko --

245
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface,

246
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
transition to a wall, and then go onto a ceiling.

247
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
There's the bulldozer version. Now, it doesn't use pressure-sensitive glue.

248
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
The animal does not use that.

249
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But that's what we're limited to, at the moment.

250
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
What does the animal do? The animal has weird toes.

251
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there,

252
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see

253
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that's there's little striations in these leaves.

254
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And if you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug.

255
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times,

256
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
you see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully,

257
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times,

258
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
you'll see each hair has split ends.

259
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end.

260
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae,

261
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends,

262
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to get very close to the surface. In fact, there's the diameter of your hair --

263
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
a gecko has two million of these, and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends.

264
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Think of the contact of that that's possible.

265
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
We were fortunate to work with another group

266
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor,

267
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair.

268
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Here's an individual hair with a little split end there.

269
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
When we measured the forces, they were enormous.

270
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size --

271
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child,

272
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
about 40 pounds, easily. Now, how do they do it?

273
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction?

274
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
No, force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics?

275
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
No, you can change the charge -- they still hold on.

276
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Do they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing.

277
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
No, you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces -- they don't do it.

278
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
How about suction? They stick on in a vacuum.

279
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
How about wet adhesion? Or capillary adhesion?

280
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
They don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine.

281
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
If you put their foot under water, they grab on.

282
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
How do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on

283
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
by intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces.

284
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
You know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry,

285
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
where you had these two atoms, they're close together,

286
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient

287
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:14,000
to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times

288
0:18:14.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
with these small structures.

289
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
What we're doing is, we're taking that inspiration of the hairs,

290
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and with another colleague at Berkeley, we're manufacturing them.

291
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe

292
0:18:30.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
we're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning,

293
0:18:35.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this.

294
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
(Laughter)

295
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
We also presented to Nike even.

296
0:18:45.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
(Laughter)

297
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
(Applause)

298
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this

299
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
that we realized that that small-size scale --

300
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore --

301
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
we needed to look at ants and their feet, because

302
0:19:06.33,000 --> 0:19:11,000
one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone

303
0:19:11.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well.

304
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:17,000
But the ants do, and we'll figure out why, so that ultimately

305
0:19:17.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
we'll make this move. And imagine: you're going to be able

306
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around.

307
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Where's this going? I think you can see it already.

308
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Clearly, the Internet is already having eyes and ears,

309
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands.

310
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
You're going to be able to do programmable

311
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:42,000
work through these kinds of robots, so that you can run,

312
0:19:42.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish.

313
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:53,000
So, in conclusion, I think the message is clear.

314
0:19:53.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
If you need a message, if nature's not enough, if you care about

315
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
search and rescue, or mine clearance, or medicine,

316
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:03,000
or the various things we're working on, we must preserve

317
0:20:03.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

318
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Thank you.

319
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:17,000
(Applause)

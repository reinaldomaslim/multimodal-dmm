2
0:00:16.685,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother

3
0:00:22.251,000 --> 0:00:24,000
who died in her exile:

4
0:00:24.651,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him.

5
0:00:29.516,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But don't you ever turn

6
0:00:32.723,000 --> 0:00:38,000
into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary."

7
0:00:38.846,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Almost two years have passed

8
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
since the Libyan Revolution broke out,

9
0:00:43.816,000 --> 0:00:47,000
inspired by the waves of mass mobilization

10
0:00:48.566,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.

11
0:00:53.366,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya

12
0:00:58.466,000 --> 0:01:,000
to call for a day of rage

13
0:01:00.666,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.

14
0:01:07.15,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And there it was, a great revolution.

15
0:01:11.183,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront

16
0:01:14.883,000 --> 0:01:17,000
calling for the fall of the regime,

17
0:01:18.067,000 --> 0:01:23,000
raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.

18
0:01:23.283,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They have shown an exemplary bravery

19
0:01:26.323,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.

20
0:01:30.39,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They have shown a great sense of solidarity

21
0:01:33.905,000 --> 0:01:36,000
from the far east to the far west to the south.

22
0:01:37.389,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war

23
0:01:43.305,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,

24
0:01:48.773,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.

25
0:01:54.156,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Applause)

26
0:02:00.405,000 --> 0:02:04,000
However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,

27
0:02:04.839,000 --> 0:02:11,000
a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.

28
0:02:12.174,000 --> 0:02:16,000
For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime

29
0:02:16.475,000 --> 0:02:24,000
destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.

30
0:02:24.924,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Aware of the devastation and the challenges,

31
0:02:28.624,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,

32
0:02:35.407,000 --> 0:02:38,000
calling for an inclusive and just transition

33
0:02:38.899,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to democracy and national reconciliation.

34
0:02:41.966,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi

35
0:02:45.783,000 --> 0:02:47,000
during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi --

36
0:02:48.682,000 --> 0:02:5,000
almost 300 in Tripoli.

37
0:02:51.583,000 --> 0:02:56,000
After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,

38
0:02:57.533,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and with unique enthusiasm,

39
0:02:59.75,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I started organizing workshops

40
0:03:02.232,000 --> 0:03:06,000
on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.

41
0:03:07.064,000 --> 0:03:09,000
With an amazing group of women,

42
0:03:09.599,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,

43
0:03:13.381,000 --> 0:03:17,000
a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,

44
0:03:18.249,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women

45
0:03:22.85,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and to lobby for our right

46
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:3,000
for equal participation in building democracy and peace.

47
0:03:30.117,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,

48
0:03:35.833,000 --> 0:03:38,000
an environment which was increasingly polarized,

49
0:03:39.817,000 --> 0:03:48,000
an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.

50
0:03:49.285,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace

51
0:03:53.367,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law,

52
0:03:57.501,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background,

53
0:04:01.966,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the right to vote and run,

54
0:04:05.05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and most importantly to stipulate on political parties

55
0:04:09.201,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the alternation of male and female candidates

56
0:04:13.916,000 --> 0:04:16,000
vertically and horizontally in their lists,

57
0:04:17.3,000 --> 0:04:19,000
creating the zipper list.

58
0:04:20.133,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.

59
0:04:26.478,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress

60
0:04:32.25,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in the first elections ever in 52 years.

61
0:04:36.515,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Applause)

62
0:04:43.266,000 --> 0:04:49,000
However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,

63
0:04:49.734,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and of the revolution as a whole,

64
0:04:53.466,000 --> 0:04:54,000
was fading out --

65
0:04:55.05,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for every day we were waking up to the news of violence.

66
0:04:59.516,000 --> 0:05:01,000
One day we wake up to the news

67
0:05:01.75,000 --> 0:05:04,000
of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.

68
0:05:05.222,000 --> 0:05:06,000
On another day we wake up to the news

69
0:05:07.017,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.

70
0:05:11.518,000 --> 0:05:13,000
On another day we wake up to the news

71
0:05:13.6,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of the assassination of army officers.

72
0:05:17.117,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias

73
0:05:22.684,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners

74
0:05:27.534,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and their disrespect of the rule of law.

75
0:05:31.466,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,

76
0:05:35.002,000 --> 0:05:36,000
became more polarized

77
0:05:36.963,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and has driven away from the ideals and the principles --

78
0:05:40.641,000 --> 0:05:43,000
freedom, dignity, social justice --

79
0:05:43.707,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that we first held.

80
0:05:45.407,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Intolerance, exclusion and revenge

81
0:05:49.517,000 --> 0:05:54,000
became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.

82
0:05:54.549,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I am here today not at all to inspire you

83
0:05:59.199,000 --> 0:06:03,000
with our success story of the zipper list and the elections.

84
0:06:03.383,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I'm rather here today to confess

85
0:06:05.584,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.

86
0:06:12.366,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We did not prioritize right.

87
0:06:15.189,000 --> 0:06:22,000
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.

88
0:06:22.583,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates

89
0:06:27.883,000 --> 0:06:3,000
bring peace and national reconciliation?

90
0:06:30.916,000 --> 0:06:32,000
No, it didn't.

91
0:06:33.333,000 --> 0:06:34,000
What is it, then?

92
0:06:35.283,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated

93
0:06:41.466,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?

94
0:06:48.767,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Maybe what was missing was not the women only,

95
0:06:53.286,000 --> 0:07:,000
but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.

96
0:07:00.49,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building

97
0:07:04.863,000 --> 0:07:05,000
more than it needed the elections,

98
0:07:06.663,000 --> 0:07:09,000
which only reinforced polarization and division.

99
0:07:10.648,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine

100
0:07:16.913,000 --> 0:07:22,000
more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.

101
0:07:22.93,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.

102
0:07:29.627,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.

103
0:07:35.227,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We need to develop a feminine discourse

104
0:07:38.861,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that not only honors but also implements

105
0:07:42.994,000 --> 0:07:5,000
mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,

106
0:07:51.358,000 --> 0:07:54,000
inclusion instead of exclusion.

107
0:07:54.577,000 --> 0:07:57,000
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya

108
0:07:57.684,000 --> 0:08:,000
needs desperately in order to achieve peace.

109
0:08:01.159,000 --> 0:08:03,000
For peace has an alchemy,

110
0:08:03.343,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation

111
0:08:10.426,000 --> 0:08:13,000
between the feminine and masculine perspectives.

112
0:08:13.926,000 --> 0:08:15,000
That's the real zipper.

113
0:08:15.977,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And we need to establish that existentially

114
0:08:19.026,000 --> 0:08:21,000
before we do so sociopolitically.

115
0:08:21.477,000 --> 0:08:23,000
According to a Quranic verse

116
0:08:24.376,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."

117
0:08:30.877,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,

118
0:08:36.612,000 --> 0:08:4,000
has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb --

119
0:08:41.313,000 --> 0:08:46,000
symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity

120
0:08:47.147,000 --> 0:08:49,000
from which the male and the female,

121
0:08:49.263,000 --> 0:08:54,000
from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.

122
0:08:54.796,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,

123
0:09:03.807,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.

124
0:09:11.573,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things."

125
0:09:16.94,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger."

126
0:09:22.94,000 --> 0:09:26,000
May we all be granted a grace of mercy.

127
0:09:27.523,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Applause)

128
0:09:31.343,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Thank you.

129
0:09:33.447,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Applause)

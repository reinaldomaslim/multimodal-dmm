1
0:00:13.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I love learning foreign languages.

2
0:00:16.68,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In fact, I love it so much that I like to learn a new language every two years,

3
0:00:20.76,000 --> 0:00:22,000
currently working on my eighth one.

4
0:00:22.88,000 --> 0:00:24,000
When people find that out about me, they always ask me,

5
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"How do you do that? What's your secret?"

6
0:00:27.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And to be honest, for many years, my answer would be,

7
0:00:30.68,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"I don't know. I simply love learning languages."

8
0:00:33.72,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But people were never happy with that answer.

9
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language,

10
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
never achieving fluency,

11
0:00:41.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and here I come, learning one language after another.

12
0:00:44.64,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They wanted to know the secret of polyglots,

13
0:00:46.88,000 --> 0:00:47,000
people who speak a lot of languages.

14
0:00:49.4,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And that made me wonder, too,

15
0:00:50.84,000 --> 0:00:52,000
how do actually other polyglots do it?

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What do we have in common?

17
0:00:54.68,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And what is it that enables us

18
0:00:56.64,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to learn languages so much faster than other people?

19
0:00:59.88,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I decided to meet other people like me and find that out.

20
0:01:03.76,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The best place to meet a lot of polyglots

21
0:01:05.84,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is an event where hundreds of language lovers

22
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
meet in one place to practice their languages.

23
0:01:11.04,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There are several such polyglot events organized all around the world,

24
0:01:14.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and so I decided to go there

25
0:01:15.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and ask polyglots about the methods that they use.

26
0:01:19.2,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And so I met Benny from Ireland,

27
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one.

28
0:01:26.24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
He learns a few phrases from a travel phrasebook

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and goes to meet native speakers

30
0:01:30.76,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and starts having conversations with them right away.

31
0:01:33.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He doesn't mind making even 200 mistakes a day,

32
0:01:36.4,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because that's how he learns, based on the feedback.

33
0:01:39.48,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And the best thing is, he doesn't even need to travel a lot today,

34
0:01:42.64,000 --> 0:01:44,000
because you can easily have conversations with native speakers

35
0:01:45.6,000 --> 0:01:47,000
from the comfort of your living room, using websites.

36
0:01:48.32,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I also met Lucas from Brazil

37
0:01:50.12,000 --> 0:01:52,000
who had a really interesting method to learn Russian.

38
0:01:53.2,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He simply added a hundred random Russian speakers on Skype as friends,

39
0:01:58.88,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and then he opened a chat window with one of them

40
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and wrote "Hi" in Russian.

41
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And the person replied, "Hi, how are you?"

42
0:02:07.6,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Lucas copied this and put it into a text window with another person,

43
0:02:12.08,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the person replied, "I'm fine, thank you, and how are you?"

44
0:02:15.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Lucas copied this back to the first person,

45
0:02:18.68,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and in this way, he had two strangers have a conversation with each other

46
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
without knowing about it.

47
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:24.88,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And soon he would start typing himself,

49
0:02:26.8,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because he had so many of these conversations

50
0:02:28.96,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that he figured out how the Russian conversation usually starts.

51
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What an ingenious method, right?

52
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And then I met polyglots who always start by imitating sounds of the language,

53
0:02:38.88,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and others who always learn the 500 most frequent words of the language,

54
0:02:43.32,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and yet others who always start by reading about the grammar.

55
0:02:47.6,000 --> 0:02:49,000
If I asked a hundred different polyglots,

56
0:02:49.92,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I heard a hundred different approaches to learning languages.

57
0:02:53.56,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Everybody seems to have a unique way they learn a language,

58
0:02:57.2,000 --> 0:03:,000
and yet we all come to the same result of speaking several languages fluently.

59
0:03:02.12,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And as I was listening to these polyglots telling me about their methods,

60
0:03:06.44,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it suddenly dawned on me:

61
0:03:08.76,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the one thing we all have in common

62
0:03:11.92,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is that we simply found ways to enjoy the language-learning process.

63
0:03:17.48,000 --> 0:03:19,000
All of these polyglots were talking about language learning

64
0:03:20.28,000 --> 0:03:21,000
as if it was great fun.

65
0:03:21.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You should have seen their faces

66
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when they were showing me their colorful grammar charts

67
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and their carefully handmade flash cards,

68
0:03:28.32,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and their statistics about learning vocabulary using apps,

69
0:03:31.36,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or even how they love to cook based on recipes in a foreign language.

70
0:03:36.68,000 --> 0:03:37,000
All of them use different methods,

71
0:03:38.44,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but they always make sure it's something that they personally enjoy.

72
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I realized that this is actually how I learn languages myself.

73
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
When I was learning Spanish, I was bored with the text in the textbook.

74
0:03:49.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I mean, who wants to read about Jose

75
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
asking about the directions to the train station. Right?

76
0:03:54.68,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I wanted to read "Harry Potter" instead,

77
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because that was my favorite book as a child,

78
0:03:59.2,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I have read it many times.

79
0:04:00.88,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So I got the Spanish translation of "Harry Potter" and started reading,

80
0:04:04.52,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and sure enough, I didn't understand almost anything at the beginning,

81
0:04:07.88,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but I kept on reading because I loved the book,

82
0:04:10.12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and by the end of the book, I was able to follow it almost without any problems.

83
0:04:14.28,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And the same thing happened when I was learning German.

84
0:04:16.92,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I decided to watch "Friends," my favorite sitcom, in German,

85
0:04:20.24,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and again, at the beginning it was all just gibberish.

86
0:04:23.36,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I didn't know where one word finished and another one started,

87
0:04:26.56,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but I kept on watching every day because it's "Friends."

88
0:04:29.24,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I can watch it in any language. I love it so much.

89
0:04:31.64,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And after the second or third season,

90
0:04:33.68,000 --> 0:04:35,000
seriously, the dialogue started to make sense.

91
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I only realized this after meeting other polyglots.

92
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We are no geniuses

93
0:04:41.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and we have no shortcut to learning languages.

94
0:04:44.2,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We simply found ways how to enjoy the process,

95
0:04:48.04,000 --> 0:04:51,000
how to turn language learning from a boring school subject

96
0:04:51.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
into a pleasant activity which you don't mind doing every day.

97
0:04:55.52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If you don't like writing words down on paper,

98
0:04:57.72,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you can always type them in an app.

99
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:01,000
If you don't like listening to boring textbook material,

100
0:05:02.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
find interesting content on YouTube or in podcasts for any language.

101
0:05:06.6,000 --> 0:05:07,000
If you're a more introverted person

102
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and you can't imagine speaking to native speakers right away,

103
0:05:11.36,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you can apply the method of self-talk.

104
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You can talk to yourself in the comfort of your room,

105
0:05:16.32,000 --> 0:05:18,000
describing your plans for the weekend, how your day has been,

106
0:05:19.24,000 --> 0:05:21,000
or even take a random picture from your phone

107
0:05:21.4,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and describe the picture to your imaginary friend.

108
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is how polyglots learn languages,

109
0:05:27.68,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and the best news is, it's available to anyone

110
0:05:30.56,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who is willing to take the learning into their own hands.

111
0:05:34.52,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So meeting other polyglots helped me realize

112
0:05:36.64,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that it is really crucial to find enjoyment

113
0:05:39.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in the process of learning languages,

114
0:05:41.8,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but also that joy in itself is not enough.

115
0:05:45.68,000 --> 0:05:47,000
If you want to achieve fluency in a foreign language,

116
0:05:48.44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you'll also need to apply three more principles.

117
0:05:51.76,000 --> 0:05:53,000
First of all, you'll need effective methods.

118
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
If you try to memorize a list of words for a test tomorrow,

119
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:06:,000
the words will be stored in your short-term memory

120
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and you'll forget them after a few days.

121
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:05,000
If you, however, want to keep words long term,

122
0:06:06.36,000 --> 0:06:08,000
you need to revise them in the course of a few days repeatedly

123
0:06:09.32,000 --> 0:06:11,000
using the so-called space repetition.

124
0:06:11.56,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You can use apps which are based on this system such as Anki or Memrise,

125
0:06:15.84,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or you can write lists of word in a notebook using the Goldlist method,

126
0:06:19.2,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which is also very popular with many polyglots.

127
0:06:21.92,000 --> 0:06:24,000
If you're not sure which methods are effective and what is available out there,

128
0:06:25.68,000 --> 0:06:28,000
just check out polyglots' YouTube channels and websites

129
0:06:28.72,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and get inspiration from them.

130
0:06:30.52,000 --> 0:06:32,000
If it works for them, it will most probably work for you too.

131
0:06:34.84,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The third principle to follow

132
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is to create a system in your learning.

133
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We're all very busy and no one really has time to learn a language today.

134
0:06:43.96,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But we can create that time if we just plan a bit ahead.

135
0:06:47.76,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Can you wake up 15 minutes earlier than you normally do?

136
0:06:51.2,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That would be the perfect time to revise some vocabulary.

137
0:06:54.52,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Can you listen to a podcast on your way to work while driving?

138
0:06:58.28,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Well, that would be great to get some listening experience.

139
0:07:01.76,000 --> 0:07:04,000
There are so many things we can do without even planning that extra time,

140
0:07:05.24,000 --> 0:07:07,000
such as listening to podcasts on our way to work

141
0:07:07.92,000 --> 0:07:08,000
or doing our household chores.

142
0:07:09.6,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The important thing is to create a plan in the learning.

143
0:07:12.92,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"I will practice speaking every Tuesday and Thursday

144
0:07:15.44,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with a friend for 20 minutes.

145
0:07:17.52,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I will listen to a YouTube video while having breakfast."

146
0:07:21.96,000 --> 0:07:23,000
If you create a system in your learning,

147
0:07:24.12,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you don't need to find that extra time,

148
0:07:26.04,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because it will become a part of your everyday life.

149
0:07:29.88,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And finally, if you want to learn a language fluently,

150
0:07:33.12,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you need also a bit of patience.

151
0:07:36.6,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's not possible to learn a language within two months,

152
0:07:39.36,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but it's definitely possible to make a visible improvement in two months,

153
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:46,000
if you learn in small chunks every day in a way that you enjoy.

154
0:07:47.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And there is nothing that motivates us more

155
0:07:49.2,000 --> 0:07:5,000
than our own success.

156
0:07:51.12,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I vividly remember the moment

157
0:07:53.04,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when I understood the first joke in German when watching "Friends."

158
0:07:57.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I was so happy and motivated

159
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that I just kept on watching that day two more episodes,

160
0:08:02.2,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and as I kept watching,

161
0:08:03.96,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I had more and more of those moments of understanding, these little victories,

162
0:08:08.2,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and step by step, I got to a level where I could use the language

163
0:08:11.68,000 --> 0:08:13,000
freely and fluently to express anything.

164
0:08:14.56,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This is a wonderful feeling.

165
0:08:16.8,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I can't get enough of that feeling,

166
0:08:18.52,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and that's why I learn a language every two years.

167
0:08:21.36,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So this is the whole polyglot secret.

168
0:08:23.44,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Find effective methods which you can use systematically

169
0:08:26.32,000 --> 0:08:29,000
over the period of some time in a way which you enjoy,

170
0:08:29.64,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and this is how polyglots learn languages within months, not years.

171
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, some of you may be thinking,

172
0:08:36.8,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"That's all very nice to enjoy language learning,

173
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but isn't the real secret that you polyglots

174
0:08:41.72,000 --> 0:08:43,000
are just super talented and most of us aren't?"

175
0:08:45.32,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Well, there's one thing I haven't told you about Benny and Lucas.

176
0:08:49.159,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Benny had 11 years of Irish Gaelic and five years of German at school.

177
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
He couldn't speak them at all when graduating.

178
0:08:58.24,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Up to the age of 21, he thought he didn't have the language gene

179
0:09:02.44,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and he could not speak another language.

180
0:09:04.88,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Then he started to look for his way of learning languages,

181
0:09:07.84,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which was speaking to native speakers and getting feedback from them,

182
0:09:11.72,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and today Benny can easily have a conversation in 10 languages.

183
0:09:17.12,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Lucas tried to learn English at school for 10 years.

184
0:09:20.44,000 --> 0:09:22,000
He was one of the worst students in class.

185
0:09:23.08,000 --> 0:09:24,000
His friends even made fun of him

186
0:09:24.72,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and gave him a Russian textbook as a joke

187
0:09:27.36,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because they thought he would never learn that language, or any language.

188
0:09:31.12,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And then Lucas started to experiment with methods,

189
0:09:33.52,000 --> 0:09:34,000
looking for his own way to learn,

190
0:09:36.52,000 --> 0:09:4,000
for example, by having Skype chat conversations with strangers.

191
0:09:40.72,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And after just 10 years,

192
0:09:42.56,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Lucas is able to speak 11 languages fluently.

193
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Does that sound like a miracle?

194
0:09:49.44,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Well, I see such miracles every single day.

195
0:09:52.76,000 --> 0:09:53,000
As a language mentor,

196
0:09:54.12,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I help people learn languages by themselves,

197
0:09:56.56,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and I see this every day.

198
0:09:57.88,000 --> 0:10:01,000
People struggle with language learning for five, 10, even 20 years,

199
0:10:02.08,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and then they suddenly take their learning into their own hands,

200
0:10:05.96,000 --> 0:10:08,000
start using materials which they enjoy, more effective methods,

201
0:10:09.28,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or they start tracking their learning

202
0:10:11.12,000 --> 0:10:13,000
so that they can appreciate their own progress,

203
0:10:14.08,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and that's when suddenly

204
0:10:16.04,000 --> 0:10:2,000
they magically find the language talent that they were missing all their lives.

205
0:10:21.48,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So if you've also tried to learn a language

206
0:10:23.68,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and you gave up, thinking it's too difficult

207
0:10:26.12,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or you don't have the language talent,

208
0:10:28.4,000 --> 0:10:29,000
give it another try.

209
0:10:29.96,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Maybe you're also just one enjoyable method away

210
0:10:32.84,000 --> 0:10:33,000
from learning that language fluently.

211
0:10:34.96,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Maybe you're just one method away from becoming a polyglot.

212
0:10:38.92,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Thank you.

213
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Applause)

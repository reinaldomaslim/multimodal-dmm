1
0:00:12.418,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When my father and I started a company

2
0:00:15.156,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to 3D print human tissues and organs,

3
0:00:18.432,000 --> 0:00:21,000
some people initially thought we were a little crazy.

4
0:00:21.788,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But since then, much progress has been made,

5
0:00:24.479,000 --> 0:00:27,000
both in our lab and other labs around the world.

6
0:00:27.686,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And given this, we started getting questions like,

7
0:00:30.953,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"If you can grow human body parts,

8
0:00:33.68,000 --> 0:00:38,000
can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"

9
0:00:39.06,000 --> 0:00:41,000
When someone first suggested this to me,

10
0:00:41.502,000 --> 0:00:43,000
quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,

11
0:00:44.456,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but what I soon came to realize

12
0:00:46.559,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was that this is not so crazy after all.

13
0:00:49.805,000 --> 0:00:51,000
What's crazy is what we do today.

14
0:00:52.774,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'm convinced that in 30 years,

15
0:00:54.963,000 --> 0:00:55,000
when we look back on today

16
0:00:56.685,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals

17
0:01:00.295,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to make our hamburgers and our handbags,

18
0:01:03.198,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we'll see this as being wasteful

19
0:01:05.38,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and indeed crazy.

20
0:01:07.67,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Did you know that today we maintain

21
0:01:10.782,000 --> 0:01:13,000
a global herd of 60 billion animals

22
0:01:14.123,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?

23
0:01:19.699,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And over the next few decades,

24
0:01:21.769,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as the world's population expands to 10 billion,

25
0:01:24.529,000 --> 0:01:25,000
this will need to nearly double

26
0:01:26.174,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to 100 billion animals.

27
0:01:28.759,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But maintaining this herd

28
0:01:30.368,000 --> 0:01:32,000
takes a major toll on our planet.

29
0:01:32.667,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Animals are not just raw materials.

30
0:01:36.286,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They're living beings,

31
0:01:37.909,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and already our livestock

32
0:01:39.827,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is one of the largest users of land,

33
0:01:42.406,000 --> 0:01:43,000
fresh water,

34
0:01:43.758,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases

35
0:01:46.491,000 --> 0:01:47,000
which drive climate change.

36
0:01:48.12,000 --> 0:01:49,000
On top of this,

37
0:01:49.45,000 --> 0:01:52,000
when you get so many animals so close together,

38
0:01:52.674,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it creates a breeding ground for disease

39
0:01:55.144,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and opportunities for harm and abuse.

40
0:01:58.727,000 --> 0:02:,000
Clearly, we cannot continue on this path

41
0:02:01.257,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which puts the environment, public health,

42
0:02:05.08,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and food security at risk.

43
0:02:07.522,000 --> 0:02:1,000
There is another way, because essentially,

44
0:02:11.088,000 --> 0:02:15,000
animal products are just collections of tissues,

45
0:02:15.374,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and right now we breed and raise

46
0:02:17.798,000 --> 0:02:18,000
highly complex animals

47
0:02:19.727,000 --> 0:02:2,000
only to create products

48
0:02:21.418,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that are made of relatively simple tissues.

49
0:02:24.133,000 --> 0:02:27,000
What if, instead of starting with a complex

50
0:02:27.343,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and sentient animal,

51
0:02:29.465,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we started with what the tissues are made of,

52
0:02:33.013,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the basic unit of life,

53
0:02:35.559,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the cell?

54
0:02:38.04,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This is biofabrication, where cells themselves

55
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
can be used to grow biological products

56
0:02:44.386,000 --> 0:02:45,000
like tissues and organs.

57
0:02:46.278,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Already in medicine,

58
0:02:47.976,000 --> 0:02:49,000
biofabrication techniques have been used

59
0:02:50.179,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to grow sophisticated body parts,

60
0:02:52.615,000 --> 0:02:56,000
like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,

61
0:02:57.513,000 --> 0:03:,000
that have been successfully implanted into patients.

62
0:03:00.747,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be

63
0:03:04.855,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.

64
0:03:09.621,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And we should begin by reimagining leather.

65
0:03:15.431,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.

66
0:03:19.701,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.

67
0:03:24.604,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Growing leather is also technically simpler

68
0:03:26.505,000 --> 0:03:28,000
than growing other animal products like meat.

69
0:03:29.28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It mainly uses one cell type,

70
0:03:31.39,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and it is largely two-dimensional.

71
0:03:34.515,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.

72
0:03:38.683,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Until biofabrication is better understood,

73
0:03:41.781,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it is clear that, initially at least,

74
0:03:43.966,000 --> 0:03:47,000
more people would be willing to wear novel materials

75
0:03:48.017,000 --> 0:03:5,000
than would be willing to eat novel foods,

76
0:03:50.652,000 --> 0:03:51,000
no matter how delicious.

77
0:03:52.603,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In this sense, leather is a gateway material,

78
0:03:55.71,000 --> 0:04:,000
a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.

79
0:04:00.782,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If we can succeed here,

80
0:04:02.666,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat

81
0:04:05.942,000 --> 0:04:07,000
closer on the horizon.

82
0:04:08.706,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now how do we do it?

83
0:04:11.171,000 --> 0:04:14,000
To grow leather, we begin by taking cells

84
0:04:14.443,000 --> 0:04:16,000
from an animal, through a simple biopsy.

85
0:04:17.275,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The animal could be a cow,

86
0:04:19.283,000 --> 0:04:21,000
lamb, or even something more exotic.

87
0:04:21.98,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This process does no harm,

88
0:04:24.032,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and Daisy the cow can live a happy life.

89
0:04:26.934,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We then isolate the skin cells

90
0:04:28.669,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and multiply them in a cell culture medium.

91
0:04:31.538,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This takes millions of cells

92
0:04:32.711,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and expands them into billions.

93
0:04:35.83,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And we then coax these cells to produce collagen,

94
0:04:38.444,000 --> 0:04:39,000
as they would naturally.

95
0:04:39.871,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This collagen is the stuff between cells.

96
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's natural connective tissue.

97
0:04:44.693,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's the extracellular matrix,

98
0:04:46.253,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but in leather, it's the main building block.

99
0:04:49.462,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen

100
0:04:53.175,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and we spread them out to form sheets,

101
0:04:55.152,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,

102
0:04:58.594,000 --> 0:05:01,000
like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,

103
0:05:02.123,000 --> 0:05:03,000
which we then let mature.

104
0:05:03.977,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And finally, we take this multilayered skin

105
0:05:07.189,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,

106
0:05:11.112,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we create leather.

107
0:05:13.288,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And so I'm very excited to show you,

108
0:05:15.482,000 --> 0:05:17,000
for the first time,

109
0:05:17.631,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the first batch of our cultured leather,

110
0:05:21.641,000 --> 0:05:22,000
fresh from the lab.

111
0:05:23.204,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is real, genuine leather,

112
0:05:26.783,000 --> 0:05:29,000
without the animal sacrifice.

113
0:05:30.306,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It can have all the characteristics of leather

114
0:05:33.484,000 --> 0:05:36,000
because it is made of the same cells,

115
0:05:36.969,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and better yet,

116
0:05:38.918,000 --> 0:05:41,000
there is no hair to remove,

117
0:05:42.793,000 --> 0:05:44,000
no scars or insect's bites,

118
0:05:45.326,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and no waste.

119
0:05:46.766,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,

120
0:05:50.19,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a handbag or a car seat.

121
0:05:53.276,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow

122
0:05:56.492,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or an alligator.

123
0:05:59.322,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And because we make this material,

124
0:06:01.876,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we grow this leather from the ground up,

125
0:06:04.158,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we can control its properties in very interesting ways.

126
0:06:07.191,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This piece of leather

127
0:06:09.726,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is a mere seven tissue layers thick,

128
0:06:13.244,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.

129
0:06:17.047,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.

130
0:06:26.214,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You don't have that kind of fine control

131
0:06:29.224,000 --> 0:06:31,000
with conventional leather.

132
0:06:31.513,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,

133
0:06:34.758,000 --> 0:06:37,000
like softness, breathability,

134
0:06:38.523,000 --> 0:06:43,000
durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.

135
0:06:43.72,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We can mimic nature,

136
0:06:45.891,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but in some ways also improve upon it.

137
0:06:49.179,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This type of leather can do what today's leather does,

138
0:06:53.177,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but with imagination, probably much more.

139
0:06:56.618,000 --> 0:07:,000
What could the future of animal products look like?

140
0:07:00.847,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It need not look like this,

141
0:07:03.206,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which is actually the state of the art today.

142
0:07:05.939,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Rather, it could be much more like this.

143
0:07:08.931,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures

144
0:07:11.164,000 --> 0:07:13,000
for thousands of years, beginning with products

145
0:07:13.929,000 --> 0:07:15,000
like wine, beer and yogurt.

146
0:07:16.558,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,

147
0:07:19.892,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and today we prepare cultured food

148
0:07:22.153,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in beautiful, sterile facilities like this.

149
0:07:24.471,000 --> 0:07:27,000
A brewery is essentially a bioreactor.

150
0:07:27.671,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It is where cell culture takes place.

151
0:07:30.44,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Imagine that in this facility,

152
0:07:32.985,000 --> 0:07:33,000
instead of brewing beer,

153
0:07:34.731,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we were brewing leather

154
0:07:37.312,000 --> 0:07:39,000
or meat.

155
0:07:40.009,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Imagine touring this facility,

156
0:07:42.654,000 --> 0:07:45,000
learning about how the leather or meat is cultured,

157
0:07:46.385,000 --> 0:07:48,000
seeing the process from beginning to end,

158
0:07:49.146,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and even trying some.

159
0:07:50.542,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It's clean, open and educational,

160
0:07:53.648,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and this is in contrast to the hidden,

161
0:07:56.068,000 --> 0:07:58,000
guarded and remote factories

162
0:07:58.146,000 --> 0:08:01,000
where leather and meat is produced today.

163
0:08:01.627,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Perhaps biofabrication

164
0:08:04.454,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.

165
0:08:08.734,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's environmentally responsible,

166
0:08:11.187,000 --> 0:08:14,000
efficient and humane.

167
0:08:14.349,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It allows us to be creative.

168
0:08:16.543,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We can design new materials, new products,

169
0:08:19.763,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and new facilities.

170
0:08:22.962,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We need to move past just killing animals

171
0:08:26.802,000 --> 0:08:27,000
as a resource

172
0:08:28.635,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to something more civilized and evolved.

173
0:08:34.556,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Perhaps we are ready for something

174
0:08:37.241,000 --> 0:08:42,000
literally and figuratively more cultured.

175
0:08:42.826,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Thank you.

176
0:08:44.207,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.659,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm an exhausted dad.

2
0:00:15.31,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Currently owned and dominated by two mini dictators,

3
0:00:19.389,000 --> 0:00:23,000
who rule my life with an iron fist while wearing their Huggies diapers.

4
0:00:23.595,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:24.976,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Now probably because I've been drowning in small people lately,

6
0:00:28.015,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I've been paying close attention to a particular headline.

7
0:00:31.428,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It seems around the world, in developed countries,

8
0:00:33.966,000 --> 0:00:35,000
people are having fewer babies.

9
0:00:36.839,000 --> 0:00:38,000
From North America to Europe to China to Japan,

10
0:00:39.296,000 --> 0:00:42,000
there's actually been a consistent decline in birth rates.

11
0:00:43.104,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In fact, over the past 50 years,

12
0:00:45.286,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the global fertility rate has halved.

13
0:00:50.286,000 --> 0:00:51,000
What the heck is going on?

14
0:00:52.284,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, my friends who don't want kids,

15
0:00:54.114,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all point to climate change as a reason for never having babies.

16
0:00:57.688,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And many of you are sitting there right now, saying,

17
0:01:00.197,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"Waj, there's also overpopulation,

18
0:01:02.982,000 --> 0:01:04,000
there's also high birth rates,

19
0:01:05.037,000 --> 0:01:07,000
which still exist in many African and Middle Eastern countries,

20
0:01:08.038,000 --> 0:01:1,000
there's also orphan kids who still need parents,

21
0:01:10.696,000 --> 0:01:12,000
there's also a lack of resources to go around for everyone,

22
0:01:13.538,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and oh, by the way,

23
0:01:14.947,000 --> 0:01:18,000
we have a ginormous carbon footprint that is destroying this planet.

24
0:01:19.538,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I hear you, I hear you.

25
0:01:21.474,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And yet, despite all this chaos,

26
0:01:25.286,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I still think we should have babies.

27
0:01:28.001,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I believe we can and should fight for the earth and humanity,

28
0:01:32.302,000 --> 0:01:33,000
side by side.

29
0:01:34.299,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, if I could take it personal for a second,

30
0:01:36.474,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I get it, I get why some of you might be skeptical about having babies.

31
0:01:40.228,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Here's a photo of my wife and me before we had kids.

32
0:01:44.287,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Young, happy, fresh.

33
0:01:48.032,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:49.104,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Here's a photo of me after having kids.

35
0:01:52.728,000 --> 0:01:55,000
A broken, defeated husk of a man.

36
0:01:55.839,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:56.934,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Here's the photo of the car I thought I'd be driving as an adult.

38
0:02:01.846,000 --> 0:02:02,000
A Porsche.

39
0:02:03.989,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Here's what I actually drive.

40
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
A Honda Odyssey minivan.

41
0:02:11.037,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:12.38,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:13.466,000 --> 0:02:14,000
For the minivan.

44
0:02:15.22,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Where there was once hope, now there is convenient space,

45
0:02:18.784,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and good mileage, good mileage.

46
0:02:21.434,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now, I just want to stress

47
0:02:24.474,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that I'm completely aware of the very dire threats

48
0:02:29.149,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of global warming and climate change.

49
0:02:31.11,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I just want to acknowledge that choosing to have babies

50
0:02:34.252,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is a deeply, profoundly personal choice.

51
0:02:37.765,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And that many who want to are unable.

52
0:02:40.202,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But just for today, let's examine the flip side of the coin.

53
0:02:43.94,000 --> 0:02:45,000
At how not having enough new people

54
0:02:46.276,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is going to be a major problem moving forward.

55
0:02:49.18,000 --> 0:02:51,000
According to the World Health Organization,

56
0:02:51.22,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we need to average about 2.1 children per woman today

57
0:02:54.314,000 --> 0:02:57,000
just so we have enough people to replace the previous generation.

58
0:02:58.077,000 --> 0:03:01,000
A lot of you thought overpopulation was going to be a problem in 100 years --

59
0:03:01.726,000 --> 0:03:02,000
yeah, it might be underpopulation.

60
0:03:03.431,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So a question:

61
0:03:04.622,000 --> 0:03:07,000
what happens if that number dips below 2.1?

62
0:03:08.413,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There's going to be a domino effect.

63
0:03:10.477,000 --> 0:03:12,000
As all of us get older, and live longer,

64
0:03:13.231,000 --> 0:03:15,000
there's going to be a shrinking younger population,

65
0:03:16.061,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which is going to lead to rising labor shortages

66
0:03:18.34,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in the world's biggest economies.

67
0:03:19.974,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I'm talking about United States, China, Japan, Germany.

68
0:03:22.886,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Fewer younger working people means less tax revenue.

69
0:03:25.823,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Less tax revenue means less money and resources

70
0:03:28.561,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to go to safety net programs that all of us are going to depend upon.

71
0:03:31.831,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I'm talking about pensions and health care.

72
0:03:34.807,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It seems every generation is indeed connected.

73
0:03:38.855,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But how the heck did we get here in the first place?

74
0:03:41.355,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Well, in some cases, it was intentional.

75
0:03:44.22,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Let's take the DeLorean to simpler times.

76
0:03:48.353,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Let's stop in China.

77
0:03:50.275,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Somewhere between the death of disco and "Empire Strikes Back" -- 1980.

78
0:03:55.275,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In 1980, China decided to implement the one-child policy,

79
0:04:00.17,000 --> 0:04:02,000
largely limiting most parents to having just one kid

80
0:04:02.837,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to combat overpopulation.

81
0:04:04.583,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Check out some good old-fashioned Chinese propaganda, lovely.

82
0:04:07.974,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Now, fast-forward to 2019.

83
0:04:10.616,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Even after ending its one-child policy in 2015,

84
0:04:13.895,000 --> 0:04:15,000
China's birth rates have largely declined.

85
0:04:16.639,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In fact, the falling population in China

86
0:04:18.599,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is removing one of its biggest drivers of growth -- people.

87
0:04:22.615,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If trends continue,

88
0:04:24.004,000 --> 0:04:27,000
China's population is actually going to peak in 2029,

89
0:04:27.665,000 --> 0:04:3,000
before entering "unstoppable decline."

90
0:04:31.879,000 --> 0:04:33,000
China's government is so freaked out right now

91
0:04:34.554,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that it's actually doing new propaganda --

92
0:04:36.601,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it's begging couples to have children for the country.

93
0:04:40.188,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Let's take the DeLorean and hop over to Japan,

94
0:04:42.8,000 --> 0:04:45,000
home of my beloved Honda Odyssey minivan.

95
0:04:45.864,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:47.594,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Japan is now producing more adult diapers than infant ones.

97
0:04:55.212,000 --> 0:05:,000
The number of kids in Japan has fallen for the 37th straight year.

98
0:05:00.474,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And unlike other countries,

99
0:05:01.816,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it has not been able to replace its population numbers

100
0:05:04.563,000 --> 0:05:05,000
through immigrant workers.

101
0:05:06.014,000 --> 0:05:07,000
There will be labor shortages

102
0:05:07.507,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and not enough money to fund the safety-net programs.

103
0:05:10.236,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, Japan has introduced two solutions.

104
0:05:12.966,000 --> 0:05:13,000
First, a financial incentive.

105
0:05:15.204,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Some local governments in Japan have offered couples money to have babies,

106
0:05:20.037,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with the money increasing with each additional child being born.

107
0:05:23.395,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This actually worked for one year in 2014 in this town called Ama.

108
0:05:27.419,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It actually raised the birth rate from about 1.66 kids per woman to 1.8.

109
0:05:32.867,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But it did not gain traction across Japan.

110
0:05:35.526,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In 2018, a leader of Japan's ruling party tried a new tack.

111
0:05:39.855,000 --> 0:05:4,000
He told young people,

112
0:05:41.506,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"You're selfish for not having babies."

113
0:05:44.569,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Shockingly, shaming was not a rousing aphrodisiac.

114
0:05:49.851,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Surprise, I know, surprise.

115
0:05:51.168,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Who would have thought?

116
0:05:52.74,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:54.295,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Let's take the DeLorean to Europe,

118
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the continent of delicious cheeses I love to eat but cannot pronounce.

119
0:06:01.151,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The UK and much of Western Europe

120
0:06:03.175,000 --> 0:06:06,000
has a birth rate of about 1.7 kids per woman,

121
0:06:06.318,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which at least is better than Hungary, where it hovers around 1.45.

122
0:06:11.545,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán

123
0:06:13.608,000 --> 0:06:16,000
has proposed a new solution to try to incentivize people to have kids.

124
0:06:17.846,000 --> 0:06:19,000
He said families where the women have four or more kids

125
0:06:20.529,000 --> 0:06:22,000
will no longer pay income tax.

126
0:06:23.617,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Pretty good, right, pretty good.

127
0:06:25.665,000 --> 0:06:28,000
At least it's better than Russia's 2007 proposal,

128
0:06:28.83,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which once offered women in a particular region

129
0:06:31.116,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the opportunity of winning a fridge if they had more kids.

130
0:06:34.672,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

131
0:06:36.735,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Yeah, it didn't work, it didn't work.

132
0:06:39.688,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But hold on, pump the brakes.

133
0:06:41.419,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Orbán is primarily proposing this because he wants to limit

134
0:06:45.577,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the population of Muslims and people of color.

135
0:06:49.286,000 --> 0:06:53,000
He says he doesn't think Hungary's traditions and culture and color

136
0:06:54.032,000 --> 0:06:57,000
has to be "mixed with those of others."

137
0:06:58.017,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Subtle.

138
0:06:59.38,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Unfortunately for Orbán, and much of the EU,

139
0:07:04.269,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the birth rates are not high enough right now

140
0:07:06.808,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to be replenished without immigration.

141
0:07:09.974,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Among EU countries, there is a demographic decline.

142
0:07:13.553,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So it seems, in Europe, karma is going to be brown and Muslim.

143
0:07:18.053,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

144
0:07:22.616,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Just saying.

145
0:07:24.362,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The question remains:

146
0:07:26.561,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Why aren't people having enough kids?

147
0:07:29.157,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Why is the birth rate declining in these countries?

148
0:07:32.53,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In some cases,

149
0:07:33.959,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it's because women are more literate, more educated.

150
0:07:37.689,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They have more economic opportunities -- applaud.

151
0:07:40.006,000 --> 0:07:42,000
All good things, all good things, yes.

152
0:07:42.535,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Applause)

153
0:07:44.911,000 --> 0:07:45,000
In India, this has been fantastic,

154
0:07:46.593,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it has actually reduced the birth rate but kept it above that magic 2.1 number.

155
0:07:50.815,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Women also have more access to birth control,

156
0:07:53.109,000 --> 0:07:55,000
more control over their reproductive lives,

157
0:07:55.561,000 --> 0:07:56,000
all good things.

158
0:07:58.141,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But in the United States, in particular,

159
0:08:01.307,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a lot of young people are opting out of having kids,

160
0:08:03.958,000 --> 0:08:05,000
largely cite the same reason:

161
0:08:06.442,000 --> 0:08:07,000
financial concerns.

162
0:08:08.022,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Let's take the DeLorean to my motherland, the United States of America,

163
0:08:12.942,000 --> 0:08:17,000
where the birth rate hit its historic low in 2017.

164
0:08:18.473,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The United States is the most expensive country in the world

165
0:08:23.362,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to give birth.

166
0:08:25.196,000 --> 0:08:26,000
If you do not have insurance,

167
0:08:26.95,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it will cost you 32,000 dollars to have a baby,

168
0:08:30.363,000 --> 0:08:32,000
if everything goes perfectly.

169
0:08:33.133,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That's like buying a brand new Honda Odyssey minivan, OK?

170
0:08:36.339,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So, congratulations, you just had a baby,

171
0:08:38.347,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but the baby's economic productivity is zero, and guess what?

172
0:08:41.245,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The United States is the only industrialized country in the world

173
0:08:44.624,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that does not require employers to offer paid parental leave.

174
0:08:48.433,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Mom, you just had a baby, congratulations, that's lovely.

175
0:08:52.251,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Get back to work or you're fired, young mom!"

176
0:08:55.865,000 --> 0:08:57,000
My wife and I, both working parents,

177
0:08:58.714,000 --> 0:09:02,000
pay about 3,500 dollars a month -- a month -- in Virginia for childcare.

178
0:09:03.905,000 --> 0:09:05,000
If you do the math, that's 40,000 dollars a year.

179
0:09:06.376,000 --> 0:09:1,000
That's like buying a brand new, souped-up, Honda Odyssey minivan, OK.

180
0:09:10.495,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I have one, I do not need 10.

181
0:09:15.161,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So here's my bold suggestion.

182
0:09:17.82,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Let's make it easier for people to have babies.

183
0:09:22.677,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It seems in order to invest in our future, we actually have to invest in the present

184
0:09:26.701,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and help those people who want to become parents.

185
0:09:29.662,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Give them affordable health care,

186
0:09:31.598,000 --> 0:09:32,000
give them affordable childcare,

187
0:09:33.464,000 --> 0:09:35,000
give them paid parental leave.

188
0:09:36.067,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Among the EU states in 2017, France reported the highest birth rates.

189
0:09:40.49,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Why?

190
0:09:41.665,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Largely due to its pronatal policies

191
0:09:43.934,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that actually kept women in the workforce.

192
0:09:46.173,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I'm talking about subsidized daycare and paid maternal leave.

193
0:09:50.614,000 --> 0:09:53,000
China and Japan, thank God, are finally wisening up

194
0:09:53.67,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and proposing such policies.

195
0:09:55.099,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This is great.

196
0:09:56.797,000 --> 0:09:59,000
That being said, I know some of you have listened to me

197
0:09:59.866,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and you still think the best investment we can make in the future

198
0:10:02.996,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is not having babies.

199
0:10:05.025,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I respect that.

200
0:10:06.366,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I get where you're coming from.

201
0:10:07.882,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And I know many of you in this audience want to have babies

202
0:10:12.821,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but you are terrified about the future.

203
0:10:15.399,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And as a parent, I feel you.

204
0:10:18.304,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I'm scared about the future.

205
0:10:20.68,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I wrote that last line a month ago.

206
0:10:23.117,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But it really hit home three days ago for me,

207
0:10:25.911,000 --> 0:10:26,000
while I was at TED.

208
0:10:29.32,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Three days ago, my wife calls me, crying.

209
0:10:32.344,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I pick it up in my hotel room.

210
0:10:34.035,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And she said, "I'm calling from the hospital."

211
0:10:36.447,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We had to take my baby daughter Nusayba,

212
0:10:38.49,000 --> 0:10:39,000
who was named after a warrior princess,

213
0:10:40.458,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to the hospital, because she found a bump on the stomach.

214
0:10:43.403,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We got back the results, and there were bumps all around her liver.

215
0:10:47.945,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Today, this morning, we found out that she has stage IV liver cancer.

216
0:10:51.961,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Audience gasps)

217
0:11:00.493,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It has been a challenging week.

218
0:11:03.271,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It has been a challenging week.

219
0:11:04.89,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And if I may, I just want to take a moment

220
0:11:07.569,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to acknowledge the TED staff, everyone, top-down,

221
0:11:10.744,000 --> 0:11:13,000
everyone in the back, in the green room, some of the speakers, word has spread.

222
0:11:14.569,000 --> 0:11:15,000
On behalf of my family, my wife,

223
0:11:16.498,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and my parents -- my Pakistani parents said I had to say this --

224
0:11:19.537,000 --> 0:11:21,000
thank you for just being decent and kind this week.

225
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So thank you.

226
0:11:23.57,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

227
0:11:31.109,000 --> 0:11:35,000
These are my beloveds, my Ibrahim and Nusayba, my babies.

228
0:11:36.01,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I talked to my wife,

229
0:11:37.836,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and despite the terrible news and the fight ahead,

230
0:11:40.225,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we both concluded that we regret nothing.

231
0:11:45.625,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Deciding to have babies was the best decision we ever made.

232
0:11:50.601,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Our babies have brought us so much joy and they've brought the world so much joy,

233
0:11:54.633,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and having kids is a risk, but life is a risk.

234
0:11:58.339,000 --> 0:12:,000
And yes, I hope you've been paying attention,

235
0:12:00.482,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we need to invest in babies in developed countries

236
0:12:02.847,000 --> 0:12:04,000
if we want to help save our economy and pensions.

237
0:12:05.18,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But that's not the reason you have babies.

238
0:12:07.212,000 --> 0:12:08,000
That's not the main reason.

239
0:12:09.014,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Babies have always represented

240
0:12:10.942,000 --> 0:12:14,000
humanity's best, boldest, most beautiful infinite possibilities.

241
0:12:16.435,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And if we in developed countries,

242
0:12:18.212,000 --> 0:12:2,000
as a whole, opt out,

243
0:12:20.839,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and don't invest in present and future generations,

244
0:12:23.252,000 --> 0:12:24,000
then what the hell's the point?

245
0:12:25.18,000 --> 0:12:28,000
What's the point of being on this absurd journey together?

246
0:12:29.823,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And so, for those who can and who choose to,

247
0:12:34.165,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for those who can and who choose to have kids,

248
0:12:38.038,000 --> 0:12:42,000
may you pass on this beautiful thing called life,

249
0:12:42.667,000 --> 0:12:45,000
with kindness, generosity,

250
0:12:46.437,000 --> 0:12:48,000
decency and love.

251
0:12:50.604,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Thank you.

252
0:12:51.778,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

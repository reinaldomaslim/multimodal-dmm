1
0:00:15.807,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This room may appear to be holding 600 people,

2
0:00:19.547,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but there's actually so many more,

3
0:00:21.489,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because within each one of us, there is a multitude of personalities.

4
0:00:26.735,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I have two primary personalities

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that have been in conflict and conversation within me

6
0:00:32.187,000 --> 0:00:33,000
since I was a little girl.

7
0:00:33.736,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I call them "the mystic" and "the warrior."

8
0:00:37.65,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was born into a family of politically active intellectual atheists.

9
0:00:43.487,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There was this equation in my family that went something like this:

10
0:00:46.705,000 --> 0:00:48,000
if you are intelligent,

11
0:00:48.856,000 --> 0:00:5,000
you therefore are not spiritual.

12
0:00:51.542,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was the freak of the family.

13
0:00:53.86,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was this weird little kid

14
0:00:55.86,000 --> 0:00:59,000
who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist

15
0:01:00.553,000 --> 0:01:03,000
beyond the ones we perceive with our senses.

16
0:01:03.997,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I wanted to know

17
0:01:05.181,000 --> 0:01:1,000
if what we human beings see and hear and think

18
0:01:10.357,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is a full and accurate picture of reality.

19
0:01:14.484,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So, looking for answers,

20
0:01:16.255,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I went to Catholic mass; I tagged along with my neighbors.

21
0:01:20.332,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I read Sartre and Socrates.

22
0:01:23.123,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school:

23
0:01:26.629,000 --> 0:01:3,000
gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America.

24
0:01:31.38,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:32.427,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I said to myself, "I wanna get me one of them."

26
0:01:34.944,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:36.234,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And ever since, I've been walking the mystic path,

28
0:01:40.616,000 --> 0:01:44,000
trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called

29
0:01:44.984,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the "optical delusion" of everyday consciousness.

30
0:01:49.706,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So what did he mean by this?

31
0:01:51.219,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I'll show you.

32
0:01:52.401,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room.

33
0:01:58.622,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, see this strange,

34
0:02:01.534,000 --> 0:02:06,000
underwater-coral-reef-looking thing?

35
0:02:06.741,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It's actually a person's trachea.

36
0:02:09.935,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And those colored globs are microbes

37
0:02:13.295,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that are actually swimming around in this room right now,

38
0:02:16.444,000 --> 0:02:17,000
all around us.

39
0:02:18.359,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If we're blind to this simple biology,

40
0:02:21.993,000 --> 0:02:27,000
imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now

41
0:02:28.071,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and at the grandest cosmic levels.

42
0:02:30.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions.

43
0:02:37.334,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They've made me a proud "I-don't-know-it-all."

44
0:02:41.344,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this,

45
0:02:45.751,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the warrior rolls her eyes.

46
0:02:48.624,000 --> 0:02:54,000
She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now.

47
0:02:55.264,000 --> 0:02:57,000
She's worried.

48
0:02:57.653,000 --> 0:02:59,000
She says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off,

49
0:03:00.654,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I know a few things,

50
0:03:02.419,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and we better get busy about them right now."

51
0:03:04.931,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I've spent my life as a warrior,

52
0:03:06.86,000 --> 0:03:08,000
working for women's issues,

53
0:03:09.066,000 --> 0:03:11,000
working on political campaigns,

54
0:03:11.431,000 --> 0:03:14,000
being an activist for the environment.

55
0:03:15.183,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And it can be sort of crazymaking,

56
0:03:17.851,000 --> 0:03:21,000
housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body.

57
0:03:21.898,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I've always been attracted to those rare people

58
0:03:26.391,000 --> 0:03:27,000
who pull that off,

59
0:03:27.704,000 --> 0:03:3,000
who devote their lives to humanity

60
0:03:30.762,000 --> 0:03:35,000
with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic --

61
0:03:36.159,000 --> 0:03:38,000
people like Martin Luther King, Jr.,

62
0:03:39.178,000 --> 0:03:43,000
who wrote, "I can never be what I ought to be

63
0:03:43.322,000 --> 0:03:46,000
until you are what you ought to be."

64
0:03:46.478,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"This," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure of reality."

65
0:03:51.621,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior, who said,

66
0:03:56.088,000 --> 0:04:,000
"The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family

67
0:04:00.407,000 --> 0:04:01,000
too small."

68
0:04:02.621,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And Nelson Mandela, who lives by the African concept of "ubuntu,"

69
0:04:08.185,000 --> 0:04:12,000
which means "I need you in order to be me,

70
0:04:12.377,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and you need me in order to be you."

71
0:04:15.976,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now, we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors

72
0:04:20.784,000 --> 0:04:22,000
as if they were born with a "saint" gene.

73
0:04:23.372,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But we all actually have the same capacity that they do.

74
0:04:28.558,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And we need to do their work now.

75
0:04:32.775,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I'm deeply disturbed

76
0:04:34.536,000 --> 0:04:4,000
by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing "the other,"

77
0:04:40.91,000 --> 0:04:44,000
by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us.

78
0:04:45.284,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Listen to these titles of some of the best-selling books

79
0:04:49.402,000 --> 0:04:51,000
from both sides of the political divide

80
0:04:51.626,000 --> 0:04:52,000
here in the US:

81
0:04:53.307,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"Liberalism is a Mental Disorder,"

82
0:04:56.775,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot,"

83
0:04:59.553,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"Pinheads and Patriots,"

84
0:05:02.507,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"Arguing with Idiots."

85
0:05:04.101,000 --> 0:05:06,000
They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek,

86
0:05:06.565,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but they're actually dangerous.

87
0:05:09.366,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now here's a title that may sound familiar,

88
0:05:11.493,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but whose author may surprise you:

89
0:05:14.558,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies,

90
0:05:17.542,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Stupidity and Cowardice."

91
0:05:20.583,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Who wrote that?

92
0:05:21.981,000 --> 0:05:26,000
That was Adolf Hitler's first title for "Mein Kampf" -- "My Struggle" --

93
0:05:27.099,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the book that launched the Nazi Party.

94
0:05:30.653,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The worst eras in human history,

95
0:05:32.86,000 --> 0:05:35,000
whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda --

96
0:05:36.6,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they start like this, with negative otherizing.

97
0:05:40.22,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And then they morph into violent extremism.

98
0:05:44.424,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is why I'm launching a new initiative.

99
0:05:47.653,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And it's to help all of us, myself included,

100
0:05:52.038,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to counteract the tendency to otherize.

101
0:05:56.86,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I realize we're all busy people,

102
0:05:59.239,000 --> 0:06:02,000
so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.

103
0:06:02.461,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I'm calling my initiative "Take the Other to Lunch."

104
0:06:07.407,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If you are a Republican,

105
0:06:12.257,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you can take a Democrat to lunch.

106
0:06:14.729,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Or if you're a Democrat,

107
0:06:17.801,000 --> 0:06:2,000
think of it as taking a Republican to lunch.

108
0:06:21.7,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Now, if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch

109
0:06:24.578,000 --> 0:06:25,000
makes you lose your appetite,

110
0:06:26.384,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:27.665,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I suggest you start more local,

112
0:06:30.261,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because there is no shortage of the other right in your own neighborhood:

113
0:06:36.144,000 --> 0:06:4,000
maybe that person who worships at the mosque

114
0:06:40.551,000 --> 0:06:43,000
or the church or the synagogue down the street;

115
0:06:43.701,000 --> 0:06:48,000
or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict;

116
0:06:48.86,000 --> 0:06:51,000
or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn't believe in global warming --

117
0:06:52.578,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:53.642,000 --> 0:06:57,000
anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you

119
0:06:58.024,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears.

120
0:07:04.534,000 --> 0:07:05,000
A couple of weeks ago,

121
0:07:06.352,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I took a conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.

122
0:07:11.415,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Now, on paper, she passed my "smoking ears" test:

123
0:07:14.704,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

124
0:07:15.759,000 --> 0:07:17,000
she's an activist from the Right,

125
0:07:17.959,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and I'm an activist from the Left.

126
0:07:21.256,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated.

127
0:07:26.091,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And you can use them, too,

128
0:07:27.966,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because I know you're all going to take an other to lunch.

129
0:07:31.932,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So first of all, decide on a goal:

130
0:07:34.529,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped.

131
0:07:41.732,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And then, before you get together,

132
0:07:43.649,000 --> 0:07:45,000
agree on some ground rules.

133
0:07:45.945,000 --> 0:07:49,000
My Tea Party lunch mate and I came up with these:

134
0:07:51.076,000 --> 0:07:54,000
"Don't persuade, defend or interrupt;

135
0:07:54.635,000 --> 0:07:58,000
be curious, be conversational, be real;

136
0:07:58.93,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and listen."

137
0:08:01.214,000 --> 0:08:04,000
From there, we dove in, and we used these questions:

138
0:08:04.98,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"Share some of your life experiences with me --

139
0:08:07.991,000 --> 0:08:1,000
what issues deeply concern you?

140
0:08:11.86,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side?"

141
0:08:16.757,000 --> 0:08:2,000
My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights,

142
0:08:21.317,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and I'm going to share just one with you.

143
0:08:23.319,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere.

144
0:08:29.86,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies

145
0:08:36.172,000 --> 0:08:37,000
about my side.

146
0:08:37.825,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"What?" she wanted to know.

147
0:08:39.929,000 --> 0:08:45,000
"Like, we're a bunch of elitist, morally corrupt terrorist-lovers."

148
0:08:45.983,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Well, she was shocked.

149
0:08:47.64,000 --> 0:08:52,000
She thought my side beat up on her side way more often --

150
0:08:53.004,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that we called them brainless, gun-toting racists.

151
0:08:57.919,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And we both marveled at the labels

152
0:09:00.405,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that fit none of the people we actually know.

153
0:09:05.423,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And since we had established some trust,

154
0:09:07.804,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we believed in each other's sincerity.

155
0:09:11.447,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities

156
0:09:14.963,000 --> 0:09:17,000
when we witnessed the kind of "otherizing" talk

157
0:09:18.697,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that can wound and fester into paranoia

158
0:09:23.006,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and then be used by those on the fringes

159
0:09:25.695,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to incite.

160
0:09:28.005,000 --> 0:09:31,000
By the end of our lunch, we acknowledged each other's openness.

161
0:09:31.409,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Neither of us had tried to change the other,

162
0:09:34.984,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but we also hadn't pretended

163
0:09:37.208,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that our differences were just going to melt away

164
0:09:40.737,000 --> 0:09:41,000
after a lunch.

165
0:09:45.961,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Instead, we had taken first steps together,

166
0:09:50.204,000 --> 0:09:51,000
past our knee-jerk reactions

167
0:09:52.026,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to the ubuntu place,

168
0:09:53.795,000 --> 0:09:55,000
which is the only place

169
0:09:56.045,000 --> 0:10:02,000
where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems

170
0:10:02.165,000 --> 0:10:03,000
will be found.

171
0:10:04.035,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So who should you invite to lunch?

172
0:10:06.571,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing,

173
0:10:10.409,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that'll be your clue.

174
0:10:12.534,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And what might happen at your lunch?

175
0:10:15.175,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Will the heavens open

176
0:10:16.598,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and "We are the World" play over the restaurant sound system?

177
0:10:20.484,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Probably not.

178
0:10:22.65,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Because ubuntu work is slow, and it's difficult.

179
0:10:26.384,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's two people dropping the pretense of being know-it-alls.

180
0:10:32.474,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's two people, two warriors, dropping their weapons

181
0:10:38.221,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and reaching toward each other.

182
0:10:41.462,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it:

183
0:10:46.19,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"Out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing,

184
0:10:51.699,000 --> 0:10:52,000
there is a field.

185
0:10:53.584,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I'll meet you there."

186
0:10:56.035,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

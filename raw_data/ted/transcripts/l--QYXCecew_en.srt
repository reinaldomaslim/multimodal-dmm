1
0:00:13.54,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In 2001, I was a brand new, shiny doctor, planning to save the world.

2
0:00:19.563,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My first job was working for three months on a lung cancer unit.

3
0:00:24.241,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Nearly all of my patients were smokers or ex-smokers,

4
0:00:27.661,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and most of them had started smoking when they were children

5
0:00:31.201,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or in their early teens.

6
0:00:33.427,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And despite living in a beautiful, wealthy country,

7
0:00:37.038,000 --> 0:00:4,000
with access to the most sophisticated medicines,

8
0:00:40.8,000 --> 0:00:43,000
nearly every single one of my patients died.

9
0:00:44.331,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Everyone knows tobacco is bad,

10
0:00:46.3,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but when you see the impact firsthand, day-by-day,

11
0:00:49.379,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it leaves a very deep impression.

12
0:00:52.895,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Ten years later, I'm a radiation oncologist,

13
0:00:56.196,000 --> 0:00:59,000
fully aware of the suffering caused by tobacco.

14
0:00:59.99,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'm sitting at the hospital cafeteria, having my first ever meeting

15
0:01:04.013,000 --> 0:01:07,000
with a representative from my superannuation fund.

16
0:01:07.109,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It was thrilling, I'm sure you can imagine.

17
0:01:09.204,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:10.768,000 --> 0:01:12,000
He tells me I'm in the default option.

19
0:01:13.403,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I said, "Option? Does that mean there are other options?"

20
0:01:16.584,000 --> 0:01:19,000
He looked at me, rolled his eyes, and said,

21
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"Well, there is this one greenie option

22
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
for people who have a problem with investing in mining, alcohol or tobacco."

23
0:01:29.307,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I said, "Did you just say tobacco?"

24
0:01:31.03,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He said, "Yes."

25
0:01:32.673,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I said, "So, are you telling me I'm currently investing in tobacco?"

26
0:01:36.141,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And he said, "Oh, yes, everyone is."

27
0:01:40.292,000 --> 0:01:43,000
When you invest in a company, you own part of that company.

28
0:01:44.589,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You want that company to grow and succeed and thrive.

29
0:01:48.073,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You want that company to attract new customers,

30
0:01:50.589,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you want that company to sell more of its products.

31
0:01:54.046,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And when it comes to tobacco,

32
0:01:55.625,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I couldn't think of anything that I wanted less.

33
0:01:59.846,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now, I know you can only see one person standing here

34
0:02:02.379,000 --> 0:02:05,000
on this big red dot, on this enormous stage.

35
0:02:05.942,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But instead, I would like you to imagine

36
0:02:09.942,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that you're looking at seven million people

37
0:02:13.538,000 --> 0:02:16,000
crammed up here beside me today.

38
0:02:17.538,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Seven million people across the world have died as a result of tobacco

39
0:02:24.315,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the past year alone.

40
0:02:27.776,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Just imagine, if a brand new industry were launched today,

41
0:02:30.626,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and by the end of next June,

42
0:02:32.11,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that industry's products had killed seven million people.

43
0:02:37.539,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Would any of us invest in that new, deadly industry?

44
0:02:43.186,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Tobacco is one of the most pressing global issues of our time,

45
0:02:47.289,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and most of us are far more complicit in the problem than we may realize.

46
0:02:53.42,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, the super fund representative explained to me

47
0:02:55.929,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that tobacco companies would be found

48
0:02:57.921,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in the international shares portion of my portfolio.

49
0:03:02.386,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So I asked him, "Well, which international shares do I have?"

50
0:03:06.22,000 --> 0:03:09,000
He got back to me two weeks later with this list:

51
0:03:09.292,000 --> 0:03:12,000
my number one holding in international shares

52
0:03:13.202,000 --> 0:03:14,000
was British American Tobacco.

53
0:03:15.805,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Number two, Imperial Tobacco.

54
0:03:18.575,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Number four, Philip Morris.

55
0:03:21.165,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And number five, the Swedish Match company.

56
0:03:23.91,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Four of the top five companies were tobacco companies,

57
0:03:26.633,000 --> 0:03:28,000
my investments, an oncologist.

58
0:03:29.458,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And then I realized it wasn't just me.

59
0:03:31.784,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It was all members of my super fund.

60
0:03:34.125,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And then I realized it wasn't just my super fund, it was all of them.

61
0:03:37.402,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And then I realized, it wasn't just superannuation funds,

62
0:03:40.11,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it was banks, insurers and fund managers.

63
0:03:43.228,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And then I realized it wasn't just Australia.

64
0:03:46.125,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It was the entire global finance sector,

65
0:03:49.061,000 --> 0:03:51,000
completely tangled up with the tobacco industry.

66
0:03:51.72,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The industry that makes products that kill seven million people every year.

67
0:03:57.475,000 --> 0:04:,000
So I started discussing the issue with my superannuation fund,

68
0:04:00.666,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and I've been discussing it ever since.

69
0:04:03.125,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Finance leaders have many challenging issues to deal with, these days.

70
0:04:06.887,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So I suggest they adopt a framework

71
0:04:09.712,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that clearly articulates why it is reasonable

72
0:04:12.855,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to take a strong position on tobacco.

73
0:04:15.847,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I suggest finance leaders ask a suite of three questions

74
0:04:20.473,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of any company in which they might invest our money.

75
0:04:24.465,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Question one:

76
0:04:26.013,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Can the product made by the company be used safely?

77
0:04:31.156,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"No" is the answer for tobacco companies.

78
0:04:34.06,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Zero is the only safe number of cigarettes for a human being.

79
0:04:37.506,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It could not be more black and white.

80
0:04:40.291,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Question two:

81
0:04:41.839,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Is the problem caused by the company so significant on a global level

82
0:04:46.911,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that it is subject to a UN treaty or convention?

83
0:04:50.974,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"Yes" is the answer for tobacco.

84
0:04:53.117,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Indeed there is a UN tobacco treaty

85
0:04:56.125,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that has been ratified by 180 countries.

86
0:05:00.215,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The treaty was created

87
0:05:01.946,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because of the catastrophic global impact of tobacco.

88
0:05:06.192,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The current forecast is that the world is on track

89
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
for one billion tobacco-related deaths this century.

90
0:05:15.292,000 --> 0:05:16,000
One billion deaths.

91
0:05:16.998,000 --> 0:05:18,000
There's only seven billion of us.

92
0:05:20.085,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Question three relates to the concept of engagement.

93
0:05:24.355,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Many financial organizations genuinely want to be good corporate citizens.

94
0:05:28.577,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They want to use their shareholder power

95
0:05:31.347,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to sit down with companies, engage with them,

96
0:05:33.681,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and encourage them to do better things.

97
0:05:35.831,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So the question is:

98
0:05:37.411,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Can engagement with the company be an effective lever for change?

99
0:05:43.026,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"No" is the answer for tobacco companies.

100
0:05:46.153,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Engagement with the tobacco industry is futile.

101
0:05:49.157,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The only acceptable outcome would be

102
0:05:50.959,000 --> 0:05:53,000
if tobacco companies ceased their primary business.

103
0:05:54.712,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In fact, engagement with the tobacco industry

104
0:05:57.416,000 --> 0:06:,000
has never led to less human death.

105
0:06:02.387,000 --> 0:06:05,000
When we consider that framework, three simple questions,

106
0:06:05.688,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we can see that is reasonable and defensible

107
0:06:09.117,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to take a strong position and exclude investment in the tobacco industry.

108
0:06:15.663,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In addition to the UN tobacco treaty,

109
0:06:18.052,000 --> 0:06:22,000
there is, in fact, another global treaty that demands that we act on tobacco.

110
0:06:22.972,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In 2015, the UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals.

111
0:06:28.069,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now, we're talking about tobacco,

112
0:06:29.728,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and I know you're going to jump straight to number three:

113
0:06:32.491,000 --> 0:06:33,000
good health and well-being.

114
0:06:33.831,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And indeed, ramping up tobacco control regulation

115
0:06:36.168,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is essential if we're going to achieve that goal.

116
0:06:38.543,000 --> 0:06:4,000
However, look a bit more deeply,

117
0:06:40.903,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and you will find that 13 of the 17 goals cannot be achieved

118
0:06:45.958,000 --> 0:06:48,000
unless there is a major shake-up of the tobacco industry.

119
0:06:50.323,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Personally, my favorite goal is number 17:

120
0:06:53.336,000 --> 0:06:54,000
partnerships for the goals.

121
0:06:55.478,000 --> 0:07:,000
At present, we have the entire global health sector doing everything it can

122
0:07:01.184,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to help the tidal wave of patients suffering as a result of tobacco.

123
0:07:05.45,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But that said, in the past year alone, seven million people have died,

124
0:07:08.776,000 --> 0:07:09,000
so clearly, that is not enough.

125
0:07:11.323,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We also have governments aligned on tobacco, 180 of them,

126
0:07:14.911,000 --> 0:07:17,000
busily trying to implement the provisions of the UN tobacco treaty.

127
0:07:18.934,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But that, too, is not enough.

128
0:07:22.038,000 --> 0:07:28,000
If the global finance sector continues to lend money to tobacco companies,

129
0:07:28.363,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to invest in tobacco companies,

130
0:07:30.744,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and to strive to profit from tobacco companies,

131
0:07:33.76,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we are working against each other.

132
0:07:36.411,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, if we are going to disrupt

133
0:07:38.823,000 --> 0:07:41,000
what doctors call "the global tobacco epidemic,"

134
0:07:42.546,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we need every sector of society to stand side by side

135
0:07:46.688,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and be part of the solution.

136
0:07:49.385,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So I call on finance leaders

137
0:07:51.655,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to implement a framework to deal with sensitive issues.

138
0:07:55.409,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I call on them to uphold global conventions.

139
0:07:59.307,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But in addition, there are business risks.

140
0:08:02.022,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Pure financial risks, associated with being invested in the tobacco industry

141
0:08:06.744,000 --> 0:08:07,000
over the long term,

142
0:08:08.18,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and I ask finance leaders to consider them.

143
0:08:12.006,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The first risk is that fewer and fewer people will smoke,

144
0:08:16.121,000 --> 0:08:19,000
as a result of increasing tobacco regulation.

145
0:08:19.891,000 --> 0:08:22,000
When these warnings were put on cigarette packets in Canada,

146
0:08:23.61,000 --> 0:08:24,000
[Tobacco can make you impotent]

147
0:08:25.196,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the first response of smokers was to give them right back to the salespeople

148
0:08:28.898,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and say, "Could you please just give me the ones that say they'll kill me?"

149
0:08:32.505,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

150
0:08:34.082,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Regulation gets noticed, regulation reduces consumption,

151
0:08:37.843,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and we have 180 countries committed to more regulation.

152
0:08:43.061,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Let's talk about litigation and the risk that presents.

153
0:08:46.664,000 --> 0:08:5,000
At present, it's the business model of the tobacco industry

154
0:08:50.831,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that is being challenged.

155
0:08:53.133,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Currently, the tobacco industry externalizes all of the health costs

156
0:08:58.08,000 --> 0:08:59,000
associated with tobacco.

157
0:09:00.326,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Governments pay, communities pay, you pay, I pay.

158
0:09:04.222,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The tobacco industry externalizes all those costs,

159
0:09:08.273,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with an estimated one trillion US dollars per year.

160
0:09:12.527,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Yet they internalize and privatize the profits.

161
0:09:16.614,000 --> 0:09:18,000
In 2015, in Quebec province,

162
0:09:19.544,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the courts determined that the tobacco industry

163
0:09:21.775,000 --> 0:09:23,000
was indeed responsible for those health costs,

164
0:09:24.599,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and ordered them to pay 15 billion US dollars.

165
0:09:27.457,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That case is under appeal.

166
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But it begs the question, why should any of us, in any country,

167
0:09:35.403,000 --> 0:09:38,000
be paying for the costs of the tobacco industry?

168
0:09:40.301,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Let's move on to supply chain and the risk there.

169
0:09:44.086,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It is not well known

170
0:09:45.983,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that the tobacco industry significantly relies on child labor.

171
0:09:53.394,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In March 2017, the International Labour Organization

172
0:09:56.792,000 --> 0:09:58,000
issued a report which stated:

173
0:09:59.602,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"In tobacco-growing communities, child labor is rampant."

174
0:10:05.499,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The US Department of Labor

175
0:10:07.015,000 --> 0:10:13,000
currently lists 16 countries that use children to produce tobacco leaf.

176
0:10:14.155,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Scrutiny of supply chains is intensifying,

177
0:10:16.647,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and that cannot continue to escape public attention.

178
0:10:20.218,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Finally, there is also reputation risk to consider

179
0:10:23.419,000 --> 0:10:27,000
for individuals and organizations that continue to maintain an affiliation

180
0:10:28.434,000 --> 0:10:29,000
with the tobacco industry.

181
0:10:29.966,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In countless surveys,

182
0:10:31.711,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the tobacco industry ranks as the world's least reputable industry.

183
0:10:36.64,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Let's just look at the impact on children.

184
0:10:39.355,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Globally, every single day,

185
0:10:43.007,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it is estimated that 100,000 children start smoking.

186
0:10:48.807,000 --> 0:10:51,000
That's enough children to fit inside the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

187
0:10:53.188,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And most of those children are from the poorest communities on earth.

188
0:10:57.252,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Here in Australia, the average age that people start smoking

189
0:11:01.974,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is 16 years and two months.

190
0:11:05.338,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They look pretty young to me, but the worst thing here

191
0:11:07.903,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is that while we don't have data from every country on earth,

192
0:11:10.815,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we believe that is the oldest age.

193
0:11:13.427,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Everywhere else is younger.

194
0:11:16.76,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now for the good news.

195
0:11:18.593,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Things are changing.

196
0:11:19.926,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The finance sector is coming to the party.

197
0:11:22.974,000 --> 0:11:25,000
After around 2,000 meetings with finance leaders,

198
0:11:26.236,000 --> 0:11:28,000
primarily in the cafés of Melbourne and Sydney

199
0:11:28.8,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and London and Paris and New York and all across the globe,

200
0:11:32.331,000 --> 0:11:35,000
momentum, moving away from investment in the tobacco industry,

201
0:11:36.326,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is starting to snowball.

202
0:11:38.095,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Finance leaders are alarmed when they're presented with the facts,

203
0:11:41.31,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and overwhelmingly, they want to be part of the solution.

204
0:11:45.357,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Here, in Australia, we now have

205
0:11:48.371,000 --> 0:11:54,000
10,636,101 superannuation accounts

206
0:11:55.046,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that are tobacco-free.

207
0:11:56.41,000 --> 0:11:57,000
That one is mine, by the way.

208
0:11:58.162,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Applause)

209
0:12:05.101,000 --> 0:12:06,000
There is still a lot of work to be done,

210
0:12:07.038,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but I've watched the conversation go from "Should we go tobacco-free?"

211
0:12:10.68,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to "Why haven't we done it yet?"

212
0:12:13.174,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In the past year alone,

213
0:12:14.412,000 --> 0:12:18,000
major tobacco-free moves have been made by leading financial organizations

214
0:12:18.69,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in eight different countries.

215
0:12:20.809,000 --> 0:12:23,000
In Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden,

216
0:12:23.871,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Denmark, France, Ireland and the USA.

217
0:12:26.958,000 --> 0:12:29,000
By sovereign wealth funds, fund managers, pension funds,

218
0:12:30.284,000 --> 0:12:32,000
banks, insurers and reinsurers.

219
0:12:32.609,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Since tobacco-free portfolios began,

220
0:12:34.768,000 --> 0:12:37,000
more than six billion dollars has been redirected

221
0:12:38.17,000 --> 0:12:41,000
away from investment in the tobacco industry.

222
0:12:41.331,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The case study is well and truly proven.

223
0:12:45.069,000 --> 0:12:48,000
When making the tobacco-free announcement in March this year,

224
0:12:48.196,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the CEO of AMP Capital said,

225
0:12:51.093,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"We are not prepared to deliver investment returns

226
0:12:54.823,000 --> 0:12:56,000
at any cost to society."

227
0:12:58.117,000 --> 0:13:,000
And that is the question we need to ask ourselves.

228
0:13:01.03,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Is there no baseline standard below which we will not sink

229
0:13:05.736,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to make profit?

230
0:13:08.363,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Along the way, I've had a lot of help and incredible support.

231
0:13:11.355,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Now, if you're trying to do something,

232
0:13:13.212,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I highly recommend that you have a princess on your team.

233
0:13:16.871,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Her Royal Highness, Princess Dina Mired,

234
0:13:19.196,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is the global ambassador for this work.

235
0:13:22.061,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We also have a lord, a knight, a former premier,

236
0:13:24.936,000 --> 0:13:27,000
a former federal minister and a stack of CEOs.

237
0:13:28.373,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But the capacity to change things

238
0:13:30.54,000 --> 0:13:33,000
does not rest exclusively with these highly influential people.

239
0:13:34.992,000 --> 0:13:37,000
The power to do that is with all of us.

240
0:13:38.696,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Everyone here can be part of the solution.

241
0:13:41.363,000 --> 0:13:44,000
In fact, everyone here must be part of the solution.

242
0:13:45.809,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Most people in this room own companies

243
0:13:49.88,000 --> 0:13:53,000
via their superannuation funds, their banks and their insurers.

244
0:13:54.483,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And it is time for us to ask them:

245
0:13:57.297,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Are they investing our money in companies that make products

246
0:14:01.573,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that kill seven million people every year?

247
0:14:04.342,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's your money.

248
0:14:05.636,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It's my money, it's our money.

249
0:14:07.347,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And that is a very reasonable question.

250
0:14:11.379,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Pretty cramped up here,

251
0:14:13.824,000 --> 0:14:15,000
with seven million people beside me today.

252
0:14:16.823,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But if we don't act now, and act together,

253
0:14:20.116,000 --> 0:14:23,000
we'll need to make way for one billion people

254
0:14:23.52,000 --> 0:14:25,000
before the end of this century.

255
0:14:25.96,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And this is a very big stage.

256
0:14:28.841,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But there is no more room.

257
0:14:30.825,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Thank you.

258
0:14:32.016,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

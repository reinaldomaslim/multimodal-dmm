1
0:00:16.09,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Non English)

2
0:00:39.972,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(French) Mais Des fois on peut voir parce Que Les gens

3
0:00:44.224,000 --> 0:00:46,000
ici faire Des choses on peut manger.

4
0:00:46.997,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(French) Mais quand tu es fâché avec quelqu'un

5
0:00:50.553,000 --> 0:00:51,000
c'est pas passé the first time.

6
0:00:52.445,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(British English) And that's one of the things that I enjoy most

7
0:00:55.738,000 --> 0:00:57,000
about this convention.

8
0:00:59.223,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's not so much, as so little has to do with what everything is.

9
0:01:06.288,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

10
0:01:09.988,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But it is within our self-interest

11
0:01:12.122,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to understand the topography of our lives

12
0:01:15.076,000 --> 0:01:16,000
unto ourselves.

13
0:01:16.856,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

14
0:01:21.135,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The future states that there is no time

15
0:01:25.219,000 --> 0:01:28,000
other than the collapsation of that sensation

16
0:01:28.545,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of the mirror of the memories in which we are living.

17
0:01:31.191,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:34.567,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Common knowledge,

19
0:01:36.428,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but important nonetheless.

20
0:01:37.968,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:41.382,000 --> 0:01:43,000
As we face fear in these times,

22
0:01:43.74,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and fear is all around us,

23
0:01:45.774,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we also have anti-fear.

24
0:01:48.345,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's hard to imagine or measure.

25
0:01:50.846,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The background radiation is simply too static

26
0:01:53.966,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis.

27
0:01:58.189,000 --> 0:02:,000
(American accent) But we feel as though there are times

28
0:02:01.053,000 --> 0:02:03,000
when a lot of us -- you know what I'm saying?

29
0:02:03.53,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But -- you know what I'm saying?

30
0:02:05.398,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Because, as a hip hop thing, you know what I'm saying,

31
0:02:07.961,000 --> 0:02:09,000
TED be rocking -- you know what I'm saying.

32
0:02:10.246,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Like so I wrote a song,

33
0:02:13.172,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I hope you guys dig it.

34
0:02:15.274,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's a song about people

35
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and sasquatches --

36
0:02:19.297,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:22.575,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And other French science stuff.

38
0:02:25.06,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That's French science.

39
0:02:26.147,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Okay, here we go.

40
0:02:30.25,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Singing) I've been trying inside

41
0:02:37.199,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I know that I'm in trouble

42
0:02:42.905,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:44.239,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that I'm in trouble

44
0:02:50.185,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by myself

45
0:02:54.373,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But every time it gets me

46
0:02:58.039,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Vocalization)

47
0:03:08.443,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Beatbox)

48
0:03:38.449,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Singing) And I've been trying to be the one that you believe in

49
0:03:43.95,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And you're the one that I want to be so saucy

50
0:03:49.166,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And you're the one I want to [unclear], baby

51
0:03:53.981,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And you can do anything

52
0:03:56.446,000 --> 0:03:58,000
as long as you don't get hurt along the way back

53
0:03:59.319,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Beatbox)

54
0:04:00.699,000 --> 0:04:03,000
If I survive, I'm going to tell you what is wrong

55
0:04:05.46,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because if you were [unclear]

56
0:04:10.328,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I think that you're looking like a [unclear]

57
0:04:16.082,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I give you what I want to be

58
0:04:21.366,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Music)

59
0:04:34.829,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Music ends abruptly)

60
0:04:36.504,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(British accent) And it's like,

61
0:04:38.48,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you could use as many of those things that you want.

62
0:04:41.346,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Applause)

63
0:04:45.792,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the computer models,

64
0:04:47.434,000 --> 0:04:48,000
no matter how many that you have

65
0:04:48.992,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and how many people that you use,

66
0:04:50.588,000 --> 0:04:52,000
are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions.

67
0:04:54.372,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute,

68
0:04:58.028,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I arrived at a conclusion.

69
0:05:00.146,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

70
0:05:07.604,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Tomorrow is another day.

71
0:05:09.246,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

72
0:05:11.962,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Not just any day,

73
0:05:13.685,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but it is a day.

74
0:05:15.84,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It will get here, there's no question.

75
0:05:19.613,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And the important thing to remember

76
0:05:21.716,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is that this simulation is a good one.

77
0:05:25.422,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's believable, it's tactile.

78
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You can reach out -- things are solid.

79
0:05:29.905,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You can move objects from one area to another.

80
0:05:33.126,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You can feel your body.

81
0:05:34.688,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You can say, "I'd like to go over to this location,"

82
0:05:37.166,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and you can move this mass of molecules through the air

83
0:05:40.401,000 --> 0:05:41,000
over to another location, at will.

84
0:05:42.691,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

85
0:05:45.861,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's something you live inside of every day.

86
0:05:50.229,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now with the allocation and the understanding

87
0:05:53.056,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of the lack of understanding,

88
0:05:54.53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we enter into a new era of science

89
0:05:57.121,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in which we feel nothing more

90
0:05:59.757,000 --> 0:06:01,000
than so much so as to say

91
0:06:02.01,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that those within themselves,

92
0:06:04.136,000 --> 0:06:07,000
comporary or non-comporary,

93
0:06:07.248,000 --> 0:06:08,000
will figuratively figure

94
0:06:08.773,000 --> 0:06:11,000
into the folding of our non-understanding

95
0:06:12.021,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and our partial understanding

96
0:06:13.882,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to the networks of which we all draw our source

97
0:06:17.169,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and conclusions from.

98
0:06:18.491,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

99
0:06:20.058,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So, as I say before the last piece,

100
0:06:25.132,000 --> 0:06:28,000
feel not as though it is a sphere we live on,

101
0:06:28.561,000 --> 0:06:32,000
rather an infinite plane which has the illusion

102
0:06:32.633,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of leading yourself back to the point of origin.

103
0:06:35.317,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:36.674,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky

105
0:06:39.033,000 --> 0:06:41,000
are just large infinite planes,

106
0:06:41.126,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it will be plain to see.

107
0:06:42.572,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

108
0:06:43.597,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Audience) (Laughter)

109
0:06:45.73,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is my final piece.

110
0:06:47.619,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And just remember,

111
0:06:49.212,000 --> 0:06:5,000
everything you are --

112
0:06:51.082,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it's more important to realize the negative space,

113
0:06:55.852,000 --> 0:06:57,000
as music is only the division of space;

114
0:06:58.758,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it is the space we are listening to divided as such,

115
0:07:01.79,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which gives us the information in comparison to something other

116
0:07:05.419,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted

117
0:07:09.161,000 --> 0:07:1,000
wants to be.

118
0:07:10.235,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So please, without further ado.

119
0:07:11.877,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Applause)

120
0:07:13.941,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Thank you.

121
0:07:15.041,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause)

122
0:07:19.299,000 --> 0:07:2,000
This is a fun one.

123
0:07:21.117,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It goes like this.

124
0:07:22.155,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Beatbox)

125
0:07:29.172,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Gibberish)

126
0:07:47.018,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Music ends)

127
0:07:48.565,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Okay, for the last piece I'd like to do,

128
0:07:50.74,000 --> 0:07:52,000
this one goes very similar to this.

129
0:07:53.19,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I hope you guys recognize it.

130
0:07:54.615,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Here we go.

131
0:08:00.693,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Okay, that still works. Okay, good.

132
0:08:03.056,000 --> 0:08:04,000
All right, here we go.

133
0:08:04.134,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Laughter)

134
0:08:07.566,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Beatbox)

135
0:08:19.001,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Here we go.

136
0:08:20.24,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Beatbox)

137
0:08:28.597,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Yeah, yo, yo, yo

138
0:08:32.246,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Gibberish)

139
0:09:18.809,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Music fades out)

140
0:09:20.714,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Thank you. Enjoy the rest.

141
0:09:22.477,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Applause)

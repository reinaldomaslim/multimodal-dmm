1
0:00:18.96,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Now...

2
0:00:21.2,000 --> 0:00:23,000
let's go back in time.

3
0:00:24.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's 1974.

4
0:00:29.96,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There is the gallery somewhere

5
0:00:33.88,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in the world,

6
0:00:37.08,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and there is a young girl, age 23,

7
0:00:40.4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
standing in the middle of the space.

8
0:00:44.759,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In the front of her is a table.

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
On the table there are 76 objects

10
0:00:54.72,000 --> 0:00:56,000
for pleasure and for pain.

11
0:00:58.52,000 --> 0:01:,000
Some of the objects are

12
0:01:00.72,000 --> 0:01:05,000
a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.

13
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But also the knife, the razor blade, the hammer

14
0:01:13.8,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the pistol with one bullet.

15
0:01:18.24,000 --> 0:01:2,000
There are instructions which say,

16
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"I'm an object.

17
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You can use everything on the table on me.

18
0:01:26.36,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'm taking all responsibility -- even killing me.

19
0:01:30.92,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And the time is six hours."

20
0:01:35.6,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The beginning of this performance was easy.

21
0:01:40.28,000 --> 0:01:43,000
People would give me the glass of water to drink,

22
0:01:43.88,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they'd give me the rose.

23
0:01:46.12,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But very soon after,

24
0:01:48.92,000 --> 0:01:51,000
there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes,

25
0:01:52.44,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach.

26
0:01:56.92,000 --> 0:02:,000
Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood,

27
0:02:01.96,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I still have the scar.

28
0:02:04.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The women would tell the men what to do.

29
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening,

30
0:02:12.84,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and it was all public,

31
0:02:14.56,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and they were with their wives.

32
0:02:16.96,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They carried me around and put me on the table,

33
0:02:19.24,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and put the knife between my legs.

34
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple.

35
0:02:25.56,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And another person took the pistol and they started a fight.

36
0:02:30.92,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And after six hours were finished,

37
0:02:33.68,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I...

38
0:02:36.2,000 --> 0:02:39,000
started walking towards the public.

39
0:02:39.36,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was a mess.

40
0:02:40.6,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face.

41
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And everybody escaped, they just ran away.

42
0:02:49.28,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being.

43
0:02:54.76,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And then --

44
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
what happened

45
0:02:59.24,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning.

46
0:03:05.08,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And

47
0:03:07.68,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I looked at myself in the mirror,

48
0:03:10.52,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and I had a piece of gray hair.

49
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Alright --

50
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
please take off your blindfolds.

51
0:03:22.76,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Welcome to the performance world.

52
0:03:25.52,000 --> 0:03:28,000
First of all, let's explain what the performance is.

53
0:03:29.84,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So many artists, so many different explanations,

54
0:03:32.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but my explanation for performance is very simple.

55
0:03:35.64,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Performance is a mental and physical construction

56
0:03:40.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that the performer makes in a specific time

57
0:03:43.08,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in a space in front of an audience

58
0:03:46.4,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and then energy dialogue happens.

59
0:03:49.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The audience and the performer make the piece together.

60
0:03:53.6,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And the difference between performance and theater is huge.

61
0:03:58.24,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In the theater, the knife is not a knife

62
0:04:01.72,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and the blood is just ketchup.

63
0:04:04.04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In the performance, the blood is the material,

64
0:04:08.6,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and the razor blade or knife is the tool.

65
0:04:11.92,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's all about being there in the real time,

66
0:04:15.84,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and you can't rehearse performance,

67
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because you can't do many of these types of things twice -- ever.

68
0:04:23.36,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Which is very important, the performance is --

69
0:04:25.88,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things.

70
0:04:30.2,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain,

71
0:04:33.6,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we're afraid of mortality.

72
0:04:36.24,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So what I'm doing --

73
0:04:37.52,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience.

74
0:04:41.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I'm using your energy,

75
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can.

76
0:04:49.76,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And then I liberate myself from these fears.

77
0:04:53.36,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And I'm your mirror.

78
0:04:54.68,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If I can do this for myself, you can do it for you.

79
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:05:,000
After Belgrade, where I was born,

80
0:05:00.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I went to Amsterdam.

81
0:05:03.44,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And you know, I've been doing performances

82
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:08,000
since the last 40 years.

83
0:05:08.36,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And here I met Ulay,

84
0:05:09.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and he was the person I actually fell in love with.

85
0:05:13.36,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And we made, for 12 years, performances together.

86
0:05:16.52,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets,

87
0:05:19.8,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I exchange into love and trust.

88
0:05:22.76,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely

89
0:05:26.4,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because this arrow is pointing to my heart.

90
0:05:29.44,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So, heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on,

91
0:05:33.8,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is about trust, is about total trust to another human being.

92
0:05:39.32,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Our relationship was 12 years,

93
0:05:41.56,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and we worked on so many subjects, both male and female energy.

94
0:05:45.44,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too.

95
0:05:49.6,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do

96
0:05:53.28,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and say, you know, "This is over."

97
0:05:55.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye.

98
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I started at the Yellow Sea, and he started from the Gobi Desert.

99
0:06:03.2,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We walked, each of us, three months,

100
0:06:06.6,000 --> 0:06:07,000
two and a half thousand kilometers.

101
0:06:08.8,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It was the mountains, it was difficult.

102
0:06:10.8,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It was climbing, it was ruins.

103
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces,

104
0:06:16.28,000 --> 0:06:19,000
this was before China was open in '87.

105
0:06:20.12,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And we succeeded to meet in the middle

106
0:06:23.68,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to say goodbye.

107
0:06:26.32,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And then our relationship stopped.

108
0:06:28.56,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And now, it completely changed how I see the public.

109
0:06:33.28,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And one very important piece I made in those days

110
0:06:36.44,000 --> 0:06:37,000
was "Balkan Baroque."

111
0:06:38.44,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,

112
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and I wanted to create some very strong, charismatic image,

113
0:06:44.72,000 --> 0:06:47,000
something that could serve for any war at any time,

114
0:06:48.04,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere.

115
0:06:52.08,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So here I am washing

116
0:06:54.08,000 --> 0:06:57,000
two and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones.

117
0:06:57.88,000 --> 0:07:,000
You can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars.

118
0:07:01.44,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones,

119
0:07:06.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and becoming possible -- an unbearable smell.

120
0:07:09.64,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But then something stays in the memory.

121
0:07:12.52,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I want to show you the one who really changed my life,

122
0:07:15.28,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made.

123
0:07:19.44,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This performance -- when I said to the curator,

124
0:07:22.8,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"I'm just going to sit at the chair,

125
0:07:24.8,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and there will be an empty chair at the front,

126
0:07:27.36,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want."

127
0:07:30.88,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The curator said to me,

128
0:07:32.12,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York,

129
0:07:34.8,000 --> 0:07:35,000
this chair will be empty,

130
0:07:36.04,000 --> 0:07:37,000
nobody has time to sit in front of you."

131
0:07:37.969,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Laughter)

132
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But I sit for three months.

133
0:07:41.08,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I sit everyday, eight hours --

134
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the opening of the museum --

135
0:07:44.44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours,

136
0:07:47.36,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and I never move.

137
0:07:48.558,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I removed the table and I'm still sitting,

138
0:07:51.44,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and this changed everything.

139
0:07:53.96,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago --

140
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:07:57,000
nothing would have happened.

141
0:07:57.76,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But the need of people to actually experience something different,

142
0:08:02.68,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the public was not anymore the group --

143
0:08:04.8,000 --> 0:08:06,000
relation was one to one.

144
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I was watching these people, they would come and sit in front of me,

145
0:08:10.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours

146
0:08:13.64,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to get to this position,

147
0:08:14.823,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and finally, they sit.

148
0:08:16.4,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And what happened?

149
0:08:18.44,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They are observed by the other people,

150
0:08:20.6,000 --> 0:08:22,000
they're photographed, they're filmed by the camera,

151
0:08:23.2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they're observed by me

152
0:08:24.6,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves.

153
0:08:28.24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And that makes a difference.

154
0:08:29.84,000 --> 0:08:3,000
There was so much pain and loneliness,

155
0:08:31.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes,

156
0:08:35.8,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because in the gaze with that total stranger,

157
0:08:38.8,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that you never even say one word -- everything happened.

158
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months,

159
0:08:47.2,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I am not the same anymore.

160
0:08:48.799,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And I understood that I have a very strong mission,

161
0:08:51.6,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that I have to communicate this experience

162
0:08:54.88,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to everybody.

163
0:08:56.159,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And this is how, for me, was born the idea

164
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to have an institute of immaterial performing arts.

165
0:09:03.32,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Because thinking about immateriality,

166
0:09:06.24,000 --> 0:09:07,000
performance is time-based art.

167
0:09:07.72,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's not like a painting.

168
0:09:09.08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there.

169
0:09:11.88,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory,

170
0:09:16.6,000 --> 0:09:18,000
or the story of somebody else telling you,

171
0:09:18.96,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but you actually missed the whole thing.

172
0:09:20.92,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So you have to be there.

173
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art,

174
0:09:25.08,000 --> 0:09:28,000
music is the highest -- absolutely highest art of all,

175
0:09:28.48,000 --> 0:09:29,000
because it's the most immaterial.

176
0:09:30.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And then after this is performance, and then everything else.

177
0:09:33.162,000 --> 0:09:34,000
That's my subjective way.

178
0:09:34.72,000 --> 0:09:37,000
This institute is going to happen in Hudson, upstate New York,

179
0:09:38.64,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.

180
0:09:41.96,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And it's very simple.

181
0:09:43.24,000 --> 0:09:47,000
If you want to get experience, you have to give me your time.

182
0:09:47.92,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You have to sign the contract before you enter the building,

183
0:09:51.04,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that you will spend there a full six hours,

184
0:09:53.92,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you have to give me your word of honor.

185
0:09:56.6,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's something so old-fashioned,

186
0:09:58.52,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before --

187
0:10:01.88,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that's not my problem.

188
0:10:03.12,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But it's six hours, the experience.

189
0:10:05.64,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment,

190
0:10:08.807,000 --> 0:10:1,000
so get home and frame it if you want.

191
0:10:10.88,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

192
0:10:11.92,000 --> 0:10:12,000
This is orientation hall.

193
0:10:13.28,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats.

194
0:10:17.8,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It's this importance

195
0:10:19.04,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter.

196
0:10:23.28,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And then you go to the lockers

197
0:10:25.72,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and you put your watch, your iPhone, your iPod, your computer

198
0:10:29.04,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and everything digital, electronic.

199
0:10:31.36,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time.

200
0:10:35.72,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Because there is nothing wrong with technology,

201
0:10:39.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
our approach to technology is wrong.

202
0:10:41.48,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We are losing the time we have for ourselves.

203
0:10:44.2,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is an institute to actually give you back this time.

204
0:10:47.52,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So what you do here,

205
0:10:48.8,000 --> 0:10:51,000
first you start slow walking, you start slowing down.

206
0:10:51.92,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You're going back to simplicity.

207
0:10:53.88,000 --> 0:10:56,000
After slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water --

208
0:10:57.52,000 --> 0:11:,000
very simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour.

209
0:11:01.64,000 --> 0:11:03,000
After this, you're going to the magnet chamber,

210
0:11:03.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body.

211
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Then after this, you go to crystal chamber.

212
0:11:10.36,000 --> 0:11:12,000
After crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber,

213
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
after eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down.

214
0:11:17.28,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So it's the three basic positions of the human body,

215
0:11:19.76,000 --> 0:11:2,000
sitting, standing and lying.

216
0:11:21.12,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And slow walking.

217
0:11:22.68,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And there is a sound chamber.

218
0:11:24.52,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And then after you've seen all of this,

219
0:11:26.88,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and prepared yourself mentally and physically,

220
0:11:29.047,000 --> 0:11:31,000
then you are ready to see something with a long duration,

221
0:11:31.738,000 --> 0:11:33,000
like in immaterial art.

222
0:11:34.12,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece,

223
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
it can be film, it can be video dance.

224
0:11:40.92,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable.

225
0:11:44.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
In the long duration chairs,

226
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work.

227
0:11:49.88,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And if you fall asleep,

228
0:11:51.12,000 --> 0:11:53,000
which is very possible because it's been a long day,

229
0:11:53.68,000 --> 0:11:55,000
you're going to be transported to the parking lot.

230
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
(Laughter)

231
0:11:57.8,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And you know, sleeping is very important.

232
0:12:00.64,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In sleeping, you're still receiving art.

233
0:12:03.44,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time,

234
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and then after this you just, you know, go back,

235
0:12:10.44,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you see more of the things you like to see

236
0:12:12.8,000 --> 0:12:14,000
or go home with your certificate.

237
0:12:15.28,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So this institute right now is virtual.

238
0:12:18.72,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil,

239
0:12:21.6,000 --> 0:12:22,000
then it's going to be in Australia,

240
0:12:23.291,000 --> 0:12:26,000
then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere.

241
0:12:26.44,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And this is to experience a kind of simple method,

242
0:12:29.96,000 --> 0:12:31,000
how you go back to simplicity in your own life.

243
0:12:32.88,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Counting rice will be another thing.

244
0:12:35.76,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:37.68,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You know, if you count rice you can make life, too.

246
0:12:40.2,000 --> 0:12:42,000
How to count rice for six hours?

247
0:12:42.4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's incredibly important.

248
0:12:44.12,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry,

249
0:12:48.28,000 --> 0:12:52,000
being completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting.

250
0:12:52.76,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get

251
0:12:55.56,000 --> 0:12:57,000
when satisfying work is finished --

252
0:12:58.04,000 --> 0:12:59,000
or counting sand in the desert.

253
0:13:00.6,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Or having the sound-isolated situation --

254
0:13:04.12,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that you have headphones, that you don't hear anything,

255
0:13:06.72,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and you're just there together without sound,

256
0:13:09.44,000 --> 0:13:13,000
with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence.

257
0:13:14.32,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We are always doing things we like in our life.

258
0:13:18.56,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And this is why you're not changing.

259
0:13:20.84,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You do things in life --

260
0:13:22.32,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way.

261
0:13:26.2,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear,

262
0:13:31.32,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the things I don't know,

263
0:13:32.84,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to go to territory that nobody's ever been.

264
0:13:35.72,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And then also to include the failure.

265
0:13:38.6,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I think failure is important

266
0:13:40.36,000 --> 0:13:43,000
because if you go, if you experiment, you can fail.

267
0:13:44.12,000 --> 0:13:46,000
If you don't go into that area and you don't fail,

268
0:13:46.8,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you are actually repeating yourself over and over again.

269
0:13:50.32,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I think that human beings right now need a change,

270
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and the only change to be made is a personal level change.

271
0:13:58.28,000 --> 0:14:,000
You have to make the change on yourself.

272
0:14:00.88,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Because the only way to change consciousness

273
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and to change the world around us,

274
0:14:05.44,000 --> 0:14:06,000
is to start with yourself.

275
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
It's so easy to criticize how it's different,

276
0:14:09.68,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the things in the world and they're not right,

277
0:14:11.847,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world

278
0:14:15.12,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and there's wars -- the killing.

279
0:14:18.6,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But what we do on the personal level --

280
0:14:21.2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
what is our contribution to this whole thing?

281
0:14:24.96,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know,

282
0:14:28.08,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now?

283
0:14:33.84,000 --> 0:14:37,000
(Chatter)

284
0:14:38.36,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little.

285
0:14:42.28,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Breathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious.

286
0:14:47.64,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Be relaxed.

287
0:14:49.28,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.

288
0:14:55.52,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Silence)

289
0:15:35.04,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you for trusting me.

290
0:15:37.72,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Applause)

291
0:15:45.36,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

292
0:15:48.36,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Thank you so much.

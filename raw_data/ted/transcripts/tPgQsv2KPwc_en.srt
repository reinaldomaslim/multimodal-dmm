1
0:00:16.576,000 --> 0:00:18,000
There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money.

2
0:00:19.553,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In fact, they make their living on this stuff.

3
0:00:21.751,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm going to try to save you all the time and money

4
0:00:24.183,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me.

5
0:00:27.065,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Started a website in 2005 with a few friends, called Reddit.com.

6
0:00:30.259,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's what you'd call a social news website;

7
0:00:32.319,000 --> 0:00:35,000
basically, the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web.

8
0:00:35.597,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You find some interesting content -- say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,

9
0:00:39.483,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and a community of your peers votes up if they like it, down if they don't.

10
0:00:43.072,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That creates the front page.

11
0:00:44.433,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's always rising, falling; a half million people visit every day.

12
0:00:47.614,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But this isn't about Reddit.

13
0:00:48.975,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's about discovering new things that pop up on the web.

14
0:00:51.7,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes,

15
0:00:54.268,000 --> 0:00:56,000
all kinds of trends get born right on our front page.

16
0:00:56.917,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales.

17
0:01:00.157,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization

18
0:01:03.861,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign.

19
0:01:06.969,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The whales were getting killed; they wanted to put an end to it.

20
0:01:10.062,000 --> 0:01:11,000
One of the ways they wanted to do it

21
0:01:11.839,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales.

22
0:01:14.351,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But to personify the movement, they wanted to name it.

23
0:01:16.993,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So in true web fashion, they put together a poll,

24
0:01:19.336,000 --> 0:01:22,000
where they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names.

25
0:01:22.784,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I believe this is the Farsi word for "immortal."

26
0:01:25.062,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I think this means "divine power of the ocean" in a Polynesian language.

27
0:01:29.12,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And then there was this: "Mister Splashy Pants."

28
0:01:31.974,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:33.232,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And this was a special name.

30
0:01:34.621,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Mister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends, was very popular on the Internet.

31
0:01:38.318,000 --> 0:01:39,000
In fact, someone on Reddit thought,

32
0:01:40.09,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"What a great thing, we should all vote this up."

33
0:01:42.428,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And Redditors responded and all agreed.

34
0:01:44.855,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So the voting started.

35
0:01:46.168,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We got behind it ourselves; we changed our logo for the day,

36
0:01:49.062,000 --> 0:01:51,000
from the alien to Splashy, to help the cause.

37
0:01:51.656,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing

38
0:01:54.672,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the rest of the Internet started saying, "We love Splashy Pants!"

39
0:01:57.973,000 --> 0:02:,000
So it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started,

40
0:02:01.642,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to 70 percent at the end of voting.

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Pretty impressive, right? We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.

42
0:02:07.67,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Just kidding -- Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it,

43
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win.

44
0:02:13.57,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They said, "No, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting."

45
0:02:16.801,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:21.285,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And the Reddit community -- really, the rest of the Internet,

48
0:02:24.197,000 --> 0:02:25,000
really got behind this.

49
0:02:25.372,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Facebook groups were created.

50
0:02:26.795,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Facebook applications were created.

51
0:02:28.517,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The idea was, "Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants."

52
0:02:31.763,000 --> 0:02:34,000
People were putting up signs in the real world about this whale.

53
0:02:34.833,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:35.858,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This was the final vote: 78 percent of the votes.

55
0:02:38.643,000 --> 0:02:41,000
To give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three.

56
0:02:42.664,000 --> 0:02:45,000
There was a clear lesson: the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.

57
0:02:45.825,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Which is obvious. It's a great name.

58
0:02:47.587,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants."

59
0:02:50.863,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:51.888,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I think that's what helped drive this.

61
0:02:53.741,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What was cool were the repercussions.

62
0:02:55.645,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Greenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it --

63
0:02:58.55,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,

64
0:03:00.367,000 --> 0:03:02,000
an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.

65
0:03:03.112,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But even more important was that they accomplished their mission.

66
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition.

67
0:03:09.256,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Mission accomplished: Greenpeace was thrilled,

68
0:03:11.447,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the whales were happy -- that's a quote.

69
0:03:13.38,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:14.405,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And actually, Redditors in the Internet community

71
0:03:17.578,000 --> 0:03:19,000
were happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers.

72
0:03:20.282,000 --> 0:03:22,000
A few, certainly, but we're talking about a lot of people,

73
0:03:23.033,000 --> 0:03:25,000
really interested and caught up in this meme.

74
0:03:25.172,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Greenpeace came back to the site and thanked Reddit for its participation.

75
0:03:28.696,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool.

76
0:03:32.327,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is how the Internet works. This is that great big secret.

77
0:03:35.267,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The Internet provides a level playing field.

78
0:03:37.351,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Your link is as good as your link, which is as good as my link.

79
0:03:40.339,000 --> 0:03:43,000
With a browser, anyone can get to any website no matter your budget.

80
0:03:43.561,000 --> 0:03:45,000
That is, as long as you can keep net neutrality in place.

81
0:03:46.255,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Another important thing is it costs nothing to get content online.

82
0:03:49.377,000 --> 0:03:51,000
There are so many publishing tools available,

83
0:03:51.499,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it only takes a few minutes to produce something.

84
0:03:53.821,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the cost of iteration is so cheap, you might as well.

85
0:03:56.525,000 --> 0:03:58,000
If you do, be genuine. Be honest, up-front.

86
0:03:58.562,000 --> 0:04:,000
One of the great lessons Greenpeace learned

87
0:04:00.605,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is that it's OK to lose control,

88
0:04:02.453,000 --> 0:04:04,000
OK to take yourself a little less seriously,

89
0:04:04.545,000 --> 0:04:06,000
given that, even though it's a very serious cause,

90
0:04:06.922,000 --> 0:04:07,000
you could ultimately achieve your goal.

91
0:04:08.858,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's the final message I want to share: you can do well online.

92
0:04:12.057,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But no longer is the message coming from just the top down.

93
0:04:14.999,000 --> 0:04:16,000
If you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control.

94
0:04:17.864,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Thank you.

95
0:04:19.294,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Applause)

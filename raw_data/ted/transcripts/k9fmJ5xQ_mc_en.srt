0:00:12.703,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Today,

2
0:00:14.684,000 --> 0:00:15,000
a baffled lady observed

3
0:00:16.324,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the shell where my soul dwells

4
0:00:18.316,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And announced that I'm

5
0:00:21.457,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"articulate"

6
0:00:23.364,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Which means that when it comes

7
0:00:25.702,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to enunciation and diction

8
0:00:27.697,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I don't even think of it

9
0:00:28.703,000 --> 0:00:3,000
‘Cause I’m "articulate"

10
0:00:31.39,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So when my professor asks a question

11
0:00:33.97,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And my answer is tainted with a connotation

12
0:00:36.129,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of urbanized suggestion

13
0:00:37.477,000 --> 0:00:39,000
There’s no misdirected intention

14
0:00:39.943,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Pay attention

15
0:00:40.92,000 --> 0:00:42,000
‘Cause I’m “articulate”

16
0:00:43.258,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?”

17
0:00:46.815,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My “articulate” answer never goes amiss

18
0:00:49.953,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand”

19
0:00:53.469,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And when I’m on the block

20
0:00:54.796,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I switch it up just because I can

21
0:00:56.491,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?”

22
0:00:59.129,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!”

23
0:01:04.539,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And sometimes in class

24
0:01:06.131,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask

25
0:01:09.06,000 --> 0:01:12,000
“Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples”

26
0:01:12.725,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Yes, I have decided to treat

27
0:01:14.89,000 --> 0:01:16,000
all three of my languages as equals

28
0:01:16.952,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Because I’m “articulate”

29
0:01:20.95,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But who controls articulation?

30
0:01:23.371,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Because the English language is a multifaceted oration

31
0:01:26.525,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Subject to indefinite transformation

32
0:01:28.344,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken English

33
0:01:31.957,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But I’m here to tell you that even “articulate” Americans

34
0:01:35.114,000 --> 0:01:37,000
sound foolish to the British

35
0:01:37.114,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So when my Professor comes on the block and says, “Hello”

36
0:01:40.363,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I stop him and say “Noooo …

37
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You’re being inarticulate …

38
0:01:45.144,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’”

39
0:01:47.307,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not cool

40
0:01:50.922,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But I’m here to tell you that even our language has rules

41
0:01:53.9,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So when Mommy mocks me and says

42
0:01:56.512,000 --> 0:01:58,000
“ya’ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store”

43
0:01:58.77,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law

44
0:02:03.756,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Never does the word "madd" go before a present participle

45
0:02:07.447,000 --> 0:02:09,000
That’s simply the principle of this English”

46
0:02:09.95,000 --> 0:02:1,000
If I had the vocal capacity I would

47
0:02:11.62,000 --> 0:02:13,000
sing this from every mountaintop,

48
0:02:13.674,000 --> 0:02:15,000
From every suburbia, and every hood

49
0:02:15.95,000 --> 0:02:18,000
‘Cause the only God of language is the one recorded in the Genesis

50
0:02:19.503,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Of this world saying “it is good"

51
0:02:21.22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So I may not always come before you

52
0:02:23.791,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with excellency of speech

53
0:02:25.185,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But do not judge me by my language and assume

54
0:02:27.716,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That I’m too ignorant to teach

55
0:02:29.235,000 --> 0:02:3,000
‘Cause I speak three tongues

56
0:02:30.785,000 --> 0:02:31,000
One for each:

57
0:02:31.933,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Home, school and friends

58
0:02:33.678,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I’m a tri-lingual orator

59
0:02:35.882,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now

60
0:02:37.851,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Then switch it up so I don’t bore later

61
0:02:39.81,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Sometimes I fight back two tongues

62
0:02:41.687,000 --> 0:02:42,000
While I use the other one in the classroom

63
0:02:43.622,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And when I mistakenly mix them up

64
0:02:45.547,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom

65
0:02:49.04,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I know that I had to borrow your language

66
0:02:53.632,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because mines was stolen

67
0:02:56.477,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly

68
0:03:00.377,000 --> 0:03:01,000
while mines is broken

69
0:03:01.879,000 --> 0:03:02,000
These words are spoken

70
0:03:03.398,000 --> 0:03:05,000
By someone who is simply fed up with

71
0:03:05.705,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the Eurocentric ideals of this season

72
0:03:08.325,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the reason I speak a composite version of your language

73
0:03:11.808,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Is because mines was raped away along with my history

74
0:03:15.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us

75
0:03:19.79,000 --> 0:03:21,000
That our current state is not a mystery

76
0:03:22.05,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I’m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad

77
0:03:27.258,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So unless you’ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad

78
0:03:31.501,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity

79
0:03:35.157,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So don’t call it good unless your hair is known

80
0:03:37.71,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for donating to charity

81
0:03:39.255,000 --> 0:03:43,000
As much as has been raped away from our people

82
0:03:44.182,000 --> 0:03:47,000
How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language

83
0:03:48.121,000 --> 0:03:5,000
As anything less than equal

84
0:03:50.735,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Let there be no confusion

85
0:03:52.607,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Let there be no hesitation

86
0:03:54.421,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is not a promotion of ignorance

87
0:03:56.485,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is a linguistic celebration

88
0:03:59.93,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application

89
0:04:05.009,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I can help to diversify your consumer market

90
0:04:07.74,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is all I wanted them to know

91
0:04:09.372,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And when they call me for the interview

92
0:04:11.105,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I’ll be more than happy to show that

93
0:04:12.615,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I can say:

94
0:04:13.35,000 --> 0:04:14,000
“What’s good”

95
0:04:14.563,000 --> 0:04:14,000
“Whatagwan”

96
0:04:15.548,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And of course …“Hello”

97
0:04:18.452,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Because I’m “articulate”

98
0:04:21.126,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Thank you.

99
0:04:22.899,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Applause)

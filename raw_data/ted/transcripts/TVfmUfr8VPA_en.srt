1
0:00:19.012,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.

2
0:00:21.838,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They've been here for billions of years,

3
0:00:23.883,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.

4
0:00:27.86,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So they're one cell

5
0:00:29.18,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA.

6
0:00:32.876,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So they have very few genes and genetic information

7
0:00:35.828,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to encode all of the traits that they carry out.

8
0:00:38.85,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients

9
0:00:42.251,000 --> 0:00:43,000
from the environment,

10
0:00:43.435,000 --> 0:00:44,000
they grow to twice their size,

11
0:00:45.133,000 --> 0:00:46,000
they cut themselves down in the middle,

12
0:00:47.036,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.

13
0:00:49.772,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They just grow and divide and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life,

14
0:00:53.688,000 --> 0:00:56,000
except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction

15
0:00:57.017,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with these critters.

16
0:00:58.275,000 --> 0:01:,000
I know you guys think of yourself as humans,

17
0:01:00.382,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and this is sort of how I think of you.

18
0:01:02.297,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This man is supposed to represent a generic human being,

19
0:01:05.558,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body.

20
0:01:09.74,000 --> 0:01:13,000
There's about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are

21
0:01:13.908,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and able to do all the things that we do.

22
0:01:16.002,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you

23
0:01:19.367,000 --> 0:01:2,000
at any moment in your life.

24
0:01:20.692,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So, 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being.

25
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And, of course, it's the DNA that counts,

26
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code

27
0:01:30.764,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and give you all your charming characteristics.

28
0:01:33.004,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You have about 30,000 genes.

29
0:01:34.694,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes

30
0:01:38.048,000 --> 0:01:41,000
playing a role in you or on you all of your life.

31
0:01:41.614,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So at the best, you're 10 percent human; more likely, about one percent human,

32
0:01:46.478,000 --> 0:01:48,000
depending on which of these metrics you like.

33
0:01:48.91,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I know you think of yourself as human beings,

34
0:01:51.055,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.

35
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:55.567,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And these bacteria are not passive riders.

37
0:01:58.558,000 --> 0:02:01,000
These are incredibly important; they keep us alive.

38
0:02:01.828,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They cover us in an invisible body armor

39
0:02:04.469,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy.

40
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They digest our food, they make our vitamins,

41
0:02:10.833,000 --> 0:02:14,000
they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out.

42
0:02:15.055,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So they do all these amazing things

43
0:02:17.08,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that help us and are vital for keeping us alive,

44
0:02:20.72,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and they never get any press for that.

45
0:02:22.854,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well.

46
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So there's all kinds of bacteria on the earth

47
0:02:29.512,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that have no business being in you or on you at any time,

48
0:02:33.011,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and if they are, they make you incredibly sick.

49
0:02:36.595,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And so the question for my lab

50
0:02:38.072,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do

51
0:02:41.522,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or all the bad things that bacteria do.

52
0:02:43.473,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The question we had is: How could they do anything at all?

53
0:02:46.231,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I mean, they're incredibly small.

54
0:02:47.853,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You have to have a microscope to see one.

55
0:02:49.858,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide,

56
0:02:52.921,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and they've always been considered to be these asocial, reclusive organisms.

57
0:02:57.669,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And so it seemed to us that they're just too small

58
0:03:00.216,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to have an impact on the environment

59
0:03:02.196,000 --> 0:03:04,000
if they simply act as individuals.

60
0:03:04.794,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live.

61
0:03:09.087,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And the clue to this came from another marine bacterium,

62
0:03:12.895,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and it's a bacterium called "Vibrio fischeri."

63
0:03:15.347,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab

64
0:03:18.923,000 --> 0:03:21,000
holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium,

65
0:03:22.08,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a harmless, beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean,

66
0:03:25.277,000 --> 0:03:26,000
named Vibrio fischeri.

67
0:03:26.73,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And this bacterium has the special property that it makes light,

68
0:03:30.08,000 --> 0:03:31,000
so it makes bioluminescence,

69
0:03:31.497,000 --> 0:03:32,000
like fireflies make light.

70
0:03:33.345,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We're not doing anything to the cells here,

71
0:03:35.404,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room,

72
0:03:38.418,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and this is what we see.

73
0:03:39.866,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And what's actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light

74
0:03:43.613,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but when the bacteria made light.

75
0:03:45.794,000 --> 0:03:47,000
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,

76
0:03:48.517,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so when they were in dilute suspension,

77
0:03:50.696,000 --> 0:03:51,000
they made no light.

78
0:03:52.08,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But when they grew to a certain cell number,

79
0:03:54.152,000 --> 0:03:57,000
all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.

80
0:03:57.526,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So the question that we had is:

81
0:03:59.278,000 --> 0:04:01,000
How can bacteria, these primitive organisms,

82
0:04:02.016,000 --> 0:04:04,000
tell the difference from times when they're alone

83
0:04:04.368,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and times when they're in a community,

84
0:04:06.283,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and then all do something together?

85
0:04:09.024,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And what we figured out is that the way they do that is they talk to each other,

86
0:04:13.149,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and they talk with a chemical language.

87
0:04:15.343,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.

88
0:04:18.08,000 --> 0:04:2,000
When it's alone, it doesn't make any light.

89
0:04:20.602,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules

90
0:04:24.38,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that you can think of like hormones,

91
0:04:26.282,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and these are the red triangles.

92
0:04:28.005,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And when the bacteria are alone, the molecules just float away,

93
0:04:31.63,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and so, no light.

94
0:04:32.974,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But when the bacteria grow and double

95
0:04:34.94,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and they're all participating in making these molecules,

96
0:04:38.301,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the molecule, the extracellular amount of that molecule,

97
0:04:41.809,000 --> 0:04:43,000
increases in proportion to cell number.

98
0:04:44.66,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And when the molecule hits a certain amount

99
0:04:46.969,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are,

100
0:04:49.533,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they recognize that molecule

101
0:04:51.051,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.

102
0:04:54.682,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And so that's how bioluminescence works --

103
0:04:56.99,000 --> 0:04:58,000
they're talking with these chemical words.

104
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The reason Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology --

105
0:05:02.654,000 --> 0:05:05,000
again, another plug for the animals in the ocean.

106
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.

107
0:05:08.38,000 --> 0:05:1,000
What you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid.

108
0:05:11.08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's been turned on its back,

109
0:05:12.748,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes.

110
0:05:15.971,000 --> 0:05:17,000
These house the Vibrio fischeri cells.

111
0:05:18.264,000 --> 0:05:2,000
They live in there, at high cell number.

112
0:05:20.292,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That molecule is there, and they're making light.

113
0:05:23.279,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans

114
0:05:26.564,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is because it wants that light.

115
0:05:28.078,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The way that this symbiosis works

116
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii,

117
0:05:33.503,000 --> 0:05:35,000
just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.

118
0:05:35.854,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And the squid is nocturnal,

119
0:05:37.405,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so during the day, it buries itself in the sand and sleeps.

120
0:05:41.08,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But then at night, it has to come out to hunt.

121
0:05:43.421,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So on bright nights

122
0:05:44.689,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when there's lots of starlight or moonlight,

123
0:05:46.816,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in,

124
0:05:50.037,000 --> 0:05:52,000
since it's just in those couple feet of water.

125
0:05:52.205,000 --> 0:05:55,000
What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close

126
0:05:55.957,000 --> 0:05:58,000
over the specialized light organ housing the bacteria.

127
0:05:59.08,000 --> 0:06:,000
And then it has detectors on its back

128
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:04,000
so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.

129
0:06:04.598,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And it opens and closes the shutter

130
0:06:06.435,000 --> 0:06:08,000
so the amount of light coming out of the bottom,

131
0:06:08.726,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which is made by the bacterium,

132
0:06:10.273,000 --> 0:06:12,000
exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back,

133
0:06:12.965,000 --> 0:06:13,000
so the squid doesn't make a shadow.

134
0:06:14.947,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So it actually uses the light from the bacteria

135
0:06:17.515,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to counter-illuminate itself in an antipredation device,

136
0:06:21.06,000 --> 0:06:22,000
so predators can't see its shadow,

137
0:06:23.08,000 --> 0:06:24,000
calculate its trajectory and eat it.

138
0:06:25.08,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.

139
0:06:27.706,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:28.904,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But then if you think about it, this squid has this terrible problem,

141
0:06:32.185,000 --> 0:06:34,000
because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria,

142
0:06:34.922,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and it can't sustain that.

143
0:06:36.401,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And so what happens is, every morning when the sun comes up,

144
0:06:39.32,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand,

145
0:06:42.18,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm.

146
0:06:45.034,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And when the sun comes up, it pumps out, like, 95 percent of the bacteria.

147
0:06:49.649,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So now the bacteria are dilute,

148
0:06:51.325,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that little hormone molecule is gone, so they're not making light.

149
0:06:54.501,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But, of course, the squid doesn't care, it's asleep in the sand.

150
0:06:57.558,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And as the day goes by, the bacteria double,

151
0:06:59.636,000 --> 0:07:01,000
they release the molecule, and then light comes on at night,

152
0:07:02.485,000 --> 0:07:04,000
exactly when the squid wants it.

153
0:07:04.618,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So first, we figured out how this bacterium does this,

154
0:07:07.989,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this

155
0:07:10.759,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to figure out, really, what's the mechanism.

156
0:07:12.935,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell --

157
0:07:16.983,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein.

158
0:07:18.928,000 --> 0:07:19,000
That's the red box --

159
0:07:20.141,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule,

160
0:07:23.139,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the red triangle.

161
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And then as the cells grow,

162
0:07:25.664,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they're all releasing that molecule into the environment,

163
0:07:28.394,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so there's lots of molecule there.

164
0:07:30.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface

165
0:07:33.985,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that fits like a lock and key with that molecule.

166
0:07:36.538,000 --> 0:07:39,000
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.

167
0:07:40.152,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So when the molecule increases to a certain amount,

168
0:07:42.599,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which says something about the number of cells,

169
0:07:44.87,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it locks down into that receptor

170
0:07:46.643,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and information comes into the cells

171
0:07:49.044,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light.

172
0:07:53.927,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade,

173
0:07:56.647,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we have found that this is not just some anomaly

174
0:07:58.914,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean --

175
0:08:02.405,000 --> 0:08:03,000
all bacteria have systems like this.

176
0:08:04.286,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.

177
0:08:07.943,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They make chemical words, they recognize those words,

178
0:08:10.769,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and they turn on group behaviors

179
0:08:12.799,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.

180
0:08:17.421,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So now we have a fancy name for this: we call it "quorum sensing."

181
0:08:20.857,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They vote with these chemical votes,

182
0:08:22.897,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote.

183
0:08:26.865,000 --> 0:08:29,000
What's important for today's talk is we know there are hundreds of behaviors

184
0:08:30.725,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.

185
0:08:33.677,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.

186
0:08:37.204,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and start secreting some toxins --

187
0:08:41.475,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you're enormous; that would have no effect on you, you're huge.

188
0:08:45.231,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But what they do, we now understand,

189
0:08:47.394,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is they get in you, they wait, they start growing,

190
0:08:50.38,000 --> 0:08:52,000
they count themselves with these little molecules,

191
0:08:52.776,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and they recognize when they have the right cell number

192
0:08:55.435,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together,

193
0:08:58.68,000 --> 0:09:01,000
they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.

194
0:09:02.38,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.

195
0:09:07.732,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So that's how it works.

196
0:09:09.08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We also then went to look at what are these molecules.

197
0:09:11.753,000 --> 0:09:13,000
These were the red triangles on my slides before.

198
0:09:14.361,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.

199
0:09:16.677,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This is the word that it talks with.

200
0:09:18.459,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And then we started to look at other bacteria,

201
0:09:20.631,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.

202
0:09:24.061,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related.

203
0:09:27.325,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical

204
0:09:29.793,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in every single species of bacteria.

205
0:09:32.42,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different

206
0:09:35.53,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in every single species.

207
0:09:37.04,000 --> 0:09:42,000
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages.

208
0:09:42.563,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So each molecule fits into its partner receptor

209
0:09:45.829,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and no other.

210
0:09:47.01,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So these are private, secret conversations.

211
0:09:49.892,000 --> 0:09:52,000
These conversations are for intraspecies communication.

212
0:09:53.731,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language

213
0:09:57.947,000 --> 0:10:,000
that allows it to count its own siblings.

214
0:10:02.189,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Once we got that far,

215
0:10:03.433,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.

216
0:10:07.429,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time,

217
0:10:10.508,000 --> 0:10:13,000
bacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures,

218
0:10:13.783,000 --> 0:10:15,000
with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.

219
0:10:16.612,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And that's depicted on this slide.

220
0:10:18.345,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is your skin.

221
0:10:19.525,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.

222
0:10:22.567,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this.

223
0:10:25.155,000 --> 0:10:26,000
What I hope you can see

224
0:10:26.421,000 --> 0:10:28,000
is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.

225
0:10:28.56,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And so we started to think, if this really is about communication in bacteria,

226
0:10:32.711,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and it's about counting your neighbors,

227
0:10:34.655,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.

228
0:10:38.297,000 --> 0:10:4,000
There has to be a way to take a census

229
0:10:40.525,000 --> 0:10:42,000
of the rest of the bacteria in the population.

230
0:10:43.005,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So we went back to molecular biology

231
0:10:45.08,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and started studying different bacteria.

232
0:10:47.053,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And what we've found now is that, in fact, bacteria are multilingual.

233
0:10:51.08,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They all have a species-specific system,

234
0:10:54.08,000 --> 0:10:55,000
they have a molecule that says "me."

235
0:10:55.926,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But then running in parallel to that is a second system

236
0:10:58.72,000 --> 0:11:,000
that we've discovered, that's generic.

237
0:11:00.815,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal,

238
0:11:03.9,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and it has its own receptor,

239
0:11:05.603,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.

240
0:11:09.08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's used by all different bacteria,

241
0:11:11.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and it's the language of interspecies communication.

242
0:11:14.547,000 --> 0:11:17,000
What happens is that bacteria are able to count

243
0:11:18.08,000 --> 0:11:2,000
how many of "me" and how many of "you."

244
0:11:20.202,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And they take that information inside,

245
0:11:22.294,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and they decide what tasks to carry out

246
0:11:25.08,000 --> 0:11:28,000
depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority

247
0:11:28.123,000 --> 0:11:29,000
of any given population.

248
0:11:30.853,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Then, again, we turned to chemistry,

249
0:11:32.982,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and we figured out what this generic molecule is --

250
0:11:35.485,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.

251
0:11:38.661,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.

252
0:11:41.413,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And what the important thing is that we learned

253
0:11:43.697,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme

254
0:11:46.53,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and makes exactly the same molecule.

255
0:11:48.741,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication.

256
0:11:52.555,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is the bacterial Esperanto.

257
0:11:55.259,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

258
0:11:56.706,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So once we got that far,

259
0:11:58.114,000 --> 0:12:,000
we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other

260
0:12:00.772,000 --> 0:12:01,000
with this chemical language.

261
0:12:02.146,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But we started to think

262
0:12:03.32,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well.

263
0:12:06.698,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I've told you that bacteria have all these social behaviors,

264
0:12:09.579,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that they communicate with these molecules.

265
0:12:11.665,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Of course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do

266
0:12:15.02,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.

267
0:12:18.08,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So we thought:

268
0:12:19.257,000 --> 0:12:22,000
What if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear?

269
0:12:23.009,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?

270
0:12:25.682,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And of course, you've just heard and you already know

271
0:12:28.183,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that we're running out of antibiotics.

272
0:12:30.056,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now,

273
0:12:32.788,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.

274
0:12:36.789,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They either pop the bacterial membrane,

275
0:12:38.923,000 --> 0:12:4,000
they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.

276
0:12:41.85,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics,

277
0:12:44.268,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and that selects for resistant mutants.

278
0:12:46.818,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And so now, of course, we have this global problem

279
0:12:49.591,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in infectious diseases.

280
0:12:51.273,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So we thought, what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,

281
0:12:54.669,000 --> 0:12:57,000
just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count,

282
0:12:58.081,000 --> 0:13:,000
and they don't know to launch virulence?

283
0:13:00.506,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So that's exactly what we've done,

284
0:13:02.211,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and we've sort of taken two strategies.

285
0:13:04.143,000 --> 0:13:08,000
The first one is, we've targeted the intraspecies communication system.

286
0:13:08.356,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules, which you saw,

287
0:13:12.605,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but they're a little bit different.

288
0:13:14.339,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And so they lock into those receptors,

289
0:13:16.218,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and they jam recognition of the real thing.

290
0:13:18.988,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So by targeting the red system,

291
0:13:20.941,000 --> 0:13:24,000
what we are able to do is make species-specific, or disease-specific,

292
0:13:25.911,000 --> 0:13:26,000
anti-quorum-sensing molecules.

293
0:13:27.77,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.

294
0:13:30.383,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit

295
0:13:33.837,000 --> 0:13:37,000
so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system.

296
0:13:38.08,000 --> 0:13:42,000
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics

297
0:13:42.331,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that work against all bacteria.

298
0:13:44.321,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And so to finish, I'll show you the strategy.

299
0:13:47.105,000 --> 0:13:49,000
In this one, I'm just using the interspecies molecule,

300
0:13:49.791,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but the logic is exactly the same.

301
0:13:51.934,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal --

302
0:13:55.211,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in this case, a mouse --

303
0:13:56.404,000 --> 0:13:58,000
it doesn't initiate virulence right away.

304
0:13:58.823,000 --> 0:13:59,000
It gets in, it starts growing,

305
0:14:00.562,000 --> 0:14:02,000
it starts secreting its quorum-sensing molecules.

306
0:14:03.432,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria

307
0:14:05.83,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that now they're going to launch their attack,

308
0:14:08.018,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and the animal dies.

309
0:14:09.345,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And so what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections,

310
0:14:12.912,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum-sensing molecules.

311
0:14:16.779,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing,

312
0:14:19.661,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but they're a little different, which I've depicted on this slide.

313
0:14:22.798,000 --> 0:14:25,000
What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium --

314
0:14:26.547,000 --> 0:14:28,000
a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium --

315
0:14:28.848,000 --> 0:14:32,000
in the same time we give our anti-quorum-sensing molecule,

316
0:14:32.896,000 --> 0:14:33,000
in fact, the animal lives.

317
0:14:34.799,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics,

318
0:14:38.051,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and it's going to get us around, at least initially,

319
0:14:40.564,000 --> 0:14:42,000
this big problem of resistance.

320
0:14:42.762,000 --> 0:14:45,000
What I hope you think is that bacteria can talk to each other,

321
0:14:46.019,000 --> 0:14:48,000
they use chemicals as their words,

322
0:14:48.193,000 --> 0:14:51,000
they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon

323
0:14:51.303,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that we're just now starting to learn about.

324
0:14:54.06,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Of course, what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular.

325
0:14:58.912,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So in the spirit of TED,

326
0:15:00.741,000 --> 0:15:03,000
they're doing things together because it makes a difference.

327
0:15:04.641,000 --> 0:15:07,000
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors,

328
0:15:07.947,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and they can carry out tasks

329
0:15:09.76,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals.

330
0:15:13.944,000 --> 0:15:16,000
What I would hope that I could further argue to you

331
0:15:17.169,000 --> 0:15:19,000
is that this is the invention of multicellularity.

332
0:15:19.793,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Bacteria have been on the earth for billions of years;

333
0:15:23.417,000 --> 0:15:25,000
humans, couple hundred thousand.

334
0:15:25.484,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works.

335
0:15:31.017,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And we think by studying bacteria,

336
0:15:33.434,000 --> 0:15:37,000
we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.

337
0:15:37.575,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So we know that the principles and the rules,

338
0:15:39.747,000 --> 0:15:42,000
if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms,

339
0:15:42.793,000 --> 0:15:43,000
the hope is that they will be applied

340
0:15:44.609,000 --> 0:15:46,000
to other human diseases and human behaviors as well.

341
0:15:48.245,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I hope that what you've learned

342
0:15:49.795,000 --> 0:15:51,000
is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.

343
0:15:52.166,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So by using these two molecules,

344
0:15:53.72,000 --> 0:15:55,000
they can say "me" and they can say "you."

345
0:15:56.003,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And again, of course, that's what we do,

346
0:15:58.004,000 --> 0:16:01,000
both in a molecular way, and also in an outward way,

347
0:16:01.49,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but I think about the molecular stuff.

348
0:16:03.443,000 --> 0:16:05,000
This is exactly what happens in your body.

349
0:16:05.485,000 --> 0:16:08,000
It's not like your heart cells and kidney cells get all mixed up every day,

350
0:16:09.104,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on,

351
0:16:11.879,000 --> 0:16:14,000
these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is

352
0:16:15.08,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and what their tasks should be.

353
0:16:16.978,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So again, we think bacteria invented that,

354
0:16:20.08,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles,

355
0:16:22.639,000 --> 0:16:26,000
but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study.

356
0:16:26.984,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And the final thing is, just to reiterate that there's this practical part,

357
0:16:30.708,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and so we've made these anti-quorum-sensing molecules

358
0:16:33.77,000 --> 0:16:35,000
that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.

359
0:16:36.38,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria

360
0:16:39.874,000 --> 0:16:4,000
that live on the earth,

361
0:16:41.422,000 --> 0:16:43,000
we've also made pro-quorum-sensing molecules.

362
0:16:43.985,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.

363
0:16:47.24,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So remember, you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells

364
0:16:50.769,000 --> 0:16:52,000
in you or on you, keeping you healthy.

365
0:16:52.841,000 --> 0:16:55,000
What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation

366
0:16:56.168,000 --> 0:16:58,000
of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you,

367
0:16:58.928,000 --> 0:17:,000
in the hopes of making you more healthy,

368
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:02,000
making those conversations better,

369
0:17:02.765,000 --> 0:17:04,000
so bacteria can do things that we want them to do

370
0:17:05.674,000 --> 0:17:07,000
better than they would be on their own.

371
0:17:08.897,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Finally, I wanted to show you --

372
0:17:10.992,000 --> 0:17:12,000
this is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.

373
0:17:13.2,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.

374
0:17:17.065,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And I hope when you learn things, like about how the natural world works --

375
0:17:20.633,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper

376
0:17:23.868,000 --> 0:17:26,000
or you hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world,

377
0:17:27.262,000 --> 0:17:28,000
it was done by a child.

378
0:17:28.785,000 --> 0:17:3,000
So science is done by that demographic.

379
0:17:31.123,000 --> 0:17:34,000
All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old,

380
0:17:34.52,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country.

381
0:17:39.081,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And it's a really lucky demographic to work with.

382
0:17:41.46,000 --> 0:17:42,000
(Applause)

383
0:17:42.486,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I keep getting older and older, and they're always the same age.

384
0:17:45.512,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And it's just a crazy, delightful job.

385
0:17:47.706,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And I want to thank you for inviting me here,

386
0:17:49.925,000 --> 0:17:52,000
it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.

387
0:17:52.968,000 --> 0:17:54,000
(Applause)

388
0:17:57.724,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Thanks.

389
0:17:58.946,000 --> 0:18:,000
(Applause)

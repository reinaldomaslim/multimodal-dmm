1
0:00:09.84,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I must warn you that at some point

2
0:00:12.72,000 --> 0:00:18,000
during the next 4 days your brain might

3
0:00:15.78,000 --> 0:00:23,000
explode by then you won't even care it's

4
0:00:19.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
time for Ted the Africans are the green

5
0:00:24.18,000 --> 0:00:27,000
down here they still remain here this is

6
0:00:26.01,000 --> 0:00:3,000
India Indonesia is moving on pretty fast

7
0:00:27.96,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and in the 80s here you have Bangladesh

8
0:00:30.57,000 --> 0:00:33,000
still among the African countries there

9
0:00:32.55,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but not Bangladesh it's a miracle that

10
0:00:34.41,000 --> 0:00:38,000
happens in the 80s the Imams start to

11
0:00:36.9,000 --> 0:00:4,000
promote Family Planning and they move up

12
0:00:38.82,000 --> 0:00:43,000
into that corner and in 90s we have the

13
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:45,000
terrible HIV epidemic that takes down

14
0:00:44.34,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the life expectancy of the African

15
0:00:46.5,000 --> 0:00:5,000
countries and all the rest of the mall

16
0:00:48.45,000 --> 0:00:52,000
moves up into the corner where we have

17
0:00:51.059,000 --> 0:00:57,000
long lives and small family and we have

18
0:00:53.43,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a completely new world the bacteria we

19
0:00:58.02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was had no idea of what we are today and

20
0:01:01.67,000 --> 0:01:08,000
today we have no idea of what we shall

21
0:01:05.22,000 --> 0:01:12,000
be in 4 billion years and this territory

22
0:01:08.94,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is fantastic that it's out poetry it's

23
0:01:12.75,000 --> 0:01:15,000
just it's just fascinating that every

24
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
single person you meet is doing

25
0:01:16.319,000 --> 0:01:19,000
something incredible and I was thinking

26
0:01:18.149,000 --> 0:01:23,000
about this what to talk about it Ted

27
0:01:19.319,000 --> 0:01:24,000
when I talked to the the kind rep from

28
0:01:23.399,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Ted and I said listen you know what

29
0:01:25.259,000 --> 0:01:29,000
should I talk about he said don't worry

30
0:01:26.67,000 --> 0:01:3,000
about it just just be profound

31
0:01:29.439,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it's the impression you get of just this

32
0:01:31.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
huge diversity of expertise and passion

33
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and I've never been to a conference

34
0:01:35.77,000 --> 0:01:38,000
before where people are actually pushing

35
0:01:37.149,000 --> 0:01:39,000
people decide to get into the room it's

36
0:01:38.979,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a normally the other way around you know

37
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
people are scrambling to get out

38
0:01:49.09,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I'm a witness and I want my testimony to

39
0:01:53.06,000 --> 0:01:58,000
be honest and uncensored I also want it

40
0:01:56.27,000 --> 0:02:,000
to be powerful and eloquent and to do as

41
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
much justice as possible to the

42
0:02:00.799,000 --> 0:02:05,000
experience of the people I'm

43
0:02:02.27,000 --> 0:02:08,000
photographing we have a chance here to

44
0:02:05.86,000 --> 0:02:1,000
prove that a country that almost

45
0:02:08.42,000 --> 0:02:13,000
slaughtered itself out of existence can

46
0:02:11.09,000 --> 0:02:17,000
practice reconciliation and provide

47
0:02:14.209,000 --> 0:02:2,000
comprehensive quality health care with

48
0:02:17.269,000 --> 0:02:21,000
minimal outside health being up on the

49
0:02:20.989,000 --> 0:02:22,000
stage

50
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:24,000
doesn't matter if it's 350 in the

51
0:02:23.51,000 --> 0:02:26,000
audience or not it feels like it's

52
0:02:24.799,000 --> 0:02:29,000
thousands because it really is this

53
0:02:27.17,000 --> 0:02:32,000
intimidating the crazy space but I got

54
0:02:30.56,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to tell you it really is a loving

55
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
atmosphere people who here want you to

56
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
do really well when you're sharing ideas

57
0:02:36.11,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and suddenly you are more than the font

58
0:02:39.65,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of the ideas I mean you are like a

59
0:02:41.239,000 --> 0:02:44,000
preacher and you can almost feel a

60
0:02:43.28,000 --> 0:02:46,000
transformation them suddenly they're

61
0:02:44.989,000 --> 0:02:46,000
saying wow this is really interesting

62
0:02:46.34,000 --> 0:02:49,000
wow this is the most interesting they

63
0:02:47.87,000 --> 0:02:5,000
haven't heard about well I love this

64
0:02:49.34,000 --> 0:02:54,000
idea if anybody just stays in their own

65
0:02:51.65,000 --> 0:02:56,000
little world they miss maybe the right

66
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
way to affect the rest of the world when

67
0:02:57.41,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the experts rise to the challenge of

68
0:03:00.17,000 --> 0:03:03,000
doing this they actually surprise

69
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
themselves they actually learn something

70
0:03:03.41,000 --> 0:03:06,000
more about their own subject they learn

71
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
something more in particular about how

72
0:03:07.1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to convey it this opens my eyes to a new

73
0:03:09.38,000 --> 0:03:16,000
way of articulating something I knew

74
0:03:12.6,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but I I didn't yet know how to make it

75
0:03:16.96,000 --> 0:03:21,000
unforgettable Ted is about releasing

76
0:03:19.42,000 --> 0:03:25,000
power intellectual power emotional power

77
0:03:22.75,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and the power of contribution in the

78
0:03:25.6,000 --> 0:03:29,000
world this is the song they played over

79
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the loudspeakers in Tiananmen Square

80
0:03:29.83,000 --> 0:03:34,000
during the revolution this is the songs

81
0:03:33.09,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which they played in Berlin when the

82
0:03:35.62,000 --> 0:03:39,000
wall fell down this is the song to the

83
0:03:37.99,000 --> 0:03:41,000
possibility that human beings are and I

84
0:03:40.45,000 --> 0:03:43,000
say that's who you

85
0:03:42.25,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I guess those of us would have been

86
0:03:44.38,000 --> 0:03:5,000
around Ted for a while cause things like

87
0:03:47.98,000 --> 0:03:5,000
this Ted moments

88
0:04:12.31,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you

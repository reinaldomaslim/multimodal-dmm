1
0:00:13.015,000 --> 0:00:16,000
If you've been thinking about US politics

2
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and trying to make sense of it for the last year or so,

3
0:00:20.807,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you might have hit on something like the following three propositions:

4
0:00:25.046,000 --> 0:00:29,000
one, US partisanship has never been so bad before;

5
0:00:31.212,000 --> 0:00:32,000
two,

6
0:00:32.792,000 --> 0:00:35,000
for the first time, it's geographically spatialized --

7
0:00:36.59,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we're divided between the coasts, which want to look outwards,

8
0:00:40.561,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the center of the country, which wants to look inwards;

9
0:00:43.702,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and third,

10
0:00:45.005,000 --> 0:00:47,000
there's nothing we can do about it.

11
0:00:49.23,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm here to today to say that all three of these propositions,

12
0:00:52.935,000 --> 0:00:54,000
all of which sound reasonable,

13
0:00:54.963,000 --> 0:00:55,000
are not true.

14
0:00:57.075,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In fact,

15
0:00:58.3,000 --> 0:01:01,000
our US partisanship goes all the way back

16
0:01:01.645,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to the very beginning of the republic.

17
0:01:05.427,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It was geographically spatialized in almost eerily the same way

18
0:01:10.534,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that it is today,

19
0:01:11.851,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and it often has been throughout US history.

20
0:01:15.822,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And last,

21
0:01:16.996,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and by far most importantly,

22
0:01:19.394,000 --> 0:01:23,000
we actually have an extraordinary mechanism

23
0:01:23.72,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that's designed to help us manage factional disagreement and partisanship.

24
0:01:29.613,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That technology is the Constitution.

25
0:01:33.261,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And this is an evolving, subtly, supplely designed entity

26
0:01:39.179,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that has the specific purpose

27
0:01:40.743,000 --> 0:01:43,000
of teaching us how to manage factional disagreement

28
0:01:44.252,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where it's possible to do that,

29
0:01:46.17,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and giving us techniques for overcoming that disagreement

30
0:01:49.875,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when that's possible.

31
0:01:51.951,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, in order to tell you the story,

32
0:01:54.486,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I want to go back to a pivotal moment in US history,

33
0:01:58.774,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and that is the moment

34
0:01:59.953,000 --> 0:02:02,000
when factional disagreement and partisanship was born.

35
0:02:03.977,000 --> 0:02:04,000
There actually was a birth moment --

36
0:02:05.82,000 --> 0:02:08,000
a moment in US history when partisanship snapped into place.

37
0:02:10.781,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The person who's at the core of that story is James Madison.

38
0:02:16.192,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And at the moment that this began,

39
0:02:18.945,000 --> 0:02:2,000
James Madison was riding high.

40
0:02:22.18,000 --> 0:02:26,000
He himself was the Einstein of not only the US Constitution,

41
0:02:26.675,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but of constitutional thought more globally,

42
0:02:29.164,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and, to give him his due,

43
0:02:31.217,000 --> 0:02:32,000
he knew it.

44
0:02:33.325,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In a period of time of just three years,

45
0:02:36.443,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from 1785 to 1788,

46
0:02:38.825,000 --> 0:02:44,000
he had conceived, theorized, designed, passed and gotten ratified

47
0:02:45.248,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the US Constitution.

48
0:02:46.813,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And just to give you some sense of the enormity

49
0:02:49.074,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of what that accomplishment actually was,

50
0:02:51.17,000 --> 0:02:53,000
although Madison couldn't have known it at the time,

51
0:02:54.089,000 --> 0:02:59,000
today that same constitutional technology that he invented is still in use

52
0:02:59.424,000 --> 0:03:,000
not only in the US,

53
0:03:01.129,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but, 230 years later,

54
0:03:02.637,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in places like Canada,

55
0:03:05.004,000 --> 0:03:06,000
India,

56
0:03:06.848,000 --> 0:03:07,000
South Africa,

57
0:03:08.395,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Brazil.

58
0:03:10.017,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So in an extraordinary range of contexts all over the world,

59
0:03:12.921,000 --> 0:03:14,000
this technology is still the dominant,

60
0:03:15.025,000 --> 0:03:18,000
most used, most effective technology to manage governance.

61
0:03:19.996,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In that moment,

62
0:03:21.961,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Madison believed that, having solved this problem,

63
0:03:25.557,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the country would run smoothly,

64
0:03:27.196,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and that he had designed a technology

65
0:03:29.028,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that would minimize the results of factions

66
0:03:32.098,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so there would be no political parties.

67
0:03:34.294,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Remarkably, he thought he had designed a constitution

68
0:03:36.827,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that was against political parties

69
0:03:38.55,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and would make them unnecessary.

70
0:03:40.5,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He had gotten an enormous degree of help

71
0:03:42.43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in the final marketing phase of his constitutional project

72
0:03:46.297,000 --> 0:03:49,000
from a man you may have heard of, called Alexander Hamilton.

73
0:03:50.493,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, Hamilton was everything Madison was not.

74
0:03:54.314,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He was passionate, where Madison was restrained.

75
0:03:58.729,000 --> 0:03:59,000
He was pansexual,

76
0:04:00.601,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where Madison didn't speak to a woman except for once

77
0:04:03.465,000 --> 0:04:04,000
until he was 42 years old,

78
0:04:05.079,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and then married Dolley and lived happily ever after for 40 years.

79
0:04:08.756,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:10.383,000 --> 0:04:11,000
To put it bluntly,

81
0:04:11.567,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Hamilton's the kind of person

82
0:04:12.998,000 --> 0:04:14,000
about whom you would write a hip-hop musical --

83
0:04:15.251,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:16.302,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and Madison is the kind of person

85
0:04:17.914,000 --> 0:04:19,000
about whom you would not write a hip-hop musical.

86
0:04:20.343,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:21.387,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all.

88
0:04:24.372,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But together,

89
0:04:25.565,000 --> 0:04:27,000
they had become a rather unlikely pairing,

90
0:04:27.661,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and they had produced the Federalist Papers,

91
0:04:29.734,000 --> 0:04:31,000
which offered a justification

92
0:04:31.83,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and, as I mentioned,

93
0:04:33.019,000 --> 0:04:35,000
a marketing plan for the Constitution,

94
0:04:35.279,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which had been wildly effective and wildly successful.

95
0:04:40.529,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Once the new government was in place,

96
0:04:42.323,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury,

97
0:04:44.494,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and he had a very specific idea in mind.

98
0:04:47.208,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And that was

99
0:04:48.385,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to do for financial institutions and infrastructure

100
0:04:51.38,000 --> 0:04:54,000
exactly what Madison had done for constitutions.

101
0:04:55.665,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Again, his contemporaries all knew it.

102
0:04:57.868,000 --> 0:04:58,000
One of them told Madison,

103
0:04:59.726,000 --> 0:05:,000
who can't have liked it very much,

104
0:05:01.503,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that Hamilton was the Newton of infrastructure.

105
0:05:05.394,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The idea was pretty straightforward.

106
0:05:07.575,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Hamilton would give the United States a national bank,

107
0:05:10.97,000 --> 0:05:13,000
a permanent national debt --

108
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:16,000
he said it would be "immortal," his phrase --

109
0:05:17.667,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and a manufacturing policy that would enable trade and manufacturing

110
0:05:23.27,000 --> 0:05:24,000
rather than agriculture,

111
0:05:24.852,000 --> 0:05:27,000
which was where the country's primary wealth had historically been.

112
0:05:29.458,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Madison went utterly ballistic.

113
0:05:32.604,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And in this pivotal, critical decision,

114
0:05:35.659,000 --> 0:05:39,000
instead of just telling the world that his old friend Hamilton was wrong

115
0:05:39.93,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and was adopting the wrong policies,

116
0:05:42.653,000 --> 0:05:43,000
he actually began to argue

117
0:05:44.439,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that Hamilton's ideas were unconstitutional --

118
0:05:47.564,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that they violated the very nature of the Constitution

119
0:05:50.558,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that the two of them had drafted together.

120
0:05:54.317,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Hamilton responded the way you would expect.

121
0:05:58.194,000 --> 0:06:03,000
He declared Madison to be his "personal and political enemy" --

122
0:06:03.279,000 --> 0:06:04,000
these are his words.

123
0:06:04.848,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So these two founders who had been such close friends and such close allies

124
0:06:08.831,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and such partners,

125
0:06:10.097,000 --> 0:06:12,000
then began to produce enmity.

126
0:06:13.782,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And they did it in the good, old-fashioned way.

127
0:06:16.054,000 --> 0:06:17,000
First, they founded political parties.

128
0:06:17.924,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Madison created a party originally called the Democratic Republican Party --

129
0:06:21.532,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"Republican" for short --

130
0:06:22.766,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and Hamilton created a party called the Federalist Party.

131
0:06:26.493,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Those two parties adopted positions on national politics

132
0:06:30.164,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that were extreme and exaggerated.

133
0:06:32.905,000 --> 0:06:33,000
To give you a clear example:

134
0:06:34.663,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Madison, who had always believed

135
0:06:36.235,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that the country would have some manufacturing and some trade

136
0:06:39.348,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and some agriculture,

137
0:06:40.942,000 --> 0:06:42,000
began attacking Hamilton

138
0:06:43.174,000 --> 0:06:46,000
as a kind of tool of the financial markets

139
0:06:47.372,000 --> 0:06:51,000
whom Hamilton himself intended to put in charge of the country.

140
0:06:52.71,000 --> 0:06:53,000
That was an overstatement,

141
0:06:54.024,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but it was something Madison came to believe.

142
0:06:56.168,000 --> 0:06:57,000
He also attacked city life,

143
0:06:58.061,000 --> 0:07:,000
and he said that the coasts were corrupt,

144
0:07:00.89,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and what people needed to do was to look inwards

145
0:07:03.545,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to the center of the country,

146
0:07:05.282,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to farmers, who were the essence of Republican virtue,

147
0:07:09.119,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and they should go back to the values that had made American great,

148
0:07:12.995,000 --> 0:07:14,000
specifically the values of the Revolution,

149
0:07:15.837,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and those were the values of low taxes,

150
0:07:18.362,000 --> 0:07:19,000
agriculture

151
0:07:19.547,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and less trade.

152
0:07:21.411,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Hamilton responded to this by saying that Madison was naïve,

153
0:07:26.112,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that he was childish,

154
0:07:28.28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and that his goal was to turn the United States

155
0:07:30.745,000 --> 0:07:31,000
into a primitive autarchy,

156
0:07:32.564,000 --> 0:07:35,000
self-reliant and completely ineffectual on the global scale.

157
0:07:36.423,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:37.958,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They both meant it,

159
0:07:39.687,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and there was some truth to each of their claims,

160
0:07:42.066,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because each side was grossly exaggerating the views of the other

161
0:07:46.432,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in order to fight their war.

162
0:07:48.902,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They founded newspapers,

163
0:07:51.059,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and so for the first time in US history,

164
0:07:53.028,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the news that people received came entirely through the lens

165
0:07:58.012,000 --> 0:08:,000
of either the Republican or the Federalist party.

166
0:08:03.059,000 --> 0:08:04,000
How does this end?

167
0:08:05.251,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Well, as it turned out, the Constitution did its work.

168
0:08:09.939,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But it did its work in surprising ways

169
0:08:13.023,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that Madison himself had not fully anticipated.

170
0:08:18.827,000 --> 0:08:19,000
First, there was a series of elections.

171
0:08:21.238,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the first two times out of the box,

172
0:08:23.853,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the Federalists destroyed the Republicans.

173
0:08:28.86,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Madison was astonished.

174
0:08:31.978,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Of course, he blamed the press.

175
0:08:33.682,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:36.044,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And in a rather innovative view --

177
0:08:38.367,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Madison never failed to innovate when he thought about anything --

178
0:08:41.577,000 --> 0:08:43,000
he said the reason that the press was so pro-Federalist

179
0:08:44.266,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is that the advertisers were all Federalists,

180
0:08:47.665,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because they were traders on the coasts who got their capital from Britain,

181
0:08:52.416,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which Federalism was in bed with.

182
0:08:55.796,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That was his initial explanation.

183
0:08:58.232,000 --> 0:09:,000
But despite the fact that the Federalists,

184
0:09:00.304,000 --> 0:09:01,000
once in power,

185
0:09:01.479,000 --> 0:09:06,000
actually enacted laws that criminalized criticism of the government --

186
0:09:06.728,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that happened in the United States --

187
0:09:09.746,000 --> 0:09:1,000
nevertheless,

188
0:09:11.535,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the Republicans fought back,

189
0:09:13.246,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and Madison began to emphasize the freedom of speech,

190
0:09:16.573,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which he had built into the Bill of Rights,

191
0:09:19.085,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and the capacity of civil society

192
0:09:21.244,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to organize.

193
0:09:22.634,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And sure enough, nationally,

194
0:09:25.28,000 --> 0:09:29,000
small local groups -- they were called Democratic-Republican Societies --

195
0:09:29.667,000 --> 0:09:33,000
began to form and protest against Federalist-dominated hegemony.

196
0:09:35.136,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Eventually, the Republicans managed to win a national election --

197
0:09:40.397,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that was in 1800.

198
0:09:42.585,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Madison became the Secretary of State,

199
0:09:44.829,000 --> 0:09:46,000
his friend and mentor Jefferson became president,

200
0:09:47.543,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and they actually, over time,

201
0:09:49.789,000 --> 0:09:53,000
managed to put the Federalists completely out of business.

202
0:09:54.665,000 --> 0:09:55,000
That was their goal.

203
0:09:57.826,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Now, why did that happen?

204
0:10:00.668,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It happened because in the structure of the Constitution

205
0:10:04.513,000 --> 0:10:07,000
were several features that actually managed faction

206
0:10:08.297,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the way there were supposed to do in the first place.

207
0:10:10.851,000 --> 0:10:11,000
What were those?

208
0:10:12.515,000 --> 0:10:14,000
One -- most important of all --

209
0:10:14.815,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the freedom of speech.

210
0:10:16.653,000 --> 0:10:18,000
This was an innovative idea at the time.

211
0:10:18.834,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Namely, that if you were out of power,

212
0:10:21.117,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you could still say that the government was terrible.

213
0:10:24.96,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Two,

214
0:10:26.89,000 --> 0:10:27,000
civil society organization.

215
0:10:29.051,000 --> 0:10:33,000
The capacity to put together private groups, individuals,

216
0:10:33.189,000 --> 0:10:34,000
political parties and others

217
0:10:34.82,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who would organize to try to bring about fundamental change.

218
0:10:39.933,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Perhaps most significantly was the separation of powers --

219
0:10:44.154,000 --> 0:10:46,000
an extraordinary component of the Constitution.

220
0:10:47.139,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The thing about the separation of powers

221
0:10:49.111,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is that it did then and it does now,

222
0:10:51.609,000 --> 0:10:54,000
drive governance to the center.

223
0:10:56.126,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You can get elected to office in the United States

224
0:10:59.462,000 --> 0:11:,000
with help from the periphery,

225
0:11:01.454,000 --> 0:11:02,000
right or left.

226
0:11:03.476,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It turns out,

227
0:11:04.76,000 --> 0:11:09,000
you actually can't govern unless you bring on board the center.

228
0:11:10.98,000 --> 0:11:13,000
There are midterm elections that come incredibly fast

229
0:11:14.722,000 --> 0:11:15,000
after a presidency begins.

230
0:11:17.777,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Those drive presidents towards the center.

231
0:11:21.168,000 --> 0:11:25,000
There's a structure in which the president, in fact, does not rule

232
0:11:25.497,000 --> 0:11:26,000
or even govern,

233
0:11:26.932,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but can only propose laws which other people have to agree with --

234
0:11:31.572,000 --> 0:11:33,000
another feature that tends to drive presidents

235
0:11:34.178,000 --> 0:11:35,000
who actually want to get things done

236
0:11:35.96,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to the center.

237
0:11:37.553,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And a glance at the newspapers today will reveal to you

238
0:11:41.809,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that these principles are still completely in operation.

239
0:11:46.351,000 --> 0:11:48,000
No matter how a president gets elected,

240
0:11:48.505,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the president cannot get anything done

241
0:11:52.005,000 --> 0:11:55,000
unless the president first of all follows the rules of the Constitution,

242
0:11:55.715,000 --> 0:11:56,000
because if not,

243
0:11:56.895,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the courts will stand up, as indeed has sometimes occurred,

244
0:12:00.216,000 --> 0:12:02,000
not only recently, but in the past, in US history.

245
0:12:03.1,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And furthermore,

246
0:12:04.277,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the president needs people,

247
0:12:05.871,000 --> 0:12:08,000
elected officials who know they need to win election

248
0:12:08.967,000 --> 0:12:09,000
from centrist voters,

249
0:12:10.436,000 --> 0:12:14,000
also to back his or her policies in order to pass laws.

250
0:12:15.562,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Without it, nothing much happens.

251
0:12:19.865,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The takeaway of this brief excursus

252
0:12:23.461,000 --> 0:12:27,000
into the history of partisanship, then, is the following:

253
0:12:29.498,000 --> 0:12:3,000
partisanship is real;

254
0:12:32.048,000 --> 0:12:33,000
it's profound;

255
0:12:34.009,000 --> 0:12:36,000
it's extraordinarily powerful,

256
0:12:36.465,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and it's terribly upsetting.

257
0:12:39.495,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But the design of the Constitution is greater than partisanship.

258
0:12:46.278,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It enables us to manage partisanship when that's possible,

259
0:12:50.735,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and it enables us actually to overcome partisan division

260
0:12:56.735,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and produce compromise,

261
0:12:58.407,000 --> 0:13:,000
when and only when that is possible.

262
0:13:03.083,000 --> 0:13:06,000
A technology like that is a technology that worked

263
0:13:06.609,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for the founders,

264
0:13:08.35,000 --> 0:13:1,000
it worked for their grandchildren,

265
0:13:12.084,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it didn't work at the moment of the Civil War,

266
0:13:14.316,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but then it started working again.

267
0:13:16.665,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And it worked for our grandparents,

268
0:13:18.99,000 --> 0:13:19,000
our parents,

269
0:13:20.568,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and it's going to work for us.

270
0:13:25.468,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Applause)

271
0:13:30.725,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So what you should do is really simple.

272
0:13:33.769,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Stand up for what you believe in,

273
0:13:36.387,000 --> 0:13:39,000
support the organizations that you care about,

274
0:13:39.617,000 --> 0:13:41,000
speak out on the issues that matter to you,

275
0:13:43.425,000 --> 0:13:44,000
get involved,

276
0:13:45.28,000 --> 0:13:46,000
make change,

277
0:13:46.819,000 --> 0:13:47,000
express you opinion,

278
0:13:48.738,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and do it with respect and knowledge and confidence

279
0:13:52.613,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that it's only by working together

280
0:13:55.491,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that the constitutional technology can do the job that it is designed to do.

281
0:14:00.997,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Stand up for what you believe,

282
0:14:02.714,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but take a deep breath while you do it.

283
0:14:05.358,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It's going to be OK.

284
0:14:09.067,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Thanks.

285
0:14:10.45,000 --> 0:14:14,000
(Applause)

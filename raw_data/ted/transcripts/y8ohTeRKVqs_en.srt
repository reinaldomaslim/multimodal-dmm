0:00:12.765,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Six months ago,

3
0:00:14.453,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I watched with bated breath

4
0:00:17.675,000 --> 0:00:21,000
as NASA's InSight lander descended towards the surface of Mars.

5
0:00:22.437,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Two hundred meters,

6
0:00:24.119,000 --> 0:00:25,000
80 meters,

7
0:00:25.472,000 --> 0:00:28,000
60, 40, 20, 17 meters.

8
0:00:29.808,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Receiving confirmation of successful touchdown

9
0:00:33.286,000 --> 0:00:36,000
was one of the most ecstatic moments of my life.

10
0:00:37.294,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And hearing that news was possible because of two small cube sets

11
0:00:42.954,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that went along to Mars with InSight.

12
0:00:46.453,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Those two cube sets essentially livestreamed InSight's telemetry

13
0:00:51.779,000 --> 0:00:52,000
back to Earth,

14
0:00:53.068,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so that we could watch in near-real time

15
0:00:55.832,000 --> 0:00:59,000
as that InSight lander went screaming towards the surface of the red planet,

16
0:01:00.738,000 --> 0:01:01,000
hitting the atmosphere of Mars

17
0:01:02.541,000 --> 0:01:05,000
at a top speed of about 12,000 miles per hour.

18
0:01:06.804,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, that event was livestreamed to us

19
0:01:09.824,000 --> 0:01:11,000
from over 90 million miles away.

20
0:01:13.064,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It was livestreamed from Mars.

21
0:01:17.484,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Meanwhile,

22
0:01:19.09,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the two Voyager spacecraft --

23
0:01:21.012,000 --> 0:01:25,000
now, these are these two almost unbelievably intrepid explorers.

24
0:01:25.822,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They were launched

25
0:01:27.022,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the same year that all of us here were being introduced to Han Solo

26
0:01:30.782,000 --> 0:01:31,000
for the first time.

27
0:01:32.61,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And they are still sending back data from interstellar space

28
0:01:36.402,000 --> 0:01:38,000
over 40 years later.

29
0:01:40.292,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We are sending more spacecraft further into deep space

30
0:01:43.522,000 --> 0:01:44,000
than ever before.

31
0:01:45.647,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But every one of those spacecraft out there

32
0:01:48.677,000 --> 0:01:5,000
depends on its navigation being performed

33
0:01:51.226,000 --> 0:01:52,000
right here at Earth

34
0:01:53.145,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to tell it where it is and, far more importantly,

35
0:01:56.006,000 --> 0:01:57,000
where it is going.

36
0:01:57.846,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And we have to do that navigation here on Earth for one simple reason:

37
0:02:02.222,000 --> 0:02:05,000
spacecraft are really bad at telling the time.

38
0:02:06.261,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But if we can change that,

39
0:02:08.293,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we can revolutionize the way we explore deep space.

40
0:02:12.448,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now, I am a deep space navigator,

41
0:02:14.913,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I know you're probably thinking, "What is that job?"

42
0:02:17.587,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Well, it is an extremely unique and also very fun job.

43
0:02:21.576,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I steer spacecraft,

44
0:02:23.529,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from the moment they separate from their launch vehicle

45
0:02:26.201,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to when they reach their destination in space.

46
0:02:28.955,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And these destinations -- say Mars for example, or Jupiter --

47
0:02:32.271,000 --> 0:02:33,000
they are really far away.

48
0:02:34.734,000 --> 0:02:36,000
To put my job in context for you:

49
0:02:37.208,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it's like me standing here in Los Angeles and shooting an arrow,

50
0:02:42.246,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and with that arrow, I hit a target that's the size of a quarter,

51
0:02:46.977,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and that target the size of a quarter is sitting in Times Square, New York.

52
0:02:52.295,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, I have the opportunity to adjust the course of my spacecraft

53
0:02:56.165,000 --> 0:02:58,000
a few times along that trajectory,

54
0:02:58.514,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but in order to do that, I need to know where it is.

55
0:03:02.852,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And tracking a spacecraft as it travels through deep space

56
0:03:06.026,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is fundamentally a problem of measuring time.

57
0:03:09.387,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You see, I can't just pull out my ruler and measure how far away my spacecraft is.

58
0:03:14.075,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But I can measure

59
0:03:15.316,000 --> 0:03:18,000
how long it takes a signal to get there and back again.

60
0:03:19.762,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And the concept is exactly the same as an echo.

61
0:03:23.116,000 --> 0:03:26,000
If I stand in front of a mountain and I shout,

62
0:03:26.513,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the longer it takes for me to hear my echo back at me,

63
0:03:30.164,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the further away that mountain is.

64
0:03:32.786,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So we measure that signal time very, very accurately,

65
0:03:38.296,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because getting it wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second

66
0:03:42.875,000 --> 0:03:46,000
might mean the difference between your spacecraft safely and gently landing

67
0:03:47.023,000 --> 0:03:48,000
on the surface of another planet

68
0:03:48.985,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or creating yet another crater on that surface.

69
0:03:52.69,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Just a tiny fraction of a second,

70
0:03:54.304,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and it can be the difference between a mission's life or death.

71
0:03:59.161,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So we measure that signal time very, very accurately here on Earth,

72
0:04:03.364,000 --> 0:04:05,000
down to better than one-billionth of a second.

73
0:04:06.823,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But it has to be measured here on Earth.

74
0:04:09.371,000 --> 0:04:13,000
There's this great imbalance of scale when it comes to deep space exploration.

75
0:04:15.051,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Historically, we have been able to send smallish things extremely far away,

76
0:04:21.702,000 --> 0:04:23,000
thanks to very large things here on our home planet.

77
0:04:24.905,000 --> 0:04:26,000
As an example, this is the size of a satellite dish

78
0:04:27.864,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that we use to talk to these spacecraft in deep space.

79
0:04:31.112,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And the atomic clocks that we use for navigation are also large.

80
0:04:35.032,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The clocks and all of their supporting hardware

81
0:04:37.474,000 --> 0:04:39,000
can be up to the size of a refrigerator.

82
0:04:40.643,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, if we even want to talk about sending that capability into deep space,

83
0:04:45.719,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that refrigerator needs to shrink down

84
0:04:47.643,000 --> 0:04:49,000
into something that can fit inside the produce drawer.

85
0:04:51.331,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So why does this matter?

86
0:04:53.878,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Well, let's revisit one of our intrepid explorers, Voyager 1.

87
0:04:59.157,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Voyager 1 is just over 13 billion miles away right now.

88
0:05:03.873,000 --> 0:05:05,000
As you know, it took over 40 years to get there,

89
0:05:06.595,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and it takes a signal traveling at the speed of light over 40 hours

90
0:05:11.836,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to get there and back again.

91
0:05:14.158,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And here's the thing about these spacecraft:

92
0:05:16.982,000 --> 0:05:18,000
they move really fast.

93
0:05:19.57,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And Voyager 1 doesn't stop and wait for us to send directions from Earth.

94
0:05:24.579,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Voyager 1 keeps moving.

95
0:05:26.802,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In that 40 hours that we are waiting

96
0:05:29.137,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to hear that echo signal here on the Earth,

97
0:05:31.724,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Voyager 1 has moved on by about 1.5 million miles.

98
0:05:36.344,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's 1.5 million miles further into largely uncharted territory.

99
0:05:41.687,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So it would be great

100
0:05:43.255,000 --> 0:05:46,000
if we could measure that signal time directly at the spacecraft.

101
0:05:47.851,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But the miniaturization of atomic clock technology is ...

102
0:05:51.424,000 --> 0:05:52,000
well, it's difficult.

103
0:05:53.543,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Not only does the clock technology and all the supporting hardware

104
0:05:56.815,000 --> 0:05:57,000
need to shrink down,

105
0:05:58.676,000 --> 0:06:,000
but you also need to make it work.

106
0:06:02.328,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Space is an exceptionally harsh environment,

107
0:06:05.483,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and if one piece breaks on this instrument,

108
0:06:07.881,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it's not like we can just send a technician out to replace the piece

109
0:06:11.136,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and continue on our way.

110
0:06:13.627,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The journeys that these spacecraft take can last months, years,

111
0:06:19.292,000 --> 0:06:2,000
even decades.

112
0:06:21.586,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And designing and building a precision instrument that can support that

113
0:06:26.421,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is as much an art as it is a science and an engineering.

114
0:06:32.131,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But there is good news: we are making some amazing progress,

115
0:06:36.274,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and we're about to take our very first baby steps

116
0:06:39.714,000 --> 0:06:42,000
into a new age of atomic space clocks.

117
0:06:43.54,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Soon we will be launching

118
0:06:45.232,000 --> 0:06:48,000
an ion-based atomic clock that is space-suitable.

119
0:06:48.596,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And this clock has the potential to completely flip the way we navigate.

120
0:06:52.466,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This clock is so stable,

121
0:06:54.385,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it measures time so well,

122
0:06:55.953,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that if I put it right here and I turned it on,

123
0:06:58.963,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and I walked away,

124
0:07:00.689,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I would have to come back nine million years later

125
0:07:03.886,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for that clock's measurement to be off by one second.

126
0:07:07.555,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So what can we do with a clock like this?

127
0:07:09.984,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Well, instead of doing all of the spacecraft navigation

128
0:07:13.539,000 --> 0:07:14,000
here on the Earth,

129
0:07:14.723,000 --> 0:07:16,000
what if we let the spacecraft navigate themselves?

130
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Onboard autonomous navigation, or a self-driving spacecraft, if you will,

131
0:07:21.895,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is one of the top technologies needed

132
0:07:23.968,000 --> 0:07:25,000
if we are going to survive in deep space.

133
0:07:27.343,000 --> 0:07:3,000
When we inevitably send humans to Mars or even further,

134
0:07:30.764,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we need to be navigating that ship in real time,

135
0:07:33.313,000 --> 0:07:35,000
not waiting for directions to come from Earth.

136
0:07:36.412,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And measuring that time wrong by just a tiny fraction of a second

137
0:07:39.781,000 --> 0:07:42,000
can mean the difference between a mission's life or death,

138
0:07:42.901,000 --> 0:07:45,000
which is bad enough for a robotic mission,

139
0:07:45.94,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but just think about the consequences if there was a human crew on board.

140
0:07:50.451,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But let's assume that we can get our astronauts

141
0:07:52.707,000 --> 0:07:54,000
safely to the surface of their destination.

142
0:07:54.764,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Once they're there, I imagine they'd like a way to find their way around.

143
0:07:58.366,000 --> 0:08:,000
Well, with this clock technology,

144
0:08:00.413,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we can now build GPS-like navigation systems

145
0:08:04.009,000 --> 0:08:06,000
at other planets and moons.

146
0:08:06.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Imagine having GPS on the Moon or Mars.

147
0:08:09.317,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Can you see an astronaut standing on the surface of Mars

148
0:08:12.626,000 --> 0:08:14,000
with Olympus Mons rising in the background,

149
0:08:15.4,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and she's looking down at her Google Maps Mars Edition

150
0:08:19.111,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to see where she is

151
0:08:20.664,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and to chart a course to get where she needs to go?

152
0:08:24.022,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Allow me to dream for a moment,

153
0:08:25.553,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and let's talk about something far, far in the future,

154
0:08:28.356,000 --> 0:08:32,000
when we are sending humans to places much further away than Mars,

155
0:08:32.44,000 --> 0:08:36,000
places where waiting for a signal from the Earth in order to navigate

156
0:08:37.077,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is just not realistic.

157
0:08:39.032,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Imagine in this scenario that we can have a constellation,

158
0:08:42.53,000 --> 0:08:46,000
a network of communication satellites scattered throughout deep space

159
0:08:47.122,000 --> 0:08:49,000
broadcasting navigation signals,

160
0:08:49.58,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and any spacecraft picking up that signal

161
0:08:52.323,000 --> 0:08:55,000
can travel from destination to destination to destination

162
0:08:55.718,000 --> 0:08:57,000
with no direct tie to the Earth at all.

163
0:08:59.981,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The ability to accurately measure time in deep space

164
0:09:03.498,000 --> 0:09:05,000
can forever change the way we navigate.

165
0:09:06.644,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But it also has the potential to give us some pretty cool science.

166
0:09:09.879,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You see, that same signal that we use for navigation

167
0:09:13.109,000 --> 0:09:15,000
tells us something about where it came from

168
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the journey that it took as it traveled from antenna to antenna.

169
0:09:20.693,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And that journey, that gives us data, data to build better models,

170
0:09:25.047,000 --> 0:09:29,000
better models of planetary atmospheres throughout our solar system.

171
0:09:30.169,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We can detect subsurface oceans on far-off icy moons,

172
0:09:34.854,000 --> 0:09:38,000
maybe even detect tiny ripples in space due to relativistic gravity.

173
0:09:40.224,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Onboard autonomous navigation means we can support more spacecraft,

174
0:09:44.921,000 --> 0:09:46,000
more sensors to explore the universe,

175
0:09:47.503,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and it also frees up navigators -- people like me --

176
0:09:51.515,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to work on finding the answers to other questions.

177
0:09:55.855,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And we still have a lot of questions to answer.

178
0:10:00.014,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We know such precious little about this universe around us.

179
0:10:05.376,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In recent years, we have discovered nearly 3,000 planetary systems

180
0:10:10.141,000 --> 0:10:12,000
outside of our own solar system,

181
0:10:12.763,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and those systems are home to almost 4,000 exoplanets.

182
0:10:16.992,000 --> 0:10:17,000
To put that number in context for you:

183
0:10:18.979,000 --> 0:10:21,000
when I was learning about planets for the first time as a child,

184
0:10:22.14,000 --> 0:10:23,000
there were nine,

185
0:10:24.017,000 --> 0:10:26,000
or eight if you didn't count Pluto.

186
0:10:26.094,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But now there are 4,000.

187
0:10:29.312,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It is estimated that dark matter

188
0:10:31.597,000 --> 0:10:34,000
makes up about 96 percent of our universe,

189
0:10:35.157,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and we don't even know what it is.

190
0:10:38.034,000 --> 0:10:4,000
All of the science returned

191
0:10:40.943,000 --> 0:10:42,000
from all of our deep space missions combined

192
0:10:43.92,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is just this single drop of knowledge

193
0:10:47.598,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in a vast ocean of questions.

194
0:10:50.919,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And if we want to learn more,

195
0:10:53.536,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to discover more, to understand more,

196
0:10:56.955,000 --> 0:10:57,000
then we need to explore more.

197
0:11:00.096,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The ability to accurately keep time in deep space

198
0:11:03.282,000 --> 0:11:07,000
will revolutionize the way that we can explore this universe,

199
0:11:07.451,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and it might just be one of the keys to unlocking some of those secrets

200
0:11:11.335,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that she holds so dear.

201
0:11:14.051,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Thank you.

202
0:11:15.35,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Applause)

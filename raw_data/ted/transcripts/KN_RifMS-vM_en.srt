1
0:00:12.569,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old,

2
0:00:15.113,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and when I was 13, I convinced

3
0:00:17.102,000 --> 0:00:18,000
one of the largest toy companies,

4
0:00:18.832,000 --> 0:00:2,000
toymakers, in the world, Hasbro,

5
0:00:21.235,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to change the way that they marketed

6
0:00:23.193,000 --> 0:00:25,000
one of their most best-selling products.

7
0:00:25.319,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So allow me to tell you about it.

8
0:00:26.639,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So I have a brother, Gavin.

9
0:00:28.456,000 --> 0:00:3,000
When this whole shebang happened, he was four.

10
0:00:30.875,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He loved to cook.

11
0:00:32.388,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge

12
0:00:34.606,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and mixing them into these, needless to say,

13
0:00:36.746,000 --> 0:00:37,000
uneatable concoctions,

14
0:00:38.135,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or making invisible macaroni and cheese.

15
0:00:41.176,000 --> 0:00:44,000
He wanted to be a chef really badly.

16
0:00:44.325,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And so what better gift for a kid who wanted to be a chef

17
0:00:47.69,000 --> 0:00:49,000
than an Easy-Bake Oven. Right?

18
0:00:49.93,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I mean, we all had those when we were little.

19
0:00:51.773,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And he wanted one so badly.

20
0:00:53.913,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But then he started to realize something.

21
0:00:56.532,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In the commercials, and on the boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens,

22
0:01:00.093,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls.

23
0:01:03.324,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And the way that they did this

24
0:01:04.829,000 --> 0:01:07,000
was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials,

25
0:01:07.935,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens

26
0:01:10.314,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it would be in bright pink and purple,

27
0:01:13.267,000 --> 0:01:16,000
very gender-specific colors to females, right?

28
0:01:16.608,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So it kind of was sending a message

29
0:01:19.193,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't.

30
0:01:22.158,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And this discouraged my brother a lot.

31
0:01:23.731,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef,

32
0:01:27.308,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because that was something that girls did.

33
0:01:29.165,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Girls cooked; boys didn't,

34
0:01:30.67,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or so was the message that Hasbro was sending.

35
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And this got me thinking,

36
0:01:35.146,000 --> 0:01:37,000
God, I wish there was a way that I could change this,

37
0:01:37.387,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro

38
0:01:40.393,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so I could ask them and tell them

39
0:01:42.17,000 --> 0:01:43,000
what they were doing wrong

40
0:01:43.489,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and ask them to change it.

41
0:01:44.882,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And that got me thinking about a website

42
0:01:46.7,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that I had learned about a few months prior

43
0:01:48.171,000 --> 0:01:49,000
called Change.org.

44
0:01:49.718,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform

45
0:01:53.051,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where you can create a petition and share it

46
0:01:55.498,000 --> 0:01:57,000
across all of these social media networks,

47
0:01:57.781,000 --> 0:01:58,000
through Facebook, through Twitter,

48
0:01:59.223,000 --> 0:02:,000
through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,

49
0:02:00.777,000 --> 0:02:01,000
through whatever you can think of.

50
0:02:02.646,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And so I created a petition

51
0:02:04.428,000 --> 0:02:07,000
along with the YouTube video that I added to the petition

52
0:02:07.642,000 --> 0:02:09,000
basically asking Hasbro

53
0:02:09.668,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to change the way that they marketed it,

54
0:02:11.915,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes,

55
0:02:14.938,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and most of all creating them

56
0:02:16.898,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in less gender-specific colors.

57
0:02:19.622,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So this petition started to take off --

58
0:02:23.02,000 --> 0:02:26,000
humongously fast, you have no idea.

59
0:02:26.387,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets

60
0:02:29.776,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and press outlets, and it was amazing.

61
0:02:33.352,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In three weeks, maybe three and a half,

62
0:02:35.968,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I had 46,000 signatures on this petition.

63
0:02:40.777,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Applause)

64
0:02:42.975,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Thank you.

65
0:02:44.749,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So, needless to say, it was crazy.

66
0:02:47.126,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters

67
0:02:51.732,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so they could go and unveil

68
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
their new Easy-Bake Oven product to me

69
0:02:55.778,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in black, silver and blue.

70
0:02:57.634,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It was literally one of the best moments of my life.

71
0:03:00.484,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It was like &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.&quot;

72
0:03:02.527,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That thing was amazing.

73
0:03:04.413,000 --> 0:03:05,000
What I didn't realize at the time, however,

74
0:03:06.083,000 --> 0:03:07,000
was that I had become an activist,

75
0:03:08.01,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I could change something,

76
0:03:09.584,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid,

77
0:03:12.591,000 --> 0:03:14,000
my voice mattered, and your voice matters too.

78
0:03:15.421,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I want to let you know it's not going to be easy,

79
0:03:17.022,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and it wasn't easy for me,

80
0:03:18.438,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because I faced a lot of obstacles.

81
0:03:21.25,000 --> 0:03:24,000
People online, and sometimes even in real life,

82
0:03:24.981,000 --> 0:03:26,000
were disrespectful to me and my family,

83
0:03:27.893,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time,

84
0:03:30.524,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and it really discouraged me.

85
0:03:31.988,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And actually, I have some examples, because what's better revenge

86
0:03:35.195,000 --> 0:03:37,000
than displaying their idiocy?

87
0:03:37.746,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So, let's see.

88
0:03:39.535,000 --> 0:03:41,000
From user name Liquidsore29 --

89
0:03:42.259,000 --> 0:03:44,000
interesting user names we have here—

90
0:03:44.268,000 --> 0:03:49,000
&quot;Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.&quot;

91
0:03:50.048,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Liquidsore29, really? Really? Okay.

92
0:03:52.803,000 --> 0:03:55,000
How about from Whiteboy77AGS:

93
0:03:56.643,000 --> 0:04:,000
"People always need something to (female dog) about."

94
0:04:00.792,000 --> 0:04:02,000
From Jeffrey Gutierrez:

95
0:04:03.082,000 --> 0:04:06,000
&quot;OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention.&quot;

96
0:04:06.098,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So it was comments like these

97
0:04:08.371,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future

98
0:04:11.171,000 --> 0:04:13,000
because I thought, people don't care,

99
0:04:13.628,000 --> 0:04:15,000
people think it's a waste of time,

100
0:04:16.034,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family.

101
0:04:19.893,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It hurt me, and it made me think,

102
0:04:22.316,000 --> 0:04:24,000
what's the point of making change in the future?

103
0:04:24.798,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But then I started to realize something.

104
0:04:27.455,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Haters gonna hate.

105
0:04:29.896,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Come on, say it with me. One, two, three:

106
0:04:31.67,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Haters gonna hate.

107
0:04:34.138,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So let your haters hate,

108
0:04:36.02,000 --> 0:04:37,000
you know what, and make your change,

109
0:04:37.704,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because I know you can.

110
0:04:39.545,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I look out into this crowd,

111
0:04:40.967,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I see 400 people

112
0:04:43.233,000 --> 0:04:46,000
who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change,

113
0:04:46.478,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can too

114
0:04:49.025,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in,

115
0:04:52.697,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and you can trade it across all these social media,

116
0:04:55.515,000 --> 0:04:57,000
through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,

117
0:04:58.401,000 --> 0:04:59,000
through whatever else you can think of.

118
0:05:00.291,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And you can make that change.

119
0:05:01.747,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You can take what you believe in

120
0:05:03.168,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and turn it into a cause and change it.

121
0:05:05.549,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today,

122
0:05:08.617,000 --> 0:05:1,000
you can use that spark that you have within you

123
0:05:11.253,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and turn it into a fire.

124
0:05:12.773,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Thank you.

125
0:05:14.549,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Applause)

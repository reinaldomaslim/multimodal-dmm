4
0:00:20.167,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Moderator: Our next speaker --

5
0:00:21.792,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:27.042,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is an --

7
0:00:30.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
incredibly --

8
0:00:34.958,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:36.583,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Is an incredibly experienced linguist

10
0:00:39.708,000 --> 0:00:42,000
working at a lab at MIT with a small group of researchers,

11
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and through studying our language

12
0:00:45.917,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and the way that we communicate with other people,

13
0:00:48.333,000 --> 0:00:51,000
he has stumbled upon the secret of human intimacy.

14
0:00:52.125,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Here to give us his perspective, please welcome to the stage,

15
0:00:55.042,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Anthony Veneziale.

16
0:00:56.375,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Applause)

17
0:01:05.375,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:10.917,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Anthony Veneziale: You might think I know what you're going through.

19
0:01:14.667,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You might be looking at me here on the red dot,

20
0:01:17.458,000 --> 0:01:2,000
or you might be looking at me on the screen.

21
0:01:20.75,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There's a one sixth of a second delay.

22
0:01:24.542,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Did I catch myself? I did.

23
0:01:27.583,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I could see myself before I turned,

24
0:01:30.958,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and that small delay creates a little bit of a divide.

25
0:01:35.042,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:39.792,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And a divide is exactly what happens with human language,

27
0:01:44.458,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and the processing of that language.

28
0:01:47.958,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I of course am working out of a small lab at MIT.

29
0:01:52.208,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:54.833,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And we are scraping for every insight that we can get.

31
0:01:58.208,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:59.292,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is not often associated with a computational challenge,

33
0:02:04.375,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but in this case, we found that persistence of vision

34
0:02:08.75,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and auditory intake

35
0:02:11.125,000 --> 0:02:14,000
actually have more in common than we ever realized,

36
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and we can see it in this first slide.

37
0:02:17.542,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:21.708,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Applause)

39
0:02:25.875,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Immediately your processing goes to, "Is that a hard-boiled egg?"

40
0:02:29.917,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:31.875,000 --> 0:02:35,000
"Is that perhaps the structural integrity of the egg

42
0:02:36.083,000 --> 0:02:39,000
being able to sustain the weight of what seems to be a rock?

43
0:02:39.292,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Aha, is it in fact a real rock?"

44
0:02:43.208,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We go to questions when we see visual information.

45
0:02:48.875,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But when we hear information, this is what happens.

46
0:02:53.25,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:56.583,000 --> 0:03:,000
The floodgates in our mind open much like the streets of Shanghai.

48
0:03:01.125,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Applause)

49
0:03:05.583,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So many pieces of information to process,

50
0:03:08.208,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so many ideas, concepts, feelings and, of course, vulnerabilities

51
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that we don't often wish to share.

52
0:03:14.375,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And so we hide,

53
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and we hide behind what we like to call the floodgate of intimacy.

54
0:03:20.5,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:22.917,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And what might that floodgate be holding?

56
0:03:25.583,000 --> 0:03:28,000
What is the dike upon which it is built?

57
0:03:28.917,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Well, first off --

58
0:03:30.917,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:36.292,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we found that it's different for six different genotypes.

60
0:03:40.5,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Applause)

61
0:03:49.958,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And, of course, we can start categorizing these genotypes

62
0:03:52.833,000 --> 0:03:56,000
into a neuronormative experience and a neurodiverse experience.

63
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:59.125,000 --> 0:04:,000
On the right-hand side of the screen,

65
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
you're seeing spikes for the neurodiverse thinking.

66
0:04:04.333,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, there are generally only two emotional states

67
0:04:06.75,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that a neurodiverse brain can tabulate and keep count of at any given time,

68
0:04:12.417,000 --> 0:04:17,000
thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be emotionally, sometimes,

69
0:04:18.25,000 --> 0:04:2,000
attuned to the present situation.

70
0:04:20.542,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But on the left-hand side, you can see the neuronormative brain,

71
0:04:24.083,000 --> 0:04:27,000
which can often handle about five different pieces

72
0:04:27.333,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of emotional cognitive information at any given time.

73
0:04:30.708,000 --> 0:04:32,000
These are the slight variances that you are seeing

74
0:04:33.541,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in the 75, 90 and 60 percentile,

75
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and then of course that dramatic difference

76
0:04:38.083,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of the 25, 40 and 35 percentile.

77
0:04:40.292,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:41.333,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But of course, what is the neural network

79
0:04:43.667,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that is helping to bridge and build these different discrepancies?

80
0:04:50.333,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:59.125,000 --> 0:05:,000
Fear.

82
0:05:00.417,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

83
0:05:02.292,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Applause)

84
0:05:08.167,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And as we all know, fear resides in the amygdala,

85
0:05:11.042,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and it is a very natural response,

86
0:05:13.333,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it is very closely linked with visual perception.

87
0:05:17.833,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It is not as closely linked with verbal perception,

88
0:05:21.042,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so our fear receptors often will be going off

89
0:05:24.042,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in advance of any of our cognitive usage around verbal and words

90
0:05:30.208,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and cues of language.

91
0:05:32.417,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So as we see these fear moments,

92
0:05:35.25,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we of course are taken aback.

93
0:05:38.042,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We stumble in a certain direction,

94
0:05:42.292,000 --> 0:05:44,000
generally away from the intimacy.

95
0:05:45.208,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:47.167,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Now of course, there's a difference between the male perception

97
0:05:50.542,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and the female perception

98
0:05:52.042,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and of trans and those who are in between, all of those as well,

99
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and outside of the gender spectrum.

100
0:05:58.167,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:01.542,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But fear is the central underlying underpinning

102
0:06:05.292,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of all of our response systems.

103
0:06:07.75,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Fight-or-flight is one of the earliest,

104
0:06:11.25,000 --> 0:06:14,000
some say reptilian, response to our environment.

105
0:06:15.25,000 --> 0:06:2,000
How can we disengage or unhook ourselves from the horns of the amygdala?

106
0:06:20.583,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:22.708,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Well, I'd like to tell you the secret right now.

108
0:06:25.667,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Applause)

109
0:06:33.583,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is all making much, much too much sense.

110
0:06:36.083,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:40.167,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The secret lies

112
0:06:43.375,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in turning our backs to one another,

113
0:06:46.625,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and I know that that sounds absolutely like the opposite

114
0:06:50.333,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of what you were expecting,

115
0:06:52.333,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but when in a relationship you turn your back to your partner

116
0:06:56.667,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and place your back upon their back --

117
0:06:59.417,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

118
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
you eliminate visual cues.

119
0:07:04.125,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

120
0:07:05.333,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Applause)

121
0:07:10.292,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You are more readily available

122
0:07:13.333,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to failing first,

123
0:07:17.167,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and failing first --

124
0:07:19.708,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

125
0:07:21.833,000 --> 0:07:26,000
far outweighs the lengths we go to

126
0:07:27.417,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to appeal to others,

127
0:07:29.833,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to our partners and to ourselves.

128
0:07:32.083,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We spend billions and billions of dollars

129
0:07:35.083,000 --> 0:07:38,000
on clothing, on makeup,

130
0:07:38.375,000 --> 0:07:4,000
on the latest trend of glasses,

131
0:07:42.667,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but what we don't spend money and time on

132
0:07:45.542,000 --> 0:07:47,000
is connecting with each other

133
0:07:48.458,000 --> 0:07:5,000
in a way that is truthful

134
0:07:50.708,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and honest

135
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and stripped of those visual receptors.

136
0:07:54.917,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

137
0:08:00.542,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

138
0:08:02.958,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It sounds hard, doesn't it?

139
0:08:04.708,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter)

140
0:08:13.917,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But we want to be aggressive about this.

141
0:08:17.375,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We don't want to just sit on the couch.

142
0:08:20.792,000 --> 0:08:21,000
As a historian said earlier today,

143
0:08:22.708,000 --> 0:08:27,000
it's important to get up and circumvent sometimes that couch.

144
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And how can we do it?

145
0:08:29.625,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Well yes, ice is a big part of it.

146
0:08:34.792,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Insights, compassion and empathy:

147
0:08:37.625,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I, C, E.

148
0:08:39.958,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Applause)

149
0:08:51.5,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And when we start using this ice method,

150
0:08:56.458,000 --> 0:09:,000
well, the possibilities become much bigger than us.

151
0:09:01.542,000 --> 0:09:04,000
In fact, they become smaller than you.

152
0:09:06.583,000 --> 0:09:08,000
On a molecular level,

153
0:09:08.958,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I believe that that insight

154
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is the unifying theme

155
0:09:13.833,000 --> 0:09:16,000
for every talk you have seen so far at TED

156
0:09:16.958,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and will continue as we of course embark

157
0:09:20.25,000 --> 0:09:25,000
on this journey here on this tiny planet,

158
0:09:25.5,000 --> 0:09:28,000
on the ledge, on the precipice,

159
0:09:28.625,000 --> 0:09:31,000
as we are seeing, yes, death is inevitable.

160
0:09:32.083,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

161
0:09:34.708,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Will it meet all of us at the same time,

162
0:09:37.292,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I think, is the variable we are inquiring.

163
0:09:39.75,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

164
0:09:46.375,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I think that timeline gets a bit longer

165
0:09:49.167,000 --> 0:09:5,000
when we use ice

166
0:09:50.667,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and when we rest our backs upon one another

167
0:09:55.458,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and build together,

168
0:09:57.083,000 --> 0:09:59,000
leaving behind the fear

169
0:09:59.125,000 --> 0:10:,000
and working towards --

170
0:10:01.5,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

171
0:10:14.125,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they'll edit this part out --

172
0:10:15.75,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

173
0:10:20.5,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a ripened experience of love,

174
0:10:24.667,000 --> 0:10:25,000
compassion,

175
0:10:26.167,000 --> 0:10:28,000
intimacy based on a truth

176
0:10:28.5,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that you are sharing from your mind's eye

177
0:10:32.208,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the heart that we all can touch,

178
0:10:36.5,000 --> 0:10:37,000
tactilely feel,

179
0:10:38.25,000 --> 0:10:42,000
have maybe potentially a mushy experience

180
0:10:42.708,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that we don't just throw out because it is browned,

181
0:10:47.333,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but let us slice in half the experience we have gathered,

182
0:10:53.5,000 --> 0:10:55,000
let us seed what the heart, the core,

183
0:10:56.375,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the seed of that idea in each of us is,

184
0:10:59.125,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and let us share it back to back.

185
0:11:01.25,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Thank you very much.

186
0:11:02.667,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause)

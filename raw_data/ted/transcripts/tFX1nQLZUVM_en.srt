1
0:00:12.771,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health?

2
0:00:16.135,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Cancer? Heart attacks? Diabetes?

3
0:00:19.603,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The answer is actually none of these;

4
0:00:21.449,000 --> 0:00:22,000
it's Alzheimer's disease.

5
0:00:23.25,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Every 67 seconds,

6
0:00:25.276,000 --> 0:00:27,000
someone in the United States is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

7
0:00:28.761,000 --> 0:00:31,000
As the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year 2050,

8
0:00:32.149,000 --> 0:00:35,000
caring for them, as well as the rest of the aging population,

9
0:00:35.446,000 --> 0:00:37,000
will become an overwhelming societal challenge.

10
0:00:38.585,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My family has experienced firsthand

11
0:00:40.465,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the struggles of caring for an Alzheimer's patient.

12
0:00:42.967,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Growing up in a family with three generations,

13
0:00:45.107,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I've always been very close to my grandfather.

14
0:00:47.262,000 --> 0:00:48,000
When I was four years old,

15
0:00:48.689,000 --> 0:00:5,000
my grandfather and I were walking in a park in Japan

16
0:00:51.192,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when he suddenly got lost.

17
0:00:52.497,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It was one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced in my life,

18
0:00:55.71,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and it was also the first instance that informed us

19
0:00:58.117,000 --> 0:01:,000
that my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease.

20
0:01:00.682,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Over the past 12 years, his condition got worse and worse,

21
0:01:04.025,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress.

22
0:01:07.823,000 --> 0:01:08,000
My aunt, his primary caregiver,

23
0:01:09.302,000 --> 0:01:12,000
really struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him,

24
0:01:12.349,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed.

25
0:01:15.047,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I became really concerned about my aunt's well-being

26
0:01:17.858,000 --> 0:01:18,000
as well as my grandfather's safety.

27
0:01:19.599,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I searched extensively for a solution that could help my family's problems,

28
0:01:23.13,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but couldn't find one.

29
0:01:24.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Then, one night about two years ago,

30
0:01:27.693,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed.

31
0:01:31.158,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The moment his foot landed on the floor,

32
0:01:33.15,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I thought, why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?

33
0:01:36.412,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed,

34
0:01:38.809,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight

35
0:01:42.516,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone.

36
0:01:45.971,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That way, my aunt could sleep much better at night

37
0:01:48.312,000 --> 0:01:5,000
without having to worry about my grandfather's wandering.

38
0:01:51.002,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So now I'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock.

39
0:01:57.134,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Could I please have my sock model on the stage?

40
0:02:00.831,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Great.

41
0:02:04.17,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So once the patient steps onto the floor --

42
0:02:07.95,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Ringing) --

43
0:02:09.51,000 --> 0:02:11,000
an alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone.

44
0:02:16.571,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Thank you. (Applause)

45
0:02:18.057,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Thank you, sock model.

46
0:02:24.045,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So this is a drawing of my preliminary design.

47
0:02:27.819,000 --> 0:02:29,000
My desire to create a sensor-based technology

48
0:02:30.441,000 --> 0:02:33,000
perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology.

49
0:02:33.979,000 --> 0:02:34,000
When I was six years old,

50
0:02:35.465,000 --> 0:02:37,000
an elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom

51
0:02:37.795,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and suffered severe injuries.

52
0:02:39.505,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I became concerned about my own grandparents

53
0:02:41.606,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and decided to invent a smart bathroom system.

54
0:02:43.958,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors

55
0:02:47.566,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom.

56
0:02:51.404,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Since I was only six years old at the time

57
0:02:53.416,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and I hadn't graduated from kindergarten yet,

58
0:02:55.739,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I didn't have the necessary resources and tools to translate my idea into reality,

59
0:03:00.073,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but nonetheless, my research experience

60
0:03:02.706,000 --> 0:03:06,000
really implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people.

61
0:03:06.957,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly.

62
0:03:12.944,000 --> 0:03:15,000
When I laid out my plan, I realized that I faced three main challenges:

63
0:03:16.425,000 --> 0:03:17,000
first, creating a sensor;

64
0:03:18.194,000 --> 0:03:19,000
second, designing a circuit;

65
0:03:19.773,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and third, coding a smartphone app.

66
0:03:21.519,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize

67
0:03:24.927,000 --> 0:03:26,000
than I initially had thought it to be.

68
0:03:26.982,000 --> 0:03:29,000
First, I had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough

69
0:03:30.476,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient's foot.

70
0:03:33.237,000 --> 0:03:36,000
After extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber,

71
0:03:36.656,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which I realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot,

72
0:03:40.191,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I decided to print a film sensor

73
0:03:41.758,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles.

74
0:03:44.66,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Once pressure is applied, the connectivity between the particles increases.

75
0:03:48.236,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Therefore, I could design a circuit that would measure pressure

76
0:03:51.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
by measuring electrical resistance.

77
0:03:53.267,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Next, I had to design a wearable wireless circuit,

78
0:03:56.026,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power

79
0:03:59.338,000 --> 0:04:,000
and requires heavy, bulky batteries.

80
0:04:01.101,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Thankfully, I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology,

81
0:04:04.728,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin-sized battery.

82
0:04:08.251,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night.

83
0:04:11.88,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Lastly, I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform

84
0:04:15.343,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the care-giver's smartphone into a remote monitor.

85
0:04:17.821,000 --> 0:04:2,000
For this, I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode

86
0:04:21.497,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices

87
0:04:24.984,000 --> 0:04:26,000
by watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks.

88
0:04:29.23,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Integrating these components, I was able to successfully create two prototypes,

89
0:04:33.019,000 --> 0:04:35,000
one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock,

90
0:04:35.347,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and another that's a re-attachable sensor assembly

91
0:04:37.743,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact

92
0:04:39.949,000 --> 0:04:4,000
with the bottom of the patient's foot.

93
0:04:41.782,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now,

94
0:04:44.682,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and it's had a 100 percent success rate

95
0:04:46.593,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wandering.

96
0:04:50.629,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Last summer, I was able to beta test my device

97
0:04:53.052,000 --> 0:04:55,000
at several residential care facilities in California,

98
0:04:55.598,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I'm currently incorporating the feedback

99
0:04:57.77,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to further improve the device into a marketable product.

100
0:05:00.733,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Testing the device on a number of patients

101
0:05:02.841,000 --> 0:05:04,000
made me realize that I needed to invent solutions

102
0:05:05.35,000 --> 0:05:07,000
for people who didn't want to wear socks to sleep at night.

103
0:05:08.805,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So sensor data, collected on a vast number of patients,

104
0:05:11.63,000 --> 0:05:13,000
can be useful for improving patient care

105
0:05:13.959,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and also leading to a cure for the disease, possibly.

106
0:05:16.777,000 --> 0:05:17,000
For example, I'm currently examining

107
0:05:18.62,000 --> 0:05:21,000
correlations between the frequency of a patient's nightly wandering

108
0:05:21.848,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and his or her daily activities and diet.

109
0:05:25.854,000 --> 0:05:27,000
One thing I'll never forget is when my device first caught

110
0:05:28.615,000 --> 0:05:3,000
my grandfather's wandering out of bed at night.

111
0:05:30.833,000 --> 0:05:32,000
At that moment, I was really struck by the power of technology

112
0:05:33.784,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to change lives for the better.

113
0:05:36.011,000 --> 0:05:38,000
People living happily and healthfully --

114
0:05:38.131,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that's the world that I imagine.

115
0:05:40.156,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Thank you very much.

116
0:05:42.216,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

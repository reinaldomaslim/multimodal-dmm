1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In 2007,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I decided that we needed to reconceptualize

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
how we thought about economic development.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Our new goal should be

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
they should be able to choose between

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
at least a handful

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of different cities

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that were all competing to attract new residents.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There are billions of people in developing countries

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But the amazing thing about cities

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is they're worth so much more

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
than it costs to build them.

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So we could easily supply the world

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with dozens, maybe hundreds,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of new cities.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now this might sound preposterous to you

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
if you've never thought about new cities.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But just substitute apartment building for cities.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the other half aren't there yet.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You could try and expand the capacity

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by doing additions on all the existing apartments.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But you know what you'd run into

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is those apartments and the surrounding areas

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
have rules to avoid discomfort

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and the distractions of construction.

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But you could go out someplace brand new,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
build a brand new apartment building,

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
as long as the rules there

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
were ones that facilitated construction

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
rather than getting in the way.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So I proposed

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that governments create new reform zones

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
big enough to hold cities

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and gave them a name: charter cities.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Later I learned that at about this same time,

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Javier and Octavio

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
were thinking about the challenge of reform

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in Honduras.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
would leave to go to the United States,

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and they wanted to ask, what could they do

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to make sure that those people could stay

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and do the same things in Honduras.

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
At one point, Javier said to Octavio,

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"What if we took some of our empty land --

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what if we just gave it to an embassy --

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and then if people want to go work

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they can go get jobs,

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
do everything they do on those embassy grounds

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In the summer of 2009,

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
At the next regularly scheduled election,

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Pepe Lobo won in a landslide

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on a platform that promised reform,

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but reconciliation as well.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Meanwhile, I was getting ready

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to give a talk at TEDGlobal.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Through a process of refinement,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
trial and error, a lot of user testing,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
down to the bare essentials.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The first point was the importance of rules,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
like those rules that say

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and it's usually the rules that hold us back.

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
He showed it to Javier.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They called me.

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So in December we met in Miami,

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in a hotel conference room.

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I tried to explain this point

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
about how valuable cities are,

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
how much more valuable they are than they cost.

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And I used this slide

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
showing how valuable the raw land is

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in a place like New York City:

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
per square meter.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But it was a fairly abstract discussion,

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and at some point when there was a pause,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Octavio said,

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughing)

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a charter city is a place

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
where you start with uninhabited land,

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and then a chance for people to opt in,

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to go live under those rules or not.

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So I was asked by the president of Honduras

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
who said that we need to do this project,

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
this is important,

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
this could be the way forward for our country.

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and talk again on January fourth and fifth.

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So I presented

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
another fact-filled lecture

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that included a slide like this,

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it has to be very big.

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This is a picture of Denver,

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This airport alone

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
covers more than 100 square kilometers.

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
if you build a new city,

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Everybody applauded politely.

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The faces in the audience

124
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
were very serious and attentive.

125
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I've got it here on my laptop."

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And it got to the essence,

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
which could be in Honduras,

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And it also involved new choices for leaders.

136
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
would need help from partner countries,

138
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who could benefit from partner countries

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
so everybody can trust

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that the charter really will be enforced.

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And the insight of President Lobo

143
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
was that that assurance of enforcement

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that I was thinking about

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
who had suffered for so many years

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
from fear and distrust.

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We went and looked at a site.

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This picture's from there.

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,

153
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
they voted in the congress to amend their constitution

154
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to have a constitutional provision

155
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that allows for special development regions.

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,

157
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment

158
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
was 124 to one.

159
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
All parties, all factions in society, backed this.

160
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.

161
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
On February 17th they passed it again

162
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
with another vote of 114 to one.

163
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Immediately after that vote,

164
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
on February 21st to the 24th,

165
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
a delegation of about 30 Hondurans

166
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
went to the two places in the world

167
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that are most interested in getting into the city building business.

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
One is South Korea.

169
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is a picture of a big, new city center

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that's being built in South Korea --

171
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
bigger than downtown Boston.

172
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Everything you see there was built in four years,

173
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
after they spent four years getting the permits.

174
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.

175
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
They've actually built two cities already in China

176
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and are preparing the third.

177
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So if you think about this practically,

178
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
here's where we are.

179
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.

180
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They're putting in place a legal system

181
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that could allow for managers to come in,

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and also an external legal system.

183
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court

184
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.

185
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
There's designers and builders of cities

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
who are very interested.

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They even can bring with them some financing.

188
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But the one thing you know they've already solved

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is that there's lots of tenants.

190
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
especially in a place with a free trade zone,

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Around the world, there's 700 million people

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
There's a million a year

196
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who leave Latin America to go to the United States.

197
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Many of these are a father

198
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --

199
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
sometimes a single mother

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Sadly, sometimes there are even children

202
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who are trying to get reunited with their parents

203
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.

204
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So what kind of an idea is it

205
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?

206
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Or to build a dozen of these,

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
or a hundred of these, around the world?

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
What kind of an idea is it

209
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to think about insisting

210
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that every family have a choice of several cities

211
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that are competing to attract new residents?

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This is an idea worth spreading.

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And my friends from Honduras

214
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
asked me to say thank you, TED.

215
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Applause)

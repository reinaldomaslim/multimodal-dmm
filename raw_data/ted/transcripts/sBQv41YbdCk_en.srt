1
0:00:13.032,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What is our imagery of cities?

2
0:00:16.016,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When we imagine cities,

3
0:00:17.849,000 --> 0:00:19,000
we often imagine it to be something like this.

4
0:00:21.587,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But what if what you're looking at is just half a picture,

5
0:00:25.802,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but there is a city within the city.

6
0:00:29.929,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This part of the city is often seen as slums,

7
0:00:32.858,000 --> 0:00:34,000
squatters, informal,

8
0:00:34.903,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and people living here are called illegal, informal,

9
0:00:38.117,000 --> 0:00:41,000
criminals, beneficiaries, supplicants, etc.

10
0:00:42.149,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But in reality,

11
0:00:43.599,000 --> 0:00:46,000
these are poor people with no choices.

12
0:00:47.702,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Poverty is a vicious cycle.

13
0:00:49.79,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If born poor, it can take three or more generations

14
0:00:52.782,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to escape one.

15
0:00:54.521,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Many are forced in this cycle without choices,

16
0:00:57.571,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to live on pavements,

17
0:01:00.514,000 --> 0:01:02,000
along train tracks,

18
0:01:03.765,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in dumping grounds,

19
0:01:06.463,000 --> 0:01:08,000
along rivers,

20
0:01:08.686,000 --> 0:01:11,000
swamps and many such unlivable spaces,

21
0:01:11.773,000 --> 0:01:13,000
without clean water, toilets or housing.

22
0:01:15.841,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But these places are not unfamiliar to me,

23
0:01:18.429,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because since the age of six, I accompanied my father, a doctor,

24
0:01:22.754,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who treated patients in the slums of Bombay.

25
0:01:25.752,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Growing up, I would help him carry his bag of medicines

26
0:01:28.76,000 --> 0:01:29,000
after school lessons --

27
0:01:29.958,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I loved doing that.

28
0:01:31.744,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Wanting to do something about these habitats,

29
0:01:34.3,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I decided to become an architect.

30
0:01:37.577,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But quite early on, I realized

31
0:01:39.887,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that the beauty of architecture was only for the rich.

32
0:01:43.782,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So I decided to do urban planning

33
0:01:47.219,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and joined an NGO in India that works with the urban poor

34
0:01:50.647,000 --> 0:01:52,000
who organize themselves to access basic services,

35
0:01:53.657,000 --> 0:01:56,000
such as water, sanitation and housing, for the poor living in cities.

36
0:01:58.228,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now I spent 10 years of my life in professional education, in learning,

37
0:02:03.951,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and then five years in unlearning it.

38
0:02:06.815,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Because I realized

39
0:02:09.085,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that all my training in architecture, design and planning

40
0:02:12.458,000 --> 0:02:14,000
failed ground realities.

41
0:02:15.879,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And this is where I learned the power of choice.

42
0:02:20.069,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I unlearned many things,

43
0:02:22.068,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but there are two myths about the poor

44
0:02:23.932,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that I would like to share that we live with.

45
0:02:27.619,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The first myth is a perception

46
0:02:29.667,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that migration of poor people into cities is a problem.

47
0:02:34.572,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Is migration really a choice?

48
0:02:37.831,000 --> 0:02:39,000
My mentor Sheela Patel

49
0:02:39.887,000 --> 0:02:42,000
asked to those who think of this as a problem,

50
0:02:43.434,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"Go ask your grandfather where he came from," she says.

51
0:02:49.798,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So what do poor people do when they migrate in cities?

52
0:02:52.957,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Let me share an example.

53
0:02:55.188,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is the Mumbai International Airport.

54
0:02:57.633,000 --> 0:03:,000
All that you see in blue are large informal settlements around it.

55
0:03:01.862,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Close to 75,000 people live here.

56
0:03:05.445,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So who are these people that work silently in hotels, restaurants,

57
0:03:10.775,000 --> 0:03:13,000
as laborers, babysitters, house helps

58
0:03:14.101,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and countless other jobs

59
0:03:15.776,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that we need for cities to function without a glitch?

60
0:03:19.133,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And where do they live?

61
0:03:21.165,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In most cities, they live in slums.

62
0:03:25.204,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So let us think again.

63
0:03:27.204,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Do we want poor people to stop migrating in our cities?

64
0:03:31.278,000 --> 0:03:33,000
What if they had a choice of not to?

65
0:03:35.73,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The second myth is my personal experience.

66
0:03:40.188,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's this attitude that we professionals know better.

67
0:03:44.688,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We professionals love to make choices for others,

68
0:03:47.658,000 --> 0:03:48,000
especially for the poor.

69
0:03:49.547,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Let me share an experience.

70
0:03:52.349,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In a workshop that looked at designing 250 new houses for poor families

71
0:03:56.674,000 --> 0:03:57,000
from a slum nearby,

72
0:03:58.603,000 --> 0:04:01,000
there were different building materials that were presented,

73
0:04:02.114,000 --> 0:04:05,000
ranging from papier-mâché, cardboard, honeycomb, etc.,

74
0:04:05.686,000 --> 0:04:06,000
simply because they were affordable.

75
0:04:08.646,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But there was this one idea that was of shipping containers.

76
0:04:13.37,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now we immediately approved of it,

77
0:04:15.053,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because we thought it was sustainable, scalable, affordable.

78
0:04:19.553,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But during this presentation,

79
0:04:21.458,000 --> 0:04:23,000
a lady from the slum humbly spoke up.

80
0:04:24.545,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And she asked the presenter,

81
0:04:27.07,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"Would you choose to live in it?"

82
0:04:29.458,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:31.514,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"If not, then why did you think we would?"

84
0:04:35.704,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now this was a personal unlearning moment for me,

85
0:04:38.601,000 --> 0:04:41,000
where I realized that poverty only changes affordability --

86
0:04:42.093,000 --> 0:04:44,000
it does not change aspirations.

87
0:04:45.268,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now poor people have lived in temporary structures all their life.

88
0:04:49.307,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They go from wall to wall,

89
0:04:50.863,000 --> 0:04:51,000
moving from bricks to tin.

90
0:04:53.307,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They move from building from bamboo,

91
0:04:55.474,000 --> 0:04:58,000
tarpaulin sheets, plastic, to cardboard, to tin,

92
0:04:58.498,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to bricks and cement,

93
0:04:59.673,000 --> 0:05:,000
just like the way we do.

94
0:05:02.069,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So somewhere here, we were forcing our choices on them.

95
0:05:05.657,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So should we force our choices on them,

96
0:05:08.149,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or should we broaden their choices?

97
0:05:11.752,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now what if the opportunity to choose was given to people?

98
0:05:15.998,000 --> 0:05:19,000
These are women who lived on the pavements of a neighborhood in Mumbai.

99
0:05:21.037,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now they faced constant evictions, and in response to it,

100
0:05:24.873,000 --> 0:05:27,000
they organized a women's network called Mahila Milan.

101
0:05:29.055,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Not only did they fight against evictions with those in power,

102
0:05:32.863,000 --> 0:05:34,000
saved money and bought land,

103
0:05:35.165,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but they also designed and helped construct their own houses.

104
0:05:39.538,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Well, these were illiterate women, so how did they do that?

105
0:05:44.593,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They used floor mats and saris to understand measurements.

106
0:05:49.423,000 --> 0:05:53,000
A sari is four meters in length and 1.5 meters in width.

107
0:05:54.098,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They used these simple day-to-day items to demonstrate house models.

108
0:05:59.115,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And even they made three options to choose from

109
0:06:01.989,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and invited all their fellow residents to come and have a look.

110
0:06:05.064,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:06.774,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And everybody loved this option that had a loft in it,

112
0:06:11.159,000 --> 0:06:12,000
simply because it did two things.

113
0:06:13.143,000 --> 0:06:16,000
One is that it accommodated larger families to sleep in.

114
0:06:16.707,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And two, it allowed home-based work,

115
0:06:19.744,000 --> 0:06:21,000
such as bangle-making, jewelry-designing,

116
0:06:22.132,000 --> 0:06:24,000
embroidery-stitching, packaging items, etc.

117
0:06:26.212,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now they also decided to not have a toilet inside,

118
0:06:29.769,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but instead have it outside in the corridors,

119
0:06:32.722,000 --> 0:06:34,000
simply because it gave them more space and it was cheaper.

120
0:06:37.095,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now, professionals could have never thought

121
0:06:39.564,000 --> 0:06:4,000
of something like that.

122
0:06:41.798,000 --> 0:06:44,000
A formal design would have necessitated to have a toilet inside.

123
0:06:47.259,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now these are smaller examples --

124
0:06:49.712,000 --> 0:06:51,000
let me share some larger context:

125
0:06:53.228,000 --> 0:06:55,000
881,000,000 people --

126
0:06:55.499,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that's about one sixth of this world, as we talk here --

127
0:06:58.617,000 --> 0:07:,000
are living in slums and informal settlements.

128
0:07:01.482,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Almost every city in the global south has large slums in the size of townships.

129
0:07:07.789,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Kibera, in Nairobi,

130
0:07:11.313,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Dharavi, in Mumbai,

131
0:07:15.046,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Khayelitsha in South Africa, just a few.

132
0:07:18.903,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Now initially, they were all on waste and abandoned lands

133
0:07:22.497,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that cities were never interested in.

134
0:07:24.857,000 --> 0:07:25,000
As cities grew,

135
0:07:26.134,000 --> 0:07:28,000
poor people started building on these lands

136
0:07:28.484,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and brought value to this over time.

137
0:07:32.038,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And today, these lands have become real estate hot spots

138
0:07:35.417,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that everybody wants a piece of.

139
0:07:38.331,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So how do cities and those in power choose to deal with them?

140
0:07:43.442,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They demolish them and evict them

141
0:07:45.702,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and move them away from their cities and economies

142
0:07:49.472,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in order to build a new infrastructure.

143
0:07:53.456,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They move them into vertical housing,

144
0:07:57.234,000 --> 0:07:59,000
which in reality looks like this.

145
0:08:00.982,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Now when built in high densities,

146
0:08:02.806,000 --> 0:08:03,000
they lack natural light and ventilation,

147
0:08:04.768,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and it often leads to unhealthy conditions.

148
0:08:08.815,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now, on one hand,

149
0:08:10.726,000 --> 0:08:13,000
poor people are not involved in the participation of design,

150
0:08:14.242,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and there is poor quality of construction.

151
0:08:16.673,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And on the other hand,

152
0:08:19.163,000 --> 0:08:21,000
they do not understand how to do maintenance,

153
0:08:21.489,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you know, keeping bills, keeping records, forming societies --

154
0:08:25.347,000 --> 0:08:26,000
this is always difficult for them.

155
0:08:28.564,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And being forced to move into this formal society,

156
0:08:33.08,000 --> 0:08:35,000
they end up looking like this in a few years.

157
0:08:36.58,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Because formalization is not a product,

158
0:08:38.937,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it's a process.

159
0:08:40.112,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Moving from informal to formal for poor people is a journey.

160
0:08:43.903,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It takes time to accept and adapt.

161
0:08:48.187,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And when that choice is not given,

162
0:08:50.593,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it becomes like this,

163
0:08:51.845,000 --> 0:08:54,000
which I'm afraid, in future, these would become the slums.

164
0:08:57.799,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now instead of doing this,

165
0:08:59.101,000 --> 0:09:01,000
what if we accommodated poor people

166
0:09:01.506,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and gave them a choice to be a part of our cities

167
0:09:04.077,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and develop them where they are,

168
0:09:06.204,000 --> 0:09:08,000
giving them basic services, like in this picture?

169
0:09:10.553,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now what happens if cities and governments could work together,

170
0:09:14.117,000 --> 0:09:16,000
if governments acknowledge poor people,

171
0:09:16.974,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and they could build it together?

172
0:09:19.458,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is Mukuru.

173
0:09:21.609,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's a large informal settlement in Nairobi.

174
0:09:24.457,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's one of the largest settlements in Africa.

175
0:09:27.244,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's home to 300,000 people

176
0:09:29.434,000 --> 0:09:31,000
living over 650 acres of land.

177
0:09:33.007,000 --> 0:09:34,000
To help us understand that scale,

178
0:09:34.648,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it's like squeezing the population of Pittsburgh

179
0:09:37.488,000 --> 0:09:38,000
into the New York Central Park.

180
0:09:40.396,000 --> 0:09:41,000
That's Mukuru.

181
0:09:43.22,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So to give us a glimpse,

182
0:09:45.006,000 --> 0:09:47,000
this is the condition of housing.

183
0:09:48.776,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And this is what it is in between them.

184
0:09:53.105,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So what is life in Mukuru like, just talking briefly?

185
0:09:57.065,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Five hundred and fifty people use one single water tap

186
0:10:01.363,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and pay nine times more

187
0:10:02.881,000 --> 0:10:04,000
than what anybody else in the city could pay,

188
0:10:05.593,000 --> 0:10:07,000
simply because there is no water infrastructure

189
0:10:07.855,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and water is sold.

190
0:10:10.546,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Many come back from work to find out that their houses do not exist,

191
0:10:14.744,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because they have either been bulldozed,

192
0:10:16.95,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or they have been burned down.

193
0:10:20.695,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So, tired of this situation,

194
0:10:22.782,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a local slum dwellers' federation called Muungano

195
0:10:25.683,000 --> 0:10:26,000
decided to do something about it.

196
0:10:28.227,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In four years,

197
0:10:29.72,000 --> 0:10:33,000
they organized 20,000 residents to collect data,

198
0:10:34.157,000 --> 0:10:36,000
map structures and put it together.

199
0:10:38.379,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And the plan was very simple --

200
0:10:39.934,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they only needed four things.

201
0:10:41.744,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They wanted clean water,

202
0:10:43.72,000 --> 0:10:45,000
toilets, decent roads

203
0:10:46.355,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and, most importantly, not to be evicted.

204
0:10:50.958,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So they presented this with the government of Nairobi.

205
0:10:54.492,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And for the first time in history ever,

206
0:10:57.286,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a city has agreed to do it.

207
0:10:59.5,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The city of Nairobi, the government of Kenya,

208
0:11:01.74,000 --> 0:11:04,000
declared Mukuru to be a special planning area,

209
0:11:05.236,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which means that people could come up with their own plan.

210
0:11:08.491,000 --> 0:11:11,000
People could decide to come up with their own norms and standards,

211
0:11:12.315,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because the standards that work for the formal citizens

212
0:11:15.275,000 --> 0:11:16,000
do not work in informal settings.

213
0:11:17.887,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So what does that mean, to give us an instance?

214
0:11:21.736,000 --> 0:11:22,000
If these are roads in Mukuru,

215
0:11:23.228,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you can see that there are houses along both sides of the road.

216
0:11:27.815,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Now in order to bring in a city bus,

217
0:11:30.736,000 --> 0:11:31,000
as per the standards,

218
0:11:32.061,000 --> 0:11:35,000
planners would have gone for a luxurious 25-meter-wide road.

219
0:11:36.585,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now that would mean displacing [25] percent of the structures --

220
0:11:41.157,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that's a lot of people.

221
0:11:43.823,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So instead of doing that, we came up with a 12-meter-wide road,

222
0:11:47.806,000 --> 0:11:49,000
which had the structures intact and brought the city bus

223
0:11:50.743,000 --> 0:11:52,000
without compromising on much services.

224
0:11:54.203,000 --> 0:11:58,000
In another instance, let's talk about community toilets.

225
0:11:58.228,000 --> 0:11:59,000
You know, in high-density areas,

226
0:11:59.809,000 --> 0:12:01,000
where there is no scope for individual toilets,

227
0:12:02.657,000 --> 0:12:04,000
like the public toilets that we have here.

228
0:12:05.665,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So we would go for a male section and a female section.

229
0:12:09.894,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But imagine this situation.

230
0:12:12.141,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In the morning rush hours to the toilet,

231
0:12:15.061,000 --> 0:12:18,000
when everybody is in intense pressure to relieve themselves,

232
0:12:18.315,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and if you're standing in a queue of 50 people,

233
0:12:20.925,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and there is a child standing behind an adult,

234
0:12:23.758,000 --> 0:12:24,000
who wins?

235
0:12:26.203,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Children end up squatting outside.

236
0:12:29.004,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And that's why women decided

237
0:12:31.101,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to come up with a separate squatting area for children.

238
0:12:33.998,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Now, who could have thought of something like that?

239
0:12:37.427,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The idea here is that when poor people choose,

240
0:12:40.328,000 --> 0:12:41,000
they choose better.

241
0:12:41.908,000 --> 0:12:43,000
They choose what works for them.

242
0:12:45.551,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So choice is everything.

243
0:12:47.797,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And power decides choice.

244
0:12:50.363,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And we need those in power --

245
0:12:53.633,000 --> 0:12:55,000
politicians, leaders, governments,

246
0:12:56.45,000 --> 0:12:59,000
architects, planners, institutions, researchers --

247
0:12:59.675,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and all of us in our everyday lives to respect choices.

248
0:13:04.857,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Instead of choosing what is right for people, for the poor,

249
0:13:09.006,000 --> 0:13:11,000
let's acknowledge and empower their choices.

250
0:13:12.307,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And that is how we can build

251
0:13:14.074,000 --> 0:13:16,000
better and inclusive cities for tomorrow,

252
0:13:16.539,000 --> 0:13:17,000
completing the imagery of cities

253
0:13:18.325,000 --> 0:13:2,000
built by the choices of its own people.

254
0:13:20.983,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Thank you.

255
0:13:22.158,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Applause)

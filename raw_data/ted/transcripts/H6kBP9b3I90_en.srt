1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:37,000
My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,

5
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
given away most everything that I owned,

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and arrived with all the essentials --

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar --

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because I was going to save the world,

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I thought I would just start with the African continent.

10
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,

11
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:04,000
by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,

12
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
thank you very much, least of all not by me.

13
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I was too young, unmarried, I had no children,

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.

15
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.

17
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,

18
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,

19
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,

20
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.

21
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,

22
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it,

23
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable

24
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.

25
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery

26
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that was run by 20 prostitutes.

27
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,

28
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.

29
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,

30
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and how what we call people so often distances us from them,

31
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and makes them little.

32
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,

33
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,

34
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:24,000
who essentially spent 600 dollars a month

35
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,

36
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.

37
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,

38
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we run this as a business and I'll help you."

39
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,

40
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
things are always harder than you think they're going to be.

41
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,

42
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and we clearly aren't the A-Team here,

43
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
so let's -- I did all this training.

44
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets

45
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,

46
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I sold all these little doughnuts to people,

47
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I came back, and I was like, "You see?"

48
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy

49
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like --

50
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter) -- it's a good point.

51
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So then I went the whole American way,

52
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,

53
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.

54
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And they started listening to the marketplace,

55
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,

56
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and sorghum bread, and before you knew it,

57
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we had cornered the Kigali market,

58
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and the women were earning three to four times the national average.

59
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,

60
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."

61
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,

62
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.

63
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine."

64
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But they wouldn't give me an answer.

65
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,

66
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"

67
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."

68
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,

69
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,

70
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,

71
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,

72
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying

73
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.

74
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So, blue, blue, everything became blue.

75
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The walls were blue, the windows were blue,

76
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the sidewalk out front was painted blue.

77
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"

78
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the women's hips were swaying

79
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.

80
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And at the end of it, we stood across the street

81
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."

82
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And the women said, "It really is."

83
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And I said, "And I think the color is perfect,"

84
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,

85
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and I said, "What?"

86
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"

87
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --

88
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:06,000
-- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,

90
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,

91
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it's really hard to say what you mean.

92
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And, mostly because people never really ask you,

93
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.

94
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,

95
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but it's also learning how better to ask questions.

96
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,

97
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it was an extraordinary time in my life.

98
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And it taught me three lessons

99
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that I think are so important for us today,

100
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and certainly in the work that I do.

101
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.

102
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,

103
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and that is fundamental to dignity.

104
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But as human beings, we also want to see each other,

105
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.

106
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
The second is that traditional charity and aid

107
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
are never going to solve the problems of poverty.

108
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,

109
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
which is that markets alone also

110
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
are not going to solve the problems of poverty.

111
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Yes, we ran this as a business,

112
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support

113
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice

114
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and, maybe most important of all,

115
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.

116
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination

117
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of investment and philanthropy.

118
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that

119
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
even health should be privatized.

120
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But, having had a father with heart disease,

121
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and realizing that what our family could afford

122
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
was not what he should have gotten,

123
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and having a good friend step in to help,

124
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I really believe that all people deserve access to health

125
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
at prices they can afford.

126
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I think the market can help us figure that out,

127
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but there's got to be a charitable component,

128
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.

129
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to

130
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
build Acumen Fund about six years ago.

131
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,

132
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
a few oxymorons in one sentence.

133
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,

134
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans

135
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in both for-profit and nonprofit entities

136
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water

137
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to low income people in South Asia and Africa,

138
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so that they can make their own choices.

139
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,

140
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,

141
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and delivered tens of millions of services to people

142
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
who otherwise would not be able to afford them.

143
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.

144
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs

145
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:58,000
who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.

146
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,

147
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and both of them, because they're manufacturers,

148
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,

149
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because they're in the malaria sector,

150
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.

151
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.

152
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.

153
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago

154
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.

155
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
These are old-hand farmers

156
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs

157
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in Kenya over the last 30 years.

158
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant;

159
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it's the basic component for artemisinin,

160
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is the best-known treatment for malaria.

161
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's indigenous to China and the Far East,

162
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,

163
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,

164
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because it's a high value-add product."

165
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.

166
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on,

167
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that actually got below market returns

168
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and was willing to go the long haul and be combined

169
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with management assistance, strategic assistance --

170
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.

171
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So that's about 50,000 people affected.

172
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And I think some of you may have visited --

173
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,

174
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
who help them become more self-sufficient.

175
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,

176
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,

177
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who has a real interest in getting the powder

178
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so that they can make Coartem.

179
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,

180
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
both on looking at a new business plan,

181
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and what does expansion look like, helping with management support

182
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.

183
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally

184
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in the last month or so. Because the company was literally

185
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
10 days away from proving that the product they produced

186
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,

187
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.

188
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And we called all of the social investors we know.

189
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa

190
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and understand the importance of agriculture,

191
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and they even helped the farmers.

192
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And even when we explained that if ABE goes away,

193
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:28,000
all those 7,500 jobs go away too,

194
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.

195
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.

196
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,

197
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now

198
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,

199
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.

200
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is Samuel. He's a farmer.

201
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
He was actually living in the Kibera slums

202
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:05,000
when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.

203
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,

204
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they now have seven acres under cultivation.

205
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Samuel's kids are in private school,

206
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --

207
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
dignity being more important than wealth.

208
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The next one, many of you know.

209
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,

210
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,

211
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.

212
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.

213
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And this is really a story about a public-private solution

214
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that has really worked.

215
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology

216
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,

217
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
so you could create a bed net,

218
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.

219
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,

220
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:05,000
it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,

221
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment

222
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"

223
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,

224
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's

225
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."

226
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Acumen came in with the patient capital,

227
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur

228
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that we would all partner with here in Africa,

229
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and Exxon provided the initial resin.

230
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs,

231
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,

232
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in A to Z manufacturing company.

233
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.

234
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,

235
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.

236
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa

237
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment

238
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to work with malaria.

239
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.

240
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:1,000
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.

241
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.

242
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,

243
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.

244
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:26,000
They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.

245
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,

246
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.

247
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,

248
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
because it's not long-term sustainable.

249
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's a company with one big customer.

250
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason

251
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:49,000
the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.

252
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And so, Anuj and Acumen

253
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
have been talking about testing the private sector,

254
0:13:55,000 --> 0:14:,000
because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,

255
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
look, in a country like Tanzania,

256
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.

257
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,

258
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,

259
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.

260
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.

261
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And we said, "Well, there's another option.

262
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and

263
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:3,000
understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.

264
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We can start building local distribution,

265
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."

266
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,

267
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing

268
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.

269
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
One, that people will pay different prices,

270
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net

271
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and make a decision to buy it.

272
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say

273
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
about what they like and what they don't like.

274
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.

275
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed

276
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
because of the patient capital,

277
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector

278
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.

279
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,

280
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:19,000
we have a choice.

281
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,

282
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:31,000
or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,

283
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
costing the public sector another six dollars a net,

284
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:38,000
give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system

285
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that might, over time, start sustaining itself.

286
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We've got to start having conversations like this,

287
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,

288
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:51,000
but also to bring other people to the table around it.

289
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.

290
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:03,000
She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.

291
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:05,000
She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,

292
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:07,000
didn't have very much education.

293
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,

294
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
who was a cement hauler,

295
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.

296
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:2,000
My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,

297
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.

298
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:27,000
She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,

299
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
worked hard every day, understood what suffering was,

300
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:33,000
had a deep faith in God, loved her children

301
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and would never have accepted a handout.

302
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:4,000
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,

303
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and she lived in a society that provided the safety

304
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:47,000
of having access to affordable health and education,

305
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:51,000
her children and their children were able to live

306
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.

307
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said,

308
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
there are a lot of us --

309
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.

310
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:09,000
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.

311
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,

312
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and I think about all the people across this continent

313
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:19,000
who are working hard every day,

314
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:23,000
is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,

315
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and that they also can believe and get access to services,

316
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:32,000
so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.

317
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:34,000
It shouldn't be that difficult.

318
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:38,000
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us

319
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:42,000
to essentially refuse trite assumptions,

320
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:45,000
get out of our ideological boxes.

321
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:48,000
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed

322
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:52,000
to service as well as to success.

323
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:55,000
It takes opening your arms, both, wide,

324
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and expecting very little love in return,

325
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:,000
but demanding accountability,

326
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and bringing the accountability to the table as well.

327
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And most of all, most of all,

328
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:1,000
it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,

329
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:13,000
whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,

330
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:16,000
local or diaspora, left or right,

331
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
to really start listening to each other.

332
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Thank you.

333
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:3,000
(Applause)

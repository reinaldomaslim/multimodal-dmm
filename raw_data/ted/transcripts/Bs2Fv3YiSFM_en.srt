1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Priya Vulchi: Four years ago, we really thought we understood racism.

2
0:00:16.72,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Just like many of you here today, we had experienced and heard stories

3
0:00:20.76,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about race, about prejudice, discrimination and stereotyping

4
0:00:24.36,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and we were like, "We get it, racism, we got it, we got it."

5
0:00:28.12,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But we weren't even close.

6
0:00:32.2,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Winona Guo: So we decided that we had to listen and learn more.

7
0:00:35.28,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We talked to as many random people as we could

8
0:00:37.48,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and collected hundreds of personal stories about race,

9
0:00:40.68,000 --> 0:00:44,000
stories that revealed how racial injustice is a nationwide epidemic

10
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that we ourselves spread

11
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and now can't seem to recognize or get rid of.

12
0:00:50.24,000 --> 0:00:51,000
PV: We're not there yet.

13
0:00:51.88,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Today, we are here to raise our standards of racial literacy,

14
0:00:56.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to redefine what it means to be racially literate.

15
0:01:00.32,000 --> 0:01:02,000
WG: We want everywhere across the United States

16
0:01:03.24,000 --> 0:01:06,000
for our youngest and future generations to grow up equipped

17
0:01:06.76,000 --> 0:01:09,000
with the tools to understand, navigate and improve

18
0:01:09.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
a world structured by racial division.

19
0:01:12.6,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We want us all to imagine the community as a place

20
0:01:15.84,000 --> 0:01:18,000
where we not only feel proud of our own backgrounds,

21
0:01:18.88,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but can also invest in others' experiences as if they were our own.

22
0:01:23.76,000 --> 0:01:25,000
PV: We just graduated from high school this past June.

23
0:01:27.12,000 --> 0:01:28,000
WG: And you'd think --

24
0:01:28.44,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Applause)

25
0:01:31.84,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And you'd think after 12 years

26
0:01:34.64,000 --> 0:01:37,000
somebody in or out of the classroom would have helped us understand --

27
0:01:37.96,000 --> 0:01:38,000
PV: At a basic level at least --

28
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:4,000
WG: The society we live in.

29
0:01:41.08,000 --> 0:01:44,000
PV: The truth for almost all our classmates is that they don't.

30
0:01:45.64,000 --> 0:01:49,000
WG: In communities around our country, so many of which are racially divided,

31
0:01:50.24,000 --> 0:01:52,000
PV: If you don't go searching for an education about race,

32
0:01:53.04,000 --> 0:01:54,000
for racial literacy --

33
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:55,000
WG: You won't get it.

34
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It won't just come to you.

35
0:01:57.76,000 --> 0:01:59,000
PV: Even when we did have conversations about race,

36
0:02:00.2,000 --> 0:02:02,000
our understanding was always superficial.

37
0:02:03.24,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We realized that there are two big gaps

38
0:02:06.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in our racial literacy.

39
0:02:08.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
WG: First, the heart gap:

40
0:02:11.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
an inability to understand each of our experiences,

41
0:02:15.48,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to fiercely and unapologetically be compassionate beyond lip service.

42
0:02:22.44,000 --> 0:02:24,000
PV: And second, the mind gap:

43
0:02:25.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
an inability to understand the larger, systemic ways in which racism operates.

44
0:02:32.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
WG: First, the heart gap.

45
0:02:35.56,000 --> 0:02:39,000
To be fair, race did pop up a few times in school, growing up.

46
0:02:39.8,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We all defend our social justice education

47
0:02:41.96,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because we learned about Martin Luther King Jr.

48
0:02:44.76,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks.

49
0:02:47.56,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But even in all of those conversations,

50
0:02:49.88,000 --> 0:02:51,000
race always felt outdated, like,

51
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Yes, slavery, that happened once upon a time,

52
0:02:55.4,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but why does it really matter now?"

53
0:02:58.4,000 --> 0:03:01,000
As a result, we didn't really care.

54
0:03:02.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But what if our teacher introduced a story from the present day,

55
0:03:06.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for example, how Treniya told us in Pittsburgh that --

56
0:03:10.36,000 --> 0:03:13,000
PV: "My sister was scrolling through Facebook and typed in our last name.

57
0:03:13.92,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This white guy popped up,

58
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and we found out that his great-great-grandfather owned slaves

59
0:03:19.96,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and my great-great- great-grandmother was one of them.

60
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
My last name -- it's not who I am.

61
0:03:26.2,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We've been living under a white man's name.

62
0:03:28.6,000 --> 0:03:3,000
If slavery didn't happen, who would I even be?"

63
0:03:32.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
WG: Now it feels relevant, immediate,

64
0:03:35.08,000 --> 0:03:4,000
because the connection to slavery's lasting legacy today is made clear, right?

65
0:03:40.32,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Or what would happen is our teacher would throw out these cold statistics.

66
0:03:43.84,000 --> 0:03:45,000
You've probably seen this one before in news headlines.

67
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:47,000
PV: African-Americans are incarcerated

68
0:03:48.72,000 --> 0:03:5,000
more than five times the rate of white people.

69
0:03:51.92,000 --> 0:03:53,000
WG: Now consider Ronnie, in Seattle.

70
0:03:55.2,000 --> 0:03:57,000
PV: "My father means everything to me.

71
0:03:57.52,000 --> 0:03:59,000
He's all I've got, I don't know my mother.

72
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
My father's currently being wrongly incarcerated for 12 years.

73
0:04:04.88,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I've got a daughter, and I try to be that same fatherly figure for her:

74
0:04:08.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
always involved in everything she does, it might even be annoying at some points.

75
0:04:13.12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But I'm afraid I'll go missing in her life

76
0:04:16.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
just like my father did in mine."

77
0:04:20.68,000 --> 0:04:23,000
WG: Throwing out just the statistic, just the facts alone,

78
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:26,000
disconnected from real humans,

79
0:04:26.24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
can lead to dangerously incomplete understanding of those facts.

80
0:04:30.079,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It fails to recognize that for many people who don't understand racism

81
0:04:33.64,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the problem is not a lack of knowledge

82
0:04:35.52,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to talk about the pain of white supremacy and oppression,

83
0:04:39.28,000 --> 0:04:42,000
it's that they don't recognize that that pain exists at all.

84
0:04:43.12,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They don't recognize the human beings that are being affected,

85
0:04:46.64,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and they don't feel enough to care.

86
0:04:49.84,000 --> 0:04:51,000
PV: Second, the mind gap.

87
0:04:51.96,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We can't ignore the stats, either.

88
0:04:54.4,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We can't truly grasp Ronnie's situation

89
0:04:57.36,000 --> 0:05:01,000
without understanding how things like unjust laws and biased policing

90
0:05:01.96,000 --> 0:05:03,000
systematic racism has created

91
0:05:04.64,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the disproportionate incarceration rates over time.

92
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Or like how in Honolulu,

93
0:05:09.6,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the large prison population of native Hawaiians like Kimmy

94
0:05:13.44,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is heavily influenced by the island's long history

95
0:05:16.76,000 --> 0:05:17,000
with US colonialization,

96
0:05:18.24,000 --> 0:05:2,000
its impact passing down through generations to today.

97
0:05:21.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
For us, sometimes we would talk

98
0:05:23.44,000 --> 0:05:26,000
about people's personal, unique experiences in the classroom.

99
0:05:27.32,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Stuff like, how Justin once told us --

100
0:05:30.4,000 --> 0:05:34,000
WG: "I've been working on psychologically reclaiming my place in this city.

101
0:05:34.56,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Because for me, my Chicago isn't the nice architecture downtown,

102
0:05:38.8,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it's not the North Side.

103
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
My Chicago is the orange line, the pink line, the working immigrant class

104
0:05:45.36,000 --> 0:05:46,000
going on the train."

105
0:05:47.6,000 --> 0:05:5,000
PV: And while we might have acknowledged his personal experience,

106
0:05:51.12,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we wouldn't have talked about how redlining

107
0:05:53.2,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and the legalized segregation of our past

108
0:05:55.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
created the racially divided neighborhoods we live in today.

109
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:,000
We wouldn't have completely understood

110
0:06:01.48,000 --> 0:06:04,000
how racism is embedded in the framework of everything around us,

111
0:06:05.44,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because we would stay narrowly focused on people's isolated experiences.

112
0:06:10.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Another example, Sandra in DC once told us:

113
0:06:14.6,000 --> 0:06:17,000
WG: "When I'm with my Korean family, I know how to move with them.

114
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I know what to do in order to have them feel like I care about them.

115
0:06:21.96,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And making and sharing food

116
0:06:23.56,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is one of the most fundamental ways of showing love.

117
0:06:27.56,000 --> 0:06:29,000
When I'm with my partner who's not Korean, however,

118
0:06:30.08,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we've had to grapple with the fact

119
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that I'm very food-centric and he's just not.

120
0:06:34.56,000 --> 0:06:36,000
One time he said that he didn't want to be expected

121
0:06:37.48,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to make food for me,

122
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I got really upset."

123
0:06:40.92,000 --> 0:06:42,000
PV: That might seem like a weird reaction,

124
0:06:43.08,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but only if we don't recognize how it's emblematic of something larger,

125
0:06:47.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
something deeper.

126
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Intragenerational trauma.

127
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:53,000
How in Sandra's family, widespread hunger and poverty

128
0:06:54.24,000 --> 0:06:57,000
existed as recently as Sandra's parents' generation

129
0:06:57.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and therefore impacts Sandra today.

130
0:06:59.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
She experiences someone saying --

131
0:07:01.96,000 --> 0:07:02,000
WG: "I don't want to feed you."

132
0:07:03.48,000 --> 0:07:04,000
PV: As --

133
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
WG: "I don't want to hug you."

134
0:07:06.2,000 --> 0:07:09,000
PV: And without her and her partner having that nuanced understanding

135
0:07:09.48,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of her reaction and the historical context behind it,

136
0:07:12.24,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it could easily lead to unnecessary fighting.

137
0:07:14.88,000 --> 0:07:17,000
That's why it's so important that we proactively --

138
0:07:18.08,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Both speaking): Co-create --

139
0:07:19.52,000 --> 0:07:2,000
PV: A shared American culture

140
0:07:21.44,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that identifies and embraces the different values and norms

141
0:07:25.24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
within our diverse communities.

142
0:07:28.44,000 --> 0:07:29,000
WG: To be racially literate --

143
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
PV: To understand who we are so that we can heal together --

144
0:07:33.8,000 --> 0:07:34,000
WG: We cannot neglect the heart --

145
0:07:35.64,000 --> 0:07:36,000
PV: Or the mind.

146
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, with our hundreds of stories,

147
0:07:39.24,000 --> 0:07:41,000
we decided to publish a racial literacy textbook

148
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to bridge that gap between our hearts and minds.

149
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:47,000
WG: Our last book, "The Classroom Index,"

150
0:07:47.84,000 --> 0:07:48,000
shares deeply personal stories.

151
0:07:49.8,000 --> 0:07:5,000
PV: And pairs those personal stories

152
0:07:51.56,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to the brilliant research of statisticians and scholars.

153
0:07:54.56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
WG: Every day, we are still blown away by people's experiences,

154
0:07:59.2,000 --> 0:08:02,000
by the complexity of our collective racial reality.

155
0:08:02.96,000 --> 0:08:04,000
PV: So today, we ask you --

156
0:08:05.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
WG: Are you racially literate?

157
0:08:07.48,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Are you there yet?

158
0:08:08.84,000 --> 0:08:1,000
PV: Do you really understand the people around you,

159
0:08:11.4,000 --> 0:08:13,000
their stories, stories like these?

160
0:08:14.4,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's not just knowing that Louise from Seattle

161
0:08:17.36,000 --> 0:08:2,000
survived Japanese American internment camps.

162
0:08:20.48,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's knowing that, meanwhile,

163
0:08:22.08,000 --> 0:08:27,000
her husband was one of an estimated 33,000 Japanese Americans

164
0:08:27.24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who fought for our country during the war,

165
0:08:29.76,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a country that was simultaneously interning their families.

166
0:08:34.68,000 --> 0:08:38,000
For most of us, those Japanese Americans both in camps and in service,

167
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
now see their bravery, their resilience, their history forgotten.

168
0:08:43.6,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They've become only victims.

169
0:08:45.84,000 --> 0:08:47,000
PV: It's not just knowing that interracial marriages

170
0:08:48.52,000 --> 0:08:5,000
like Shermaine and Paul in DC exist,

171
0:08:51.4,000 --> 0:08:55,000
it's acknowledging that our society has been programmed for them to fail.

172
0:08:55.76,000 --> 0:08:57,000
That on their very first date someone shouted,

173
0:08:58.4,000 --> 0:09:,000
"Why are you with that black whore?"

174
0:09:00.68,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That according to a Columbia study on cis straight relationships

175
0:09:04.52,000 --> 0:09:06,000
black is often equated with masculinity

176
0:09:07.2,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and Asian with femininity,

177
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
leading more men to not value black women and to fetishize Asian women.

178
0:09:14.48,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Among black-white marriages in the year 2000,

179
0:09:17.6,000 --> 0:09:2,000
73 percent had a black husband and a white wife.

180
0:09:21.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Paul and Shermaine defy that statistic.

181
0:09:24.24,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Black is beautiful,

182
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but it takes a lot to believe so once society says otherwise.

183
0:09:29.88,000 --> 0:09:32,000
WG: It's not just knowing that white people like Lisa in Chicago

184
0:09:33.48,000 --> 0:09:34,000
have white privilege,

185
0:09:34.84,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it's reflecting consciously on the term whiteness and its history,

186
0:09:38.48,000 --> 0:09:41,000
knowing that whiteness can't be equated with American.

187
0:09:42.76,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It's knowing that Lisa can't forget her own personal family's history

188
0:09:46.32,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of Jewish oppression.

189
0:09:48.2,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That she can't forget how, growing up,

190
0:09:50.08,000 --> 0:09:53,000
she was called a dirty Jew with horns and tails.

191
0:09:53.2,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But Lisa knows she can pass as white

192
0:09:55.52,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so she benefits from huge systemic and interpersonal privileges,

193
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
and so she spends every day

194
0:10:00.76,000 --> 0:10:03,000
grappling with ways that she can leverage that white privilege

195
0:10:04.32,000 --> 0:10:05,000
for social justice.

196
0:10:05.76,000 --> 0:10:09,000
For example, starting conversations with other people of privilege about race.

197
0:10:10.52,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Or shifting the power in her classroom to her students

198
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
by learning to listen to their experiences of racism and poverty.

199
0:10:19.08,000 --> 0:10:22,000
PV: It's not just knowing that native languages are dying.

200
0:10:22.44,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It's appreciating how fluency in the Cherokee language,

201
0:10:25.64,000 --> 0:10:28,000
which really only less than 12,000 people speak today,

202
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is an act of survival, of preservation of culture and history.

203
0:10:34.04,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's knowing how the nongendered Cherokee language

204
0:10:37.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
enabled Ahyoka's acceptance as a trans woman

205
0:10:40.66,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.

206
0:10:43.04,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Her grandmother told her firmly a saying in Cherokee,

207
0:10:46.28,000 --> 0:10:48,000
"I don't tell me who you are,

208
0:10:48.84,000 --> 0:10:49,000
you tell me who you are.

209
0:10:50.64,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And that is who you are."

210
0:10:52.2,000 --> 0:10:55,000
WG: These are just parts of a few stories.

211
0:10:55.24,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There are approximately 323 million people in the United States.

212
0:10:59.36,000 --> 0:11:01,000
PV: And 7.4 billion people on the planet.

213
0:11:02.28,000 --> 0:11:03,000
WG: So we have a lot to listen to.

214
0:11:03.924,000 --> 0:11:04,000
PV: And a lot to learn.

215
0:11:05.28,000 --> 0:11:06,000
WG: We need to raise the bar.

216
0:11:06.8,000 --> 0:11:08,000
PV: Elevate our standards for racial literacy.

217
0:11:09.36,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Because without investing in an education that values --

218
0:11:12.12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
WG: Both the stories -- PV: And statistics --

219
0:11:14.28,000 --> 0:11:15,000
WG: The people -- PV: And the numbers --

220
0:11:16.2,000 --> 0:11:18,000
WG: The interpersonal -- PV: And the systemic --

221
0:11:18.48,000 --> 0:11:2,000
WG: There will always be a piece missing.

222
0:11:20.96,000 --> 0:11:23,000
PV: Today, so few of us understand each other.

223
0:11:24.64,000 --> 0:11:25,000
WG: We don't know how to communicate --

224
0:11:26.56,000 --> 0:11:27,000
PV: Live together -- WG: Love one another.

225
0:11:28.56,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We need to all work together to create a new national community.

226
0:11:31.68,000 --> 0:11:34,000
PV: A new shared culture of mutual suffering and celebration.

227
0:11:35.44,000 --> 0:11:38,000
WG: We need to each begin by learning in our own local communities,

228
0:11:39.28,000 --> 0:11:41,000
bridging the gaps between our own hearts and minds

229
0:11:42.24,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to become racially literate.

230
0:11:43.88,000 --> 0:11:45,000
PV: Once we all do, we will be that much closer

231
0:11:46.64,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to living in spaces and systems that fight and care equally for all of us.

232
0:11:52.68,000 --> 0:11:55,000
WG: Then, none of us will be able to remain distant.

233
0:11:56.12,000 --> 0:11:58,000
PV: We couldn't -- sorry, mom and dad, college can wait.

234
0:11:59.08,000 --> 0:12:02,000
WG: We're on a gap year before college, traveling to all 50 states

235
0:12:02.32,000 --> 0:12:03,000
collecting stories for our next book.

236
0:12:04.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
PV: And we still have 23 states left to interview in.

237
0:12:07.32,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Both) Let's all get to work.

238
0:12:09.32,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Thank you.

239
0:12:10.6,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

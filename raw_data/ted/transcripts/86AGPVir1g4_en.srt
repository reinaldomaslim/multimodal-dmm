1
0:00:13.714,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a journalist.

2
0:00:14.968,000 --> 0:00:16,000
And I know how frustrating it gets

3
0:00:17.247,000 --> 0:00:18,000
when most of your stories go unnoticed.

4
0:00:20.007,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I felt it when I worked as a local reporter

5
0:00:22.601,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in my hometown Belgaum, in India.

6
0:00:25.188,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I thought maybe joining a national newspaper would help.

7
0:00:29.418,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So I went through professional training

8
0:00:31.308,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and worked with India's three national newspapers.

9
0:00:34.99,000 --> 0:00:36,000
During my five-year stint, I used to travel for my stories.

10
0:00:38.835,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It was in early 2012

11
0:00:40.327,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I traveled 1,000 miles from Mumbai to a coastal village in south India.

12
0:00:44.677,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I was there to do a story

13
0:00:46.431,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on environmental risk of a nuclear power plant.

14
0:00:50.155,000 --> 0:00:51,000
When I spoke to a local activist,

15
0:00:51.776,000 --> 0:00:57,000
he said the story of hundreds of villagers protesting against a nuclear power plant

16
0:00:58.156,000 --> 0:00:59,000
was reported by local media

17
0:01:00.14,000 --> 0:01:03,000
six months before national TV channels picked it up.

18
0:01:04.863,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I had similar experiences when I traveled for other stories.

19
0:01:08.553,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It confirmed my belief that a local reporter knows a story

20
0:01:11.737,000 --> 0:01:13,000
much before it is picked up by national media.

21
0:01:14.244,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But like me, they did not have a platform to share them.

22
0:01:18.593,000 --> 0:01:2,000
According to a 2011 media study,

23
0:01:20.998,000 --> 0:01:23,000
only two percent of India's mainstream media coverage

24
0:01:24.649,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is about rural issues.

25
0:01:26.815,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Even though almost 70 percent of India's population,

26
0:01:32.363,000 --> 0:01:34,000
1.3 billion population, live in villages.

27
0:01:36.03,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is disturbing for a democratic country like India,

28
0:01:39.07,000 --> 0:01:42,000
where transparency is key to ensure justice to everyone, especially the poor.

29
0:01:43.933,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was convinced that there's a need to build a platform

30
0:01:47.187,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to bring out this important story at the national level.

31
0:01:50.361,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So I quit my job with "Economic Times" in December 2014.

32
0:01:54.883,000 --> 0:01:56,000
For the next six months, I freelanced

33
0:01:57.059,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and also built a database of 20,000 local reporters across India.

34
0:02:03.081,000 --> 0:02:04,000
During that time,

35
0:02:04.62,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I saw editors who were looking for more and more contributors

36
0:02:07.572,000 --> 0:02:09,000
as news organizations cut down cost

37
0:02:10.099,000 --> 0:02:12,000
by getting rid of hundreds of full-time reporters.

38
0:02:13.361,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I saw an opportunity to highlight these important stories

39
0:02:16.552,000 --> 0:02:18,000
if I can train these local reporters

40
0:02:19.179,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and connect them with the mainstream media.

41
0:02:21.227,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And that is exactly what we are doing.

42
0:02:23.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Our tech platform, for the first time, discovers a local reporter,

43
0:02:27.355,000 --> 0:02:28,000
grooms them,

44
0:02:28.537,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and helps them write for national and international publications.

45
0:02:31.632,000 --> 0:02:35,000
A team of experienced editors works closely with these local reporters

46
0:02:35.744,000 --> 0:02:37,000
on each and every story filed by them.

47
0:02:38.752,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This process not only helps the local reporters learn reporting skills

48
0:02:43.615,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but also gives credibility to their stories.

49
0:02:47.323,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In June 2017,

50
0:02:49.188,000 --> 0:02:51,000
one of our local reporters, Saurabh Sharma,

51
0:02:51.411,000 --> 0:02:53,000
won an international award from the European Commission

52
0:02:54.125,000 --> 0:02:58,000
for his story on the hardships faced by young girls living on the street.

53
0:02:59.453,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We're also trying to correct market for these local reporters,

54
0:03:02.399,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by paying them three times more than the existing rates.

55
0:03:05.509,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Better pay and recognition is giving them confidence

56
0:03:08.665,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to dig deeper and expose corruption in the system and society.

57
0:03:13.173,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We recently reported a story from Northeast India

58
0:03:16.069,000 --> 0:03:2,000
where children have to cross a river in a huge cooking pot,

59
0:03:20.308,000 --> 0:03:21,000
risking their life every day,

60
0:03:21.736,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because there's no bridge, there's no boat.

61
0:03:24.501,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The story was picked up by mainstream media

62
0:03:26.883,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and it caught the attention of a local elected representative

63
0:03:30.193,000 --> 0:03:31,000
who promised to build a bridge.

64
0:03:32.455,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In the last three years of our operations,

65
0:03:35.244,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we have reported more than 2,500 such stories.

66
0:03:40.379,000 --> 0:03:42,000
To publish them for a wider reach and impact,

67
0:03:42.887,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we have partnered with 16 leading media houses,

68
0:03:46.061,000 --> 0:03:47,000
who are happy to take them,

69
0:03:47.792,000 --> 0:03:51,000
as it brings their cost down, by not editing or managing reporters.

70
0:03:52.847,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Today, we have more than 1,200 reporters in our network,

71
0:03:58.257,000 --> 0:04:,000
covering stories like the nuclear power plant,

72
0:04:00.918,000 --> 0:04:03,000
from places that are either ignored by mainstream media

73
0:04:04.086,000 --> 0:04:05,000
or never covered.

74
0:04:05.63,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In the next five years,

75
0:04:07.566,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we plan to have one reporter in each of the 5,500 subdistricts in India,

76
0:04:13.59,000 --> 0:04:14,000
covering the entire nation,

77
0:04:16.54,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to ensure that none of these important stories go unnoticed.

78
0:04:25.832,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Next time you see a story from the countryside,

79
0:04:29.245,000 --> 0:04:3,000
please do not ignore it.

80
0:04:31.499,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Do read and share them, they might be breaking stories.

81
0:04:34.762,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This way, we can ensure

82
0:04:36.683,000 --> 0:04:38,000
none of the important stories go unnoticed.

83
0:04:39.643,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Thank you.

84
0:04:40.817,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:13,000
June 2010.

2
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I landed for the first time in Rome, Italy.

3
0:00:19.8,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I wasn't there to sightsee.

4
0:00:21.72,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was there to solve world hunger.

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That's right.

7
0:00:28.52,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was a 25-year-old PhD student

8
0:00:30.64,000 --> 0:00:33,000
armed with a prototype tool developed back at my university,

9
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I was going to help the World Food Programme fix hunger.

10
0:00:37.84,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So I strode into the headquarters building

11
0:00:40.6,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags,

12
0:00:43.44,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I smiled as I thought to myself,

13
0:00:46.84,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"The engineer is here."

14
0:00:48.48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:50.72,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Give me your data.

16
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'm going to optimize everything.

17
0:00:54.72,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:56.48,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Tell me the food that you've purchased,

19
0:00:58.4,000 --> 0:01:,000
tell me where it's going and when it needs to be there,

20
0:01:01.04,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I'm going to tell you the shortest, fastest, cheapest,

21
0:01:03.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
best set of routes to take for the food.

22
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We're going to save money,

23
0:01:07.28,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we're going to avoid delays and disruptions,

24
0:01:09.4,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and bottom line, we're going to save lives.

25
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You're welcome.

26
0:01:13.4,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I thought it was going to take 12 months,

28
0:01:17.12,000 --> 0:01:18,000
OK, maybe even 13.

29
0:01:19.8,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This is not quite how it panned out.

30
0:01:23.6,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Just a couple of months into the project, my French boss, he told me,

31
0:01:27.4,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"You know, Mallory,

32
0:01:29.24,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it's a good idea,

33
0:01:30.92,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but the data you need for your algorithms is not there.

34
0:01:34.28,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's the right idea but at the wrong time,

35
0:01:36.84,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the right idea at the wrong time

36
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is the wrong idea."

37
0:01:40.56,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Project over.

39
0:01:45.12,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was crushed.

40
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:5,000
When I look back now

41
0:01:50.48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
on that first summer in Rome

42
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I see how much has changed over the past six years,

43
0:01:54.84,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it is an absolute transformation.

44
0:01:57.64,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world.

45
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's exciting. It's inspiring.

46
0:02:04.84,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But we're not there yet.

47
0:02:07.32,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And brace yourself, executives,

48
0:02:09.64,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because I'm going to be putting companies

49
0:02:11.64,000 --> 0:02:14,000
on the hot seat to step up and play the role that I know they can.

50
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:19,000
My experiences back in Rome prove

51
0:02:20.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
using data you can save lives.

52
0:02:23.44,000 --> 0:02:25,000
OK, not that first attempt,

53
0:02:25.92,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but eventually we got there.

54
0:02:28.52,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Let me paint the picture for you.

55
0:02:30.28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Imagine that you have to plan breakfast, lunch and dinner

56
0:02:33.04,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for 500,000 people,

57
0:02:34.68,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and you only have a certain budget to do it,

58
0:02:36.84,000 --> 0:02:38,000
say 6.5 million dollars per month.

59
0:02:40.92,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Well, what should you do? What's the best way to handle it?

60
0:02:44.28,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil?

61
0:02:47.76,000 --> 0:02:48,000
How much?

62
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It sounds simple. It's not.

63
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You have 30 possible foods, and you have to pick five of them.

64
0:02:54.4,000 --> 0:02:57,000
That's already over 140,000 different combinations.

65
0:02:57.84,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Then for each food that you pick,

66
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:,000
you need to decide how much you'll buy,

67
0:03:01.56,000 --> 0:03:02,000
where you're going to get it from,

68
0:03:03.28,000 --> 0:03:04,000
where you're going to store it,

69
0:03:05.76,000 --> 0:03:06,000
how long it's going to take to get there.

70
0:03:07.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
You need to look at all of the different transportation routes as well.

71
0:03:11.12,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And that's already over 900 million options.

72
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
If you considered each option for a single second,

73
0:03:16.52,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that would take you over 28 years to get through.

74
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:19,000
900 million options.

75
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So we created a tool that allowed decisionmakers

76
0:03:23.64,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to weed through all 900 million options

77
0:03:26.28,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in just a matter of days.

78
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It turned out to be incredibly successful.

79
0:03:31.4,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In an operation in Iraq,

80
0:03:32.68,000 --> 0:03:34,000
we saved 17 percent of the costs,

81
0:03:35.24,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and this meant that you had the ability to feed an additional 80,000 people.

82
0:03:39.4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's all thanks to the use of data and modeling complex systems.

83
0:03:44.8,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But we didn't do it alone.

84
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The unit that I worked with in Rome, they were unique.

85
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They believed in collaboration.

86
0:03:51.36,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They brought in the academic world.

87
0:03:53.08,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They brought in companies.

88
0:03:55.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And if we really want to make big changes in big problems like world hunger,

89
0:03:58.84,000 --> 0:04:,000
we need everybody to the table.

90
0:04:02.04,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We need the data people from humanitarian organizations

91
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:06,000
leading the way,

92
0:04:06.28,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and orchestrating just the right types of engagements

93
0:04:08.88,000 --> 0:04:09,000
with academics, with governments.

94
0:04:10.6,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And there's one group that's not being leveraged in the way that it should be.

95
0:04:14.32,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Did you guess it? Companies.

96
0:04:16.44,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Companies have a major role to play in fixing the big problems in our world.

97
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I've been in the private sector for two years now.

98
0:04:23.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I've seen what companies can do, and I've seen what companies aren't doing,

99
0:04:26.92,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I think there's three main ways that we can fill that gap:

100
0:04:30.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
by donating data, by donating decision scientists

101
0:04:33.44,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and by donating technology to gather new sources of data.

102
0:04:37.92,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is data philanthropy,

103
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and it's the future of corporate social responsibility.

104
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Bonus, it also makes good business sense.

105
0:04:46.92,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Companies today, they collect mountains of data,

106
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so the first thing they can do is start donating that data.

107
0:04:52.946,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Some companies are already doing it.

108
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Take, for example, a major telecom company.

109
0:04:57.6,000 --> 0:04:59,000
They opened up their data in Senegal and the Ivory Coast

110
0:05:00.4,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and researchers discovered

111
0:05:02.4,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that if you look at the patterns in the pings to the cell phone towers,

112
0:05:05.758,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you can see where people are traveling.

113
0:05:07.72,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And that can tell you things like

114
0:05:09.92,000 --> 0:05:12,000
where malaria might spread, and you can make predictions with it.

115
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Or take for example an innovative satellite company.

116
0:05:15.96,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They opened up their data and donated it,

117
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and with that data you could track

118
0:05:19.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
how droughts are impacting food production.

119
0:05:22.92,000 --> 0:05:25,000
With that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen.

120
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is a great start.

121
0:05:29.84,000 --> 0:05:31,000
There's important insights just locked away in company data.

122
0:05:34.48,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And yes, you need to be very careful.

123
0:05:36.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You need to respect privacy concerns, for example by anonymizing the data.

124
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But even if the floodgates opened up,

125
0:05:42.72,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and even if all companies donated their data

126
0:05:45.28,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to academics, to NGOs, to humanitarian organizations,

127
0:05:48.56,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it wouldn't be enough to harness that full impact of data

128
0:05:51.56,000 --> 0:05:52,000
for humanitarian goals.

129
0:05:54.32,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Why?

130
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:58,000
To unlock insights in data, you need decision scientists.

131
0:05:59.76,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Decision scientists are people like me.

132
0:06:02.36,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They take the data, they clean it up,

133
0:06:04.2,000 --> 0:06:06,000
transform it and put it into a useful algorithm

134
0:06:06.48,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that's the best choice to address the business need at hand.

135
0:06:09.8,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In the world of humanitarian aid, there are very few decision scientists.

136
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Most of them work for companies.

137
0:06:16.48,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So that's the second thing that companies need to do.

138
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:2,000
In addition to donating their data,

139
0:06:20.72,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they need to donate their decision scientists.

140
0:06:23.52,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Now, companies will say, "Ah! Don't take our decision scientists from us.

141
0:06:29.28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We need every spare second of their time."

142
0:06:32.36,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But there's a way.

143
0:06:35.2,000 --> 0:06:38,000
If a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist's time,

144
0:06:38.64,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time

145
0:06:41.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
over a long period, say for example five years.

146
0:06:44.6,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This might only amount to a couple of hours per month,

147
0:06:47.68,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which a company would hardly miss,

148
0:06:49.76,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but what it enables is really important: long-term partnerships.

149
0:06:54.92,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Long-term partnerships allow you to build relationships,

150
0:06:57.76,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to get to know the data, to really understand it

151
0:07:00.44,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and to start to understand the needs and challenges

152
0:07:02.88,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that the humanitarian organization is facing.

153
0:07:06.345,000 --> 0:07:09,000
In Rome, at the World Food Programme, this took us five years to do,

154
0:07:09.56,000 --> 0:07:1,000
five years.

155
0:07:11.04,000 --> 0:07:14,000
That first three years, OK, that was just what we couldn't solve for.

156
0:07:14.4,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Then there was two years after that of refining and implementing the tool,

157
0:07:17.92,000 --> 0:07:19,000
like in the operations in Iraq and other countries.

158
0:07:21.52,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I don't think that's an unrealistic timeline

159
0:07:23.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
when it comes to using data to make operational changes.

160
0:07:26.4,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's an investment. It requires patience.

161
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But the types of results that can be produced are undeniable.

162
0:07:33.28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In our case, it was the ability to feed tens of thousands more people.

163
0:07:39.44,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So we have donating data, we have donating decision scientists,

164
0:07:43.8,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and there's actually a third way that companies can help:

165
0:07:46.52,000 --> 0:07:48,000
donating technology to capture new sources of data.

166
0:07:49.52,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You see, there's a lot of things we just don't have data on.

167
0:07:52.96,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Right now, Syrian refugees are flooding into Greece,

168
0:07:57.12,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the UN refugee agency, they have their hands full.

169
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The current system for tracking people is paper and pencil,

170
0:08:04.08,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and what that means is

171
0:08:05.36,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that when a mother and her five children walk into the camp,

172
0:08:08.24,000 --> 0:08:1,000
headquarters is essentially blind to this moment.

173
0:08:10.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's all going to change in the next few weeks,

174
0:08:13.28,000 --> 0:08:14,000
thanks to private sector collaboration.

175
0:08:15.84,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology

176
0:08:19.52,000 --> 0:08:21,000
from the logistics company that I work for.

177
0:08:22.12,000 --> 0:08:24,000
With this new system, there will be a data trail,

178
0:08:24.48,000 --> 0:08:25,000
so you know exactly the moment

179
0:08:25.96,000 --> 0:08:27,000
when that mother and her children walk into the camp.

180
0:08:28.48,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And even more, you know if she's going to have supplies

181
0:08:31.12,000 --> 0:08:32,000
this month and the next.

182
0:08:32.4,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Information visibility drives efficiency.

183
0:08:35.44,000 --> 0:08:38,000
For companies, using technology to gather important data,

184
0:08:38.72,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it's like bread and butter.

185
0:08:40.2,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They've been doing it for years,

186
0:08:41.8,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and it's led to major operational efficiency improvements.

187
0:08:45.08,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Just try to imagine your favorite beverage company

188
0:08:48.28,000 --> 0:08:49,000
trying to plan their inventory

189
0:08:49.88,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and not knowing how many bottles were on the shelves.

190
0:08:52.4,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's absurd.

191
0:08:53.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Data drives better decisions.

192
0:08:57.8,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, if you're representing a company,

193
0:09:00.36,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and you're pragmatic and not just idealistic,

194
0:09:03.52,000 --> 0:09:06,000
you might be saying to yourself, "OK, this is all great, Mallory,

195
0:09:06.6,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but why should I want to be involved?"

196
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Well for one thing, beyond the good PR,

197
0:09:11.84,000 --> 0:09:13,000
humanitarian aid is a 24-billion-dollar sector,

198
0:09:14.64,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and there's over five billion people, maybe your next customers,

199
0:09:17.72,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that live in the developing world.

200
0:09:19.56,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Further, companies that are engaging in data philanthropy,

201
0:09:22.68,000 --> 0:09:24,000
they're finding new insights locked away in their data.

202
0:09:25.68,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Take, for example, a credit card company

203
0:09:27.96,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that's opened up a center

204
0:09:29.32,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that functions as a hub for academics, for NGOs and governments,

205
0:09:32.72,000 --> 0:09:33,000
all working together.

206
0:09:35.04,000 --> 0:09:37,000
They're looking at information in credit card swipes

207
0:09:37.8,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and using that to find insights about how households in India

208
0:09:40.8,000 --> 0:09:41,000
live, work, earn and spend.

209
0:09:43.68,000 --> 0:09:45,000
For the humanitarian world, this provides information

210
0:09:46.28,000 --> 0:09:48,000
about how you might bring people out of poverty.

211
0:09:48.96,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But for companies, it's providing insights about your customers

212
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and potential customers in India.

213
0:09:54.76,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It's a win all around.

214
0:09:57.96,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now, for me, what I find exciting about data philanthropy --

215
0:10:01.76,000 --> 0:10:05,000
donating data, donating decision scientists and donating technology --

216
0:10:06.12,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it's what it means for young professionals like me

217
0:10:08.52,000 --> 0:10:09,000
who are choosing to work at companies.

218
0:10:10.8,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Studies show that the next generation of the workforce

219
0:10:13.48,000 --> 0:10:15,000
care about having their work make a bigger impact.

220
0:10:16.92,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We want to make a difference,

221
0:10:19.4,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and so through data philanthropy,

222
0:10:21.84,000 --> 0:10:24,000
companies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists.

223
0:10:25.8,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand.

224
0:10:29.84,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Data philanthropy makes good business sense,

225
0:10:34.2,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and it also can help revolutionize the humanitarian world.

226
0:10:39.6,000 --> 0:10:41,000
If we coordinated the planning and logistics

227
0:10:41.72,000 --> 0:10:44,000
across all of the major facets of a humanitarian operation,

228
0:10:45.12,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we could feed, clothe and shelter hundreds of thousands more people,

229
0:10:49.44,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and companies need to step up and play the role that I know they can

230
0:10:53.72,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in bringing about this revolution.

231
0:10:56.72,000 --> 0:10:58,000
You've probably heard of the saying "food for thought."

232
0:10:59.68,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Well, this is literally thought for food.

233
0:11:03.56,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It finally is the right idea at the right time.

234
0:11:07.72,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:08.96,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Très magnifique.

236
0:11:10.56,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Thank you.

237
0:11:11.8,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Applause)

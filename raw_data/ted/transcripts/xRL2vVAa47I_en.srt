0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
[This talk contains graphic language Viewer discretion is advised]

2
0:00:16.972,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, this is the first and the last slide

3
0:00:19.769,000 --> 0:00:23,000
each of my 6,400 students over the last 15 years has seen.

4
0:00:24.119,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I do not believe you can build a multibillion-dollar organization

5
0:00:27.883,000 --> 0:00:32,000
unless you are clear on which instinct or organ you are targeting.

6
0:00:33.394,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Our species has a need for a superbeing.

7
0:00:36.507,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Our competitive advantage as a species is our brain.

8
0:00:39.557,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Our brain is robust enough to ask these really difficult questions,

9
0:00:42.724,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but, unfortunately, it doesn't have the processing power to answer them,

10
0:00:46.246,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which creates a need for a superbeing

11
0:00:48.568,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that we can pray to and look to for answers.

12
0:00:51.021,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What is prayer?

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Sending a query into the universe,

14
0:00:54.632,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and hopefully there's some sort of divine intervention --

15
0:00:57.428,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we don't need to understand what's going on --

16
0:00:59.784,000 --> 0:01:01,000
from an all-knowing, all-seeing superbeing

17
0:01:01.964,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that gives us authority that this is the right answer.

18
0:01:05.796,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Will my kid be all right?"

19
0:01:08.533,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You have your planet of stuff,

20
0:01:10.201,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you have your planet of work,

21
0:01:11.876,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you have your planet of friends.

22
0:01:13.705,000 --> 0:01:14,000
If you have kids,

23
0:01:15.223,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you know that once something comes off the rails with your kids,

24
0:01:18.342,000 --> 0:01:19,000
everything melts,

25
0:01:19.894,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in your universe to the Sun that is your kids.

26
0:01:22.555,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"Will my kid be all right?"

27
0:01:25.463,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Symptoms and treatment of croup" in the Google query box.

28
0:01:29.576,000 --> 0:01:32,000
One in six queries presented to Google have never been asked before

29
0:01:33.538,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in the history of mankind.

30
0:01:34.886,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What priest, teacher, rabbi, scholar, mentor, boss has so much credibility

31
0:01:40.318,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that one in six questions posed to that person

32
0:01:42.888,000 --> 0:01:43,000
have never been asked before?

33
0:01:44.663,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Google is our modern man's God.

34
0:01:47.953,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Imagine your face and your name above everything you've put into that box,

35
0:01:52.281,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and you're going to realize you trust Google more than any entity

36
0:01:56.425,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in your history.

37
0:01:57.663,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:58.754,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Let's move further down the torso.

39
0:02:00.537,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:02.56,000 --> 0:02:04,000
One of the other wonderful things about our species

41
0:02:05.059,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is we not only need to be loved, but we need to love others.

42
0:02:08.577,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Children with poor nutrition but a lot of affection

43
0:02:11.559,000 --> 0:02:15,000
have better outcomes than children with good nutrition and poor affection.

44
0:02:16.517,000 --> 0:02:19,000
However, the best signal that you might make it

45
0:02:19.969,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to be part of the number-one fastest growing demographic in the world --

46
0:02:24.05,000 --> 0:02:26,000
centenarians, people who live to triple digits --

47
0:02:26.483,000 --> 0:02:27,000
there are three signals.

48
0:02:27.683,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In reverse order: your genetics -- not as important as you'd like to think,

49
0:02:31.643,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so you can continue to treat your body like shit

50
0:02:33.943,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and think, "Oh, Uncle Joe lived to 95,

51
0:02:35.854,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the die have been cast."

52
0:02:37.105,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's less important than you think.

53
0:02:38.826,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Number two is lifestyle.

54
0:02:40.413,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Don't smoke, don't be obese, and prescreen --

55
0:02:42.704,000 --> 0:02:44,000
get rid of about two-thirds of early cancers

56
0:02:45.683,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and cardiovascular disease.

57
0:02:47.212,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The number one indicator or signal that you'll make it to triple digits:

58
0:02:50.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
How many people do you love?

59
0:02:54.702,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Caretaking is the security camera --

60
0:02:57.551,000 --> 0:02:59,000
we call the low-resolution security camera in our brain --

61
0:03:00.495,000 --> 0:03:02,000
deciding whether or not you are adding value.

62
0:03:02.703,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Facebook taps into our instinctive need not only to be loved,

63
0:03:06.364,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but to love others,

64
0:03:07.591,000 --> 0:03:09,000
mostly through pictures that create empathy,

65
0:03:09.692,000 --> 0:03:11,000
catalyze and reinforce our relationships.

66
0:03:12.224,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Let's continue our journey down the torso.

67
0:03:15.741,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Amazon is our consumptive gut.

68
0:03:18.201,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The instinct of more is hardwired into us.

69
0:03:21.777,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The penalty for too little is starvation and malnutrition.

70
0:03:25.804,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Open your cupboards, open your closets,

71
0:03:28.017,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you have 10 to 100x times what you need.

72
0:03:31.434,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Why?

73
0:03:32.621,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Because the penalty for too little is much greater

74
0:03:35.407,000 --> 0:03:36,000
than the penalty for too much.

75
0:03:37.314,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So "more for less" is a business strategy that never goes out of style.

76
0:03:41.172,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's the strategy of China,

77
0:03:42.702,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it's a the strategy of Walmart,

78
0:03:44.344,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and now it's the strategy of the most successful company in the world,

79
0:03:47.753,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Amazon.

80
0:03:48.937,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You get more for less into your gut;

81
0:03:51.105,000 --> 0:03:54,000
digest, send it to your muscular and skeletal system of consumption.

82
0:03:54.911,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Moving further,

83
0:03:56.59,000 --> 0:03:59,000
once we know we will survive, the basic instinct,

84
0:04:00.219,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we move to the second most powerful instinct,

85
0:04:02.685,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that is to spread and select the strongest, smartest and fastest seed

86
0:04:07.426,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to the four corners of the earth,

87
0:04:09.173,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or pick the best seed.

88
0:04:11.537,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is not a timepiece.

89
0:04:13.285,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I haven't wound it in five years.

90
0:04:15.399,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's my vain attempt to say to people,

91
0:04:17.646,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"If you mate with me, your children are more likely to survive

92
0:04:20.789,000 --> 0:04:22,000
than if you mate with someone wearing a Swatch watch."

93
0:04:23.457,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:25.073,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The key to business is tapping into the irrational organs.

95
0:04:29.488,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"Irrational" is Harvard Business School's and New York Business School's term

96
0:04:33.248,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for fat profit margins and shareholder value.

97
0:04:36.789,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"High-caloric paste for your children."

98
0:04:39.373,000 --> 0:04:4,000
No?

99
0:04:40.563,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You love your choosy mom.

100
0:04:42.82,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Why choosy moms choose Jif: you love your kids more.

101
0:04:46.034,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The greatest algorithm for shareholder creation from World War II

102
0:04:49.155,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to the advent of Google

103
0:04:50.532,000 --> 0:04:53,000
was taking an average product and appealing to people's hearts.

104
0:04:53.656,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You're a better a mom, a better person, a better patriot

105
0:04:56.998,000 --> 0:04:59,000
if you buy this average soap versus this average soap.

106
0:05:00.338,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now, the number one algorithm for shareholder value isn't technology.

107
0:05:03.773,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Look at the Forbes 400.

108
0:05:05.027,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Take out inherited wealth, take out finance.

109
0:05:07.483,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The number one source of wealth creation:

110
0:05:09.72,000 --> 0:05:11,000
appealing to your reproductive organs.

111
0:05:11.853,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The Lauders; the number one wealthiest man in Europe, LVMH.

112
0:05:16.758,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Numbers two and three: H&M and Inditex.

113
0:05:19.359,000 --> 0:05:24,000
You want to target the most irrational organs for shareholder value.

114
0:05:25.362,000 --> 0:05:28,000
As a result, these four companies -- Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google --

115
0:05:29.153,000 --> 0:05:3,000
have disarticulated who we are.

116
0:05:30.888,000 --> 0:05:32,000
God, love, consumption, sex.

117
0:05:33.205,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The proportion in your approach to those things is who you are,

118
0:05:36.892,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and they have reassembled who we are in the form of for-profit companies.

119
0:05:40.661,000 --> 0:05:41,000
At the end of the Great Recession,

120
0:05:42.533,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the market capitalization of these companies was equivalent

121
0:05:45.419,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to the GDP of Niger.

122
0:05:46.596,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now it is equivalent to the GDP of India,

123
0:05:49.244,000 --> 0:05:52,000
having blown past Russia and Canada in '13 and '14.

124
0:05:52.623,000 --> 0:05:53,000
There are only five nations

125
0:05:54.006,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that have a GDP greater than the combined market capitalization

126
0:05:57.549,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of these four firms.

127
0:05:59.29,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Something is happening, though.

128
0:06:01.915,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The conversation just a year ago was, which CEO was more Jesus-like?

129
0:06:06.341,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Who was running for president?

130
0:06:08.779,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now the worm has turned.

131
0:06:10.244,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Everything they're doing is bothering us.

132
0:06:12.486,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We're worried they're tax avoiders.

133
0:06:14.47,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Walmart, since the Great Recession, has paid 64 billion dollars

134
0:06:17.877,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in corporate income tax;

135
0:06:19.434,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Amazon has paid 1.4.

136
0:06:21.788,000 --> 0:06:24,000
How do we pay our firefighters, our soldiers and our social workers

137
0:06:25.394,000 --> 0:06:28,000
if the most successful companies in the world don't pay their fair share?

138
0:06:28.903,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Pretty easy.

139
0:06:30.09,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That means the less successful companies have to pay

140
0:06:32.653,000 --> 0:06:33,000
more than their fair share.

141
0:06:33.994,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Alexa, is this a good thing?

142
0:06:35.849,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is despite that fact --

143
0:06:37.841,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:38.94,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is despite the fact

145
0:06:41.619,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that Amazon has added the entire market capitalization of Walmart

146
0:06:45.699,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to its market cap in the last 19 months.

147
0:06:52.423,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Whose fault is it? It's our fault.

148
0:06:54.671,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We're electing regulators who don't have the backbone

149
0:06:58.513,000 --> 0:07:,000
to actually go after these companies.

150
0:07:00.964,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Facebook lies to EU regulators

151
0:07:02.99,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and says, "It would be impossible for us to share the data

152
0:07:06.095,000 --> 0:07:09,000
between our core platform and our proposed acquisition of WhatsApp.

153
0:07:09.915,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Approve the merger."

154
0:07:11.322,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They approve the merger and then -- spoiler alert! -- they figure it out.

155
0:07:15.133,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And the EU says, "I feel lied to.

156
0:07:16.871,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We're fining you 120 [million] dollars,"

157
0:07:20.282,000 --> 0:07:24,000
about .6 percent of the acquisition price of 19 billion dollars.

158
0:07:24.571,000 --> 0:07:26,000
If Mark Zuckerberg could take out an insurance policy

159
0:07:27.198,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that the acquisition would go through for .6 percent,

160
0:07:29.944,000 --> 0:07:3,000
wouldn't he do it?

161
0:07:31.327,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Anticompetitive behavior.

162
0:07:33.622,000 --> 0:07:35,000
A two-and-a-half-billion-dollar fine,

163
0:07:35.646,000 --> 0:07:37,000
three billion of the cash flow,

164
0:07:38.562,000 --> 0:07:41,000
three percent of the cash on Google's balance sheet.

165
0:07:41.631,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We are telling these companies, "The smart thing to do,

166
0:07:45.596,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the shareholder-driven thing to do,

167
0:07:47.585,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is to lie and to cheat."

168
0:07:49.924,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We are issuing 25-cent parking tickets

169
0:07:53.596,000 --> 0:07:56,000
on a meter that costs 100 dollars an hour.

170
0:07:56.847,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The smart thing to do is lie.

171
0:07:57.957,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Job destruction!

172
0:07:59.507,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Amazon only needs one person for two at Macy's.

173
0:08:02.832,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If they grow their business 20 billion dollars this year, which they will,

174
0:08:06.497,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we will lose 53,000 cashiers and clerks.

175
0:08:08.706,000 --> 0:08:09,000
This is nothing unusual;

176
0:08:09.991,000 --> 0:08:11,000
this has happened all through our economy,

177
0:08:12.327,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we've just never seen companies this good at it.

178
0:08:14.613,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That's one Yankee Stadium of workers.

179
0:08:16.915,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's even worse in media.

180
0:08:18.306,000 --> 0:08:2,000
If Facebook and Google grow their businesses

181
0:08:20.44,000 --> 0:08:22,000
22 billion dollars this year, which they will,

182
0:08:22.639,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we're going to lose approximately 150,000 creative directors,

183
0:08:26.294,000 --> 0:08:27,000
planners and copywriters.

184
0:08:28.291,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Or we can fill up two-and-a-half Yankee Stadiums

185
0:08:30.625,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and say, "You are out of work, courtesy of Amazon."

186
0:08:34.04,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We now get the majority of our news from our social media feeds,

187
0:08:37.314,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and the majority of our news coming off of social media feeds is ...

188
0:08:41.611,000 --> 0:08:42,000
fake news.

189
0:08:42.935,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:44.646,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I am not allowed to be political or use curse words,

191
0:08:48.274,000 --> 0:08:49,000
or talk about religion in class,

192
0:08:49.985,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so I can definitely not say,

193
0:08:53.473,000 --> 0:08:55,000
"Zuckerberg has become Putin's bitch."

194
0:08:56.058,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I definitely cannot say that.

195
0:08:58.308,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:59.345,000 --> 0:09:,000
Their defense:

197
0:09:00.548,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"Facebook is not a media company; it's a technology company."

198
0:09:03.947,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You create original content,

199
0:09:05.645,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you pay sports leagues to give you original content,

200
0:09:08.565,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you run advertising against it -- boom! -- you're a media company.

201
0:09:11.703,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Just in the last few days,

202
0:09:13.254,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Sheryl Sandberg has repeated this lie, that "We are not a media company."

203
0:09:17.887,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Facebook has openly embraced the margins of celebrity

204
0:09:21.356,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and the influence of a media company

205
0:09:23.754,000 --> 0:09:26,000
yet seems to be allergic to the responsibilities

206
0:09:27.465,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of a media company.

207
0:09:29.138,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Imagine McDonald's.

208
0:09:31.293,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We find 80 percent of their beef is fake,

209
0:09:33.746,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and it's giving us encephalitis,

210
0:09:35.391,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and we're making terrible decisions.

211
0:09:37.801,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And we say, "McDonald's, we're pissed off!"

212
0:09:40.653,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And they say, "Wait, wait --

213
0:09:43.608,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we're not a fast-food restaurant,

214
0:09:45.484,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we're a fast-food platform."

215
0:09:47.741,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:50.307,000 --> 0:09:52,000
These companies and CEOs wrap themselves

217
0:09:52.67,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in a neon-blue pink rainbow and blue blanket

218
0:09:56.552,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to create an illusionist trick from their behavior each day,

219
0:09:59.925,000 --> 0:10:03,000
which is more indicative of the spawn of Darth Vader and Ayn Rand.

220
0:10:04.42,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Why? Because we as progressives are seen as nice but weak.

221
0:10:09.045,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If Sheryl Sandberg had written a book on gun rights

222
0:10:12.423,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or on the pro-life movement,

223
0:10:14.851,000 --> 0:10:16,000
would they be flying Sheryl to Cannes?

224
0:10:17.856,000 --> 0:10:18,000
No.

225
0:10:19.038,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I'm not doubting their progressive values,

226
0:10:21.206,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but it foots to shareholder value,

227
0:10:23.302,000 --> 0:10:25,000
because we as progressives are seen as weak.

228
0:10:25.395,000 --> 0:10:27,000
They're so nice -- remember Microsoft?

229
0:10:27.827,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They didn't seem as nice,

230
0:10:29.348,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and regulators stepped in much earlier than the regulators now,

231
0:10:33.645,000 --> 0:10:36,000
who would never step in on those nice, nice people.

232
0:10:37.354,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I'm about to get on a plane tonight,

233
0:10:39.184,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and I'm going to have a guy named Roy from TSA molest me.

234
0:10:41.926,000 --> 0:10:44,000
If I am suspected of a DUI on the way home,

235
0:10:45.131,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I can have blood taken from my person.

236
0:10:48.554,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But wait! Don't tap into the iPhone --

237
0:10:51.646,000 --> 0:10:52,000
it's sacred.

238
0:10:53.09,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This is our new cross.

239
0:10:54.553,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It shouldn't be the iPhone X,

240
0:10:56.186,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it should be called the "iPhone Cross."

241
0:10:58.206,000 --> 0:11:,000
We have our religion; it's Apple.

242
0:11:00.396,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Our Jesus Christ is Steve Jobs,

243
0:11:02.195,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and we've decided this is holier than our person, our house

244
0:11:05.505,000 --> 0:11:06,000
or our computer.

245
0:11:06.829,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We have become totally out of control

246
0:11:09.37,000 --> 0:11:12,000
with the gross idolatry of innovation and of youth.

247
0:11:13.187,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We no longer worship at the altar of character,

248
0:11:15.682,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of kindness,

249
0:11:16.863,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but of innovation and people who create shareholder value.

250
0:11:20.465,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Amazon has become so powerful in the marketplace,

251
0:11:23.383,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it can conduct Jedi mind tricks.

252
0:11:24.969,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It can begin damaging other industries just by looking at them.

253
0:11:27.983,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Nike announces they're distributing on Amazon, their stock goes up,

254
0:11:31.171,000 --> 0:11:32,000
every other footwear stock goes down.

255
0:11:33.001,000 --> 0:11:36,000
When Amazon stock goes up, the rest of retail stocks go down,

256
0:11:36.034,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because they assume what's good for Amazon is bad for everybody else.

257
0:11:39.367,000 --> 0:11:43,000
They cut the cost on salmon 33 percent when they acquired Whole Foods.

258
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:46,000
In between the time they announced the acquisition of Whole Foods

259
0:11:46.891,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and when it closed,

260
0:11:48.089,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer in America,

261
0:11:50.384,000 --> 0:11:51,000
shed a third of its value,

262
0:11:52.143,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because Amazon purchased a grocer one-eleventh the size of Kroger.

263
0:11:59.167,000 --> 0:12:,000
I got very lucky.

264
0:12:00.419,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I predicted the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon

265
0:12:03.86,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the week before it happened.

266
0:12:05.228,000 --> 0:12:07,000
This is me boasting; I said this publicly in the media.

267
0:12:07.94,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This was the largest acquisition in their history,

268
0:12:10.345,000 --> 0:12:12,000
they'd never made an acquisition over a billion,

269
0:12:12.704,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and people asked, "How did you know this?"

270
0:12:14.846,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So I'm letting this very impressive audience in on the secret.

271
0:12:18.089,000 --> 0:12:19,000
How did I know this?

272
0:12:19.308,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I'm going to tell you how I knew.

273
0:12:21.302,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I bark at Alexa all day long

274
0:12:24.076,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and try to figure out what's going on.

275
0:12:26.012,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Scott Galloway) Alexa, buy whole milk.

276
0:12:29.432,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Alexa) I couldn't find anything for whole milk,

277
0:12:31.723,000 --> 0:12:33,000
so I've added whole milk to your shopping list.

278
0:12:34.463,000 --> 0:12:35,000
SG: Then I asked,

279
0:12:35.773,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(SG) Alexa, buy organic foods.

280
0:12:38.939,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Alexa) The top search result for organic food

281
0:12:41.106,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is Plum Organics baby food, banana and pumpkin,

282
0:12:44.103,000 --> 0:12:46,000
12-pack of four ounces each.

283
0:12:46.144,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It's 15 dollars total.

284
0:12:48.419,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Would you like to buy it?

285
0:12:49.636,000 --> 0:12:5,000
SG: And then, as often happens at my age,

286
0:12:51.659,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I got confused.

287
0:12:52.843,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(SG) Alexa, buy whole foods.

288
0:12:56.05,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Alexa) I have purchased the outstanding stock of Whole Foods Incorporated

289
0:12:59.608,000 --> 0:13:,000
at 42 dollars per share.

290
0:13:01.421,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I have charged 13.7 billion to your American Express card.

291
0:13:05.306,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

292
0:13:07.884,000 --> 0:13:08,000
SG: I thought that'd be funnier.

293
0:13:09.515,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Laughter)

294
0:13:11.037,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We've personified these companies,

295
0:13:12.744,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and just as when you're really angry over every little thing someone does

296
0:13:16.203,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in your life and relationships,

297
0:13:17.722,000 --> 0:13:18,000
you've got to ask yourself,

298
0:13:19.05,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"What's going on here? Why are we so disappointed in technology?"

299
0:13:22.124,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I believe it's because the ratio of one-percent pursuit

300
0:13:24.827,000 --> 0:13:25,000
of shareholder value

301
0:13:26.018,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and 99 percent the betterment of humanity

302
0:13:28.583,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that technology used to play

303
0:13:29.992,000 --> 0:13:3,000
has been flipped,

304
0:13:31.171,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and now we're totally focused on shareholder value instead of humanity.

305
0:13:34.562,000 --> 0:13:37,000
One hundred thousand people came together for the Manhattan Project

306
0:13:37.865,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and literally saved the world.

307
0:13:39.35,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Technology saved the world.

308
0:13:40.685,000 --> 0:13:43,000
My mother was a four-year-old Jew living in London at the outset of the war.

309
0:13:44.396,000 --> 0:13:47,000
If we had not won the footrace towards splitting the atom,

310
0:13:47.525,000 --> 0:13:48,000
would she have survived?

311
0:13:49.237,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It's unlikely.

312
0:13:50.854,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Twenty-five years later,

313
0:13:52.185,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the most impressive accomplishment, arguably, ever in all of humankind:

314
0:13:56.642,000 --> 0:13:57,000
put a man on the moon.

315
0:13:57.818,000 --> 0:14:,000
Four hundred thirty thousand Canadians, British and Americans came together,

316
0:14:01.466,000 --> 0:14:02,000
again, with very basic technology,

317
0:14:03.321,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and put a man on the moon.

318
0:14:04.663,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Now we have the 700,000 best and brightest,

319
0:14:08.294,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and these are the best and brightest from the four corners of the earth.

320
0:14:11.763,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They are literally playing with lasers relative to slingshots,

321
0:14:15.867,000 --> 0:14:16,000
relative to the squirt gun.

322
0:14:17.178,000 --> 0:14:19,000
They have the GDP of India to work at.

323
0:14:19.474,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And after studying these companies for 10 years,

324
0:14:22.028,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I know what their mission is.

325
0:14:23.708,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Is it to organize the world's information?

326
0:14:26.356,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Is it to connect us?

327
0:14:27.885,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Is it to create greater comity of man?

328
0:14:30.833,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It isn't.

329
0:14:32.019,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I know why we have brought together --

330
0:14:33.939,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I know that the greatest collection of IQ capital and creativity,

331
0:14:38.272,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that their sole mission is:

332
0:14:40.286,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to sell another fucking Nissan.

333
0:14:42.466,000 --> 0:14:45,000
My name is Scott Galloway, I teach at NYU, and I appreciate your time.

334
0:14:46.237,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Applause)

335
0:14:54.654,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Chris Anderson: Not planned,

336
0:14:56.153,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but you prompted some questions in me, Scott.

337
0:14:59.137,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

338
0:15:00.232,000 --> 0:15:02,000
That was a spectacular rant.

339
0:15:02.564,000 --> 0:15:03,000
SG: Is this like Letterman?

340
0:15:03.953,000 --> 0:15:05,000
When you do well, he calls you onto the couch?

341
0:15:06.893,000 --> 0:15:09,000
CA: No, no, you're going to the heart of the conversation right now.

342
0:15:10.584,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Everyone's aware that after years of worshipping Silicon Valley,

343
0:15:16.742,000 --> 0:15:17,000
suddenly the worm has turned

344
0:15:18.62,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and in such a big way.

345
0:15:20.178,000 --> 0:15:23,000
To some people here, it will just feel like you're piling on,

346
0:15:23.607,000 --> 0:15:26,000
you're kicking the kids who've already been kicked to pieces anyway.

347
0:15:27.021,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Don't you feel any empathy for them at all?

348
0:15:29.41,000 --> 0:15:3,000
SG: None whatsoever.

349
0:15:31.259,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Look, this is the issue:

350
0:15:33.682,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's not their fault, it's our fault.

351
0:15:35.519,000 --> 0:15:37,000
They're for-profit companies.

352
0:15:37.659,000 --> 0:15:39,000
They're not concerned with the condition of our souls.

353
0:15:40.23,000 --> 0:15:42,000
They're not going to take care of us when we get older.

354
0:15:42.842,000 --> 0:15:45,000
We have set up a society that values shareholder value over everything,

355
0:15:46.608,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and they're doing what they're supposed to be doing.

356
0:15:49.075,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But we need to elect people,

357
0:15:50.468,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and we need to force ourselves to force them

358
0:15:52.576,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to be subject to the same scrutiny

359
0:15:54.271,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that the rest of business endures, full stop.

360
0:15:56.423,000 --> 0:15:57,000
CA: There's another narrative

361
0:15:58.169,000 --> 0:16:01,000
that is arguably equally consistent with the facts,

362
0:16:01.816,000 --> 0:16:07,000
which is that there actually is good intent in much of the leadership --

363
0:16:08.672,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I won't say everyone, necessarily --

364
0:16:10.447,000 --> 0:16:11,000
many of the employees.

365
0:16:12.042,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We all know people who work in those companies,

366
0:16:15.14,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and they still are pretty convincing that their mission is to --

367
0:16:18.93,000 --> 0:16:21,000
so, the alternative narrative is that there have been

368
0:16:22.192,000 --> 0:16:24,000
unintended consequences here,

369
0:16:24.288,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that the technologies that we're unleashing,

370
0:16:26.406,000 --> 0:16:3,000
the algorithms, that we're attempting to personalize the internet, for example,

371
0:16:31.008,000 --> 0:16:37,000
have A, resulted in weird effects like filter bubbles

372
0:16:37.341,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that we weren't expecting;

373
0:16:38.859,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and B, made themselves vulnerable to weird things like --

374
0:16:41.949,000 --> 0:16:43,000
oh, I don't know, Russian hackers creating accounts

375
0:16:44.669,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and doing things that we didn't expect.

376
0:16:46.668,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Isn't the unintended consequence a possibility here?

377
0:16:51.724,000 --> 0:16:52,000
SG: I don't think --

378
0:16:52.954,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I'm pretty sure, statistically,

379
0:16:54.51,000 --> 0:16:56,000
they're no less or better people than any other organization

380
0:16:57.4,000 --> 0:16:58,000
that has 100,000 or more people.

381
0:16:58.961,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I don't think they're bad people.

382
0:17:00.593,000 --> 0:17:01,000
As a matter of fact, I would argue

383
0:17:02.246,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that there's a lot of very civic-minded, decent leadership.

384
0:17:05.09,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But this is the issue:

385
0:17:06.278,000 --> 0:17:1,000
when you control 90 percent points of share in a market, search,

386
0:17:10.541,000 --> 0:17:13,000
that is now bigger than the entire advertising market of any nation,

387
0:17:14.1,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and you're primarily compensated and trying to develop economic security

388
0:17:17.834,000 --> 0:17:19,000
for you and the families of your employees,

389
0:17:19.89,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to increase that market share,

390
0:17:21.369,000 --> 0:17:24,000
you can't help but leverage all the power at your disposal.

391
0:17:24.522,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And that is the basis for regulation,

392
0:17:26.463,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and it's the basis for the truism throughout history

393
0:17:28.943,000 --> 0:17:29,000
that power corrupts.

394
0:17:30.31,000 --> 0:17:31,000
They're not bad people;

395
0:17:31.537,000 --> 0:17:33,000
we've just let them get out of control.

396
0:17:34.31,000 --> 0:17:38,000
CA: So maybe the case is slightly overstated?

397
0:17:38.368,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I know at least a bit --

398
0:17:40.712,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Larry Page, for example, Jeff Bezos --

399
0:17:42.71,000 --> 0:17:44,000
I don't actually believe they wake up thinking,

400
0:17:45.403,000 --> 0:17:46,000
"I've got to sell a fucking Nissan."

401
0:17:47.255,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I don't think they think that.

402
0:17:48.788,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I think they are trying to build something cool, and are probably,

403
0:17:54.368,000 --> 0:17:55,000
in moments of reflection,

404
0:17:55.712,000 --> 0:17:58,000
as horrified that some of the things that have happened as we might be.

405
0:17:59.92,000 --> 0:18:02,000
So is there a different way of framing this,

406
0:18:04.294,000 --> 0:18:09,000
to say that when your model is advertising,

407
0:18:09.515,000 --> 0:18:13,000
that there are dangers there that you have to take on more explicitly?

408
0:18:14.637,000 --> 0:18:18,000
SG: I think it's very difficult to set an organization up as we do,

409
0:18:19.298,000 --> 0:18:21,000
to pursue shareholder value above all else.

410
0:18:21.501,000 --> 0:18:22,000
They're not non-profits.

411
0:18:22.822,000 --> 0:18:25,000
The reason people go to work there is they want to create economic security

412
0:18:26.409,000 --> 0:18:27,000
for them and their families,

413
0:18:27.807,000 --> 0:18:28,000
mostly first and foremost.

414
0:18:29.131,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And when you get to a point where you control so much economic power,

415
0:18:32.448,000 --> 0:18:34,000
you use all the weapons at your disposal.

416
0:18:34.868,000 --> 0:18:35,000
I don't think they're bad people,

417
0:18:36.478,000 --> 0:18:39,000
but I think the role of government and the role of us as consumers

418
0:18:39.643,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and people who elect our officials

419
0:18:41.342,000 --> 0:18:43,000
is to ensure that there are some checks here.

420
0:18:43.514,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And we have given them the mother of all hall passes

421
0:18:46.054,000 --> 0:18:48,000
because we find them just so fascinating.

422
0:18:48.13,000 --> 0:18:51,000
CA: Scott, eloquently put, spectacularly put.

423
0:18:51.312,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Tim Cook, if you're watching,

424
0:18:56.73,000 --> 0:18:58,000
you're welcome to come and make the counterargument as well.

425
0:18:59.733,000 --> 0:19:,000
Scott, thank you so much.

426
0:19:00.985,000 --> 0:19:01,000
SG: Thanks very much.

427
0:19:02.17,000 --> 0:19:04,000
(Applause)

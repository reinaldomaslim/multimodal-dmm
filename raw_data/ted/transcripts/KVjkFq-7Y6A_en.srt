2
0:00:15.261,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What I do is I organize information.

3
0:00:17.069,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a graphic designer.

4
0:00:18.826,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Professionally, I try to make sense

5
0:00:21.569,000 --> 0:00:24,000
often of things that don't make much sense themselves.

6
0:00:25.198,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So my father might not understand what it is that I do for a living.

7
0:00:29.336,000 --> 0:00:31,000
His part of my ancestry has been farmers.

8
0:00:31.613,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He's part of this ethnic minority called the Pontic Greeks.

9
0:00:35.24,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They lived in Asia Minor and fled to Greece after a genocide

10
0:00:39.676,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about a hundred years ago.

11
0:00:41.834,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And ever since that, migration has somewhat been a theme in my family.

12
0:00:46.107,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My father moved to Germany, studied there and married,

13
0:00:50.632,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and as a result, I now have this half-German brain,

14
0:00:55.084,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with all the analytical thinking and that slightly dorky demeanor

15
0:00:58.466,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that come with that.

16
0:01:00.469,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And of course it meant that I was a foreigner in both countries,

17
0:01:03.579,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well,

18
0:01:07.953,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in good family tradition, if you like.

19
0:01:10.932,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But of course, most journeys that we undertake from day to day

20
0:01:14.281,000 --> 0:01:15,000
are within a city.

21
0:01:15.931,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And, especially if you know the city,

22
0:01:18.727,000 --> 0:01:21,000
getting from A to B may seem pretty obvious, right?

23
0:01:23.551,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But the question is, why is it obvious?

24
0:01:26.901,000 --> 0:01:27,000
How do we know where we're going?

25
0:01:29.243,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So I washed up on a Dublin ferry port about 12 years ago,

26
0:01:33.092,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a professional foreigner, if you like,

27
0:01:35.508,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and I'm sure you've all had this experience before, yeah?

28
0:01:38.634,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You arrive in a new city,

29
0:01:40.746,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place.

30
0:01:44.743,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Once you find your base, your home,

31
0:01:48.145,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you start to build this cognitive map of your environment.

32
0:01:52.605,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain.

33
0:01:56.517,000 --> 0:01:57,000
All animal species do it,

34
0:01:58.302,000 --> 0:02:,000
even though we all use slightly different tools.

35
0:02:01.301,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Us humans, of course, we don't move around marking our territory by scent, like dogs.

36
0:02:07.35,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We don't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks, like bats.

37
0:02:12.866,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We just don't do that,

38
0:02:14.887,000 --> 0:02:17,000
although a night in the Temple Bar district can get pretty wild.

39
0:02:18.157,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:19.529,000 --> 0:02:22,000
No, we do two important things to make a place our own.

41
0:02:23.467,000 --> 0:02:26,000
First, we move along linear routes.

42
0:02:26.543,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Typically, we find a main street,

43
0:02:29.037,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds.

44
0:02:32.631,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But our mind keeps it pretty simple, yeah?

45
0:02:34.878,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Every street is generally perceived as a straight line,

46
0:02:38.257,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make.

47
0:02:42.37,000 --> 0:02:44,000
When we do, however, make a turn into a side street,

48
0:02:44.844,000 --> 0:02:49,000
our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90-degree angle.

49
0:02:50.158,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This of course makes for some funny moments

50
0:02:52.88,000 --> 0:02:54,000
when you're in some old city layout

51
0:02:55.23,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that follows some sort of circular city logic, yeah?

52
0:03:00.246,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Maybe you've had that experience as well.

53
0:03:02.358,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Let's say you're on some spot on a side street

54
0:03:05.478,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that projects from a main cathedral square,

55
0:03:07.844,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and you want to get to another point on a side street just like that.

56
0:03:12.568,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The cognitive map in your mind may tell you,

57
0:03:16.538,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"Aris, go back to the main cathedral square,

58
0:03:19.963,000 --> 0:03:22,000
take a 90-degree turn and walk down that other side street."

59
0:03:23.7,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But somehow you feel adventurous that day, and you suddenly discover

60
0:03:28.159,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that the two spots were actually only a single building apart.

61
0:03:33.035,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, I don't know about you,

62
0:03:34.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but I always feel like I find this wormhole

63
0:03:36.548,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or this inter-dimensional portal.

64
0:03:39.345,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:40.643,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So we move along linear routes

66
0:03:44.174,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.

67
0:03:50.22,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The second thing that we do to make a place our own

68
0:03:53.189,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is we attach meaning and emotions to the things

69
0:03:57.376,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that we see along those lines.

70
0:04:00.265,000 --> 0:04:05,000
If you go to the Irish countryside and you ask an old lady for directions,

71
0:04:06.156,000 --> 0:04:09,000
brace yourself for some elaborate Irish storytelling

72
0:04:10.068,000 --> 0:04:11,000
about all the landmarks, yeah?

73
0:04:12.046,000 --> 0:04:15,000
She'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work,

74
0:04:15.321,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and "... go past that church where I got married," that kind of thing.

75
0:04:18.716,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning.

76
0:04:23.303,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What's more, we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them.

77
0:04:28.954,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols.

78
0:04:34.904,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And of course, we're all capable of understanding these symbols.

79
0:04:39.959,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:41.019,000 --> 0:04:45,000
What's more, we're all capable of understanding the cognitive maps,

81
0:04:45.526,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves.

82
0:04:51.268,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So next time, when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place,

83
0:04:54.885,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you grab a beermat, grab a napkin, and you just observe yourself

84
0:04:59.677,000 --> 0:05:03,000
create this awesome piece of communication design.

85
0:05:04.068,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's got straight lines.

86
0:05:05.504,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It's got 90-degree corners.

87
0:05:08.006,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You might add little symbols along the way.

88
0:05:10.13,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And when you look at what you've just drawn,

89
0:05:14.273,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you realize it does not resemble a street map.

90
0:05:18.835,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn,

91
0:05:23.134,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you'd realize your streets and the distances -- they'd be way off.

92
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:33,000
No, what you've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic.

93
0:05:34.116,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's a visual construct of lines, dots, letters,

94
0:05:39.087,000 --> 0:05:41,000
designed in the language of our brains.

95
0:05:41.979,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So it's no big surprise

96
0:05:43.859,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that the big information-design icon of the last century --

97
0:05:48.842,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from A to B,

98
0:05:53.199,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the London Underground map --

99
0:05:55.241,000 --> 0:05:59,000
was not designed by a cartographer or a city planner;

100
0:05:59.578,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it was designed by an engineering draftsman.

101
0:06:03.974,000 --> 0:06:04,000
In the 1930s,

102
0:06:05.708,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Harry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design

103
0:06:11.884,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever.

104
0:06:16.53,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now the very key to the success of this map

105
0:06:20.249,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is in the omission of less important information

106
0:06:24.333,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and in the extreme simplification.

107
0:06:27.052,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So, straightened streets, corners of 90 and 45 degrees,

108
0:06:31.012,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but also the extreme geographic distortion in that map.

109
0:06:37.156,000 --> 0:06:4,000
If you were to look at the actual locations of these stations,

110
0:06:41.086,000 --> 0:06:43,000
you'd see they're very different.

111
0:06:43.753,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But this is all for the clarity of the public Tube map.

112
0:06:48.341,000 --> 0:06:51,000
If you, say, wanted to get from Regent's Park station

113
0:06:51.509,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to Great Portland Street,

114
0:06:53.159,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the Tube map would tell you:

115
0:06:55.017,000 --> 0:06:59,000
take the Tube, go to Baker Street, change over, take another Tube.

116
0:06:59.653,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Of course, what you don't know is that the two stations

117
0:07:03.574,000 --> 0:07:05,000
are only about a hundred meters apart.

118
0:07:06.142,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now we've reached the subject of public transport,

119
0:07:09.053,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and public transport here in Dublin

120
0:07:12.121,000 --> 0:07:13,000
is a somewhat touchy subject.

121
0:07:14.128,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:16.431,000 --> 0:07:19,000
For everybody who does not know the public transport here in Dublin,

123
0:07:19.668,000 --> 0:07:23,000
essentially, we have this system of local buses that grew with the city.

124
0:07:24.635,000 --> 0:07:27,000
For every outskirt that was added, there was another bus route added,

125
0:07:28.283,000 --> 0:07:31,000
running from the outskirt all the way to the city center.

126
0:07:33.227,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And as these local buses approach the city center,

127
0:07:37.22,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they all run side by side and converge in pretty much one main street.

128
0:07:42.795,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago,

129
0:07:46.732,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I tried to make sense of that.

130
0:07:50.817,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Because exploring a city on foot only gets you so far.

131
0:07:55.234,000 --> 0:08:,000
But when you explore a foreign and new public transport system,

132
0:08:00.587,000 --> 0:08:04,000
you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way.

133
0:08:06.362,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Typically, you choose yourself a rapid transport route,

134
0:08:11.119,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and in your mind, this route is perceived as a straight line.

135
0:08:15.555,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And like a pearl necklace,

136
0:08:17.231,000 --> 0:08:21,000
all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line.

137
0:08:22.849,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And only then you start to discover some local bus routes

138
0:08:28.527,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that would fill in the gaps,

139
0:08:30.266,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and that allow for those wormhole, inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.

140
0:08:36.947,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So I tried to make sense, and when I arrived,

141
0:08:40.363,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I was looking for some information leaflets

142
0:08:42.927,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that would help me crack this system and understand it,

143
0:08:46.468,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I found those brochures.

144
0:08:48.633,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

145
0:08:52.734,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They were not geographically distorted.

146
0:08:56.103,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They had a lot of omission of information,

147
0:09:00.107,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but unfortunately, the wrong information.

148
0:09:02.498,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Say, in the city center --

149
0:09:04.272,000 --> 0:09:07,000
there were never actually any lines that showed the routes.

150
0:09:07.523,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

151
0:09:08.691,000 --> 0:09:12,000
There are actually not even any stations with names.

152
0:09:13.465,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

153
0:09:14.735,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, the maps of Dublin transport have gotten better,

154
0:09:20.382,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and after I finished the project, they got a good bit better,

155
0:09:25.572,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but still no station names, still no routes.

156
0:09:28.635,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So, being naive, and being half-German, I decided,

157
0:09:34.769,000 --> 0:09:36,000
"Aris, why don't you build your own map?"

158
0:09:37.872,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So that's what I did.

159
0:09:39.211,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I researched how each and every bus route moved through the city, nice and logical,

160
0:09:45.223,000 --> 0:09:46,000
every bus route a separate line.

161
0:09:47.938,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I plotted it into my own map of Dublin,

162
0:09:51.319,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and in the city center ...

163
0:09:53.93,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I got a nice spaghetti plate.

164
0:09:55.584,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

165
0:09:58.136,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Now, this is a bit of a mess,

166
0:10:01.209,000 --> 0:10:03,000
so I decided, of course,

167
0:10:03.383,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"You're going to apply the rules of schematic design,"

168
0:10:06.962,000 --> 0:10:07,000
cleaning up the corridors,

169
0:10:08.847,000 --> 0:10:1,000
widening the streets where there were loads of buses

170
0:10:11.626,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and making the streets at straight, 90-degree corners, 45-degree corners

171
0:10:16.435,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or fractions of that,

172
0:10:17.888,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and filled it in with the bus routes.

173
0:10:20.898,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And I built this city center bus map of the system,

174
0:10:24.221,000 --> 0:10:25,000
how it was five years ago.

175
0:10:26.61,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact

176
0:10:28.996,000 --> 0:10:3,000
of the quays and Westmoreland Street.

177
0:10:31.346,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

178
0:10:34.037,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Now I can proudly say --

179
0:10:36.051,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

180
0:10:42.403,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I can proudly say, as a public transport map,

181
0:10:46.608,000 --> 0:10:49,000
this diagram is an utter failure.

182
0:10:50.564,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

183
0:10:52.475,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Except, probably, in one aspect:

184
0:10:54.534,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I now had a great visual representation

185
0:10:57.186,000 --> 0:11:,000
of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was.

186
0:11:01.775,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now, call me old-fashioned,

187
0:11:04.431,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but I think a public transport route map should have lines,

188
0:11:07.938,000 --> 0:11:09,000
because that's what they are, yeah?

189
0:11:10.055,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They're little pieces of string that wrap their way

190
0:11:13.295,000 --> 0:11:15,000
through the city center or through the city.

191
0:11:15.999,000 --> 0:11:2,000
If you will, the Greek guy inside of me feels if I don't get a line,

192
0:11:21.514,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it's like entering the labyrinth of the Minotaur

193
0:11:24.607,000 --> 0:11:27,000
without having Ariadne giving you the string to find your way.

194
0:11:27.895,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So the outcome of my academic research,

195
0:11:31.862,000 --> 0:11:37,000
loads of questionnaires, case studies and looking at a lot of maps,

196
0:11:38.659,000 --> 0:11:4,000
was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings

197
0:11:41.096,000 --> 0:11:43,000
of the public transport system here in Dublin

198
0:11:43.442,000 --> 0:11:45,000
was the lack of a coherent public transport map --

199
0:11:45.872,000 --> 0:11:47,000
a simplified, coherent public transport map --

200
0:11:48.613,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because I think this is the crucial step to understanding

201
0:11:52.052,000 --> 0:11:55,000
a public transport network on a physical level,

202
0:11:55.273,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but it's also the crucial step to make a public transport network mappable

203
0:11:59.592,000 --> 0:12:,000
on a visual level.

204
0:12:01.599,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So I teamed up with a gentleman called James Leahy,

205
0:12:05.533,000 --> 0:12:08,000
a civil engineer and a recent master's graduate

206
0:12:08.868,000 --> 0:12:11,000
of the Sustainable Development program at DIT,

207
0:12:12.202,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and together we drafted the simplified model network,

208
0:12:16.529,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which I could then go ahead and visualize.

209
0:12:19.831,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So here's what we did.

210
0:12:21.886,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We distributed these rapid-transport corridors throughout the city center,

211
0:12:28.2,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and extended them into the outskirts.

212
0:12:31.1,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Rapid, because we wanted them to be served by rapid-transport vehicles.

213
0:12:37.315,000 --> 0:12:4,000
They would get exclusive road use, where possible,

214
0:12:41.249,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and it would be high-quantity, high-quality transport.

215
0:12:43.828,000 --> 0:12:45,000
James wanted to use bus rapid transport for that,

216
0:12:46.53,000 --> 0:12:47,000
rather than light rail.

217
0:12:47.984,000 --> 0:12:49,000
For me, it was important

218
0:12:50.135,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors

219
0:12:54.557,000 --> 0:12:58,000
would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the street.

220
0:12:59.973,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Now we could take out all the local buses

221
0:13:03.039,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that ran alongside those rapid transport means.

222
0:13:06.136,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again.

223
0:13:09.652,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So, in other words, if there was a street in an outskirt

224
0:13:12.889,000 --> 0:13:15,000
where there had been a bus, we put a bus back in,

225
0:13:15.976,000 --> 0:13:19,000
only now these buses wouldn't run all the way to the city center,

226
0:13:20.431,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but connect to the nearest rapid-transport mode,

227
0:13:23.995,000 --> 0:13:25,000
one of these thick lines over there.

228
0:13:26.18,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So the rest was merely a couple of months of work,

229
0:13:29.349,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and a couple of fights with my girlfriend,

230
0:13:31.472,000 --> 0:13:34,000
of our place constantly being clogged up with maps,

231
0:13:35.448,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and the outcome, one of the outcomes,

232
0:13:37.465,000 --> 0:13:4,000
was this map of the Greater Dublin area.

233
0:13:40.722,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I'll zoom in a little bit.

234
0:13:43.808,000 --> 0:13:47,000
This map only shows the rapid transport connections, no local bus,

235
0:13:47.879,000 --> 0:13:52,000
very much in the "metro map" style that was so successful in London,

236
0:13:53.153,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and that since has been exported to so many other major cities,

237
0:13:57.449,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and therefore is the language that we should use

238
0:14:00.254,000 --> 0:14:02,000
for public transport maps.

239
0:14:03.123,000 --> 0:14:08,000
What's also important is, with a simplified network like this,

240
0:14:08.664,000 --> 0:14:13,000
it now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge

241
0:14:14.166,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and make a public transport map for the city center,

242
0:14:17.763,000 --> 0:14:2,000
one where I wouldn't just show rapid transport connections,

243
0:14:20.883,000 --> 0:14:23,000
but also all the local bus routes, streets and the likes,

244
0:14:24.381,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and this is what a map like this could look like.

245
0:14:26.715,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I'll zoom in a little bit.

246
0:14:31.186,000 --> 0:14:36,000
In this map, I'm including each transport mode,

247
0:14:36.252,000 --> 0:14:4,000
so rapid transport, bus, DART, tram and the likes.

248
0:14:41.459,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Each individual route is represented by a separate line.

249
0:14:48.493,000 --> 0:14:52,000
The map shows each and every station,

250
0:14:52.673,000 --> 0:14:55,000
each and every station name,

251
0:14:56.002,000 --> 0:15:,000
and I'm also displaying side streets.

252
0:15:00.776,000 --> 0:15:03,000
In fact, most of the side streets even with their name,

253
0:15:04.281,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and for good measure, also a couple of landmarks,

254
0:15:09.232,000 --> 0:15:11,000
some of them signified by little symbols,

255
0:15:11.43,000 --> 0:15:14,000
others by these isometric three-dimensional

256
0:15:14.543,000 --> 0:15:15,000
bird's-eye-view drawings.

257
0:15:16.565,000 --> 0:15:18,000
The map is relatively small in overall size,

258
0:15:19.222,000 --> 0:15:22,000
so something that you could still hold as a fold-out map

259
0:15:22.387,000 --> 0:15:25,000
or display in a reasonably-sized display box on a bus shelter.

260
0:15:26.069,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I think it tries to be the best balance

261
0:15:30.737,000 --> 0:15:33,000
between actual representation and simplification --

262
0:15:34.093,000 --> 0:15:39,000
the language of way-finding in our brain.

263
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So, straightened lines, cleaned-up corners,

264
0:15:42.815,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and of course, that very, very important geographic distortion

265
0:15:46.505,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that makes public transport maps possible.

266
0:15:50.053,000 --> 0:15:52,000
If you, for example, have a look at the two main corridors

267
0:15:52.815,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that run through the city -- the yellow and orange one over here --

268
0:15:56.111,000 --> 0:15:59,000
this is how they look in an actual, accurate street map,

269
0:15:59.713,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and this is how they would look in my distorted,

270
0:16:03.722,000 --> 0:16:05,000
simplified public transport map.

271
0:16:06.676,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So for a successful public transport map,

272
0:16:09.602,000 --> 0:16:11,000
we should not stick to accurate representation,

273
0:16:12.38,000 --> 0:16:14,000
but design them in the way our brains work.

274
0:16:14.765,000 --> 0:16:17,000
The reactions I got were tremendous, it was really good to see.

275
0:16:18.06,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And of course, for my own self, I was very happy to see

276
0:16:21.776,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that my folks in Germany and Greece finally have an idea

277
0:16:25.198,000 --> 0:16:26,000
what I do for a living.

278
0:16:26.401,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Laughter)

279
0:16:27.427,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Thank you.

280
0:16:28.602,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

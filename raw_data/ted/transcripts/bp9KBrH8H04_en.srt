1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
As a boy,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I loved cars.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
When I turned 18,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I lost my best friend to a car accident.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Like this.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to saving one million people

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
every year.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I saw the concept first

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in the DARPA Grand Challenges

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
where the U.S. government issued a prize

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And even though a hundred teams were there,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
these cars went nowhere.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We built the hardware and the software.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We made it learn from us,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and we set it free in the desert.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And the unimaginable happened:

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it became the first car

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
winning Stanford 2 million dollars.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Since, our work has focused

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
on building driving cars

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that can drive anywhere by themselves --

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
any street in California.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We've driven 140,000 miles.

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Our cars have sensors

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
by which they magically can see

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
everything around them

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and make decisions

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about every aspect of driving.

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's the perfect driving mechanism.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We've driven in cities,

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
like in San Francisco here.

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
We've encountered joggers,

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
busy highways, toll booths,

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and this is without a person in the loop;

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the car just drives itself.

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
people didn't even notice.

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Mountain roads,

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
day and night,

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and even crooked Lombard Street

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in San Francisco.

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Sometimes our cars get so crazy,

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
they even do little stunts.

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Video) Man: Oh, my God.

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
What?

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Second Man: It's driving itself.

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but I can do something for all the people who died.

58
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Do you know that driving accidents

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
are the number one cause of death for young people?

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And do you realize that almost all of those

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
are due to human error

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and not machine error,

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and can therefore be prevented by machines?

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Do you realize

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that we could change the capacity of highways

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
by a factor of two or three

67
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
if we didn't rely on human precision

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
on staying in the lane --

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
improve body position

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and therefore drive a little bit closer together

71
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
on a little bit narrower lanes,

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and do away with all traffic jams on highways?

73
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Do you realize that you, TED users,

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
spend an average

75
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of 52 minutes per day

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in traffic,

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
wasting your time

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
on your daily commute?

79
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You could regain this time.

80
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is four billion hours

81
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
wasted in this country alone.

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.

83
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,

84
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I'm really looking forward to a time

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
when generations after us look back at us

86
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.

87
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Thank you.

88
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I am a reformed marketer,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I now work in international development.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is the [second] largest country in Africa.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The DRC is a dangerous place.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In the past 10 years, five million people have died

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
due to a war in the east.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But war isn't the only reason

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that life is difficult in the DRC.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There are many health issues as well.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is 1.3 percent among adults.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This might not sound like a large number,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but in a country with 76 million people,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it means there are 930,000 that are infected.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And due to the poor infrastructure,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
only 25 percent of those

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Which is why, in part,

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
donor agencies provide condoms

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
at low or no cost.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And so while I was in the DRC,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
including Damien.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight,

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so it's not a place that you stay.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now Damien knows all about condoms,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but he doesn't sell them.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He said there's just not in demand.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's not surprising,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because only three percent of people in the DRC

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
use condoms.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Joseph and Christine,

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
their customers don't buy the branded versions.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They like the generics.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And as a marketer, I found that curious.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And it turns out that there are three main messages

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
used by the donor agencies for these condoms:

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
fear, financing and fidelity.

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live"

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or Trust.

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They package it with the red ribbon

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that reminds us of HIV,

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them,

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
show pictures of your wife or husband

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and tell you to protect them

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
or to act prudently.

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
just before they go get a condom.

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What is it that you think about

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
just before you get a condom?

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Sex!

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places,

63
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
they understand this.

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Their marketing is slightly different.

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The name might not be much different,

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but the imagery sure is.

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Some brands are aspirational,

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And this made me think

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
on a key aspect of marketing:

72
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
understanding who's the audience.

73
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And for donor agencies, unfortunately,

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the audience tends to be

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It's people back home,

77
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
people that support their work,

78
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
people like these.

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But if what we're really trying to do

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is stop the spread of HIV,

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we need to think about the customer,

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the people whose behavior needs to change --

83
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the couples,

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the young women, the young men --

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
whose lives depend on it.

86
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And so the lesson is this:

87
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it doesn't really matter what you're selling;

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you just have to think about who is your customer,

89
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and what are the messages

90
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that are going to get them to change their behavior.

91
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It might just save their lives.

92
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Thank you.

93
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.1,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Well, as many of you know,

2
0:00:13.659,000 --> 0:00:15,000
the results of the recent election were as follows:

3
0:00:16.98,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate

4
0:00:19.62,000 --> 0:00:2,000
won a landslide victory

5
0:00:21.54,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with 52 percent of the overall vote.

6
0:00:24.34,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Jill Stein, the Green candidate,

7
0:00:26.62,000 --> 0:00:28,000
came a distant second, with 19 percent.

8
0:00:29.9,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate,

9
0:00:32.38,000 --> 0:00:34,000
was hot on her heels with 14 percent,

10
0:00:35.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the remainder of the vote were shared between abstainers

11
0:00:38.94,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate.

12
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.18,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, what parallel universe do you suppose I live in?

14
0:00:52.58,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Well, I don't live in a parallel universe.

15
0:00:54.62,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I live in the world, and that is how the world voted.

16
0:00:58.98,000 --> 0:01:,000
So let me take you back and explain what I mean by that.

17
0:01:02.62,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In June this year,

18
0:01:03.86,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I launched something called the Global Vote.

19
0:01:06.62,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And the Global Vote does exactly what it says on the tin.

20
0:01:10.46,000 --> 0:01:11,000
For the first time in history,

21
0:01:12.14,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it lets anybody, anywhere in the world,

22
0:01:14.9,000 --> 0:01:17,000
vote in the elections of other people's countries.

23
0:01:18.86,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now, why would you do that?

24
0:01:20.94,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What's the point?

25
0:01:22.58,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Well, let me show you what it looks like.

26
0:01:24.94,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You go to a website,

27
0:01:27.62,000 --> 0:01:28,000
rather a beautiful website,

28
0:01:29.66,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and then you select an election.

29
0:01:32.5,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Here's a bunch that we've already covered.

30
0:01:35.78,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We do about one a month, or thereabouts.

31
0:01:38.94,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So you can see Bulgaria, the United States of America,

32
0:01:41.78,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Secretary-General of the United Nations,

33
0:01:44.3,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the Brexit referendum at the end there.

34
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You select the election that you're interested in,

35
0:01:50.06,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and you pick the candidates.

36
0:01:53.34,000 --> 0:01:55,000
These are the candidates from the recent presidential election

37
0:01:56.3,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in the tiny island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe,

38
0:01:59.42,000 --> 0:02:01,000
199,000 inhabitants,

39
0:02:01.82,000 --> 0:02:02,000
off the coast of West Africa.

40
0:02:04.34,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And then you can look at the brief summary of each of those candidates

41
0:02:08.86,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which I dearly hope is very neutral,

42
0:02:11.38,000 --> 0:02:13,000
very informative and very succinct.

43
0:02:14.22,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And when you've found the one you like, you vote.

44
0:02:17.46,000 --> 0:02:18,000
These were the candidates

45
0:02:19.02,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in the recent Icelandic presidential election,

46
0:02:21.9,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and that's the way it goes.

47
0:02:24.74,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So why on earth would you want to vote in another country's election?

48
0:02:30.54,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Well, the reason that you wouldn't want to do it,

49
0:02:33.66,000 --> 0:02:34,000
let me reassure you,

50
0:02:34.9,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is in order to interfere in the democratic processes of another country.

51
0:02:38.82,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That's not the purpose at all.

52
0:02:40.5,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In fact, you can't,

53
0:02:41.94,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because usually what I do is I release the results

54
0:02:44.42,000 --> 0:02:47,000
after the electorate in each individual country has already voted,

55
0:02:47.98,000 --> 0:02:49,000
so there's no way that we could interfere in that process.

56
0:02:50.82,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But more importantly,

57
0:02:52.22,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I'm not particularly interested

58
0:02:53.82,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in the domestic issues of individual countries.

59
0:02:56.1,000 --> 0:02:57,000
That's not what we're voting on.

60
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton proposed to do for the Americans

61
0:03:02.46,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is frankly none of our business.

62
0:03:04.5,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That's something that only the Americans can vote on.

63
0:03:07.54,000 --> 0:03:1,000
No, in the global vote, you're only considering one aspect of it,

64
0:03:11.1,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which is what are those leaders going to do for the rest of us?

65
0:03:15.3,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And that's so very important because we live,

66
0:03:17.98,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as no doubt you're sick of hearing people tell you,

67
0:03:20.42,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in a globalized, hyperconnected, massively interdependent world

68
0:03:25.7,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where the political decisions of people in other countries

69
0:03:28.46,000 --> 0:03:3,000
can and will have an impact on our lives

70
0:03:30.7,000 --> 0:03:32,000
no matter who we are, no matter where we live.

71
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Like the wings of the butterfly

72
0:03:36.14,000 --> 0:03:38,000
beating on one side of the Pacific

73
0:03:38.46,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that can apparently create a hurricane on the other side,

74
0:03:42.02,000 --> 0:03:44,000
so it is with the world that we live in today

75
0:03:44.7,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and the world of politics.

76
0:03:46.42,000 --> 0:03:5,000
There is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs.

77
0:03:51.74,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Any country, no matter how small,

78
0:03:54.18,000 --> 0:03:56,000
even if it's São Tomé and Príncipe,

79
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
could produce the next Nelson Mandela

80
0:03:58.82,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or the next Stalin.

81
0:04:01.46,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They could pollute the atmosphere and the oceans, which belong to all of us,

82
0:04:05.46,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or they could be responsible and they could help all of us.

83
0:04:09.42,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And yet, the system is so strange

84
0:04:12.54,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because the system hasn't caught up with this globalized reality.

85
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Only a small number of people are allowed to vote for those leaders,

86
0:04:19.5,000 --> 0:04:21,000
even though their impact is gigantic

87
0:04:21.58,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and almost universal.

88
0:04:23.86,000 --> 0:04:24,000
What number was it?

89
0:04:25.3,000 --> 0:04:27,000
140 million Americans voted

90
0:04:27.86,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for the next president of the United States,

91
0:04:30.14,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and yet, as all of us knows, in a few weeks time,

92
0:04:33.099,000 --> 0:04:35,000
somebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes

93
0:04:35.74,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to Donald J. Trump.

94
0:04:37.54,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, if that isn't having a potential impact on all of us,

95
0:04:40.38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I don't know what is.

96
0:04:42.34,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Similarly, the election for the referendum on the Brexit vote,

97
0:04:49.02,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a small number of millions of British people voted on that,

98
0:04:52.46,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but the outcome of the vote, whichever way it went,

99
0:04:55.18,000 --> 0:04:56,000
would have had a significant impact

100
0:04:56.9,000 --> 0:05:,000
on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions of people around the world.

101
0:05:01.34,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And yet, only a tiny number could vote.

102
0:05:03.78,000 --> 0:05:04,000
What kind of democracy is that?

103
0:05:06.42,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Huge decisions that affect all of us

104
0:05:08.18,000 --> 0:05:11,000
being decided by relatively very small numbers of people.

105
0:05:12.06,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I don't know about you,

106
0:05:13.42,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but I don't think that sounds very democratic.

107
0:05:16.18,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So I'm trying to clear it up.

108
0:05:17.98,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But as I say,

109
0:05:19.46,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we don't ask about domestic questions.

110
0:05:21.34,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In fact, I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates.

111
0:05:24.42,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I send them the same two questions every single time.

112
0:05:26.94,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I say, one,

113
0:05:28.38,000 --> 0:05:31,000
if you get elected, what are you going to do for the rest of us,

114
0:05:31.54,000 --> 0:05:34,000
for the remainder of the seven billion who live on this planet?

115
0:05:34.98,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Second question:

116
0:05:36.94,000 --> 0:05:39,000
What is your vision for your country's future in the world?

117
0:05:40.18,000 --> 0:05:41,000
What role do you see it playing?

118
0:05:42.38,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Every candidate, I send them those questions.

119
0:05:45.18,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.

120
0:05:47.3,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I reckon if you're standing

121
0:05:49.1,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to become the next president of the United States,

122
0:05:51.5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
you're probably pretty tied up most of the time,

123
0:05:53.9,000 --> 0:05:57,000
so I'm not altogether surprised that they don't all answer, but many do.

124
0:05:57.98,000 --> 0:05:58,000
More every time.

125
0:05:59.5,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And some of them do much more than answer.

126
0:06:01.58,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way

127
0:06:04.74,000 --> 0:06:05,000
you could imagine.

128
0:06:05.98,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I just want to say a word here for Saviour Chishimba,

129
0:06:08.5,000 --> 0:06:09,000
who was one of the candidates

130
0:06:09.94,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in the recent Zambian presidential election.

131
0:06:12.22,000 --> 0:06:16,000
His answers to those two questions were basically an 18-page dissertation

132
0:06:16.78,000 --> 0:06:19,000
on his view of Zambia's potential role in the world

133
0:06:20.46,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and in the international community.

134
0:06:22.5,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I posted it on the website so anybody could read it.

135
0:06:25.74,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, Saviour won the global vote,

136
0:06:28.78,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but he didn't win the Zambian election.

137
0:06:31.14,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So I found myself wondering,

138
0:06:32.54,000 --> 0:06:34,000
what am I going to do with this extraordinary group of people?

139
0:06:35.5,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I've got some wonderful people here who won the global vote.

140
0:06:38.38,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We always get it wrong, by the way.

141
0:06:40.1,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The one that we elect

142
0:06:41.34,000 --> 0:06:43,000
is never the person who's elected by the domestic electorate.

143
0:06:45.46,000 --> 0:06:47,000
That may be partly because we always seem to go for the woman.

144
0:06:49.22,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But I think it may also be a sign

145
0:06:51.38,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that the domestic electorate is still thinking very nationally.

146
0:06:54.98,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They're still thinking very inwardly.

147
0:06:57.14,000 --> 0:07:,000
They're still asking themselves: What's in it for me? ...

148
0:07:00.66,000 --> 0:07:02,000
instead of what they should be asking today,

149
0:07:02.78,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which is, what's in it for we?

150
0:07:05.82,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But there you go.

151
0:07:07.06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So suggestions, please, not right now,

152
0:07:09.22,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but send me an email if you've got an idea

153
0:07:11.244,000 --> 0:07:14,000
about what we can do with this amazing team of glorious losers.

154
0:07:14.52,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:15.62,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We've got Saviour Chishimba, who I mentioned before.

156
0:07:18.1,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We've got Halla Tómasdóttir,

157
0:07:19.5,000 --> 0:07:21,000
who was the runner up in the Icelandic presidential election.

158
0:07:22.42,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Many of you may have seen her amazing talk at TEDWomen

159
0:07:25.14,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just a few weeks ago

160
0:07:26.38,000 --> 0:07:29,000
where she spoke about the need for more women to get into politics.

161
0:07:29.98,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We've got Maria das Neves from São Tomé and Príncipe.

162
0:07:33.34,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We've got Hillary Clinton.

163
0:07:34.98,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I don't know if she's available.

164
0:07:37.06,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We've got Jill Stein.

165
0:07:39.3,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And we covered also the election

166
0:07:42.18,000 --> 0:07:44,000
for the next Secretary-General of the United Nations.

167
0:07:45.285,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We've got the ex-prime minister of New Zealand,

168
0:07:47.5,000 --> 0:07:49,000
who would be a wonderful member of the team.

169
0:07:49.62,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So I think maybe those people,

170
0:07:51.14,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the glorious loser's club, could travel around the world

171
0:07:53.82,000 --> 0:07:54,000
wherever there's an election

172
0:07:55.22,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and remind people of the necessity in our modern age

173
0:07:58.62,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of thinking a little bit outwards

174
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and thinking of the international consequences.

175
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So what comes next for the global vote?

176
0:08:06.18,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Well, obviously,

177
0:08:07.98,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the Donald and Hillary show is a bit of a difficult one to follow,

178
0:08:12.46,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but there are some other really important elections coming up.

179
0:08:15.42,000 --> 0:08:16,000
In fact, they seem to be multiplying.

180
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
There's something going on, I'm sure you've noticed, in the world.

181
0:08:20.42,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the next row of elections are all critically important.

182
0:08:25.1,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In just a few day's time

183
0:08:26.62,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we've got the rerun of the Austrian presidential election,

184
0:08:29.7,000 --> 0:08:3,000
with the prospect of Norbert Hofer

185
0:08:31.5,000 --> 0:08:32,000
becoming what is commonly described

186
0:08:33.5,000 --> 0:08:36,000
as the first far-right head of state in Europe since the Second World War.

187
0:08:38.1,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Next year we've got Germany,

188
0:08:39.54,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we've got France,

189
0:08:40.78,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we've got presidential elections in Iran

190
0:08:42.94,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and a dozen others.

191
0:08:44.739,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It doesn't get less important.

192
0:08:46.9,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It gets more and more important.

193
0:08:50.22,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Clearly, the global vote is not a stand-alone project.

194
0:08:54.02,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's not just there on its own.

195
0:08:56.58,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It has some background.

196
0:08:57.86,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's part of a project which I launched back in 2014,

197
0:09:01.9,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which I call the Good Country.

198
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The idea of the Good Country is basically very simple.

199
0:09:07.66,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's my simple diagnosis of what's wrong with the world

200
0:09:11.14,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and how we can fix it.

201
0:09:13.62,000 --> 0:09:15,000
What's wrong with the world I've already hinted at.

202
0:09:16.06,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Basically, we face an enormous and growing number

203
0:09:18.82,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of gigantic, existential global challenges:

204
0:09:22.02,000 --> 0:09:24,000
climate change, human rights abuses,

205
0:09:24.7,000 --> 0:09:28,000
mass migration, terrorism, economic chaos, weapons proliferation.

206
0:09:29.9,000 --> 0:09:32,000
All of these problems which threaten to wipe us out

207
0:09:33.1,000 --> 0:09:35,000
are by their very nature globalized problems.

208
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
No individual country has the capability of tackling them on its own.

209
0:09:40.58,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And so very obviously

210
0:09:42.34,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we have to cooperate and we have to collaborate as nations

211
0:09:45.98,000 --> 0:09:46,000
if we're going to solve these problems.

212
0:09:48.38,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's so obvious, and yet we don't.

213
0:09:51.7,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We don't do it nearly often enough.

214
0:09:54.46,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Most of the time, countries still persist in behaving

215
0:09:58.06,000 --> 0:10:02,000
as if they were warring, selfish tribes battling against each other,

216
0:10:02.74,000 --> 0:10:04,000
much as they have done since the nation-state was invented

217
0:10:05.5,000 --> 0:10:06,000
hundreds of years ago.

218
0:10:07.1,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And this has got to change.

219
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
This is not a change in political systems or a change in ideology.

220
0:10:12.62,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This is a change in culture.

221
0:10:14.58,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We, all of us, have to understand

222
0:10:17.46,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that thinking inwards is not the solution to the world's problems.

223
0:10:21.5,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We have to learn how to cooperate and collaborate a great deal more

224
0:10:25.5,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and compete just a tiny bit less.

225
0:10:29.02,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Otherwise things are going to carry on getting bad

226
0:10:31.42,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and they're going to get much worse, much sooner than we anticipate.

227
0:10:35.58,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This change will only happen

228
0:10:37.5,000 --> 0:10:38,000
if we ordinary people

229
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
tell our politicians that things have changed.

230
0:10:42.1,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We have to tell them that the culture has changed.

231
0:10:44.66,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We have to tell them that they've got a new mandate.

232
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The old mandate was very simple and very single:

233
0:10:50.18,000 --> 0:10:52,000
if you're in a position of power or authority,

234
0:10:52.38,000 --> 0:10:55,000
you're responsible for your own people and your own tiny slice of territory,

235
0:10:56.02,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and that's it.

236
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And if in order to do the best thing for your own people,

237
0:10:59.98,000 --> 0:11:02,000
you screw over everybody else on the planet, that's even better.

238
0:11:03.06,000 --> 0:11:04,000
That's considered to be a bit macho.

239
0:11:04.82,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Today, I think everybody in a position of power and responsibility

240
0:11:08.22,000 --> 0:11:09,000
has got a dual mandate,

241
0:11:09.86,000 --> 0:11:11,000
which says if you're in a position of power and responsibility,

242
0:11:12.86,000 --> 0:11:13,000
you're responsible for your own people

243
0:11:14.74,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and for every single man, woman, child and animal on the planet.

244
0:11:19.1,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You're responsible for your own slice of territory

245
0:11:21.5,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and for every single square mile of the earth's surface

246
0:11:25.22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and the atmosphere above it.

247
0:11:26.62,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And if you don't like that responsibility, you should not be in power.

248
0:11:29.98,000 --> 0:11:31,000
That for me is the rule of the modern age,

249
0:11:32.06,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and that's the message that we've got to get across to our politicians,

250
0:11:35.46,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and show them that that's the way things are done these days.

251
0:11:38.78,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

252
0:11:41.86,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I don't have a problem, actually,

253
0:11:43.5,000 --> 0:11:45,000
with Donald Trump's credo of "America first."

254
0:11:46.46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It seems to me that that's a pretty banal statement

255
0:11:48.9,000 --> 0:11:51,000
of what politicians have always done and probably should always do.

256
0:11:52.1,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Of course they're elected to represent the interests of their own people.

257
0:11:56.3,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But what I find so boring and so old-fashioned

258
0:11:59.3,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and so unimaginative about his take on that

259
0:12:02.06,000 --> 0:12:04,000
is that America first means everyone else last,

260
0:12:06.1,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that making America great again means making everybody else small again,

261
0:12:10.3,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and it's just not true.

262
0:12:12.46,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In my job as a policy advisor over the last 20 years or so,

263
0:12:15.38,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I've seen so many hundreds of examples of policies

264
0:12:19.02,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that harmonize the international and the domestic needs,

265
0:12:22.58,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and they make better policy.

266
0:12:24.58,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I'm not asking nations to be altruistic or self-sacrificing.

267
0:12:28.18,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That would be ridiculous.

268
0:12:29.54,000 --> 0:12:3,000
No nation would ever do that.

269
0:12:31.66,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I'm asking them to wake up and understand that we need a new form of governance,

270
0:12:35.5,000 --> 0:12:36,000
which is possible

271
0:12:37.46,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and which harmonizes those two needs,

272
0:12:39.3,000 --> 0:12:42,000
those good for our own people and those good for everybody else.

273
0:12:43.34,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Since the US election and since Brexit

274
0:12:45.58,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it's become more and more obvious to me

275
0:12:47.98,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that those old distinctions of left wing and right wing

276
0:12:50.62,000 --> 0:12:51,000
no longer make sense.

277
0:12:51.94,000 --> 0:12:52,000
They really don't fit the pattern.

278
0:12:54.58,000 --> 0:12:56,000
What does seem to matter today

279
0:12:56.9,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is very simple,

280
0:12:58.54,000 --> 0:13:,000
whether your view of the world is

281
0:13:00.74,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that you take comfort from looking inwards and backwards,

282
0:13:04.46,000 --> 0:13:08,000
or whether, like me, you find hope in looking forwards and outwards.

283
0:13:10.06,000 --> 0:13:11,000
That's the new politics.

284
0:13:11.58,000 --> 0:13:14,000
That's the new division that is splitting the world right down the middle.

285
0:13:16.62,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Now, that may sound judgmental, but it's not meant to be.

286
0:13:19.54,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I don't at all misunderstand

287
0:13:21.5,000 --> 0:13:25,000
why so many people find their comfort in looking inwards and backwards.

288
0:13:26.38,000 --> 0:13:28,000
When times are difficult, when you're short of money,

289
0:13:28.9,000 --> 0:13:3,000
when you're feeling insecure and vulnerable,

290
0:13:31.02,000 --> 0:13:33,000
it's almost a natural human tendency to turn inwards,

291
0:13:33.54,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to think of your own needs

292
0:13:35.58,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and to discard everybody else's,

293
0:13:37.7,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and perhaps to start to imagine that the past was somehow better

294
0:13:41.46,000 --> 0:13:43,000
than the present or the future could ever be.

295
0:13:44.54,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But I happen to believe that that's a dead end.

296
0:13:47.02,000 --> 0:13:49,000
History shows us that it's a dead end.

297
0:13:49.3,000 --> 0:13:51,000
When people turn inwards and turn backwards,

298
0:13:51.46,000 --> 0:13:52,000
human progress becomes reversed

299
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and things get worse for everybody very quickly indeed.

300
0:13:58.54,000 --> 0:13:59,000
If you're like me

301
0:13:59.98,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and you believe in forwards and outwards,

302
0:14:02.7,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and you believe that the best thing about humanity is its diversity,

303
0:14:07.42,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and the best thing about globalization

304
0:14:10.22,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is the way that it stirs up that diversity, that cultural mixture

305
0:14:14.54,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to make something more creative, more exciting, more productive

306
0:14:17.58,000 --> 0:14:19,000
than there's ever been before in human history,

307
0:14:20.54,000 --> 0:14:22,000
then, my friends, we've got a job on our hands,

308
0:14:23.98,000 --> 0:14:25,000
because the inwards and backwards brigade

309
0:14:26.9,000 --> 0:14:28,000
are uniting as never before,

310
0:14:29.46,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and that creed of inwards and backwards,

311
0:14:31.42,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that fear, that anxiety,

312
0:14:34.86,000 --> 0:14:35,000
playing on the simplest instincts,

313
0:14:36.7,000 --> 0:14:38,000
is sweeping across the world.

314
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Those of us who believe,

315
0:14:41.22,000 --> 0:14:43,000
as I believe, in forwards and outwards,

316
0:14:43.98,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we have to get ourselves organized,

317
0:14:46.9,000 --> 0:14:49,000
because time is running out very, very quickly.

1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In 1969 in July,

2
0:00:15.375,000 --> 0:00:17,000
three Americans launched into space.

3
0:00:18.333,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Now, they went to the surface of the moon,

4
0:00:20.75,000 --> 0:00:23,000
they famously made the great leap for mankind.

5
0:00:24.25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, they walked on the surface,

6
0:00:27.375,000 --> 0:00:28,000
they planted this flag.

7
0:00:28.667,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's rightly celebrated as a moment that in America we say is a triumph.

8
0:00:34.125,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We think it was this amazing accomplishment.

9
0:00:37.125,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They didn't just leave behind this flag, though.

10
0:00:39.417,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They also left behind a plaque.

11
0:00:40.918,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This plaque is a beautiful object,

12
0:00:42.583,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and one that I want to talk to you a little bit about.

13
0:00:45.167,000 --> 0:00:47,000
First, you might notice that there's two globes,

14
0:00:47.43,000 --> 0:00:48,000
representing all of earth.

15
0:00:48.708,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And then there's this beautiful statement:

16
0:00:50.75,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"We came in peace for all mankind."

17
0:00:52.458,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, at first, this is just nice poetic language,

18
0:00:55.583,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but it's also set in a typeface that's perfect for this moment.

19
0:00:59.458,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It seems industrial, it seems engineered.

20
0:01:02.667,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It also is the best possible name

21
0:01:04.263,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you could come up with for something on the moon: Futura.

22
0:01:08.083,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, I want to talk to you about fonts,

23
0:01:09.965,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and why this typeface is perfect for this moment.

24
0:01:12.333,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But it's actually more than just ceremonial.

25
0:01:15.25,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, when all of you arrived here today,

26
0:01:18.042,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you actually had to think about fonts.

27
0:01:20.667,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You might not realize it,

28
0:01:21.958,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but you're all unconscious experts on typography.

29
0:01:24.958,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Typography is the study of how fonts inhabit our world,

30
0:01:29.333,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they're the visual language of the words we use.

31
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Here's the thing that's funny about this, though.

32
0:01:36.333,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I know you're probably not like me, you're not a font nerd,

33
0:01:39.125,000 --> 0:01:41,000
maybe some of you are, but if you're not, that's alright,

34
0:01:41.875,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because I might spend hours every day

35
0:01:43.875,000 --> 0:01:45,000
trying to pick the perfect typeface for the perfect project,

36
0:01:46.709,000 --> 0:01:48,000
or I might spend thousands of dollars every year,

37
0:01:49.042,000 --> 0:01:51,000
trying to get ones with the right features.

38
0:01:51.125,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But all of you actually spend hours every day, evaluating fonts.

39
0:01:54.292,000 --> 0:01:56,000
If you don't believe me, think about how you got here.

40
0:01:56.875,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Each of you had to judge by the signs

41
0:01:58.667,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and maybe even on your phone,

42
0:02:00.125,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which signals to trust and which to ignore.

43
0:02:03.625,000 --> 0:02:04,000
You were evaluating fonts.

44
0:02:04.917,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Or maybe when you're just buying a new product,

45
0:02:07.167,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you have to think about whether something is expensive

46
0:02:09.715,000 --> 0:02:12,000
or cheap or hard to get or easy to find.

47
0:02:13.458,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And the funny thing about it is,

48
0:02:15.083,000 --> 0:02:16,000
this may not seem extraordinary to you,

49
0:02:16.965,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but the moment you see something out of place,

50
0:02:19.292,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you recognize it right away.

51
0:02:20.667,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:23.083,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The thing I love about typography,

53
0:02:24.792,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and why I love fonts and why I love Futura,

54
0:02:27.083,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is that, for me, what I study is everywhere.

55
0:02:30.958,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Every street that I walk down, every book that I pick up,

56
0:02:33.667,000 --> 0:02:38,000
every thing that I read is filled with the thing I love.

57
0:02:38.833,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, once you understand the history and what happens with typography,

58
0:02:43.167,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you actually have a history of everything before you.

59
0:02:46.583,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And this is the typeface Futura.

60
0:02:48.833,000 --> 0:02:51,000
As previously we've discussed, this is modernism in miniature.

61
0:02:52.25,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This is a way in which modernism infiltrated this country

62
0:02:55.042,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and became perhaps the most popular, or promiscuous typeface,

63
0:02:58.292,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of the twentieth century.

64
0:03:00.292,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"Less is more," right, these are the aphorisms of modernism.

65
0:03:03.625,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And in the visual arts, the same thing happened.

66
0:03:05.917,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Let's focus on the essentials, focus on the basic shapes,

67
0:03:08.625,000 --> 0:03:09,000
focus on geometry.

68
0:03:09.917,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So Futura actually holds this to its core.

69
0:03:12.667,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You might notice that the shapes inherent in Futura

70
0:03:15.125,000 --> 0:03:16,000
have circles, squares, triangles.

71
0:03:16.875,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Some of the shapes are all based on circles,

72
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:2,000
like the O, D and C,

73
0:03:20.292,000 --> 0:03:23,000
or others have this pointed apex of the triangle.

74
0:03:23.792,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Others just look like they might have been made

75
0:03:26.042,000 --> 0:03:27,000
with a ruler or a compass.

76
0:03:27.375,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They feel geometric, they feel mathematic, precise.

77
0:03:30.083,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In fact, this whole system carries through with the way

78
0:03:32.708,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that the typeface was designed.

79
0:03:34.25,000 --> 0:03:37,000
To not look like it was made like other typefaces, to be something new.

80
0:03:37.625,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Here it is in the lightweight, the medium weight and the bold weight.

81
0:03:41.875,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The whole family has different things to commend to it.

82
0:03:44.875,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This was a conscious break from the past,

83
0:03:46.875,000 --> 0:03:49,000
something that looked like it was made by a machine, and not by hand.

84
0:03:50.167,000 --> 0:03:52,000
When I say not made by hand, this is what I mean.

85
0:03:52.5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
This is what we think about maybe,

86
0:03:54.167,000 --> 0:03:57,000
when you might create something with a calligraphic brush or a pen.

87
0:03:57.792,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That there's thicks and thins.

88
0:03:59.25,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And even more traditional typefaces, say like a Garamond,

89
0:04:02.667,000 --> 0:04:03,000
holds vestiges of this old system

90
0:04:04.458,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in which you can see the A where it get little bit thinner at the top

91
0:04:07.75,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and thicker down below,

92
0:04:09.042,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because it's trying to look like someone had made it by hand.

93
0:04:11.958,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But Futura, in contrast,

94
0:04:13.292,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is designed to look like no one had touched it at all,

95
0:04:15.875,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that this was made by a machine,

96
0:04:17.458,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for a machine age, for an industrial age.

97
0:04:19.458,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There's actually a sleight of hand here

98
0:04:21.542,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that Paul Renner, the designer who made this in 1927, employed.

99
0:04:25.292,000 --> 0:04:26,000
If you look at the way in which

100
0:04:26.833,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the circular shape joins with the vertical shaft,

101
0:04:29.791,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you'll notice that it tapers just every so slightly.

102
0:04:33.041,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And this is one of hundreds of ways

103
0:04:34.792,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in which this typeface was designed to look geometrically perfect,

104
0:04:37.958,000 --> 0:04:38,000
even though it's mathematically not.

105
0:04:39.75,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And this is what typeface designers do all the time

106
0:04:42.167,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to make typefaces work, every day.

107
0:04:44.833,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, there were other designers doing this at the same time in Europe and America.

108
0:04:48.75,000 --> 0:04:5,000
These are a few other excellent examples from Europe,

109
0:04:51.292,000 --> 0:04:54,000
trying to create something new for the new age, a new moment in time.

110
0:04:54.583,000 --> 0:04:55,000
These are some other ones in Germany

111
0:04:56.375,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that in some ways look very similar to Futura,

112
0:04:58.583,000 --> 0:05:01,000
maybe with higher waist or lower waist or different proportions.

113
0:05:01.667,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Then why did Futura take over the world?

114
0:05:03.625,000 --> 0:05:05,000
In this case, if you can read the titles there,

115
0:05:06.167,000 --> 0:05:08,000
some of these names don't quite roll off the tongue:

116
0:05:08.958,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Erbar, Kabel Light, Berthold-Grotesk, Elegant-Grotesk.

117
0:05:14.333,000 --> 0:05:16,000
These aren't exactly household names, are they?

118
0:05:16.583,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And so when you compare that to Futura,

119
0:05:19.292,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you realize that this was a really good choice by the marketing team.

120
0:05:22.583,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What's amazing about this name --

121
0:05:24.333,000 --> 0:05:26,000
you know, what's in this name is that this is a name

122
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that actually invokes hope and an idea about the future.

123
0:05:30.708,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And this isn't actually the word for future in German,

124
0:05:33.256,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it wasn't a German name,

125
0:05:34.542,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they actually picked something

126
0:05:36.042,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that would speak to a wider, larger audience, a universal audience.

127
0:05:39.25,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And when you compare it to what was being done in America --

128
0:05:42.125,000 --> 0:05:44,000
these are the typefaces from the same period

129
0:05:44.25,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in the United States in the 1920s,

130
0:05:45.917,000 --> 0:05:46,000
bold, brash, braggadocios.

131
0:05:47.25,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You almost think of this as exactly like what the stock market looked like

132
0:05:50.792,000 --> 0:05:52,000
when they were all going nuts in the 1920s.

133
0:05:52.875,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And you realize that Futura is doing something revolutionary.

134
0:05:55.792,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I want to step back and talk about an example of the typeface in use.

135
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So this is a magazine that we all probably know today, "Vanity Fair."

136
0:06:03.292,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is what it looked like in 1929, in the summer.

137
0:06:06.667,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And in many ways, there's nothing wrong with this design.

138
0:06:10.083,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is absolutely typical of the 1920s.

139
0:06:12.708,000 --> 0:06:14,000
There's a photograph of an important person,

140
0:06:14.833,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in this case Franklin Roosevelt, then-governor of New York.

141
0:06:17.667,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Everything seems centered, everything seems symmetrical.

142
0:06:20.333,000 --> 0:06:22,000
There's still a little bit of ornamentation,

143
0:06:22.458,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so this is still maybe having some vestiges of the painted lady

144
0:06:25.458,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and not fully modernistic.

145
0:06:26.75,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But everything seems kid of solid.

146
0:06:28.417,000 --> 0:06:3,000
There's even drop caps to help you get into the text.

147
0:06:30.958,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But this all changed very quickly and in October of 1929,

148
0:06:33.708,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a Berlin-based designer came and redesigned "Vanity Fair."

149
0:06:36.708,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And this is what it looks like with Futura.

150
0:06:39.917,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Instead of the governor

151
0:06:41.792,000 --> 0:06:43,000
now we have a photograph of an abstract, beautiful setting,

152
0:06:44.708,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in this case, the ocean.

153
0:06:46.25,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Instead of drop caps, there's nothing at all.

154
0:06:48.5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And replaced with a centered layout is now asymmetry.

155
0:06:52.583,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And it gets even more radical the further you enter the magazine.

156
0:06:55.667,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In this case, even more dramatic asymmetry.

157
0:06:57.708,000 --> 0:07:,000
In this case, illustrations by Pablo Picasso, moving across the page

158
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and breaking the gutter of the two pages.

159
0:07:04.917,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And there's something even more radical.

160
0:07:06.875,000 --> 0:07:08,000
If you look closely at the Futura, you might notice something.

161
0:07:09.833,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You might not pick it up at first,

162
0:07:11.5,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but there are no capital letters in the title or the captions on this page.

163
0:07:15.083,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You might not think that's very radical,

164
0:07:17.042,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but pick up any magazine, any book or go to any website,

165
0:07:19.708,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and I guarantee, you are not going to find it very easily.

166
0:07:22.5,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This is still a radical idea.

167
0:07:24.917,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And why is that radical?

168
0:07:26.208,000 --> 0:07:28,000
When we think about what capital letters denote,

169
0:07:29.208,000 --> 0:07:3,000
they denote something important,

170
0:07:31.042,000 --> 0:07:33,000
whether it's our names, or our titles.

171
0:07:33.208,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Or maybe even just the name of our corporations,

172
0:07:36.167,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or maybe our trademarks.

173
0:07:37.917,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Actually, in some ways, America's the home of capitalization.

174
0:07:41.375,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We love putting capitals in everything.

175
0:07:43.292,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:44.958,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But think about how radical this would be

177
0:07:46.958,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to introduce a magazine where you're taking away all the capital letters.

178
0:07:51.292,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This has maybe had the same political force

179
0:07:53.375,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that we now argue over things like pronouns in our society today.

180
0:07:57.125,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In the 1920s,

181
0:07:58.708,000 --> 0:08:02,000
this is just shortly after Soviet Russia had a communist revolution.

182
0:08:04.25,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And for them, this actually represented a socialist infiltration into America.

183
0:08:08.917,000 --> 0:08:11,000
All lowercase letters meant that this was an egalitarian,

184
0:08:12.792,000 --> 0:08:16,000
complete lowering of everything into one equal playing field.

185
0:08:16.833,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Now this is still kind of a radical idea.

186
0:08:18.833,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Think about how often you do capitalize something

187
0:08:21.143,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to have more power or prestige to it.

188
0:08:22.958,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So for them to do this was a way in which Futura was using this idea.

189
0:08:27.167,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now, other designers were doing other things with Futura.

190
0:08:30.375,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Others brought other ideas of modernism with it,

191
0:08:32.667,000 --> 0:08:34,000
whether it was interesting new illustration styles,

192
0:08:35.083,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or interesting new collage types of illustration.

193
0:08:37.958,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Or even just new book covers,

194
0:08:40.042,000 --> 0:08:42,000
whether they were from Europe.

195
0:08:42.167,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But here's the funny thing.

196
0:08:44.042,000 --> 0:08:46,000
In the 1920s, if you wanted to use a new typeface,

197
0:08:46.417,000 --> 0:08:48,000
you couldn't just go download it onto your computer.

198
0:08:48.875,000 --> 0:08:5,000
You actually had to have pieces of lead.

199
0:08:51.082,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So for Americans who wanted to adopt this

200
0:08:53.167,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and make it part of their own system,

201
0:08:55.207,000 --> 0:08:57,000
something they could use in everyday typography,

202
0:08:58.083,000 --> 0:08:59,000
whether in ads or anything else,

203
0:08:59.75,000 --> 0:09:01,000
they actually had to have metal type.

204
0:09:01.958,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So being good American capitalists, what did we do?

205
0:09:04.417,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We made all sorts of copies.

206
0:09:05.833,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Ones that had nothing to do with the name Futura,

207
0:09:08.167,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but looked identical to it,

208
0:09:10.042,000 --> 0:09:11,000
whether it was Spartan or Tempo.

209
0:09:11.625,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And in fact, by the time that World War II started,

210
0:09:14.375,000 --> 0:09:17,000
American corporations were actually trying to boycott Nazi goods.

211
0:09:17.833,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But they said, "Go ahead and use our copies.

212
0:09:20.333,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Use 20th Century, use Spartan, use Vogue, use Tempo.

213
0:09:23.042,000 --> 0:09:25,000
These are identical to Futura."

214
0:09:25.375,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And in fact, for most people, they didn't even learn the new names,

215
0:09:28.583,000 --> 0:09:29,000
they just still called it all Futura.

216
0:09:30.375,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So America took this typeface in,

217
0:09:32.958,000 --> 0:09:33,000
conquered it and made it its own.

218
0:09:34.958,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So by the time World War II finishes,

219
0:09:37.875,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Americans are using this on everything,

220
0:09:39.757,000 --> 0:09:41,000
whether it be catalogs, or atlases,

221
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
or encyclopedias or charts and graphs,

222
0:09:45.333,000 --> 0:09:48,000
or calendars, or even political material.

223
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And even the logo for a new expansion football team.

224
0:09:53.042,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And in fact, it was used even on some of the most important advertising

225
0:09:56.458,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of the 20th century.

226
0:09:57.792,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So it's in this context

227
0:09:59.125,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that when the US government was picking a typeface

228
0:10:01.5,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to use after World War II for new maps and new projects,

229
0:10:04.144,000 --> 0:10:05,000
they picked Futura.

230
0:10:05.417,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It wasn't an astounding choice, it wasn't a radical choice,

231
0:10:08.25,000 --> 0:10:1,000
it didn't have anything to do with communism.

232
0:10:10.417,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But in this case, it was used on some of the most important maps,

233
0:10:13.542,000 --> 0:10:14,000
so this one, an air force map in 1962,

234
0:10:15.417,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or used for the maps in Vietnam in '66.

235
0:10:18.833,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And so it wasn't a surprise

236
0:10:20.167,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that when astronauts first started the Mercury program,

237
0:10:23.25,000 --> 0:10:24,000
such as John Glenn orbiting the earth,

238
0:10:25.084,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that charts and maps that he was using were in Futura.

239
0:10:27.708,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And in fact, by the time Mercury morphed into Apollo,

240
0:10:31.75,000 --> 0:10:33,000
it started getting used more and more for more things.

241
0:10:34.375,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So in this case for a safety plan,

242
0:10:37.042,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or even starting to get used on instrument panels,

243
0:10:39.667,000 --> 0:10:4,000
or navigational aids.

244
0:10:41.375,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Or even on diagrams to show how the whole system worked.

245
0:10:44.542,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But here's the amazing thing,

246
0:10:45.958,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it didn't just get used for papers that they handed out to people.

247
0:10:49.083,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It started to get used for an interface,

248
0:10:51.042,000 --> 0:10:53,000
for an entire system that helped the astronauts

249
0:10:53.292,000 --> 0:10:54,000
know how to use the machine.

250
0:10:54.833,000 --> 0:10:57,000
NASA wasn't just one big corporation making everything.

251
0:10:58.708,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There was hundreds of contractors --

252
0:11:00.583,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Boeing, IBM, McDonnell Douglas --

253
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:04,000
all making different machines.

254
0:11:04.458,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Now imagine if astronauts had to use different typefaces and different systems

255
0:11:08.167,000 --> 0:11:11,000
for each component they had in the space shuttles.

256
0:11:11.583,000 --> 0:11:13,000
This would have been impossible to navigate

257
0:11:13.625,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and there would have been a cognitive overload

258
0:11:15.792,000 --> 0:11:17,000
every time they had to open up a new system.

259
0:11:17.917,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So in this case, Futura being used on the interface

260
0:11:20.583,000 --> 0:11:23,000
helped them navigate complexity and make it more clear.

261
0:11:24.083,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And it wasn't just used on buttons, it was used on labels,

262
0:11:27.25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and it was used on their food rations,

263
0:11:29.084,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and it was used on their tool kits.

264
0:11:31.292,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It was used on knobs and levers to tell them what to do.

265
0:11:35.375,000 --> 0:11:36,000
In fact, maybe even some of the places

266
0:11:37.25,000 --> 0:11:4,000
where they needed to have things that were complex be more simple to them,

267
0:11:40.751,000 --> 0:11:42,000
instructions were printed entirely in Futura,

268
0:11:43.333,000 --> 0:11:45,000
so that they could know what to do with that one moment.

269
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They didn't have to remember everything in their head,

270
0:11:48.583,000 --> 0:11:5,000
they could have it out there in the world to see and refer to.

271
0:11:51.542,000 --> 0:11:53,000
In this case, Futura helped make that system,

272
0:11:53.708,000 --> 0:11:56,000
which was already a very difficult and complex system,

273
0:11:57.042,000 --> 0:11:58,000
a little less complex.

274
0:11:59.083,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In fact, the very first or last thing an astronaut might have seen

275
0:12:02.25,000 --> 0:12:04,000
when they were entering or exiting the spacecraft

276
0:12:04.583,000 --> 0:12:05,000
would have been in Futura.

277
0:12:05.875,000 --> 0:12:08,000
One of my favorite examples of how Futura worked in this way

278
0:12:09.042,000 --> 0:12:1,000
is actually this camera.

279
0:12:10.375,000 --> 0:12:14,000
This is a Hasselblad that was made by the Swedish company.

280
0:12:14.625,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's a perfectly good camera, some of you might have used one,

281
0:12:17.583,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it's prized by photographers as a really great camera.

282
0:12:21.458,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And you might notice, if you know anything about cameras,

283
0:12:24.167,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that there's some modifications made to it.

284
0:12:26.25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
In this case, there are stickers placed all over the film canisters,

285
0:12:29.5,000 --> 0:12:31,000
or other parts of the camera here.

286
0:12:32.25,000 --> 0:12:34,000
What this enabled NASA to do,

287
0:12:34.333,000 --> 0:12:37,000
was make something really great out of the astronauts.

288
0:12:37.833,000 --> 0:12:39,000
They're not photographers, they're not experts in art.

289
0:12:40.542,000 --> 0:12:43,000
But they could ensure that they would know how to use this camera

290
0:12:43.708,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because of the labels placed there in Futura.

291
0:12:45.917,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So in this case,

292
0:12:47.208,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Futura acquired and made sure that they had legitimacy

293
0:12:51.042,000 --> 0:12:52,000
with the things they were using.

294
0:12:52.667,000 --> 0:12:55,000
In this case to not take off the film before it would expose.

295
0:12:55.833,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Which, in this case, we would have never had

296
0:12:57.958,000 --> 0:12:59,000
some of the amazing photos we had without this label.

297
0:13:00.5,000 --> 0:13:05,000
When we see something as decorative as this, a ceremonial patch,

298
0:13:06.125,000 --> 0:13:08,000
or something like this plaque on the moon,

299
0:13:08.333,000 --> 0:13:11,000
we realize that Futura was more than just something ceremonial,

300
0:13:11.458,000 --> 0:13:15,000
something more than something that had just been picked for its design.

301
0:13:16.125,000 --> 0:13:18,000
In fact, Futura had authority,

302
0:13:18.833,000 --> 0:13:2,000
had legitimacy and had power because of this choice.

303
0:13:21.333,000 --> 0:13:24,000
There's one other thing I want to talk about in closing.

304
0:13:24.542,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And that is that Futura tells a story.

305
0:13:28.042,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And this is what I love about typefaces, is that all of them tell stories.

306
0:13:32.25,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And in this case, this typeface tells a very powerful story

307
0:13:35.083,000 --> 0:13:38,000
about assimilation, about something being taken into America

308
0:13:38.5,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and being made part of its culture.

309
0:13:40.958,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And that's one of the best and worst things America does,

310
0:13:43.708,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is we take things into our culture and we spit them out back again

311
0:13:46.833,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and claim them our own.

312
0:13:48.125,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And in this case, Futura mirrors exactly what happened with the technology

313
0:13:51.75,000 --> 0:13:52,000
undergirding the whole system.

314
0:13:53.417,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Futura was a German typeface, taken in, made into an American commodity.

315
0:13:57.875,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And so were the technologies:

316
0:13:59.333,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the rockets, the scientists all came from Germany as well.

317
0:14:02.125,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So in some ways, this German typeface on an American plaque

318
0:14:05.375,000 --> 0:14:07,000
perfectly mirrors what happened with the technology.

319
0:14:07.833,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And in this case,

320
0:14:09.125,000 --> 0:14:14,000
when you think about this story, you realize that typography on the moon

321
0:14:14.625,000 --> 0:14:16,000
represents legitimacy, represents authority,

322
0:14:17.5,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and this gave them, the astronauts, the power to get to the moon.

323
0:14:21.208,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Thank you.

324
0:14:22.5,000 --> 0:14:24,000

Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:16.407,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to talk to you today

3
0:00:18.37,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about a difficult topic that is close to me,

4
0:00:21.657,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and closer than you might realize to you.

5
0:00:26.313,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I came to the UK 21 years ago, as an asylum-seeker.

6
0:00:32.306,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was 21.

7
0:00:34.21,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was forced to leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

8
0:00:38.089,000 --> 0:00:41,000
my home, where I was a student activist.

9
0:00:44.096,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I would love my children to be able to meet my family in the Congo.

10
0:00:51.355,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But I want to tell you what the Congo has got to do with you.

11
0:00:56.481,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But first of all, I want you to do me a favor.

12
0:01:00.549,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Can you all please reach into your pockets and take out your mobile phone?

13
0:01:09.079,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Feel that familiar weight ...

14
0:01:13.683,000 --> 0:01:16,000
how naturally your finger slides towards the buttons.

15
0:01:16.874,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:20.074,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Can you imagine your world without it?

17
0:01:22.277,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It connects us to our loved ones,

18
0:01:24.785,000 --> 0:01:27,000
our family, friends and colleagues,

19
0:01:28.428,000 --> 0:01:3,000
at home and overseas.

20
0:01:31.045,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It is a symbol of an interconnected world.

21
0:01:35.618,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But what you hold in your hand leaves a bloody trail,

22
0:01:41.464,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and it all boils down to a mineral:

23
0:01:45.349,000 --> 0:01:49,000
tantalum, mined in the Congo as coltan.

24
0:01:49.676,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It is an anticorrosive heat conductor.

25
0:01:53.176,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It stores energy in our mobile phones, PlayStations and laptops.

26
0:02:00.076,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It is used in aerospace and medical equipment as an alloy.

27
0:02:06.37,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts.

28
0:02:11.603,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It would be great if the story ended there.

29
0:02:15.469,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Unfortunately, what you hold in your hand

30
0:02:19.147,000 --> 0:02:24,000
has not only enabled incredible technological development

31
0:02:24.884,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and industrial expansion,

32
0:02:27.741,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but it has also contributed to unimaginable human suffering.

33
0:02:33.348,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Since 1996,

34
0:02:36.079,000 --> 0:02:41,000
over five million people have died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

35
0:02:42.298,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Countless women, men and children have been raped, tortured or enslaved.

36
0:02:50.336,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Rape is used as a weapon of war,

37
0:02:53.163,000 --> 0:02:57,000
instilling fear and depopulating whole areas.

38
0:02:58.639,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The quest for extracting this mineral

39
0:03:02.61,000 --> 0:03:06,000
has not only aided, but it has fueled

40
0:03:07.293,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the ongoing war in the Congo.

41
0:03:12.535,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But don't throw away your phones yet.

42
0:03:15.929,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Thirty thousand children are enlisted

43
0:03:20.039,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and are made to fight in armed groups.

44
0:03:25.418,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The Congo consistently scores dreadfully

45
0:03:29.399,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in global health and poverty rankings.

46
0:03:33.927,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But remarkably,

47
0:03:35.404,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the UN Environmental Programme has estimated the wealth of the country

48
0:03:41.124,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to be over 24 trillion dollars.

49
0:03:51.286,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The state-regulated mining industry has collapsed,

50
0:03:55.169,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and control over mines has splintered.

51
0:03:58.858,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Coltan is easily controlled by armed groups.

52
0:04:03.306,000 --> 0:04:08,000
One well-known illicit trade route is that across the border to Rwanda,

53
0:04:08.514,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where Congolese tantalum is disguised as Rwandan.

54
0:04:13.471,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But don't throw away your phones yet,

55
0:04:16.141,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because the incredible irony

56
0:04:18.998,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is that the technology that has placed such unsustainable,

57
0:04:22.366,000 --> 0:04:25,000
devastating demands on the Congo

58
0:04:25.395,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is the same technology that has brought this situation to our attention.

59
0:04:32.061,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We only know so much about the situation in the Congo and in the mines

60
0:04:37.005,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because of the kind of communication the mobile phone allows.

61
0:04:43.485,000 --> 0:04:45,000
As with the Arab Spring,

62
0:04:45.787,000 --> 0:04:48,000
during the recent elections in the Congo,

63
0:04:49.148,000 --> 0:04:55,000
voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations

64
0:04:55.221,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to the headquarters in the capital, Kinshasa.

65
0:04:59.933,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And in the wake of the result,

66
0:05:05.287,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the diaspora has joined with the Carter Center,

67
0:05:09.008,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the Catholic Church and other observers,

68
0:05:12.389,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to draw attention to the undemocratic result.

69
0:05:17.492,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The mobile phone has given people around the world

70
0:05:22.931,000 --> 0:05:26,000
an important tool towards gaining their political freedom.

71
0:05:28.225,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet.

72
0:05:34.116,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It has allowed momentous political change to take place.

73
0:05:39.832,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So, we are faced with a paradox.

74
0:05:45.763,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The mobile phone is an instrument of freedom

75
0:05:49.83,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and an instrument of oppression.

76
0:05:55.275,000 --> 0:06:01,000
TED has always celebrated what technology can do for us,

77
0:06:01.67,000 --> 0:06:03,000
technology in its finished form.

78
0:06:04.225,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It is time to be asking questions about technology.

79
0:06:10.091,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Where does it come from?

80
0:06:12.424,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Who makes it?

81
0:06:15.075,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And for what?

82
0:06:17.838,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Here, I am speaking directly to you,

83
0:06:21.266,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the TED community,

84
0:06:23.029,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and to all those who might be watching on a screen,

85
0:06:26.845,000 --> 0:06:29,000
on your phone, across the world,

86
0:06:30.222,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in the Congo.

87
0:06:32.737,000 --> 0:06:36,000
All the technology is in place for us to communicate,

88
0:06:37.031,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and all the technology is in place to communicate this.

89
0:06:44.019,000 --> 0:06:45,000
At the moment,

90
0:06:45.919,000 --> 0:06:48,000
there is no clear fair-trade solution.

91
0:06:50.547,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But there has been a huge amount of progress.

92
0:06:53.927,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The US has recently passed legislation

93
0:06:57.579,000 --> 0:07:,000
to target bribery and misconduct in the Congo.

94
0:07:01.427,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Recent UK legislation could be used in the same way.

95
0:07:06.986,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In February, Nokia unveiled its new policy on sourcing minerals in the Congo,

96
0:07:13.265,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and there is a petition to Apple to make a conflict-free iPhone.

97
0:07:21.752,000 --> 0:07:25,000
There are campaigns spreading across university campuses

98
0:07:26.137,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to make their colleges conflict-free.

99
0:07:29.595,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But we're not there yet.

100
0:07:31.753,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies

101
0:07:37.796,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to change their sourcing processes.

102
0:07:41.766,000 --> 0:07:44,000
When I first came to the UK, 21 years ago,

103
0:07:45.534,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I was homesick.

104
0:07:47.903,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I missed my family and the friends I left behind.

105
0:07:53.105,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Communication was extremely difficult.

106
0:07:56.727,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Sending and receiving letters took months --

107
0:08:00.455,000 --> 0:08:01,000
if you were lucky.

108
0:08:01.985,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Often, they never arrived.

109
0:08:05.432,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Even if I could have afforded the phone bills home,

110
0:08:10.799,000 --> 0:08:12,000
like most people in the Congo,

111
0:08:13.215,000 --> 0:08:16,000
my parents did not own a phone line.

112
0:08:17.246,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Today, my two sons --

113
0:08:23.668,000 --> 0:08:25,000
David and Daniel,

114
0:08:25.746,000 --> 0:08:29,000
can talk to my parents and get to know them.

115
0:08:33.177,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Why should we allow

116
0:08:35.987,000 --> 0:08:41,000
such a wonderful, brilliant and necessary product

117
0:08:42.906,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to be the cause of unnecessary suffering

118
0:08:46.865,000 --> 0:08:47,000
for human beings?

119
0:08:49.992,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We demand fair-trade food and fair-trade clothes.

120
0:08:54.892,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It is time to demand fair-trade phones.

121
0:08:59.718,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This is an idea worth spreading.

122
0:09:03.113,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Thank you.

123
0:09:04.295,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Applause)

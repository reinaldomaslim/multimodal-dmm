1
0:00:15.393,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Science,

2
0:00:16.621,000 --> 0:00:19,000
science has allowed us to know so much

3
0:00:19.958,000 --> 0:00:22,000
about the far reaches of the universe,

4
0:00:22.984,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is at the same time tremendously important

5
0:00:26.179,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and extremely remote,

6
0:00:28.245,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and yet much, much closer,

7
0:00:30.704,000 --> 0:00:32,000
much more directly related to us,

8
0:00:32.795,000 --> 0:00:34,000
there are many things we don't really understand.

9
0:00:35.263,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And one of them is the extraordinary

10
0:00:37.392,000 --> 0:00:4,000
social complexity of the animals around us,

11
0:00:40.718,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and today I want to tell you a few stories

12
0:00:42.734,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of animal complexity.

13
0:00:44.742,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But first, what do we call complexity?

14
0:00:48.092,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What is complex?

15
0:00:49.579,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Well, complex is not complicated.

16
0:00:53.006,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Something complicated comprises many small parts,

17
0:00:56.454,000 --> 0:00:58,000
all different, and each of them

18
0:00:58.899,000 --> 0:01:01,000
has its own precise role in the machinery.

19
0:01:02.003,000 --> 0:01:04,000
On the opposite, a complex system

20
0:01:04.814,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is made of many, many similar parts,

21
0:01:07.455,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and it is their interaction

22
0:01:09.463,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that produces a globally coherent behavior.

23
0:01:12.783,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Complex systems have many interacting parts

24
0:01:16.619,000 --> 0:01:19,000
which behave according to simple, individual rules,

25
0:01:20.045,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and this results in emergent properties.

26
0:01:23.394,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The behavior of the system as a whole

27
0:01:25.282,000 --> 0:01:26,000
cannot be predicted

28
0:01:26.95,000 --> 0:01:28,000
from the individual rules only.

29
0:01:29.102,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As Aristotle wrote,

30
0:01:30.912,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

31
0:01:33.972,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But from Aristotle, let's move onto

32
0:01:36.434,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a more concrete example of complex systems.

33
0:01:40.124,000 --> 0:01:41,000
These are Scottish terriers.

34
0:01:42.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In the beginning, the system is disorganized.

35
0:01:45.831,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Then comes a perturbation: milk.

36
0:01:49.632,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Every individual starts pushing in one direction

37
0:01:53.482,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and this is what happens.

38
0:01:56.791,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The pinwheel is an emergent property

39
0:01:59.617,000 --> 0:02:,000
of the interactions between puppies

40
0:02:01.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk

41
0:02:05.43,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and therefore to push in a random direction.

42
0:02:09.037,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So it's all about finding the simple rules

43
0:02:13.012,000 --> 0:02:15,000
from which complexity emerges.

44
0:02:15.77,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I call this simplifying complexity,

45
0:02:18.71,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it's what we do at the chair of systems design

46
0:02:20.845,000 --> 0:02:21,000
at ETH Zurich.

47
0:02:22.822,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We collect data on animal populations,

48
0:02:26.527,000 --> 0:02:29,000
analyze complex patterns, try to explain them.

49
0:02:30.338,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It requires physicists who work with biologists,

50
0:02:32.957,000 --> 0:02:34,000
with mathematicians and computer scientists,

51
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and it is their interaction that produces

52
0:02:38.5,000 --> 0:02:39,000
cross-boundary competence

53
0:02:40.214,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to solve these problems.

54
0:02:41.792,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So again, the whole is greater

55
0:02:44.064,000 --> 0:02:45,000
than the sum of the parts.

56
0:02:45.464,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In a way, collaboration

57
0:02:47.614,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is another example of a complex system.

58
0:02:51.105,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And you may be asking yourself

59
0:02:52.981,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which side I'm on, biology or physics?

60
0:02:55.798,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In fact, it's a little different,

61
0:02:57.909,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and to explain, I need to tell you

62
0:02:59.498,000 --> 0:03:01,000
a short story about myself.

63
0:03:01.84,000 --> 0:03:02,000
When I was a child,

64
0:03:03.567,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I loved to build stuff, to create complicated machines.

65
0:03:07.676,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So I set out to study electrical engineering

66
0:03:10.413,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and robotics,

67
0:03:11.965,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and my end-of-studies project

68
0:03:14.058,000 --> 0:03:16,000
was about building a robot called ER-1 --

69
0:03:16.984,000 --> 0:03:17,000
it looked like this—

70
0:03:18.914,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that would collect information from its environment

71
0:03:21.285,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and proceed to follow a white line on the ground.

72
0:03:24.783,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It was very, very complicated,

73
0:03:27.162,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but it worked beautifully in our test room,

74
0:03:30.146,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and on demo day, professors had assembled to grade the project.

75
0:03:33.607,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room.

76
0:03:36.509,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It turned out, the light in that room

77
0:03:38.819,000 --> 0:03:39,000
was slightly different.

78
0:03:40.638,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The robot's vision system got confused.

79
0:03:42.969,000 --> 0:03:43,000
At the first bend in the line,

80
0:03:44.73,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it left its course, and crashed into a wall.

81
0:03:48.469,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We had spent weeks building it,

82
0:03:50.556,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and all it took to destroy it

83
0:03:52.229,000 --> 0:03:54,000
was a subtle change in the color of the light

84
0:03:54.885,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in the room.

85
0:03:56.481,000 --> 0:03:57,000
That's when I realized that

86
0:03:57.996,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the more complicated you make a machine,

87
0:04:00.323,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the more likely that it will fail

88
0:04:02.362,000 --> 0:04:04,000
due to something absolutely unexpected.

89
0:04:04.925,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And I decided that, in fact,

90
0:04:06.755,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I didn't really want to create complicated stuff.

91
0:04:09.768,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I wanted to understand complexity,

92
0:04:12.71,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the complexity of the world around us

93
0:04:14.698,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and especially in the animal kingdom.

94
0:04:17.103,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Which brings us to bats.

95
0:04:20.423,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Bechstein's bats are a common species of European bats.

96
0:04:23.474,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They are very social animals.

97
0:04:24.887,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Mostly they roost, or sleep, together.

98
0:04:28.178,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And they live in maternity colonies,

99
0:04:29.857,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which means that every spring,

100
0:04:31.397,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the females meet after the winter hibernation,

101
0:04:34.655,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they stay together for about six months

102
0:04:36.744,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to rear their young,

103
0:04:39.23,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and they all carry a very small chip,

104
0:04:42.035,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which means that every time one of them

105
0:04:43.906,000 --> 0:04:46,000
enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes,

106
0:04:46.963,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we know where she is,

107
0:04:48.606,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and more importantly,

108
0:04:49.775,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we know with whom she is.

109
0:04:52.338,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I study roosting associations in bats,

110
0:04:56.032,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and this is what it looks like.

111
0:04:58.477,000 --> 0:05:,000
During the day, the bats roost

112
0:05:00.919,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in a number of sub-groups in different boxes.

113
0:05:03.223,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It could be that on one day,

114
0:05:05.152,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the colony is split between two boxes,

115
0:05:07.372,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but on another day,

116
0:05:08.672,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it could be together in a single box,

117
0:05:10.913,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or split between three or more boxes,

118
0:05:13.229,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and that all seems rather erratic, really.

119
0:05:16.156,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's called fission-fusion dynamics,

120
0:05:19.359,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the property for an animal group

121
0:05:21.072,000 --> 0:05:23,000
of regularly splitting and merging

122
0:05:23.25,000 --> 0:05:24,000
into different subgroups.

123
0:05:24.911,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So what we do is take all these data

124
0:05:27.473,000 --> 0:05:28,000
from all these different days

125
0:05:29.135,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and pool them together

126
0:05:30.639,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to extract a long-term association pattern

127
0:05:33.256,000 --> 0:05:35,000
by applying techniques with network analysis

128
0:05:35.761,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to get a complete picture

129
0:05:37.382,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of the social structure of the colony.

130
0:05:39.919,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Okay? So that's what this picture looks like.

131
0:05:44.184,000 --> 0:05:46,000
In this network, all the circles

132
0:05:46.578,000 --> 0:05:48,000
are nodes, individual bats,

133
0:05:49.355,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the lines between them

134
0:05:50.938,000 --> 0:05:53,000
are social bonds, associations between individuals.

135
0:05:54.602,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It turns out this is a very interesting picture.

136
0:05:57.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This bat colony is organized

137
0:05:59.262,000 --> 0:06:,000
in two different communities

138
0:06:01.13,000 --> 0:06:02,000
which cannot be predicted

139
0:06:02.969,000 --> 0:06:04,000
from the daily fission-fusion dynamics.

140
0:06:05.218,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We call them cryptic social units.

141
0:06:08.768,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Even more interesting, in fact:

142
0:06:10.384,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Every year, around October,

143
0:06:12.748,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the colony splits up,

144
0:06:14.309,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and all bats hibernate separately,

145
0:06:17.007,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but year after year,

146
0:06:18.468,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when the bats come together again in the spring,

147
0:06:21.541,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the communities stay the same.

148
0:06:24.131,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So these bats remember their friends

149
0:06:26.851,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for a really long time.

150
0:06:28.681,000 --> 0:06:3,000
With a brain the size of a peanut,

151
0:06:31.155,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they maintain individualized,

152
0:06:33.28,000 --> 0:06:35,000
long-term social bonds,

153
0:06:35.422,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We didn't know that was possible.

154
0:06:37.146,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We knew that primates

155
0:06:38.905,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and elephants and dolphins could do that,

156
0:06:41.473,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but compared to bats, they have huge brains.

157
0:06:44.101,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So how could it be

158
0:06:46.5,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that the bats maintain this complex,

159
0:06:48.451,000 --> 0:06:49,000
stable social structure

160
0:06:50.139,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with such limited cognitive abilities?

161
0:06:53.671,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And this is where complexity brings an answer.

162
0:06:56.56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
To understand this system,

163
0:06:58.701,000 --> 0:07:,000
we built a computer model of roosting,

164
0:07:01.498,000 --> 0:07:03,000
based on simple, individual rules,

165
0:07:03.516,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and simulated thousands and thousands of days

166
0:07:05.951,000 --> 0:07:07,000
in the virtual bat colony.

167
0:07:07.97,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It's a mathematical model,

168
0:07:10.094,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but it's not complicated.

169
0:07:12.048,000 --> 0:07:15,000
What the model told us is that, in a nutshell,

170
0:07:15.146,000 --> 0:07:18,000
each bat knows a few other colony members

171
0:07:18.332,000 --> 0:07:2,000
as her friends, and is just slightly more likely

172
0:07:20.82,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to roost in a box with them.

173
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Simple, individual rules.

174
0:07:25.774,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is all it takes to explain

175
0:07:27.486,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the social complexity of these bats.

176
0:07:29.875,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But it gets better.

177
0:07:31.593,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Between 2010 and 2011,

178
0:07:34.441,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the colony lost more than two thirds of its members,

179
0:07:37.894,000 --> 0:07:39,000
probably due to the very cold winter.

180
0:07:40.88,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The next spring, it didn't form two communities

181
0:07:44.024,000 --> 0:07:45,000
like every year,

182
0:07:45.295,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which may have led the whole colony to die

183
0:07:47.498,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because it had become too small.

184
0:07:49.593,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Instead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit,

185
0:07:54.966,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which allowed the colony to survive that season

186
0:07:57.698,000 --> 0:08:,000
and thrive again in the next two years.

187
0:08:00.802,000 --> 0:08:01,000
What we know is that the bats

188
0:08:02.58,000 --> 0:08:04,000
are not aware that their colony is doing this.

189
0:08:05.487,000 --> 0:08:08,000
All they do is follow simple association rules,

190
0:08:09.033,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and from this simplicity

191
0:08:10.382,000 --> 0:08:12,000
emerges social complexity

192
0:08:12.823,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which allows the colony to be resilient

193
0:08:15.663,000 --> 0:08:17,000
against dramatic changes in the population structure.

194
0:08:18.644,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And I find this incredible.

195
0:08:21.338,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now I want to tell you another story,

196
0:08:23.422,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but for this we have to travel from Europe

197
0:08:24.977,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.

198
0:08:28.025,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is where meerkats live.

199
0:08:30.052,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'm sure you know meerkats.

200
0:08:31.552,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They're fascinating creatures.

201
0:08:33.658,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy.

202
0:08:36.647,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There is one dominant pair,

203
0:08:38.106,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and many subordinates,

204
0:08:39.488,000 --> 0:08:4,000
some acting as sentinels,

205
0:08:41.202,000 --> 0:08:42,000
some acting as babysitters,

206
0:08:42.539,000 --> 0:08:43,000
some teaching pups, and so on.

207
0:08:44.436,000 --> 0:08:47,000
What we do is put very small GPS collars

208
0:08:47.757,000 --> 0:08:48,000
on these animals

209
0:08:49.282,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to study how they move together,

210
0:08:51.157,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and what this has to do with their social structure.

211
0:08:54.874,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And there's a very interesting example

212
0:08:56.364,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of collective movement in meerkats.

213
0:08:59.08,000 --> 0:09:01,000
In the middle of the reserve which they live in

214
0:09:01.447,000 --> 0:09:02,000
lies a road.

215
0:09:02.656,000 --> 0:09:05,000
On this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.

216
0:09:05.889,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But the meerkats have to cross it

217
0:09:08.173,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to get from one feeding place to another.

218
0:09:10.747,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So we asked, how exactly do they do this?

219
0:09:15.498,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We found that the dominant female

220
0:09:17.334,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is mostly the one who leads the group to the road,

221
0:09:19.955,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road,

222
0:09:23.227,000 --> 0:09:25,000
she gives way to the subordinates,

223
0:09:25.578,000 --> 0:09:26,000
a manner of saying,

224
0:09:27.355,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"Go ahead, tell me if it's safe."

225
0:09:30.037,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What I didn't know, in fact,

226
0:09:31.701,000 --> 0:09:34,000
was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow

227
0:09:34.843,000 --> 0:09:36,000
for this change at the edge of the group to happen

228
0:09:37.768,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.

229
0:09:41.618,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats

230
0:09:45.609,000 --> 0:09:46,000
crossing a simulated road.

231
0:09:47.522,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's a simplistic model.

232
0:09:49.394,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Moving meerkats are like random particles

233
0:09:52.234,000 --> 0:09:54,000
whose unique rule is one of alignment.

234
0:09:54.456,000 --> 0:09:56,000
They simply move together.

235
0:09:56.862,000 --> 0:09:59,000
When these particles get to the road,

236
0:10:00.046,000 --> 0:10:01,000
they sense some kind of obstacle,

237
0:10:01.988,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and they bounce against it.

238
0:10:04.072,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The only difference

239
0:10:05.228,000 --> 0:10:07,000
between the dominant female, here in red,

240
0:10:07.27,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and the other individuals,

241
0:10:08.755,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is that for her, the height of the obstacle,

242
0:10:11.309,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which is in fact the risk perceived from the road,

243
0:10:13.814,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is just slightly higher,

244
0:10:15.763,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and this tiny difference

245
0:10:17.424,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in the individual's rule of movement

246
0:10:19.262,000 --> 0:10:21,000
is sufficient to explain what we observe,

247
0:10:21.708,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that the dominant female

248
0:10:24.268,000 --> 0:10:25,000
leads her group to the road

249
0:10:25.702,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and then gives way to the others

250
0:10:27.372,000 --> 0:10:29,000
for them to cross first.

251
0:10:30.235,000 --> 0:10:33,000
George Box, who was an English statistician,

252
0:10:33.886,000 --> 0:10:35,000
once wrote, "All models are false,

253
0:10:36.848,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but some models are useful."

254
0:10:38.907,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And in fact, this model is obviously false,

255
0:10:42.104,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because in reality, meerkats are anything but random particles.

256
0:10:46.072,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But it's also useful,

257
0:10:47.709,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because it tells us that extreme simplicity

258
0:10:50.458,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in movement rules at the individual level

259
0:10:53.816,000 --> 0:10:55,000
can result in a great deal of complexity

260
0:10:56.167,000 --> 0:10:57,000
at the level of the group.

261
0:10:58.105,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So again, that's simplifying complexity.

262
0:11:02.161,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I would like to conclude

263
0:11:03.609,000 --> 0:11:05,000
on what this means for the whole species.

264
0:11:06.426,000 --> 0:11:07,000
When the dominant female

265
0:11:08.09,000 --> 0:11:09,000
gives way to a subordinate,

266
0:11:09.656,000 --> 0:11:11,000
it's not out of courtesy.

267
0:11:11.773,000 --> 0:11:12,000
In fact, the dominant female

268
0:11:13.28,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is extremely important for the cohesion of the group.

269
0:11:15.799,000 --> 0:11:18,000
If she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.

270
0:11:19.311,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So this behavior of risk avoidance

271
0:11:21.547,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is a very old evolutionary response.

272
0:11:24.348,000 --> 0:11:27,000
These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic

273
0:11:28.217,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that is thousands of generations old,

274
0:11:30.45,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and they're adapting it to a modern risk,

275
0:11:32.864,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in this case a road built by humans.

276
0:11:36.189,000 --> 0:11:38,000
They adapt very simple rules,

277
0:11:38.584,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and the resulting complex behavior

278
0:11:40.873,000 --> 0:11:42,000
allows them to resist human encroachment

279
0:11:43.829,000 --> 0:11:45,000
into their natural habitat.

280
0:11:46.277,000 --> 0:11:47,000
In the end,

281
0:11:48.079,000 --> 0:11:5,000
it may be bats which change their social structure

282
0:11:50.779,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in response to a population crash,

283
0:11:53.163,000 --> 0:11:54,000
or it may be meerkats

284
0:11:54.562,000 --> 0:11:57,000
who show a novel adaptation to a human road,

285
0:11:57.764,000 --> 0:11:59,000
or it may be another species.

286
0:12:00.449,000 --> 0:12:02,000
My message here -- and it's not a complicated one,

287
0:12:03.242,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but a simple one of wonder and hope --

288
0:12:06.006,000 --> 0:12:09,000
my message here is that animals

289
0:12:09.099,000 --> 0:12:11,000
show extraordinary social complexity,

290
0:12:11.523,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and this allows them to adapt

291
0:12:13.964,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and respond to changes in their environment.

292
0:12:17.445,000 --> 0:12:19,000
In three words, in the animal kingdom,

293
0:12:20.213,000 --> 0:12:22,000
simplicity leads to complexity

294
0:12:22.987,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which leads to resilience.

295
0:12:24.47,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Thank you.

296
0:12:26.754,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause)

297
0:12:42.694,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Dania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas,

298
0:12:44.647,000 --> 0:12:47,000
for this great start. Little bit nervous?

299
0:12:47.926,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Nicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks.

300
0:12:49.57,000 --> 0:12:51,000
DG: Okay, great. I'm sure a lot of people in the audience

301
0:12:52.03,000 --> 0:12:53,000
somehow tried to make associations

302
0:12:53.894,000 --> 0:12:54,000
between the animals you were talking about --

303
0:12:55.718,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the bats, meerkats -- and humans.

304
0:12:57.774,000 --> 0:12:58,000
You brought some examples:

305
0:12:58.982,000 --> 0:12:59,000
The females are the social ones,

306
0:13:00.717,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the females are the dominant ones,

307
0:13:02.43,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I'm not sure who thinks how.

308
0:13:04.103,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But is it okay to do these associations?

309
0:13:06.998,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard

310
0:13:09.798,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that can be valid across all species?

311
0:13:13.071,000 --> 0:13:14,000
NP: Well, I would say there are also

312
0:13:14.674,000 --> 0:13:15,000
counter-examples to these stereotypes.

313
0:13:16.626,000 --> 0:13:19,000
For examples, in sea horses or in koalas, in fact,

314
0:13:19.766,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it is the males who take care of the young always.

315
0:13:23.464,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And the lesson is that it's often difficult,

316
0:13:28.505,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and sometimes even a bit dangerous,

317
0:13:30.257,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to draw parallels between humans and animals.

318
0:13:32.929,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So that's it.

319
0:13:35.035,000 --> 0:13:37,000
DG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.

320
0:13:37.881,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Thank you, Nicolas Perony.

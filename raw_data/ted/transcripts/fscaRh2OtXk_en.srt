1
0:00:12.26,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The best Christmas my children ever had

2
0:00:15.42,000 --> 0:00:18,000
was also the worst Christmas my husband and I ever had.

3
0:00:19.62,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Elizabeth, age seven,

4
0:00:21.46,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and her brother, Ian, age five,

5
0:00:24.34,000 --> 0:00:27,000
couldn't imagine why they were getting everything they wanted for Christmas.

6
0:00:29.06,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The reason Santa was so generous

7
0:00:32.58,000 --> 0:00:35,000
was because of something my husband Pat and I knew

8
0:00:35.86,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the kids couldn't comprehend.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Something that we had just learned, and it terrified us.

10
0:00:43.38,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This was 1994

11
0:00:45.66,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and the story actually starts a few years earlier.

12
0:00:48.62,000 --> 0:00:52,000
For a couple of years I had noticed a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck

13
0:00:54.22,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that looked like prickly heat.

14
0:00:56.78,000 --> 0:00:59,000
For those same years, my father and brother both died of cancer,

15
0:01:01.42,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I was probably overanxious about illness.

16
0:01:04.94,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The doctors assured us there was nothing wrong

17
0:01:07.74,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and I shouldn't worry,

18
0:01:09.5,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but I wasn't so sure.

19
0:01:12.02,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And so without a referral, and paying out-of-pocket,

20
0:01:15.14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.

21
0:01:18.38,000 --> 0:01:2,000
She was probably just allergic to something,

22
0:01:20.74,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but why did it appear just on the sides of her neck, this rash?

23
0:01:26.66,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So it's two days before Christmas,

24
0:01:28.62,000 --> 0:01:29,000
1994,

25
0:01:31.02,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the dermatologist takes a quick look at her neck and says,

26
0:01:34.42,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum."

27
0:01:37.46,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And then he shuts off the lights and looks in her eyes.

28
0:01:42.14,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It turns out, by chance,

29
0:01:43.82,000 --> 0:01:46,000
this dermatologist also trained in ophthalmology.

30
0:01:47.9,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Our lucky day.

31
0:01:51.22,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I am sick to my stomach.

32
0:01:53.46,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"Oma?"

33
0:01:54.74,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma --

34
0:01:57.66,000 --> 0:01:58,000
cancer.

35
0:01:59.66,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Why are you looking in her eyes for a skin rash?"

36
0:02:03.42,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I scream and make no sound.

37
0:02:06.54,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So there it is.

38
0:02:08.62,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum,

39
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
PXE for short.

40
0:02:16.7,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Questions mix with fear

41
0:02:19.02,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and erupt like bile in my throat.

42
0:02:21.739,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Why are you looking in her eyes?

43
0:02:24.66,000 --> 0:02:26,000
What do you know about this? How do you know for sure?

44
0:02:27.66,000 --> 0:02:28,000
What is the prognosis?

45
0:02:30.02,000 --> 0:02:33,000
My training in pastoral counseling did not prepare me for this.

46
0:02:35.5,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Dr. Bercovitch tells us everything he knows about PXE.

47
0:02:40.66,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's a rare genetic disorder,

48
0:02:43.62,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it's systemic,

49
0:02:45.86,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it's a slowly progressing, premature aging disease.

50
0:02:50.66,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It causes loose wrinkly skin in the flexor areas.

51
0:02:55.42,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It causes legal blindness,

52
0:02:57.38,000 --> 0:02:58,000
like macular degeneration,

53
0:02:59.78,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and a host of cardiovascular problems.

54
0:03:03.5,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Little is known about this disease,

55
0:03:06.42,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and some people die in their 30s,

56
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
say some of the reports at the time.

57
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
He then just glances at our son and says,

58
0:03:17.94,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"He has it, too."

59
0:03:21.22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We want to flee back to the land of normal.

60
0:03:30.74,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Two days after Christmas,

61
0:03:32.18,000 --> 0:03:35,000
researchers come from a university in Boston,

62
0:03:35.22,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and they take blood from us and our children

63
0:03:37.74,000 --> 0:03:39,000
for a research project focused on finding the gene.

64
0:03:41.18,000 --> 0:03:42,000
A few days later,

65
0:03:42.58,000 --> 0:03:44,000
researchers come from a medical center in New York

66
0:03:45.02,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and say they want blood, too.

67
0:03:47.34,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"These are children.

68
0:03:49.38,000 --> 0:03:51,000
They're five and seven years old.

69
0:03:51.5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Don't make them face the needle twice.

70
0:03:54.18,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Go and get your share from the other researchers."

71
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
They laugh, incredulous.

72
0:04:00.5,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"Share?"

73
0:04:03.02,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It is then that we learn that there is little sharing in biomedical research.

74
0:04:08.34,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This moment, more than any other,

75
0:04:11.06,000 --> 0:04:13,000
lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.

76
0:04:15.46,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Pat and I went to a medical school library

77
0:04:17.66,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and we copied every article we could find on PXE.

78
0:04:21.54,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We didn't understand a thing.

79
0:04:24.66,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We bought medical dictionaries and scientific textbooks

80
0:04:27.42,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and read everything we could get our hands on.

81
0:04:30.38,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And though we still didn't understand,

82
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we could see patterns,

83
0:04:34.14,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and it became quickly apparent within a month

84
0:04:37.54,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that there was no systematic effort to understand PXE.

85
0:04:42.82,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In addition,

86
0:04:44.06,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the lack of sharing that we experienced was pervasive.

87
0:04:48.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Researchers competed with each other

88
0:04:51.46,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because the ecosystem was designed to reward competition

89
0:04:56.38,000 --> 0:04:57,000
rather than to alleviate suffering.

90
0:04:59.66,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We realized that we would have to do work on this condition ourselves

91
0:05:04.7,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to find solutions for ourselves and others like us.

92
0:05:09.38,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But we faced two major barriers.

93
0:05:11.74,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The first one:

94
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Pat and I have no science background.

95
0:05:16.74,000 --> 0:05:19,000
At the time, he's the manager of a construction company,

96
0:05:20.18,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and I'm a former college chaplain stay-at-home mom --

97
0:05:24.06,000 --> 0:05:27,000
hardly the backgrounds to take the research world by storm.

98
0:05:29.3,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The second barrier:

99
0:05:32.18,000 --> 0:05:33,000
researchers don't share.

100
0:05:34.82,000 --> 0:05:36,000
People told us you can't herd cats.

101
0:05:38.46,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Well, yes you can if you move their food.

102
0:05:42.02,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:45.22,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Applause)

104
0:05:49.22,000 --> 0:05:52,000
DNA and clinical data is the food.

105
0:05:52.78,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So we would collect blood and medical histories,

106
0:05:55.94,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and require that all scientists using these resources

107
0:05:59.54,000 --> 0:06:02,000
would share results with each other and with the people who donated.

108
0:06:04.9,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Well before the internet was in common use,

109
0:06:07.14,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Pat and I established PXE International,

110
0:06:10.02,000 --> 0:06:14,000
a nonprofit dedicated to initiating research and conducting it on PXE

111
0:06:14.94,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and also supporting individuals with the disease.

112
0:06:19.66,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Using traditional media,

113
0:06:21.02,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we garnered around 100-150 people around the world

114
0:06:25.46,000 --> 0:06:26,000
who we asked,

115
0:06:26.74,000 --> 0:06:29,000
would you give us your blood, your tissue, your medical histories,

116
0:06:30.02,000 --> 0:06:31,000
your medical records?

117
0:06:32.02,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And we brought all of that together.

118
0:06:34.74,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We quickly learned that this shared resource was not going to be enough.

119
0:06:39.74,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And so we decided we had to do hardcore bench science --

120
0:06:45.1,000 --> 0:06:46,000
hardcore research.

121
0:06:47.22,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So we borrowed bench space at a lab at Harvard.

122
0:06:50.02,000 --> 0:06:52,000
A wonderful neighbor came a couple times a week

123
0:06:52.82,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am

124
0:06:56.9,000 --> 0:06:58,000
while Pat and I extracted DNA,

125
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
ran and scored gels

126
0:07:01.02,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and searched for the gene.

127
0:07:03.06,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Generous postdocs tutored us as we went along.

128
0:07:06.46,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Within a few years, we found the gene.

129
0:07:09.18,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We patented it so that it would be freely available.

130
0:07:12.22,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We created a diagnostic test.

131
0:07:14.3,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We put together a research consortium.

132
0:07:17.42,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We held research meetings and opened a center of excellence.

133
0:07:21.18,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We found more than 4,000 people around the world who had PXE,

134
0:07:26.58,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and held patient meetings

135
0:07:28.54,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and did clinical trials and studies.

136
0:07:32.66,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Through all this,

137
0:07:34.18,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we lived with fear.

138
0:07:36.86,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Fear of the disease breathing down our neck

139
0:07:41.18,000 --> 0:07:42,000
while the clock ticked.

140
0:07:43.1,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Fear of researchers,

141
0:07:46.02,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so well credentialed and positioned in a world made for them.

142
0:07:50.74,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Fear that we were making the wrong choices.

143
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Fear that the naysayers were right

144
0:07:56.62,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the cats would simply find a new food.

145
0:08:00.62,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But greater than all these fears was our drive to make a difference

146
0:08:03.82,000 --> 0:08:06,000
for our kids and for all those we had met along the way.

147
0:08:08.1,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And very quickly,

148
0:08:09.34,000 --> 0:08:11,000
we also realized what we were doing for one disease,

149
0:08:12.1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we should do for all diseases.

150
0:08:16.02,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We joined with, and I eventually led,

151
0:08:17.86,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Genetic Alliance --

152
0:08:19.1,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a network of health advocacy,

153
0:08:21.42,000 --> 0:08:22,000
patient advocacy,

154
0:08:22.66,000 --> 0:08:23,000
research and health organizations.

155
0:08:24.98,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We built scalable and extensible resources,

156
0:08:27.46,000 --> 0:08:29,000
like biobanks and registries and directories of support

157
0:08:30.3,000 --> 0:08:31,000
for all diseases.

158
0:08:32.62,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And as I learned about all those diseases and all those disease communities,

159
0:08:36.7,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I realized that there were two secrets in health care

160
0:08:39.58,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that were impacting me greatly.

161
0:08:42.3,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The first:

162
0:08:43.58,000 --> 0:08:46,000
there are no ready answers for people like my kids

163
0:08:47.02,000 --> 0:08:48,000
or all the people I was working with,

164
0:08:48.979,000 --> 0:08:5,000
whether common or rare conditions.

165
0:08:51.739,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And the second secret:

166
0:08:53.58,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the answers lie in all of us together,

167
0:08:57.7,000 --> 0:08:58,000
donating our data,

168
0:09:00.06,000 --> 0:09:02,000
our biological samples

169
0:09:02.38,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and ultimately ourselves.

170
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There is a small groundswell of individuals

171
0:09:09.62,000 --> 0:09:11,000
who are working to change this.

172
0:09:11.9,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Citizen scientists, activists, hacks

173
0:09:14.98,000 --> 0:09:17,000
who are using crowdsourcing, do-it-yourself science

174
0:09:18.18,000 --> 0:09:19,000
are changing the game.

175
0:09:20.42,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Even President Obama and Vice President Biden

176
0:09:24.5,000 --> 0:09:25,000
are evangelists for the idea

177
0:09:26.22,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that people should be partners in research.

178
0:09:29.5,000 --> 0:09:31,000
This is a founding principle of our organization.

179
0:09:32.78,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Sure, it's really hard

180
0:09:34.94,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to discover and develop interventions and therapies.

181
0:09:39.3,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The science is hard,

182
0:09:41.66,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the regulatory regime is difficult.

183
0:09:44.78,000 --> 0:09:47,000
There are a lot of stakeholders with lots of interests

184
0:09:47.82,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and misaligned incentives like publishing, promotion and tenure.

185
0:09:53.18,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I don't fault scientists for following this path,

186
0:09:56.62,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but I challenge them and us to do this differently.

187
0:10:00.22,000 --> 0:10:03,000
To recognize that people are at the center.

188
0:10:05.22,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Genetic Alliance has experimented

189
0:10:07.02,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in what it will take to transform these crusty systems.

190
0:10:12.74,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Our goal is to work without boundaries.

191
0:10:15.7,000 --> 0:10:18,000
That sounds abstract, but for us it's quite practical.

192
0:10:21.22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
When we're frustrated that entities won't share data --

193
0:10:24.94,000 --> 0:10:29,000
data that comes from people who gave their energy, their time, their blood

194
0:10:30.06,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and even their tears --

195
0:10:32.34,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we need to stop and ask,

196
0:10:33.98,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"How is it true that we could share, but we aren't?"

197
0:10:37.66,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We're part of this system, too.

198
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
How do we make it so that people can share ideas freely?

199
0:10:47.22,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So that people can take risks and move closer to one another?

200
0:10:53.3,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This leads to a dissolving of us versus them,

201
0:10:56.58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
not only for organizations but also for individuals.

202
0:11:00.54,000 --> 0:11:03,000
If I'm going to ask organizations or individuals

203
0:11:03.94,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to strive for these standards,

204
0:11:06.18,000 --> 0:11:1,000
then I too need to explore my own being and my practices.

205
0:11:11.94,000 --> 0:11:14,000
If I'm going to ask clinicians and researchers and administrators

206
0:11:15.22,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to take risks,

207
0:11:16.82,000 --> 0:11:19,000
then I, Sharon, need to take risks as well.

208
0:11:20.66,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I need to face my personal fears.

209
0:11:24.5,000 --> 0:11:26,000
My fear of not having enough impact.

210
0:11:29.22,000 --> 0:11:31,000
My fear of not leading well.

211
0:11:32.82,000 --> 0:11:34,000
My fear of not being enough.

212
0:11:38.54,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Just before they entered their teens, our kids stopped us in our tracks

213
0:11:42.5,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and said, "You have to stop worrying about making a difference,

214
0:11:46.22,000 --> 0:11:47,000
making an impact,

215
0:11:47.5,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and instead, like us, learn to live with disease

216
0:11:51.5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
rather than fight it."

217
0:11:56.42,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I have to ask,

218
0:11:57.74,000 --> 0:11:59,000
where does all my fear come from?

219
0:12:01.14,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The kids' declaration shines a spotlight on that fear.

220
0:12:05.58,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It arises from a bedrock of love.

221
0:12:09.74,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I love Elizabeth and Ian.

222
0:12:14.14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I love people with PXE.

223
0:12:17.34,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I love people with any disease.

224
0:12:20.54,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I love people.

225
0:12:24.34,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Some of my colleagues have discovered that it is not death we fear,

226
0:12:28.98,000 --> 0:12:3,000
it is the enormity of our loving.

227
0:12:32.58,000 --> 0:12:36,000
This expansive love opens me to great pain

228
0:12:37.38,000 --> 0:12:38,000
as I face loss.

229
0:12:40.86,000 --> 0:12:42,000
As I discover my fear,

230
0:12:43.98,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I discover that I

231
0:12:45.78,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and all those around me

232
0:12:47.42,000 --> 0:12:49,000
have boundless capacity for love.

233
0:12:53.46,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And I also discover

234
0:12:56.06,000 --> 0:12:57,000
as I move into this fear,

235
0:12:59.22,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that I can learn many new things

236
0:13:01.7,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and find paths

237
0:13:04.14,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to things like practical solutions

238
0:13:08.02,000 --> 0:13:11,000
as well as the core of healing and health.

239
0:13:14.82,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I don't fear fear the way I used to.

240
0:13:20.38,000 --> 0:13:25,000
In fact lately, with enormous support from all my fellow journeyers,

241
0:13:25.54,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I notice that it's not a warning the way it used to be.

242
0:13:29.86,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I notice that instead,

243
0:13:32.74,000 --> 0:13:33,000
it's an invitation to go forward

244
0:13:34.66,000 --> 0:13:37,000
because in it lies love and the path to greater love.

245
0:13:39.46,000 --> 0:13:42,000
If I turn with gentle curiosity toward that fear,

246
0:13:44.62,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I find enormous wealth within myself and others

247
0:13:49.7,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and the ability to step into challenges that I never thought I could.

248
0:13:54.78,000 --> 0:13:56,000
My kids are ahead of me on that path still.

249
0:13:58.18,000 --> 0:13:59,000
At ages 29 and 27,

250
0:14:00.1,000 --> 0:14:02,000
they declare they are happy and healthy

251
0:14:02.58,000 --> 0:14:07,000
despite having manifestations of PXE in their skin and eyes and arteries.

252
0:14:08.98,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And so I invite you, us, we,

253
0:14:12.34,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to turn toward our fear;

254
0:14:13.94,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to embrace the things that scare us

255
0:14:16.9,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and find the love at the center.

256
0:14:19.06,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We'll not only find ourselves there

257
0:14:21.3,000 --> 0:14:24,000
but we'll also be able to step into the shoes of those we fear

258
0:14:25.3,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and those who fear us.

259
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
If we breathe into that fear

260
0:14:30.38,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and are vulnerable with the systems and people who challenge us,

261
0:14:35.06,000 --> 0:14:39,000
our power as changemakers grows exponentially.

262
0:14:40.22,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And when we realize

263
0:14:41.5,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that working on our inner life is working on our outer life

264
0:14:45.18,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and outer work is inner work,

265
0:14:47.94,000 --> 0:14:49,000
we get down to what is real

266
0:14:50.1,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and shit gets done.

267
0:14:51.54,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Laughter)

268
0:14:53.02,000 --> 0:14:56,000
There is no limit to what we can accomplish together.

269
0:14:56.86,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Thank you.

270
0:14:58.1,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm going to talk about your mindset.

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset?

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
If not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it?

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
When I talk to my students about global issues,

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I listen to them in the coffee break,

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
they always talk about "we" and "them."

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And when they come back into the lecture room

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.

11
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"We learned it in college."

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And what is the definition then? "The definition?

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Everyone knows," they say.

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But then you know, I press them like this.

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Western world is a long life in a small family.

17
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Developing world is a short life in a large family."

18
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I like that definition, because it enabled me

19
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to transfer their mindset

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
into the dataset.

21
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And here you have the dataset.

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So, you can see that what we have on this axis here

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is size of family. One, two, three, four, five

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
children per woman on this axis.

25
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And here, length of life, life expectancy,

26
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
30, 40, 50.

27
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world.

28
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And really this is about the bedroom.

29
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family,

30
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and take care of their kids, and how long they will live.

31
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
you can live long.

33
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted --

34
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which had large families and short life. Developing world.

36
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And we had one set of countries up there

37
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which was the western world.

38
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They had small families and long life.

39
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
And you are going to see here

40
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.

41
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Then the developing countries applied

42
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
soap and water, vaccination.

43
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And all the developing world started to apply family planning.

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And partly to USA who help to provide

45
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
technical advice and investment.

46
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family,

47
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and a life with 60 to 70 years.

48
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But some countries remain back in this area here.

49
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.

50
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We have Liberia. We have Congo.

51
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So we have countries living there.

52
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So the problem I had

53
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is that the worldview that my students had

54
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
corresponds to reality in the world

55
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the year their teachers were born.

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Applause)

58
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And we, in fact, when we have played this over the world.

59
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,

60
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I could see the wrong concept

61
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
even active people in United States had,

62
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that they didn't realize the improvement

63
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States.

64
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Look here when I move them forward.

65
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Here we go.

66
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They catch up. There's Mexico.

67
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.

68
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There was less than five percent

69
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.

70
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This great nation, Mexico,

71
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
has the problem that arms are coming from North,

72
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
across the borders, so they had to stop that,

73
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know.

74
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But if I would change this axis here,

75
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I would instead put income per person.

76
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Income per person. I can put that here.

77
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And we will then see

78
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
a completely different picture.

79
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
By the way, I'm teaching you

80
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
how to use our website, Gapminder World,

81
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
while I'm correcting this,

82
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because this is a free utility on the net.

83
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And when I now finally got it right,

84
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I can go back 200 years in history.

85
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I can find United States up there.

86
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And I can let the other countries be shown.

87
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And now I have income per person on this axis.

88
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.

89
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years,

90
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
on par with Afghanistan today.

91
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And what has happened in the world, I will show now.

92
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is instead of studying history

93
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for one year at university.

94
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing.

95
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,

97
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and the yellow one, which is the United States,

98
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they get richer and richer and also

99
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
start to get healthier and healthier.

100
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And this is now 100 years ago,

101
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
where the rest of the world remains behind.

102
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Here we come. And that was the influenza.

103
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?

104
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.

105
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And then we come up. Not until

106
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
independence started.

107
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Look here You have China over there,

108
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you have India over there,

109
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and this is what has happened.

110
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Did you note there, that we have Mexico up there?

111
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Mexico is not at all on par with the United States,

112
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but they are quite close.

113
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And especially, it's interesting to see

114
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
China and the United States

115
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
during 200 years,

116
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because I have my oldest son now working for Google,

117
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
after Google acquired this software.

118
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Because in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet

119
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
for many years and developed this.

120
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing.

121
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know?

122
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing,

123
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in China, he got a long-term perspective.

124
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Whereas when my oldest son, who works for Google,

125
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
he should develop by quarter, or by half-year.

126
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.

127
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But in China they look generation after generation

128
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because they remember

129
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the very embarrassing period, for 100 years,

130
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
when they went backwards.

131
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And then they would remember the first part

132
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of last century, which was really bad,

133
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.

134
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But this was 1963.

135
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China,

136
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started

137
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
this amazing move forward.

138
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Isn't it strange to see that the United States

139
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
first grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?

140
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Whereas China could get healthy much earlier,

141
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,

142
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and then also benefits of penicillin

143
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and vaccines and family planning.

144
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And Asia could have social development

145
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
before they got the economic development.

146
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So to me, as a public health professor,

147
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.

148
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Because what you see here, what you see here

149
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is the flat world of Thomas Friedman,

150
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
isn't it.

151
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's not really, really flat.

152
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But the middle income countries --

153
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and this is where I suggest to my students,

154
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
stop using the concept "developing world."

155
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Because after all, talking about the developing world

156
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is like having two chapters in the history of the United States.

157
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The last chapter is about present, and president Obama,

158
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the other is about the past,

159
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
where you cover everything from Washington

160
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to Eisenhower.

161
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Because Washington to Eisenhower,

162
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that is what we find in the developing world.

163
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We could actually go to Mayflower

164
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to Eisenhower,

165
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and that would be put together into a developing world,

166
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,

167
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which have great entrepreneurs,

168
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but also have the collapsing countries.

169
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So, how could we make better sense about this?

170
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could

171
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
look at income distribution.

172
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world,

173
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
from $1. This is where you have food to eat.

174
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
These people go to bed hungry.

175
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And this is the number of people.

176
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This is $10, whether you have a public or a private

177
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
health service system. This is where you can

178
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
provide health service for your family and school for your children,

179
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and this is OECD countries:

180
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Green, Latin America, East Europe.

181
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia.

182
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And this is how the world changed.

183
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It changed like this.

184
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions

185
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?

186
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And it goes over here?

187
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And I come now, into projections,

188
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --

189
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that's where the projections are not valid any longer.

191
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Probably the world will do this.

192
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and then it will continue forward like this.

193
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But more or less, this is what will happen,

194
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.

195
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We have the high income countries here,

196
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
with the United States as a leading power;

197
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we have the emerging economies in the middle,

198
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout;

199
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and we have the low income countries here.

200
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Yeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes,

201
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
they have been saving, you know, over the last decade.

202
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And here we have the low income countries

203
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where entrepreneurs are.

204
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And here we have the countries in collapse and war,

205
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
like Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur.

206
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We have all this at the same time.

207
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened

208
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in the developing world.

209
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Because it's so different, what has happened there.

210
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And that's why I suggest

211
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
a slightly different approach of what you would call it.

212
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And you have huge differences within countries also.

213
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I heard that your departments here were by regions.

214
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,

215
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
East Asia, Arab states,

216
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD.

217
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And on this axis, GDP.

218
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And on this, heath, child survival,

219
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and it doesn't come as a surprise

220
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.

221
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But when I split it, when I split it

222
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
into country bubbles,

223
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the size of the bubbles here is the population.

224
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.

225
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.

226
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,

227
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Arab world.

228
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Now all your different departments.

229
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.

230
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.

231
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We cannot put it into two parts.

232
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here,

233
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
building, building countries.

234
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It's Lincoln here, advancing them.

235
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.

236
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And then it's United States today, up here.

237
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And we have countries all this way.

238
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Now, this is the important thing

239
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
of understanding how the world has changed.

240
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
At this point I decided to make a pause.

241
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And it is my task, on behalf of the rest of the world,

243
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,

244
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
for Demographic Health Survey.

245
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Many are not aware of -- no, this is not a joke.

246
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
This is very serious.

247
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring

248
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
during 25 years of the very good methodology

249
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
for measuring child mortality

250
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.

251
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

252
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And it is U.S. government at its best,

253
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
without advocacy, providing facts,

254
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that it's useful for the society.

255
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And providing data free of charge

256
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
on the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much.

257
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Quite the opposite of the World Bank,

258
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
who compiled data with government money,

259
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
tax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,

260
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.

261
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause)

262
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But the people doing that at the World Bank

263
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
are among the best in the world.

264
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And they are highly skilled professionals.

265
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies

266
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.

267
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And when it comes to free data and transparency,

268
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
United States of America is one of the best.

269
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.

270
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

271
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And I'm not paid to come here, no.

272
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I would like to show you what happens with the data,

273
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
what we can show with this data.

274
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Look here. This is the world.

275
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
With income down there and child mortality.

276
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And what has happened in the world?

277
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Since 1950, during the last 50 years

278
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
we have had a fall in child mortality.

279
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this.

280
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And we had an increase in income.

281
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And the blue former developing countries

282
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
are mixing up with the former industrialized western world.

283
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We have a continuum. But we still have, of course,

284
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries

285
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
as we have had, always, in history.

286
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today

287
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
about a completely new approach to do it.

288
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And how fast has this happened?

289
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Well, MDG 4.

290
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The United States has not been so eager

291
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to use MDG 4.

292
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,

293
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.

294
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.

295
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Let's see what Sweden has done.

296
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We used to boast about fast social progress.

297
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
That's where we were, 1900.

298
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
1900, Sweden was there.

299
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Same child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990,

300
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
though they had lower income.

301
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They started very well. They used the aid well.

302
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They vaccinated the kids. They get better water.

303
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And they reduced child mortality,

304
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden.

305
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I run Sweden the same 16 year period.

306
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Second round, it's Sweden, 1916,

307
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
against Egypt, 1990.

308
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.

309
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
They get safe water, they get food for the poor,

310
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and they get malaria eradicated.

311
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal.

312
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.

313
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Brazil here has amazing social improvement

314
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
over the last 16 years,

315
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and they go faster than Sweden.

316
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
This means that the world is converging.

317
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The middle income countries,

318
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
the emerging economy, they are catching up.

319
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
They are moving to cities,

320
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
where they also get better assistance for that.

321
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Well the Swedish students protest at this point.

322
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
They say, "This is not fair,

323
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics

324
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that were not available for Sweden.

325
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We have to do real-time competition."

326
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.

327
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.

328
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
It's the most tropical country in the world,

329
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
a marshland on the equator.

330
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.

331
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But then they started to grow their economy.

332
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And they made the social investment. They got away malaria.

333
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
They got a magnificent health system

334
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that beat both the U.S. and Sweden.

335
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!

336
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Applause)

337
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals.

338
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
These yellow are just about to be doing this.

339
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
These red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved.

340
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Not simplistic extrapolation.

341
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
We have to really find a way

342
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
of supporting those countries in a better way.

343
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We have to respect the middle income countries

344
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
on what they are doing.

345
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.

346
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries.

347
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The blue is Africa.

348
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.

349
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
You see the tragedy in South Africa there.

350
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected.

351
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And in spite of them having quite a high income,

352
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
they have a huge number of HIV infected.

353
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
But you also see that there are African countries down here.

354
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.

355
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
There's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa

356
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that has the same level as Sweden and United States.

357
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And there are others who are extremely high.

358
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And I will show you that what has happened

359
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
in one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy

360
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
in Africa and a good governance, Botswana.

361
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
They have a very high level. It's coming down.

362
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But now it's not falling,

363
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
because there, with help from PEPFAR,

364
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
it's working with treatment. And people are not dying.

365
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And you can see it's not that easy,

366
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
that it is war which caused this.

367
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Because here, in Congo, there is war.

368
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And here, in Zambia, there is peace.

369
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher.

370
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
If I split Tanzania in its income,

371
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the richer 20 percent in Tanzania

372
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
has more HIV than the poorest one.

373
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And it's really different within each country.

374
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different.

375
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And this is the situation you see.

376
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation,

377
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
probably of concurrent sexual partnership

378
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
among part of the heterosexual population

379
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
in some countries, or some parts of countries,

380
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
in south and eastern Africa.

381
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.

382
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place,

383
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
in the way it can be done there.

384
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
So to just end up,

385
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
there are things of suffering

386
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
in the one billion poorest, which we don't know.

387
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Those who live beyond the cellphone,

388
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
those who have yet to see a computer,

389
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
those who have no electricity at home.

390
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
This is the disease, Konzo, I spent 20 years

391
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
elucidating in Africa.

392
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.

393
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s.

394
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
It's similar to other nutritional diseases.

395
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
It will never affect a rich person.

396
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
We have seen it here in Mozambique.

397
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.

398
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
You never heard about the disease.

399
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
But it's much more than Ebola

400
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that has been affected by this disease.

401
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Cause crippling throughout the world.

402
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
And over the last two years,

403
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
2,000 people has been crippled

404
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
in the southern tip of Bandundu region.

405
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
That used to be the illegal diamond trade,

406
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.

407
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
That has now disappeared,

408
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and they are now in great economic problem.

409
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And one week ago, for the first time,

410
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
there were four lines on the Internet.

411
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies

412
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and the great capacity

413
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
of people in the middle income countries

414
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and in peaceful low income countries.

415
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
There is still mystery in one billion.

416
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
And we have to have more concepts

417
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
than just developing countries and developing world.

418
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
We need a new mindset. The world is converging,

419
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
but -- but -- but not the bottom billion.

420
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
They are still as poor as they've ever been.

421
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
It's not sustainable, and it will not happen around one superpower.

422
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
But you will remain

423
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
one of the most important superpowers,

424
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and the most hopeful superpower, for the time to be.

425
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And this institution

426
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
will have a very crucial role,

427
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
not for United States, but for the world.

428
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
So you have a very bad name,

429
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
State Department. This is not the State Department.

430
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
It's the World Department.

431
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much.

432
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
(Applause)

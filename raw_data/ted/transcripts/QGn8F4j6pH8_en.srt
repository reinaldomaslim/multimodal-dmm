1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I remember these Turkish carpets,

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
from this soldier.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week,

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
with creatures and gargoyles and nudity --

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories,

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.

13
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And then there was another influence.

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,

15
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And so,

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I fused together the two things I loved the most,

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which was skiing and windsurfing.

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.

20
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So, I created this compilation of the two:

21
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,

22
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and some foot straps, and some metal fins,

23
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.

24
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,

25
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.

26
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I realized then I had to go to design school.

27
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I mean, look at those graphics there.

29
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So, I went to design school,

31
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and it was the early '90s when I finished.

32
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,

33
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
so I wanted to be there,

34
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,

35
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.

36
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,

37
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and we would get in to these meetings,

38
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and these managers would come in,

39
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and they would say,

40
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."

41
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And they would give the projects code names, you know,

42
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.

43
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer

44
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,

45
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and I would ask questions.

46
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,

47
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"

48
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?

49
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"You know, do people really use it?

50
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"

51
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
What I realized then is, they didn't really want to change

53
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.

54
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,

55
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.

56
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I didn't want to be a colorist.

57
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It wasn't what I wanted to do.

58
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.

59
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And then I saw this quote:

60
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."

61
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco,

63
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and I started a little company, fuseproject.

64
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.

65
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins,

66
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.

67
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so the first projects were sort of humble,

68
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
but they took technology and maybe made it into things

69
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that people would use in a new way,

70
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and maybe finding some new functionality.

71
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,

72
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
right when it launched,

73
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and it's the first watch that has a display

74
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that switches from horizontal to vertical.

75
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,

76
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
without bending my elbow.

77
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And other projects, which were really about transformation,

78
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
about matching the human need.

79
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,

80
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and it ships completely flat,

81
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.

82
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And something a little bit more experimental:

83
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
this is a light fixture for Swarovski,

84
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and what it does is, it changes shape.

85
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.

86
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,

87
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.

88
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.

89
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is a pretty involved process;

90
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
it took us about four and a half years.

91
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,

92
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
a new experience of light.

93
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.

94
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.

95
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And the new experience I was looking for

96
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is giving the choice for the user to go from

97
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,

98
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
all the way to a bright work light.

99
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So, the light bulb actually does that.

100
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It allows the person to switch,

101
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and to mix these two colorations.

102
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And it's done in a very simple way:

103
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
one just touches the base of the light,

104
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and on one side, you can mix the brightness,

105
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and on the other, the coloration of the light.

106
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,

107
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and I think as designers we need to really think

108
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
about how we can create a different relationship

109
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
between our work and the world,

110
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
whether it's for business,

111
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.

112
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring

113
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
value to business, value to the users also,

114
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but I think it's the values that we put into these projects

115
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that ultimately create the greater value.

116
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And the values we bring

117
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
can be about environmental issues,

118
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
about sustainability, about lower power consumption.

119
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You know, they can be about function and beauty;

120
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they can be about business strategy.

121
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But designers are really the glue

122
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that brings these things together.

123
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,

124
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and it has a humanistic technology.

125
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,

126
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and it knows when it is you're talking.

127
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And by knowing when it is you're talking,

128
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,

129
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which is the environmental noises.

130
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone

131
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,

132
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and all the nerdy stuff out of it,

133
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and try to make it as beautiful as we can.

134
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I mean, think about it:

135
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,

136
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or accessories is really important,

137
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.

138
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And this is what we're pursuing here.

139
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.

140
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I want to point at something here, on the left.

141
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside

142
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that makes this technology work.

143
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But this is the design process:

144
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
there's somebody changing the board,

145
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,

146
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
as the designers on the other side are doing the work.

147
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.

148
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's really about designing from the inside out.

149
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And then, on the other side of the room,

150
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the designers are making small adjustments,

151
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.

152
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And it's what I call being design driven.

153
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You know, there is some push and pull,

154
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but design is really helping define

155
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the whole experience from the inside out.

156
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And then, of course, design is never done.

157
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And this is -- the other new way that is unique

158
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in how we work is, because it's never done,

159
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you have to do all this other stuff.

160
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue

161
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to really touch the user, in many ways.

162
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?

163
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,

164
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you know, really understands that you need a different structure.

165
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,

166
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it's a partnership. We can continue to work

167
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and dedicate ourselves to this project,

168
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and then we also share in the rewards.

169
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.

170
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is called Y Water,

171
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,

172
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Austrian originally, who came to us,

173
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,

174
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or an organic drink for his kids,

175
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to replace the high-sugar-content sodas

176
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that he's trying to get them away from.

177
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So, we worked on this bottle,

178
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.

179
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.

180
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The bottles connect together,

181
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and you can create different shapes, different forms.

182
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

184
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Thank you.

185
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Applause)

186
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And then while we were doing this,

187
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,

188
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,"

189
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
are probably the most important words that kids ask.

190
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So we called it Y Water. And so this is

191
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
another place where it all comes together in the same room:

192
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,

193
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it all becomes deeply connected.

194
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And then the other thing about this project is,

195
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
we bring intellectual property,

196
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we bring a marketing approach,

197
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,

198
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
what we bring is these values,

199
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.

200
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And it's especially rewarding when your design work

201
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
becomes a creative endeavor,

202
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
when others can be creative and do more with it.

203
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Here's another project,

204
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
which I think really emulates that.

205
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.

206
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
This picture is incredible.

207
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.

208
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.

209
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I mean, to me, it just means so much.

210
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But when Nicholas Negroponte --

211
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and he has spoken about this project a lot,

212
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us

213
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
about two and a half years ago,

214
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
there were some clear ideas.

215
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,

216
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and those are pillars of his life,

217
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.

218
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.

219
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.

220
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.

221
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But what he said was really significant,

222
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is that design was going to be why the kids

223
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
were going to love this product,

224
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
how we were going to make it low cost, robust.

225
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --

226
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter) --

227
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and the Num Lock key, too.

228
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,

229
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.

230
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And then the integration of

231
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
all these great technologies, which you've heard about,

232
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;

233
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the screen, which you can read in sunlight;

234
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,

235
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and it's protected from the environment.

236
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You know, all these great technologies really happened

237
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
because of the passion and

238
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the OLPC people and the engineers.

239
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
They fought the suppliers,

240
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
they fought the manufacturers.

241
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I mean, they fought like animals

242
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
for this to remain they way it is.

243
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --

244
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
allows the process

245
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
from not destroying the original idea.

246
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And I think this is something really important.

247
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So, now you get these pictures --

248
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria

249
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and you see them in Uruguay

250
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
with their computers, and in Mongolia.

251
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And we went away from obviously the beige.

252
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.

253
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.

254
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It's because we were able

255
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to run, during the manufacturing process,

256
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
20 colors for the X and the O,

257
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
which is the name of the computer,

258
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,

259
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
you get 20 times 20: you get

260
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
400 different options there.

261
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So, the lessons from seeing the kids

262
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
using them in the developing world are incredible.

263
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,

264
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
and he had the laptop for an afternoon,

265
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and I had to take it back. It was hard.

266
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Laughter)

267
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,

268
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I come back to Switzerland,

269
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and there he is playing with his own version.

270
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Laughter)

271
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Like paper, paper and cardboard.

272
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So, I'm going to finish with one last project,

273
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and this is a little bit more of adult play.

274
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Laughter)

275
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.

276
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,

277
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
February 14, about 10 days ago.

278
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,

279
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and they needed a way to distribute

280
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.

281
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.

282
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.

283
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,

284
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and it has to be easily serviceable:

285
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
you have to know where it is and what it does.

286
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And we also designed the condoms themselves.

287
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And I was just in New York at the launch,

288
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and I went to see all these places where they're installed:

289
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;

290
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.

291
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.

292
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Of course, clubs and discos, too.

293
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And here's the public service announcement for this project.

294
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Music)

295
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Laughter)

296
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Get some.

297
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Applause)

298
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So, this is really where design

299
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
is able to create a conversation.

300
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I was in these venues, and people were,

301
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
you know, really into getting them. They were excited.

302
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
It was breaking the ice,

303
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
it was getting over a stigma,

304
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and I think that's also what design can do.

305
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So, I was going to

306
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
throw some condoms in the room and whatnot,

307
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.

308
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Laughter)

309
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.

310
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Laughter)

311
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Applause)

312
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.

313
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Laughter)

314
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,

315
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
you can just say you like the design.

316
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000

0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
So, I'll finish with just one thought:

318
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
if we all work together on creating value,

319
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,

320
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
I think we can change the work that we do.

321
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,

322
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.

323
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So, thank you.

324
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000

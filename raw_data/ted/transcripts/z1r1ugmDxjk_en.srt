1
0:00:12.858,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I am a visual artist,

2
0:00:14.357,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I make revolutionary art to propel history forward.

3
0:00:18.369,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm going to come right out and tell you something:

4
0:00:20.804,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I don't accept the economic foundation,

5
0:00:22.693,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the social relations

6
0:00:23.878,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or the governing ideas of America.

7
0:00:26.523,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My art contributes to fundamental change

8
0:00:28.481,000 --> 0:00:31,000
by encouraging an audience to address big questions from that perspective.

9
0:00:32.892,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Social change is hard, but ideas matter tremendously.

10
0:00:37.594,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When I say I'm an artist, most people think, "Oh, he's a painter."

11
0:00:40.738,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Behind me, you can see some of the kind of work I do.

12
0:00:43.295,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Imagine a World Without America" is a painting,

13
0:00:45.656,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but I work in a range of media,

14
0:00:47.173,000 --> 0:00:5,000
including photography, video and performance art.

15
0:00:53.536,000 --> 0:00:55,000
A current project, "Slave Rebellion Reenactment,"

16
0:00:56.378,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is going to be reenacted on the outskirts of New Orleans

17
0:00:59.378,000 --> 0:01:,000
this November.

18
0:01:02.5,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In 1989, I had an artwork that became the center of controversy

19
0:01:06.403,000 --> 0:01:08,000
over its transgressive use of the American flag.

20
0:01:09.62,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?"

21
0:01:12.278,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is a conceptual work that encouraged audience participation.

22
0:01:16.003,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It consisted of a photo montage that had text that read,

23
0:01:18.724,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?"

24
0:01:21.243,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Below that were books that people could write responses to that question in,

25
0:01:24.865,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and below that was a flag that people had the option of standing on.

26
0:01:28.086,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The photo montage consisted of images of South Korean students

27
0:01:31.17,000 --> 0:01:32,000
burning American flags,

28
0:01:32.641,000 --> 0:01:34,000
holding signs that said, "Yankee go home. Son of a bitch,"

29
0:01:35.489,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and below that were flag-draped coffins coming back from Vietnam.

30
0:01:39.461,000 --> 0:01:41,000
People wrote long and short answers.

31
0:01:41.553,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Thousands of people engaged with the work in a lot of different languages.

32
0:01:45.42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Some of the people said,

33
0:01:47.414,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"I'm a German girl.

34
0:01:48.692,000 --> 0:01:51,000
If we Germans would admire our flag as you all do,

35
0:01:51.738,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we would be called Nazis again.

36
0:01:53.497,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I think you do have too much trouble about this flag."

37
0:01:57.93,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage,

38
0:02:00.786,000 --> 0:02:01,000
i.e., the jungles of Africa,

39
0:02:02.455,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and then he can shovel manure in his artistic way."

40
0:02:06.981,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"This flag I'm standing on stands for everything oppressive in this system:

41
0:02:10.606,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the murder of the Indians and all the oppressed around the world,

42
0:02:13.698,000 --> 0:02:15,000
including my brother who was shot by a pig,

43
0:02:15.726,000 --> 0:02:18,000
who kicked over his body to 'make sure the nigger was dead.'

44
0:02:19.776,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That pig was wearing the flag.

45
0:02:21.403,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Thank you, Dread Scott, for this opportunity."

46
0:02:24.259,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"As a veteran defending the flag,

47
0:02:25.884,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I personally would never defend your stupid ass!

48
0:02:28.177,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You should be shot!" -- US Navy Seal Team.

49
0:02:32.463,000 --> 0:02:35,000
As you can see, people had very strong reactions about the flag then,

50
0:02:35.949,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as they do now.

51
0:02:37.606,000 --> 0:02:4,000
There were demonstrations of veterans in front of the Art Institute of Chicago.

52
0:02:41.414,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They chanted things like,

53
0:02:42.687,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"The flag and the artist, hang them both high,"

54
0:02:44.959,000 --> 0:02:45,000
evoking images of lynching.

55
0:02:46.507,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I received numerous death threats,

56
0:02:48.169,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and bomb threats were phoned in to my school.

57
0:02:50.323,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It was a very dangerous situation.

58
0:02:52.401,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Later, President Bush called the work "disgraceful,"

59
0:02:54.958,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which I viewed as a tremendous honor,

60
0:02:56.777,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and Congress outlawed the work.

61
0:02:58.326,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:59.455,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I became part of a Supreme Court case when I and others defied that law,

63
0:03:03.496,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by burning flags on the steps of the Capitol.

64
0:03:06.485,000 --> 0:03:09,000
That action and the subsequent legal and political battle

65
0:03:09.629,000 --> 0:03:12,000
led to a landmark First Amendment decision that prevented the government

66
0:03:13.331,000 --> 0:03:15,000
from demanding patriotism be mandatory.

67
0:03:16.169,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But let me back up a bit.

68
0:03:17.413,000 --> 0:03:19,000
These people literally wanted me dead.

69
0:03:20.633,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What I would do at this moment would make a difference.

70
0:03:23.281,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This is me at the exact same moment,

71
0:03:25.352,000 --> 0:03:26,000
eight stories above that crowd.

72
0:03:28.368,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It was supposed to be for a photo shoot

73
0:03:30.273,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that was going to take place on the steps where the veterans were at that time.

74
0:03:34.092,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It wouldn't have been safe for me to be there, to say the least.

75
0:03:37.142,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But it was really important to do that shoot,

76
0:03:39.307,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because while some wanted to kill me, it was also a situation

77
0:03:42.22,000 --> 0:03:45,000
where those who viewed the American flag as standing for everything oppressive

78
0:03:45.934,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in this system

79
0:03:47.114,000 --> 0:03:48,000
felt that they had a voice,

80
0:03:48.433,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and that voice needed to be amplified.

81
0:03:50.837,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The point is this:

82
0:03:52.085,000 --> 0:03:53,000
changing anything --

83
0:03:53.479,000 --> 0:03:57,000
whether it's conventional ideas about US national symbols,

84
0:03:57.505,000 --> 0:03:59,000
traditional thinking challenged by scientific breakthroughs

85
0:04:00.451,000 --> 0:04:02,000
or ousting an authoritarian president --

86
0:04:02.903,000 --> 0:04:03,000
requires a lot of things.

87
0:04:04.254,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It requires courage,

88
0:04:05.89,000 --> 0:04:06,000
luck

89
0:04:07.069,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and also vision and boldness of action.

90
0:04:10.971,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But on luck --

91
0:04:12.165,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I have to say, the photo shoot we did might not have worked out so well.

92
0:04:15.662,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We laughed after we were out of the area.

93
0:04:18.116,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But the thing is, it was worth the risk

94
0:04:20.008,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because of the stakes that were involved.

95
0:04:22.039,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And in this case, the luck led to a wonderful,

96
0:04:24.216,000 --> 0:04:25,000
profound and powerful situation

97
0:04:25.751,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that was also humorous.

98
0:04:27.241,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Thank you.

99
0:04:28.429,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Applause)

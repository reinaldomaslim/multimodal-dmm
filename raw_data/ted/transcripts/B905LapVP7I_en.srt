1
0:00:12.694,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So there's a lot of valid concern these days

2
0:00:14.87,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that our technology is getting so smart

3
0:00:17.099,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that we've put ourselves on the path to a jobless future.

4
0:00:21.502,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I think the example of a self-driving car

5
0:00:23.678,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is actually the easiest one to see.

6
0:00:25.376,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So these are going to be fantastic for all kinds of different reasons.

7
0:00:28.728,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But did you know that "driver" is actually the most common job

8
0:00:32.19,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in 29 of the 50 US states?

9
0:00:34.862,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What's going to happen to these jobs when we're no longer driving our cars

10
0:00:38.364,000 --> 0:00:39,000
or cooking our food

11
0:00:39.553,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or even diagnosing our own diseases?

12
0:00:42.495,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Well, a recent study from Forrester Research

13
0:00:44.896,000 --> 0:00:47,000
goes so far to predict that 25 million jobs

14
0:00:48.083,000 --> 0:00:5,000
might disappear over the next 10 years.

15
0:00:51.213,000 --> 0:00:52,000
To put that in perspective,

16
0:00:52.726,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that's three times as many jobs lost in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

17
0:00:58.426,000 --> 0:01:,000
And it's not just blue-collar jobs that are at risk.

18
0:01:01.548,000 --> 0:01:04,000
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley, we are seeing tremendous gains

19
0:01:04.999,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in the quality of analysis and decision-making

20
0:01:07.205,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because of machine learning.

21
0:01:08.883,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So even the smartest, highest-paid people will be affected by this change.

22
0:01:13.534,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What's clear is that no matter what your job is,

23
0:01:16.228,000 --> 0:01:17,000
at least some, if not all of your work,

24
0:01:18.224,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is going to be done by a robot or software in the next few years.

25
0:01:22.738,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And that's exactly why people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates

26
0:01:25.833,000 --> 0:01:28,000
are talking about the need for government-funded minimum income levels.

27
0:01:29.245,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But if our politicians can't agree on things like health care

28
0:01:32.611,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or even school lunches,

29
0:01:33.914,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I just don't see a path where they'll find consensus

30
0:01:36.368,000 --> 0:01:39,000
on something as big and as expensive as universal basic life income.

31
0:01:40.436,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Instead, I think the response needs to be led by us in industry.

32
0:01:44.105,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We have to recognize the change that's ahead of us

33
0:01:46.653,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and start to design the new kinds of jobs

34
0:01:48.652,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that will still be relevant in the age of robotics.

35
0:01:52.719,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The good news is that we have faced down and recovered

36
0:01:55.496,000 --> 0:01:57,000
two mass extinctions of jobs before.

37
0:01:58.343,000 --> 0:02:,000
From 1870 to 1970,

38
0:02:00.577,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the percent of American workers based on farms fell by 90 percent,

39
0:02:05.009,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and then again from 1950 to 2010,

40
0:02:07.578,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the percent of Americans working in factories

41
0:02:09.745,000 --> 0:02:1,000
fell by 75 percent.

42
0:02:12.39,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The challenge we face this time, however, is one of time.

43
0:02:15.368,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We had a hundred years to move from farms to factories,

44
0:02:18.406,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and then 60 years to fully build out a service economy.

45
0:02:21.498,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The rate of change today

46
0:02:22.847,000 --> 0:02:24,000
suggests that we may only have 10 or 15 years to adjust,

47
0:02:25.845,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and if we don't react fast enough,

48
0:02:27.572,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that means by the time today's elementary-school students

49
0:02:30.352,000 --> 0:02:31,000
are college-aged,

50
0:02:32.261,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we could be living in a world that's robotic,

51
0:02:34.426,000 --> 0:02:37,000
largely unemployed and stuck in kind of un-great depression.

52
0:02:39.617,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But I don't think it has to be this way.

53
0:02:41.58,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You see, I work in innovation,

54
0:02:43.304,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and part of my job is to shape how large companies apply new technologies.

55
0:02:48.085,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Certainly some of these technologies

56
0:02:49.904,000 --> 0:02:51,000
are even specifically designed to replace human workers.

57
0:02:53.435,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But I believe that if we start taking steps right now

58
0:02:56.385,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to change the nature of work,

59
0:02:58.23,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we can not only create environments where people love coming to work

60
0:03:02.14,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but also generate the innovation that we need

61
0:03:04.282,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to replace the millions of jobs that will be lost to technology.

62
0:03:08.352,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I believe that the key to preventing our jobless future

63
0:03:12.175,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is to rediscover what makes us human,

64
0:03:14.545,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and to create a new generation of human-centered jobs

65
0:03:17.527,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that allow us to unlock the hidden talents and passions

66
0:03:20.157,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that we carry with us every day.

67
0:03:23.971,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But first, I think it's important to recognize

68
0:03:26.138,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that we brought this problem on ourselves.

69
0:03:28.314,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And it's not just because, you know, we are the one building the robots.

70
0:03:32.327,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But even though most jobs left the factory decades ago,

71
0:03:35.535,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we still hold on to this factory mindset

72
0:03:37.496,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of standardization and de-skilling.

73
0:03:40.345,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We still define jobs around procedural tasks

74
0:03:42.72,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and then pay people for the number of hours that they perform these tasks.

75
0:03:46.232,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We've created narrow job definitions

76
0:03:48.012,000 --> 0:03:51,000
like cashier, loan processor or taxi driver

77
0:03:51.276,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and then asked people to form entire careers

78
0:03:53.783,000 --> 0:03:54,000
around these singular tasks.

79
0:03:56.071,000 --> 0:03:59,000
These choices have left us with actually two dangerous side effects.

80
0:03:59.628,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The first is that these narrowly defined jobs

81
0:04:02.402,000 --> 0:04:04,000
will be the first to be displaced by robots,

82
0:04:04.849,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because single-task robots are just the easiest kinds to build.

83
0:04:08.601,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But second, we have accidentally made it

84
0:04:11.018,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so that millions of workers around the world

85
0:04:13.17,000 --> 0:04:15,000
have unbelievably boring working lives.

86
0:04:15.877,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:18.247,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Let's take the example of a call center agent.

88
0:04:20.673,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Over the last few decades, we brag about lower operating costs

89
0:04:23.7,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because we've taken most of the need for brainpower

90
0:04:26.151,000 --> 0:04:28,000
out of the person and put it into the system.

91
0:04:28.319,000 --> 0:04:3,000
For most of their day, they click on screens,

92
0:04:30.864,000 --> 0:04:31,000
they read scripts.

93
0:04:33.307,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They act more like machines than humans.

94
0:04:37.098,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And unfortunately, over the next few years,

95
0:04:39.238,000 --> 0:04:4,000
as our technology gets more advanced,

96
0:04:41.121,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they, along with people like clerks and bookkeepers,

97
0:04:43.729,000 --> 0:04:45,000
will see the vast majority of their work disappear.

98
0:04:47.315,000 --> 0:04:49,000
To counteract this, we have to start creating new jobs

99
0:04:50.043,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that are less centered on the tasks that a person does

100
0:04:52.606,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and more focused on the skills that a person brings to work.

101
0:04:56.209,000 --> 0:04:59,000
For example, robots are great at repetitive and constrained work,

102
0:04:59.62,000 --> 0:05:,000
but human beings have an amazing ability

103
0:05:01.593,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to bring together capability with creativity

104
0:05:03.896,000 --> 0:05:05,000
when faced with problems that we've never seen before.

105
0:05:06.942,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's when every day brings a little bit of a surprise

106
0:05:09.946,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that we have designed work for humans

107
0:05:11.974,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and not for robots.

108
0:05:13.95,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Our entrepreneurs and engineers already live in this world,

109
0:05:16.872,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but so do our nurses and our plumbers

110
0:05:19.488,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and our therapists.

111
0:05:21.569,000 --> 0:05:24,000
You know, it's the nature of too many companies and organizations

112
0:05:24.65,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to just ask people to come to work and do your job.

113
0:05:28.364,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But if you work is better done by a robot,

114
0:05:30.574,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or your decisions better made by an AI,

115
0:05:33.395,000 --> 0:05:34,000
what are you supposed to be doing?

116
0:05:35.833,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Well, I think for the manager,

117
0:05:38.341,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we need to realistically think about the tasks that will be disappearing

118
0:05:41.762,000 --> 0:05:42,000
over the next few years

119
0:05:42.937,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and start planning for more meaningful, more valuable work that should replace it.

120
0:05:46.833,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We need to create environments

121
0:05:48.286,000 --> 0:05:5,000
where both human beings and robots thrive.

122
0:05:50.549,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I say, let's give more work to the robots,

123
0:05:53.109,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and let's start with the work that we absolutely hate doing.

124
0:05:57.248,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Here, robot,

125
0:05:58.436,000 --> 0:05:59,000
process this painfully idiotic report.

126
0:06:00.311,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:01.758,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And move this box. Thank you.

128
0:06:03.207,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:04.93,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And for the human beings,

130
0:06:06.483,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we should follow the advice from Harry Davis at the University of Chicago.

131
0:06:10.061,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He says we have to make it so that people don't leave too much of themselves

132
0:06:13.734,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in the trunk of their car.

133
0:06:15.089,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I mean, human beings are amazing on weekends.

134
0:06:18.002,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Think about the people that you know and what they do on Saturdays.

135
0:06:21.17,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They're artists, carpenters, chefs and athletes.

136
0:06:24.906,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But on Monday, they're back to being Junior HR Specialist

137
0:06:28.826,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and Systems Analyst 3.

138
0:06:30.949,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:34.754,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You know, these narrow job titles not only sound boring,

140
0:06:38.096,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but they're actually a subtle encouragement

141
0:06:40.216,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for people to make narrow and boring job contributions.

142
0:06:43.28,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But I've seen firsthand that when you invite people to be more,

143
0:06:46.42,000 --> 0:06:48,000
they can amaze us with how much more they can be.

144
0:06:50.147,000 --> 0:06:52,000
A few years ago, I was working at a large bank

145
0:06:52.404,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that was trying to bring more innovation into its company culture.

146
0:06:55.524,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So my team and I designed a prototyping contest

147
0:06:57.889,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that invited anyone to build anything that they wanted.

148
0:07:01.524,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We were actually trying to figure out

149
0:07:03.381,000 --> 0:07:05,000
whether or not the primary limiter to innovation

150
0:07:05.673,000 --> 0:07:07,000
was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,

151
0:07:08.187,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and it turns out it was neither one.

152
0:07:10.072,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It was an empowerment problem.

153
0:07:12.518,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And the results of the program were amazing.

154
0:07:16.198,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We started by inviting people to reenvision

155
0:07:18.599,000 --> 0:07:2,000
what it is they could bring to a team.

156
0:07:20.738,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This contest was not only a chance to build anything that you wanted

157
0:07:24.5,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but also be anything that you wanted.

158
0:07:26.86,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And when people were no longer limited by their day-to-day job titles,

159
0:07:30.17,000 --> 0:07:33,000
they felt free to bring all kinds of different skills and talents

160
0:07:33.341,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to the problems that they were trying to solve.

161
0:07:35.851,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We saw technology people being designers, marketing people being architects,

162
0:07:39.785,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and even finance people showing off their ability to write jokes.

163
0:07:43.427,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:44.601,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We ran this program twice,

165
0:07:46.03,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and each time more than 400 people brought their unexpected talents to work

166
0:07:49.85,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and solved problems that they had been wanting to solve for years.

167
0:07:53.31,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Collectively, they created millions of dollars of value,

168
0:07:56.353,000 --> 0:08:,000
building things like a better touch-tone system for call centers,

169
0:08:00.942,000 --> 0:08:01,000
easier desktop tools for branches

170
0:08:02.634,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and even a thank you card system

171
0:08:04.183,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that has become a cornerstone of the employee working experience.

172
0:08:07.521,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Over the course of the eight weeks,

173
0:08:09.348,000 --> 0:08:12,000
people flexed muscles that they never dreamed of using at work.

174
0:08:14.173,000 --> 0:08:15,000
People learned new skills,

175
0:08:15.774,000 --> 0:08:17,000
they met new people,

176
0:08:18.166,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and at the end, somebody pulled me aside and said,

177
0:08:20.983,000 --> 0:08:21,000
"I have to tell you,

178
0:08:22.576,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the last few weeks has been one of the most intense,

179
0:08:25.376,000 --> 0:08:28,000
hardest working experiences of my entire life,

180
0:08:28.679,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but not one second of it felt like work."

181
0:08:31.9,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And that's the key.

182
0:08:33.222,000 --> 0:08:36,000
For those few weeks, people got to be creators and innovators.

183
0:08:38.631,000 --> 0:08:39,000
They had been dreaming of solutions

184
0:08:40.322,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to problems that had been bugging them for years,

185
0:08:42.83,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and this was a chance to turn those dreams into a reality.

186
0:08:46.489,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And that dreaming is an important part of what separates us from machines.

187
0:08:50.955,000 --> 0:08:53,000
For now, our machines do not get frustrated,

188
0:08:53.997,000 --> 0:08:54,000
they do not get annoyed,

189
0:08:55.428,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and they certainly don't imagine.

190
0:08:57.712,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But we, as human beings --

191
0:08:59.435,000 --> 0:09:,000
we feel pain,

192
0:09:00.666,000 --> 0:09:01,000
we get frustrated.

193
0:09:02.09,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And it's when we're most annoyed and most curious

194
0:09:05.23,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that we're motivated to dig into a problem and create change.

195
0:09:09.366,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Our imaginations are the birthplace of new products, new services,

196
0:09:13.3,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and even new industries.

197
0:09:15.296,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I believe that the jobs of the future

198
0:09:17.122,000 --> 0:09:18,000
will come from the minds of people

199
0:09:18.859,000 --> 0:09:2,000
who today we call analysts and specialists,

200
0:09:21.599,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but only if we give them the freedom and protection that they need to grow

201
0:09:25.101,000 --> 0:09:27,000
into becoming explorers and inventors.

202
0:09:28.534,000 --> 0:09:3,000
If we really want to robot-proof our jobs,

203
0:09:30.701,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we, as leaders, need to get out of the mindset

204
0:09:32.96,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of telling people what to do

205
0:09:34.814,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and instead start asking them what problems they're inspired to solve

206
0:09:38.659,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and what talents they want to bring to work.

207
0:09:41.501,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Because when you can bring your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,

208
0:09:44.968,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you'll look forward to Mondays more,

209
0:09:46.986,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and those feelings that we have about Mondays

210
0:09:49.692,000 --> 0:09:5,000
are part of what makes us human.

211
0:09:52.287,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And as we redesign work for an era of intelligent machines,

212
0:09:55.319,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I invite you all to work alongside me

213
0:09:57.559,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to bring more humanity to our working lives.

214
0:10:00.225,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Thank you.

215
0:10:01.4,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Applause)

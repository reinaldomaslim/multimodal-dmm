1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It began with one question:

2
0:00:17.222,000 --> 0:00:22,000
If Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing?

3
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa,

4
0:00:26.48,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which wasn't exactly according to the rules

5
0:00:28.56,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because South Africa's not my country.

6
0:00:31.64,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But alluding to the country's continual attempts

7
0:00:34.92,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to build a postracial society

8
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
after being ravaged for decades by apartheid,

9
0:00:40.6,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol

10
0:00:46.96,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and begging them to get along in its stomach.

11
0:00:50.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And then I waited.

12
0:00:52.68,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line.

13
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country

14
0:00:59.36,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and a few other African countries I'm familiar with.

15
0:01:02.4,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And then I waited again,

16
0:01:03.68,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but this time

17
0:01:05.08,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted

18
0:01:08.52,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to convince myself,

19
0:01:10.28,000 --> 0:01:14,000
no, to remind myself that I'm really funny

20
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.

21
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But luckily,

22
0:01:20.2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I didn't have to do that for very long.

23
0:01:22.44,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Very soon, people were participating.

24
0:01:26.28,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In fact, by the end of that week in July,

25
0:01:29.56,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the hashtag #ifafricawasabar

26
0:01:32.12,000 --> 0:01:35,000
would have garnered around 60,000 tweets,

27
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
lit up the continent

28
0:01:37.52,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and made its way to publications all over the world.

29
0:01:41.24,000 --> 0:01:44,000
People were using the hashtag to do many different things.

30
0:01:45.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
To poke fun at their stereotypes:

31
0:01:47.48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
[#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining

32
0:01:50.12,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that he will pay the entrance fee,

33
0:01:51.92,000 --> 0:01:53,000
all he needs is the bouncer's account details.]

34
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:55.6,000 --> 0:01:57,000
To criticize government spending:

36
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce

37
0:02:01.6,000 --> 0:02:02,000
running a tab it won't be able to pay]

38
0:02:03.48,000 --> 0:02:05,000
To make light of geopolitical tensions:

39
0:02:06.08,000 --> 0:02:08,000
[#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy

40
0:02:08.48,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with serious anger management issues.]

41
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:11,000
To remind us that even in Africa

42
0:02:12.6,000 --> 0:02:14,000
there are some countries we don't know exist:

43
0:02:15.08,000 --> 0:02:17,000
[#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person

44
0:02:17.48,000 --> 0:02:2,000
who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.]

45
0:02:20.52,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa:

46
0:02:24.8,000 --> 0:02:27,000
[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco

47
0:02:27.84,000 --> 0:02:29,000
be like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"]

48
0:02:30.08,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And to note the countries that had made a big turnaround:

50
0:02:36.12,000 --> 0:02:38,000
[#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl

51
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]

52
0:02:41.8,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But most importantly,

53
0:02:44.36,000 --> 0:02:46,000
people were using the hashtag to connect.

54
0:02:47.64,000 --> 0:02:49,000
People were connecting over their Africanness.

55
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So for one week in July,

56
0:02:53.32,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Twitter became a real African bar.

57
0:02:57.6,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I was really thrilled,

58
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work,

59
0:03:04.2,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips

60
0:03:09.52,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a platform that just needed a small spark

61
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to light in us a hunger for each other.

62
0:03:17.12,000 --> 0:03:19,000
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,

63
0:03:19.32,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I'm 22 years old

64
0:03:21.08,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.

65
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth

66
0:03:26.68,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because my parents are from two different African countries.

67
0:03:30.08,000 --> 0:03:33,000
My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa.

68
0:03:33.84,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's only slightly bigger than Germany.

69
0:03:36.88,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy.

70
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And it has some very progressive social policies.

71
0:03:44.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland.

72
0:03:48.64,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa.

73
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It is Africa's last complete monarchy.

74
0:03:55.52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family

75
0:03:58.36,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in line with their tradition,

76
0:03:59.8,000 --> 0:04:,000
for a very long time.

77
0:04:01.88,000 --> 0:04:03,000
On paper, these countries seem very different.

78
0:04:04.88,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And when I was a kid, I could see the difference.

79
0:04:08.44,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other.

80
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But outside of that, I didn't really realize

81
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:18,000
why it mattered that my parents were from two different places.

82
0:04:19.72,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me.

83
0:04:23.92,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You see, I was born in one country

84
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and raised in the other.

85
0:04:28.76,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When we moved to Botswana,

86
0:04:30.68,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati

87
0:04:33.64,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and nothing else.

88
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So I was being introduced to my new home,

89
0:04:37.96,000 --> 0:04:39,000
my new cultural identity,

90
0:04:40.24,000 --> 0:04:42,000
as a complete outsider,

91
0:04:42.28,000 --> 0:04:46,000
incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me

92
0:04:46.56,000 --> 0:04:5,000
by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward.

93
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But very soon, I would shed SiSwati.

94
0:04:55.24,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And when I would go back to Swaziland,

95
0:04:57.52,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.

96
0:05:02.64,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system,

97
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:09,000
whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you,

98
0:05:10.84,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and I would have a very peculiar adolescence.

99
0:05:14.24,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here,

100
0:05:20.12,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once

101
0:05:24.4,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but not really belonging to either one very well

102
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously.

103
0:05:33.4,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity.

104
0:05:40.56,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Since then, I have continued to read about politics

105
0:05:43.36,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and geography and identity and what all those things mean.

106
0:05:46.8,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies.

107
0:05:51.56,000 --> 0:05:52,000
When I began to read,

108
0:05:52.84,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals

109
0:05:56.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,

110
0:05:58.76,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who tackled complex ideas

111
0:06:00.6,000 --> 0:06:03,000
like decolonization and black consciousness.

112
0:06:03.68,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas,

113
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen

114
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara

115
0:06:15.04,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.

116
0:06:17.48,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on.

117
0:06:21.88,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So when Twitter came,

118
0:06:23.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl

119
0:06:27.76,000 --> 0:06:32,000
whose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff.

120
0:06:34.28,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The year was 2011

121
0:06:35.64,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and all over southern Africa and the whole continent,

122
0:06:38.72,000 --> 0:06:41,000
affordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing

123
0:06:42.64,000 --> 0:06:44,000
became much easier to get.

124
0:06:45.48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform

125
0:06:50.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity.

126
0:06:55.44,000 --> 0:06:57,000
On long commutes to work,

127
0:06:57.88,000 --> 0:07:,000
in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to,

128
0:07:01.36,000 --> 0:07:02,000
on our lunch breaks,

129
0:07:02.96,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we would communicate as much as we could

130
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
about the everyday realities of being young and African.

131
0:07:08.88,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But of course, this luxury was not available to everybody.

132
0:07:12.4,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana

133
0:07:16.12,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and you wanted to have fun on the Internet,

134
0:07:18.2,000 --> 0:07:2,000
one, you had to tweet in English.

135
0:07:20.88,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Two, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online.

136
0:07:25.68,000 --> 0:07:3,000
You had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.

137
0:07:30.76,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And suddenly, your whole world opened up.

138
0:07:33.56,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And my whole world did open up.

139
0:07:35.92,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent,

140
0:07:39.76,000 --> 0:07:4,000
taking pictures of themselves

141
0:07:41.24,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and posting them under the hashtag #myafrica.

142
0:07:44.36,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Because at that time,

143
0:07:45.84,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google

144
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:5,000
or any kind of social media,

145
0:07:51.2,000 --> 0:07:54,000
you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals

146
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts.

147
0:07:58.52,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Laughter)

148
0:08:00.8,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But Africans were using this platform

149
0:08:03.36,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors.

150
0:08:07.44,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria.

151
0:08:11.48,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi.

152
0:08:15.04,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And these were the same Africans that I began to meet

153
0:08:17.541,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in my own travels around the continent.

154
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy.

155
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But almost invariably, every single time,

156
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we would end up discussing Twitter.

157
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And that's when I realized what this was.

158
0:08:35.12,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We were standing in the middle of something amazing,

159
0:08:38.44,000 --> 0:08:4,000
because for the first time ever

160
0:08:40.76,000 --> 0:08:45,000
young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time,

161
0:08:45.84,000 --> 0:08:49,000
without the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments.

162
0:08:50.72,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Because the little known truth is

163
0:08:52.679,000 --> 0:08:55,000
many Africans know a lot less about other African countries

164
0:08:56.56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole.

165
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This is by accident,

166
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but sometimes, it's by design.

167
0:09:03.92,000 --> 0:09:05,000
For example, in apartheid South Africa,

168
0:09:06.88,000 --> 0:09:09,000
black South Africans were constantly being bombarded

169
0:09:10.4,000 --> 0:09:13,000
with this message that any country ruled by black people

170
0:09:13.52,000 --> 0:09:14,000
was destined for failure.

171
0:09:15.52,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And this was done to convince them

172
0:09:18.08,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that they were much better off under crushing white rule

173
0:09:21.76,000 --> 0:09:24,000
than they were living in a black and free nation.

174
0:09:25.64,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Add to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system,

175
0:09:30.88,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s --

176
0:09:34.88,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes

177
0:09:39.2,000 --> 0:09:43,000
of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years,

178
0:09:43.28,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country.

179
0:09:46.64,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And to me, this doesn't make any sense

180
0:09:49.52,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because whether we like it or not,

181
0:09:51.56,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the fates of African people are deeply intertwined.

182
0:09:55.68,000 --> 0:09:58,000
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits,

183
0:09:59.2,000 --> 0:10:01,000
we share the consequences.

184
0:10:01.36,000 --> 0:10:03,000
When Burundians flee political turmoil,

185
0:10:04.36,000 --> 0:10:05,000
they go to us,

186
0:10:05.72,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to other African countries.

187
0:10:07.76,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers.

188
0:10:12.32,000 --> 0:10:14,000
What was once a Burundian problem

189
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
becomes an African problem.

190
0:10:17.04,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So to me, there are no Sudanese problems

191
0:10:20.64,000 --> 0:10:22,000
or South African problems or Kenyan problems,

192
0:10:23.08,000 --> 0:10:24,000
only African problems

193
0:10:24.68,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because eventually, we share the turmoil.

194
0:10:27.6,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So if we share the problems,

195
0:10:29.36,000 --> 0:10:32,000
why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes?

196
0:10:33.2,000 --> 0:10:34,000
How can we do that?

197
0:10:34.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Well, in the long term,

198
0:10:35.72,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade,

199
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
removing borders and putting pressure on leaders

200
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed.

201
0:10:45.2,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes

202
0:10:50.36,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism.

203
0:10:55.32,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now, political Pan-Africanism already exists,

204
0:10:58.2,000 --> 0:11:,000
so I'm not inventing anything totally new here.

205
0:11:01.36,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But political Pan-Africanism

206
0:11:02.96,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is usually the African unity of the political elite.

207
0:11:06.52,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And who does that benefit?

208
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.

209
0:11:11.28,000 --> 0:11:13,000
No, what I'm talking about

210
0:11:14.2,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is the Pan-Africanism of the ordinary African.

211
0:11:17.84,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Young Africans like me,

212
0:11:19.92,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we are bursting with creative energy,

213
0:11:22.92,000 --> 0:11:24,000
with innovative ideas.

214
0:11:25.44,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But with bad governance and shaky institutions,

215
0:11:28.84,000 --> 0:11:3,000
all of this potential could go to waste.

216
0:11:31.52,000 --> 0:11:33,000
On a continent where more than a handful of leaders

217
0:11:34.08,000 --> 0:11:35,000
have been in power longer

218
0:11:35.96,000 --> 0:11:38,000
than the majority of the populations has been alive,

219
0:11:40.36,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we are in desperate need of something new,

220
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:44,000
something that works.

221
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And I think that thing is social Pan-Africanism.

222
0:11:51.56,000 --> 0:11:54,000
My dream is that young Africans

223
0:11:54.72,000 --> 0:11:59,000
stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation.

224
0:12:00.28,000 --> 0:12:04,000
My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant,

225
0:12:04.64,000 --> 0:12:07,000
they don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country,"

226
0:12:08.08,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and then give up.

227
0:12:09.52,000 --> 0:12:12,000
My dream is that young Africans begin to realize

228
0:12:13.2,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that the entire continent is our canvas, is our home.

229
0:12:18.92,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Using the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively,

230
0:12:23.28,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we can begin to innovate together.

231
0:12:25.88,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In Africa, we say, "If you want to go fast, you go alone,

232
0:12:29.48,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but if you want to go far, you go together."

233
0:12:32.36,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together.

234
0:12:39.48,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And this is already happening.

235
0:12:41.52,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Access to these online networks has given young Africans

236
0:12:44.52,000 --> 0:12:48,000
something we've always had to violently take: a voice.

237
0:12:48.92,000 --> 0:12:49,000
We now have a platform.

238
0:12:50.84,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Before now, if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa,

239
0:12:54.8,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth --

240
0:12:58.56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Laughter)

241
0:12:59.88,000 --> 0:13:,000
to wake up in the morning,

242
0:13:01.96,000 --> 0:13:03,000
take his heartburn medication

243
0:13:05.36,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and then tell you the plans he has for your generation

244
0:13:08.28,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in 20 years time.

245
0:13:10.4,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Before now, if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government,

246
0:13:16.36,000 --> 0:13:19,000
you were pushed to protest, suffer the consequences

247
0:13:19.76,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and have your fingers crossed

248
0:13:21.44,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that some Western paper somewhere might make someone care.

249
0:13:25.56,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But now we have opportunities to back each other up

250
0:13:28.4,000 --> 0:13:3,000
in ways we never could before.

251
0:13:30.64,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We support South African students

252
0:13:32.4,000 --> 0:13:35,000
who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees.

253
0:13:36.04,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament.

254
0:13:39.4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained.

255
0:13:43.56,000 --> 0:13:45,000
For the first time ever,

256
0:13:45.72,000 --> 0:13:49,000
African pain and African aspiration

257
0:13:50.2,000 --> 0:13:53,000
has the ability to be witnessed

258
0:13:53.52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
by those who can empathize with it the most:

259
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
other Africans.

260
0:13:58.92,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking

261
0:14:02.88,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and using the Internet as a tool,

262
0:14:05.92,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we can begin to rescue each other,

263
0:14:08.8,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.

264
0:14:12.4,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Thank you.

265
0:14:13.64,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Applause)

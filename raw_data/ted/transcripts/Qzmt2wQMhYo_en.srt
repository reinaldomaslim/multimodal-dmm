0:00:16.346,000 --> 0:00:17,000
About 75 years ago,

3
0:00:18.036,000 --> 0:00:2,000
my grandfather, a young man,

4
0:00:20.595,000 --> 0:00:21,000
walked into a tent

5
0:00:22.506,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that was converted into a

6
0:00:24.003,000 --> 0:00:25,000
movie theater like that,

7
0:00:25.714,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and he fell hopelessly in love

8
0:00:27.914,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with the woman he saw on the

9
0:00:29.243,000 --> 0:00:32,000
silver screen: none other than Mae West,

10
0:00:32.572,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the heartthrob of the '30s,

11
0:00:34.487,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and he could never forget her.

12
0:00:36.527,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In fact, when he had his daughter

13
0:00:38.447,000 --> 0:00:4,000
many years later, he wanted to

14
0:00:40.639,000 --> 0:00:41,000
name her after Mae West,

15
0:00:42.055,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but can you imagine an Indian

16
0:00:43.639,000 --> 0:00:44,000
child name Mae West?

17
0:00:45.175,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The Indian family said, no way!

18
0:00:46.861,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So when my twin brother Kaesava

19
0:00:49.799,000 --> 0:00:51,000
was born, he decided to tinker

20
0:00:52.309,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with the spelling of Keshava's name.

21
0:00:54.024,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E,

22
0:00:57.735,000 --> 0:01:,000
why can't Keshava be K-A-E?

23
0:01:01.271,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So he changed Kaesava's spelling.

24
0:01:03.511,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now Kaesava had a baby boy

25
0:01:05.582,000 --> 0:01:07,000
called Rehan a couple of weeks ago.

26
0:01:07.782,000 --> 0:01:09,000
He decided to spell, or, rather,

27
0:01:10.013,000 --> 0:01:12,000
misspell Raehan with an A-E.

28
0:01:12.093,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You know, my grandfather died

29
0:01:14.228,000 --> 0:01:15,000
many years ago when I was

30
0:01:15.588,000 --> 0:01:16,000
little, but his love for Mae

31
0:01:17.429,000 --> 0:01:19,000
West lives on as a misspelling

32
0:01:19.9,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the DNA of his progeny.

33
0:01:21.676,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That for me is successful legacy. (Laughs)

34
0:01:24.82,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You know, as for me,

35
0:01:26.462,000 --> 0:01:27,000
my wife and I have our own

36
0:01:27.689,000 --> 0:01:28,000
crazy legacy project.

37
0:01:29.297,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We actually sit every few years,

38
0:01:31.489,000 --> 0:01:33,000
argue, disagree, fight,

39
0:01:33.862,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and actually come up with our

40
0:01:35.704,000 --> 0:01:37,000
very own 200-year plan.

41
0:01:37.72,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Our friends think we're mad.

42
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Our parents think we're cuckoo.

43
0:01:41.168,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Because, you know, we both

44
0:01:42.504,000 --> 0:01:43,000
come from families that really

45
0:01:43.872,000 --> 0:01:46,000
look up to humility and wisdom,

46
0:01:46.873,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but we both like to live

47
0:01:48.504,000 --> 0:01:49,000
larger than life.

48
0:01:49.841,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I believe in the concept of

49
0:01:51.351,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before

50
0:01:54.112,000 --> 0:01:55,000
you can become an ascetic.

51
0:01:55.425,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is me being a rock star,

52
0:01:56.92,000 --> 0:01:57,000
even if it's in my own house.

53
0:01:58.544,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You know?

54
0:01:59.808,000 --> 0:02:,000
So when Netra and I sat down

55
0:02:01.52,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to make our first plan

56
0:02:02.976,000 --> 0:02:03,000
10 years ago, we said

57
0:02:04.96,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we want the focus of this plan

58
0:02:07.064,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to go way beyond ourselves.

59
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What do we mean by beyond ourselves?

60
0:02:11.544,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well 200 years, we calculated,

61
0:02:14.569,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is at the end of our direct

62
0:02:16.744,000 --> 0:02:17,000
contact with the world.

63
0:02:17.912,000 --> 0:02:18,000
There's nobody I'll meet in

64
0:02:19.271,000 --> 0:02:21,000
my life will ever live beyond

65
0:02:21.584,000 --> 0:02:22,000
200 years, so we thought

66
0:02:23.488,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that's a perfect place where

67
0:02:24.68,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we should situate our plan and

68
0:02:26.592,000 --> 0:02:27,000
let our imagination take flight.

69
0:02:28.32,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You know, I never really

70
0:02:29.864,000 --> 0:02:3,000
believed in legacy. What am I

71
0:02:31.552,000 --> 0:02:32,000
going to leave behind? I'm an artist.

72
0:02:33.544,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Until I made a cartoon about 9/11.

73
0:02:36.83,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It caused so much trouble for me.

74
0:02:39.478,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was so upset.

75
0:02:40.894,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You know, a cartoon that was

76
0:02:43.374,000 --> 0:02:44,000
meant to be a cartoon of the week

77
0:02:45.038,000 --> 0:02:48,000
ended up staying so much longer.

78
0:02:48.27,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now I'm in the business of

79
0:02:50.424,000 --> 0:02:51,000
creating art that will

80
0:02:52.101,000 --> 0:02:54,000
definitely even outlive me, and

81
0:02:54.464,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I think about what I want to

82
0:02:56.125,000 --> 0:02:58,000
leave behind through those paintings.

83
0:02:58.165,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You know, the 9/11 cartoon

84
0:03:00.157,000 --> 0:03:03,000
upset me so much that I decided

85
0:03:03.453,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I'll never cartoon again.

86
0:03:04.989,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I said, I'm never going to make any

87
0:03:06.205,000 --> 0:03:07,000
honest public commentary again.

88
0:03:08.118,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But of course I continued

89
0:03:10.613,000 --> 0:03:11,000
creating artwork that was honest

90
0:03:12.549,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and raw, because I forgot about

91
0:03:14.726,000 --> 0:03:16,000
how people reacted to my work.

92
0:03:16.944,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You know, sometimes forgetting

93
0:03:18.518,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is so important to remain idealistic.

94
0:03:21.509,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Perhaps loss of memory is so

95
0:03:24.246,000 --> 0:03:25,000
crucial for our survival

96
0:03:26.189,000 --> 0:03:27,000
as human beings.

97
0:03:27.558,000 --> 0:03:28,000
One of the most important things

98
0:03:29.413,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in my 200-year plan that Netra

99
0:03:31.317,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and I write is what to forget

100
0:03:33.703,000 --> 0:03:34,000
about ourselves.

101
0:03:35.016,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You know, we carry so much

102
0:03:36.437,000 --> 0:03:37,000
baggage, from our parents,

103
0:03:37.846,000 --> 0:03:39,000
from our society, from so many

104
0:03:39.854,000 --> 0:03:42,000
people -- fears, insecurities -- and

105
0:03:43.598,000 --> 0:03:44,000
our 200-year plan really lists

106
0:03:45.453,000 --> 0:03:48,000
all our childhood problems that we have to expire.

107
0:03:48.505,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We actually put an expiry date

108
0:03:50.006,000 --> 0:03:52,000
on all our childhood problems.

109
0:03:52.48,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The latest date I put was,

110
0:03:54.345,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I said, I am going to expire

111
0:03:57.106,000 --> 0:03:59,000
my fear of my leftist, feminist

112
0:03:59.649,000 --> 0:04:01,000
mother-in-law, and this

113
0:04:02.058,000 --> 0:04:05,000
today is the date! (Laughs)

114
0:04:05.18,000 --> 0:04:06,000
She's watching. (Laughter)

115
0:04:06.771,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Anyway, you know, I really

116
0:04:11.619,000 --> 0:04:13,000
make decisions all the time

117
0:04:13.619,000 --> 0:04:14,000
about how I want to remember

118
0:04:15.204,000 --> 0:04:18,000
myself, and that's the most important

119
0:04:18.476,000 --> 0:04:19,000
kind of decisions I make.

120
0:04:19.995,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And this directly translates

121
0:04:21.867,000 --> 0:04:22,000
into my paintings.

122
0:04:23.19,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But like my friends, I can do

123
0:04:25.332,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that really well on Facebook,

124
0:04:26.908,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.

125
0:04:28.827,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Name it, I'm on it.

126
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I've started outsourcing my

127
0:04:32.339,000 --> 0:04:33,000
memory to the digital world,

128
0:04:33.932,000 --> 0:04:34,000
you know? But that comes

129
0:04:35.372,000 --> 0:04:36,000
with a problem.

130
0:04:36.468,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's so easy to think of

131
0:04:38.099,000 --> 0:04:39,000
technology as a metaphor

132
0:04:39.404,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for memory, but our brains

133
0:04:41.75,000 --> 0:04:42,000
are not perfect storage devices

134
0:04:43.697,000 --> 0:04:43,000
like technology.

135
0:04:44.496,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We only remember what we

136
0:04:46.036,000 --> 0:04:47,000
want to. At least I do.

137
0:04:47.291,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I rather think of our brains

138
0:04:49.794,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as biased curators of our

139
0:04:52.193,000 --> 0:04:54,000
memory, you know? And if

140
0:04:55.033,000 --> 0:04:56,000
technology is not a metaphor for

141
0:04:56.857,000 --> 0:04:57,000
memory, what is it?

142
0:04:58.489,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Netra and I use our technology

143
0:05:01.505,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as a tool in our 200-year plan

144
0:05:04.073,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to really curate our digital legacy.

145
0:05:07.592,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That is a picture of my mother,

146
0:05:10.609,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and she recently got a Facebook account.

147
0:05:13.362,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You know where this is going.

148
0:05:15.128,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And I've been very supportive

149
0:05:16.962,000 --> 0:05:18,000
until this picture shows up

150
0:05:19.345,000 --> 0:05:2,000
on my Facebook page. (Laughter)

151
0:05:20.912,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I actually untagged myself

152
0:05:24.169,000 --> 0:05:25,000
first, then I picked up the

153
0:05:25.633,000 --> 0:05:26,000
phone. I said, "Mom, you will

154
0:05:26.992,000 --> 0:05:27,000
never put a picture of me

155
0:05:28.104,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in a bikini ever again."

156
0:05:29.393,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And she said, "Why? You look

157
0:05:32.321,000 --> 0:05:34,000
so cute, darling." I said,

158
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:35,000
"You just don't understand."

159
0:05:36.233,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Maybe we are among the first

160
0:05:38.216,000 --> 0:05:39,000
generation that really understands

161
0:05:39.537,000 --> 0:05:41,000
this digital curating of ourselves.

162
0:05:41.728,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Maybe we are the first to even

163
0:05:43.29,000 --> 0:05:45,000
actively record our lives.

164
0:05:45.528,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You know, whether you

165
0:05:47.08,000 --> 0:05:49,000
agree with, you know, legacy

166
0:05:49.233,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or not, we are actually leaving

167
0:05:51.376,000 --> 0:05:53,000
behind digital traces all the time.

168
0:05:53.729,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So Netra and I really wanted

169
0:05:55.784,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to use our 200-year plan

170
0:05:57.144,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to curate this digital legacy,

171
0:05:59.321,000 --> 0:06:,000
and not only digital legacy

172
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but we believe in curating

173
0:06:02.32,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the legacy of my past

174
0:06:04.208,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and future.

175
0:06:05.392,000 --> 0:06:06,000
How, you may ask?

176
0:06:07.225,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Well, when I think of the future,

177
0:06:10.793,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I never see myself moving forward

178
0:06:12.985,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in time. I actually see time

179
0:06:15.017,000 --> 0:06:17,000
moving backward towards me.

180
0:06:17.089,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I can actually visualize

181
0:06:18.489,000 --> 0:06:19,000
my future approaching.

182
0:06:19.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I can dodge what I don't want

183
0:06:21.953,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and pull in what I want.

184
0:06:23.441,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's like a video game obstacle

185
0:06:24.752,000 --> 0:06:26,000
course. And I've gotten better and better

186
0:06:27.238,000 --> 0:06:28,000
at doing this. Even when I make

187
0:06:29.071,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a painting, I actually imagine

188
0:06:31.104,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I'm behind the painting,

189
0:06:33.135,000 --> 0:06:34,000
it already exists, and

190
0:06:34.318,000 --> 0:06:35,000
someone's looking at it,

191
0:06:35.534,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and I see whether they're

192
0:06:36.624,000 --> 0:06:37,000
feeling it from their gut.

193
0:06:38.245,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Are they feeling it from their

194
0:06:39.478,000 --> 0:06:41,000
heart, or is it just a cerebral thing?

195
0:06:42.144,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And it really informs my painting.

196
0:06:44.252,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Even when I do an art show,

197
0:06:45.443,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I really think about, what should

198
0:06:46.467,000 --> 0:06:47,000
people walk away with?

199
0:06:48.019,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I remember when I was 19,

200
0:06:50.955,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I did, I wanted to do my first

201
0:06:53.092,000 --> 0:06:56,000
art exhibition, and I wanted the

202
0:06:56.292,000 --> 0:06:57,000
whole world to know about it.

203
0:06:57.699,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I didn't know TED then,

204
0:06:59.147,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but what I did was I closed

205
0:07:01.148,000 --> 0:07:02,000
my eyes tight, and I started

206
0:07:02.916,000 --> 0:07:04,000
dreaming. I could imagine people

207
0:07:05.188,000 --> 0:07:06,000
coming in, dressed up, looking

208
0:07:06.731,000 --> 0:07:08,000
beautiful, my paintings with all

209
0:07:08.764,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the light, and in my visualization

210
0:07:11.475,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I actually saw a very famous

211
0:07:13.331,000 --> 0:07:15,000
actress launching my show,

212
0:07:15.499,000 --> 0:07:16,000
giving credibility to me.

213
0:07:16.996,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And I woke up from my

214
0:07:19.059,000 --> 0:07:2,000
visualization and I said,

215
0:07:20.316,000 --> 0:07:21,000
who was that? I couldn't tell

216
0:07:22.052,000 --> 0:07:24,000
if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha,

217
0:07:24.291,000 --> 0:07:26,000
two very famous Indian actresses,

218
0:07:26.5,000 --> 0:07:27,000
like the Meryl Streeps of India.

219
0:07:28.347,000 --> 0:07:3,000
As it turned out, next morning

220
0:07:30.707,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I wrote a letter to both of them,

221
0:07:32.427,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and Shabana Azmi replied,

222
0:07:34.38,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and came and launched

223
0:07:36.147,000 --> 0:07:39,000
my very first show 12 years ago.

224
0:07:39.212,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And what a bang it started

225
0:07:41.444,000 --> 0:07:42,000
my career with! You know,

226
0:07:43.244,000 --> 0:07:45,000
when we think of time in this

227
0:07:45.66,000 --> 0:07:47,000
way, we can curate not only the

228
0:07:47.979,000 --> 0:07:5,000
future but also the past.

229
0:07:51.496,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This is a picture of my family,

230
0:07:53.7,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and that is Netra, my wife.

231
0:07:56.323,000 --> 0:07:57,000
She's the co-creator of my

232
0:07:57.955,000 --> 0:07:58,000
200-year plan.

233
0:07:59.436,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Netra's a high school history

234
0:08:01.475,000 --> 0:08:02,000
teacher. I love Netra,

235
0:08:03.419,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but I hate history.

236
0:08:05.236,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I keep saying, "Nets, you live

237
0:08:07.148,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in the past while I'll create

238
0:08:08.795,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the future, and when I'm done,

239
0:08:10.796,000 --> 0:08:11,000
you can study about it."

240
0:08:12.292,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

241
0:08:14.252,000 --> 0:08:15,000
She gave me an indulgent smile,

242
0:08:16.251,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and as punishment, she said,

243
0:08:18.388,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Tomorrow I'm teaching a class

244
0:08:20.123,000 --> 0:08:22,000
on Indian history, and you are

245
0:08:22.284,000 --> 0:08:23,000
sitting in it, and I'm grading you."

246
0:08:23.732,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I'm like, "Oh, God." I went.

247
0:08:26.075,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I actually went and sat in

248
0:08:27.379,000 --> 0:08:29,000
on her class. She started by

249
0:08:29.572,000 --> 0:08:31,000
giving students primary source

250
0:08:31.867,000 --> 0:08:33,000
documents from India, Pakistan,

251
0:08:34.482,000 --> 0:08:36,000
from Britain, and I said,

252
0:08:36.731,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"Wow." Then she asked them to

253
0:08:38.875,000 --> 0:08:39,000
separate fact from bias.

254
0:08:40.827,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I said, "Wow," again.

255
0:08:43.619,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Then she said, "Choose your

256
0:08:46.579,000 --> 0:08:49,000
facts and biases and create an

257
0:08:49.883,000 --> 0:08:51,000
image of your own story

258
0:08:52.162,000 --> 0:08:53,000
of dignity."

259
0:08:53.571,000 --> 0:08:56,000
History as an imaging tool?

260
0:08:56.826,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I was so inspired.

261
0:08:58.459,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I went and created my own

262
0:08:59.819,000 --> 0:09:,000
version of Indian history.

263
0:09:01.396,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I actually included stories from

264
0:09:03.283,000 --> 0:09:04,000
my grandmother.

265
0:09:04.305,000 --> 0:09:05,000
She used to work for the

266
0:09:05.464,000 --> 0:09:06,000
telephone exchange, and she used

267
0:09:07.032,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to actually overhear conversations

268
0:09:08.159,000 --> 0:09:1,000
between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.

269
0:09:10.328,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And she used to hear all

270
0:09:11.904,000 --> 0:09:12,000
kinds of things she shouldn't

271
0:09:13.039,000 --> 0:09:15,000
have heard. But, you know,

272
0:09:15.545,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I include things like that.

273
0:09:16.711,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is my version of Indian history.

274
0:09:19.505,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You know, if this

275
0:09:23.791,000 --> 0:09:25,000
is so, it occurred to me that

276
0:09:25.905,000 --> 0:09:27,000
maybe, just maybe, the primary

277
0:09:28.128,000 --> 0:09:29,000
objective of our brains

278
0:09:29.567,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is to serve our dignity.

279
0:09:32.607,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Go tell Facebook to

280
0:09:34.615,000 --> 0:09:35,000
figure that out!

281
0:09:35.924,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Netra and I don't write our

282
0:09:38.544,000 --> 0:09:39,000
200-year plan for someone else

283
0:09:40.357,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to come and execute it

284
0:09:41.381,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in 150 years. Imagine receiving

285
0:09:43.524,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a parcel saying, from the past,

286
0:09:45.421,000 --> 0:09:46,000
okay now you're supposed to

287
0:09:46.784,000 --> 0:09:46,000
spend the rest of your life

288
0:09:47.749,000 --> 0:09:48,000
doing all of this. No.

289
0:09:49.207,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We actually write it only

290
0:09:50.854,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to set our attitudes right.

291
0:09:53.344,000 --> 0:09:56,000
You know, I used to believe

292
0:09:57.184,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that education is the most

293
0:09:58.584,000 --> 0:09:59,000
important tool to leave

294
0:10:00.065,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a meaningful legacy.

295
0:10:01.522,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Education is great.

296
0:10:03.046,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It really teaches us who

297
0:10:04.695,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we are, and helps us

298
0:10:06.031,000 --> 0:10:07,000
contextualize ourselves

299
0:10:07.35,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in the world, but it's really

300
0:10:09.316,000 --> 0:10:11,000
my creativity that's taught me

301
0:10:11.375,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that I can be much more

302
0:10:13.152,000 --> 0:10:15,000
than what my education told me I am.

303
0:10:15.343,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I'd like to make

304
0:10:16.797,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the argument that creativity is

305
0:10:19.127,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the most important tool we have.

306
0:10:21.558,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It lets us create who we are,

307
0:10:23.744,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and curate what is to come.

308
0:10:25.655,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I like to think -- Thank you.

309
0:10:28.895,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I like to think of myself

310
0:10:30.47,000 --> 0:10:32,000
as a storyteller, where my past

311
0:10:32.806,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and my future are only stories,

312
0:10:35.87,000 --> 0:10:37,000
my stories, waiting to be told

313
0:10:38.159,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and retold. I hope all of you

314
0:10:40.774,000 --> 0:10:41,000
one day get a chance to

315
0:10:42.718,000 --> 0:10:43,000
share and write your own

316
0:10:44.545,000 --> 0:10:45,000
200-year story.

317
0:10:45.91,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Thank you so much.

318
0:10:46.975,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Shukran! (Applause)

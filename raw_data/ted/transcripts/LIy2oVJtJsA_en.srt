1
0:00:12.982,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Nine years ago, I worked

2
0:00:14.602,000 --> 0:00:16,000
for the U.S. government in Iraq,

3
0:00:16.799,000 --> 0:00:19,000
helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.

4
0:00:19.928,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I was there, and I worked in that job

5
0:00:22.565,000 --> 0:00:23,000
because I believe that technology

6
0:00:24.415,000 --> 0:00:26,000
can improve people's lives.

7
0:00:27.064,000 --> 0:00:29,000
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper

8
0:00:29.999,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,

9
0:00:32.819,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and he said to me, "You Americans,

10
0:00:35.558,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you can put a man on the moon,

11
0:00:36.909,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but when I get home tonight,

12
0:00:38.454,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I won't be able to turn on my lights."

13
0:00:41.31,000 --> 0:00:42,000
At the time, the U.S. government had spent

14
0:00:42.967,000 --> 0:00:44,000
more than two billion dollars

15
0:00:45.327,000 --> 0:00:47,000
on electricity reconstruction.

16
0:00:47.684,000 --> 0:00:5,000
How do you ensure technology reaches users?

17
0:00:50.856,000 --> 0:00:51,000
How do you put it in their hands

18
0:00:52.836,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so that it is useful?

19
0:00:55.072,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So those are the questions that my colleagues and I

20
0:00:58.116,000 --> 0:01:,000
at D-Rev ask ourselves.

21
0:01:00.229,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.

22
0:01:03.377,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I took over the organization four years ago

23
0:01:05.971,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and really focused it on developing products

24
0:01:08.272,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that actually reach users,

25
0:01:10.46,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and not just any users,

26
0:01:11.946,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but customers who live on less than four dollars a day.

27
0:01:16.001,000 --> 0:01:17,000
One of the key areas we've been working on recently

28
0:01:17.909,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious

29
0:01:20.422,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that medical devices have something in common

30
0:01:22.554,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with Iraq's electricity grid then,

31
0:01:25.12,000 --> 0:01:27,000
there are some commonalities.

32
0:01:27.249,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Despite the advanced technology,

33
0:01:29.958,000 --> 0:01:31,000
it's not reaching the people who need it most.

34
0:01:32.726,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on,

35
0:01:35.134,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee

36
0:01:38.041,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for above-knee amputees.

37
0:01:40.197,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization,

38
0:01:43.497,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,

39
0:01:46.091,000 --> 0:01:47,000
came to the Bay Area and they said,

40
0:01:47.56,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"We need a better knee."

41
0:01:50.53,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Chances are, if you're living on less than four dollars a day,

42
0:01:53.678,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and you're an amputee,

43
0:01:55.555,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.

44
0:01:57.729,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Most people think it's land mines,

45
0:01:59.142,000 --> 0:02:,000
but it's a vehicle accident.

46
0:02:00.748,000 --> 0:02:01,000
You're walking by the side of the road

47
0:02:02.604,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and you're hit by a truck,

48
0:02:04.028,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or you're trying to to jump on a moving train,

49
0:02:05.889,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.

50
0:02:09.873,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And the reality is that if you don't have much money,

51
0:02:13.038,000 --> 0:02:15,000
like this young named Kamal right here,

52
0:02:15.038,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the option you really have

53
0:02:17.242,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is a bamboo staff to get around.

54
0:02:19.806,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And how big a problem is this?

55
0:02:22.289,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There's over three million amputees every year

56
0:02:25.215,000 --> 0:02:28,000
who need a new or replacement knee.

57
0:02:28.504,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And what are their options?

58
0:02:30.373,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This is a high-end. This is what we'd call a "smart knee."

59
0:02:32.972,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's got a microprocessor inside.

60
0:02:34.99,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It can pretty much do anything,

61
0:02:37.075,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but it's 20,000 dollars,

62
0:02:38.772,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and to give you a sense of who wears this,

63
0:02:40.978,000 --> 0:02:43,000
veterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq

64
0:02:44.221,000 --> 0:02:46,000
would be fit with something like this.

65
0:02:46.547,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This is a low-end titanium knee.

66
0:02:49.064,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means

67
0:02:51.541,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,

68
0:02:53.75,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that mimics a natural human knee.

69
0:02:56.3,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive

70
0:02:58.703,000 --> 0:03:,000
for people like Kamal.

71
0:03:01.087,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.

72
0:03:03.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This is a knee that's been designed specifically

73
0:03:05.511,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for poor people.

74
0:03:07.187,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And while you have affordability,

75
0:03:09.02,000 --> 0:03:1,000
you've lost on functionality.

76
0:03:10.915,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The mechanism here is a single axis,

77
0:03:13.566,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and a single axis is like a door hinge.

78
0:03:15.815,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So you can think about how unstable that would be.

79
0:03:18.01,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And this is the type of mechanism

80
0:03:20.005,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee,

81
0:03:23.894,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like,

82
0:03:26.251,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because I'm showing you all these knees

83
0:03:27.59,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I imagine it's hard to think how it all fits together.

84
0:03:29.966,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So at the top you have a socket,

85
0:03:32.008,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and this fits over someone's residual limb,

86
0:03:33.954,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.

87
0:03:36.514,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And then you have the knee,

88
0:03:37.698,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and here I've got a single axis on the knee

89
0:03:39.416,000 --> 0:03:4,000
so you can see how it rotates,

90
0:03:41.128,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and then a pylon, and then a foot.

91
0:03:45.091,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And we've been able to develop a knee,

92
0:03:47.634,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a polycentric knee, so that type of knee

93
0:03:49.996,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,

94
0:03:52.571,000 --> 0:03:54,000
for 80 dollars retail.

95
0:03:55.314,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Applause)

96
0:03:58.878,000 --> 0:04:,000
But the key is, you can have this great invention,

97
0:04:01.432,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you can have this great design, but how do you get it

98
0:04:03.418,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to the people who most need it?

99
0:04:05.19,000 --> 0:04:08,000
How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?

100
0:04:08.496,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,

101
0:04:11.432,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and we looked at three things that we really believe

102
0:04:13.816,000 --> 0:04:16,000
gets technologies to customers, to users,

103
0:04:17.788,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to people who need it.

104
0:04:19.164,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class.

105
0:04:21.885,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It needs to perform on par

106
0:04:23.536,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or better than the best products on the market.

107
0:04:26.381,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Regardless of your income level,

108
0:04:28.527,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you want the most beautiful,

109
0:04:30.065,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the best product that there is.

110
0:04:32.753,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I'm going to show you a video now

111
0:04:36.242,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.

112
0:04:37.888,000 --> 0:04:38,000
He's wearing the same knee system here

113
0:04:39.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
with a single axis knee.

114
0:04:41.406,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.

115
0:04:43.498,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And you'll notice that he's struggling with stability as he's walking.

116
0:04:47.313,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And something that's not obvious, that you can't see,

117
0:04:49.968,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is that it's psychologically draining

118
0:04:52.555,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.

119
0:04:56.337,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now this is a video of Kamal.

120
0:04:58.041,000 --> 0:05:,000
You remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff.

121
0:05:00.774,000 --> 0:05:02,000
He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,

122
0:05:03.482,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.

123
0:05:06.582,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And you can see his stability is much better.

124
0:05:11.849,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So world class isn't just about technical performance.

125
0:05:14.968,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's also about human performance.

126
0:05:18.308,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And most medical devices, we've learned,

127
0:05:20.166,000 --> 0:05:22,000
as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,

128
0:05:22.694,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for wealthier economies.

129
0:05:24.357,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But the reality is our users, our customers,

130
0:05:27.619,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.

131
0:05:30.172,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.

132
0:05:33.014,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion

133
0:05:35.762,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of almost any other knee on the market.

134
0:05:39.846,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So the second thing we learned, and this leads

135
0:05:41.576,000 --> 0:05:43,000
into my second point, which is that we believe

136
0:05:43.836,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that products need to be designed to be user-centric.

137
0:05:46.553,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say

138
0:05:49.153,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you need to be user-obsessed.

139
0:05:51.053,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about,

140
0:05:53.773,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but everyone who interacts with the product,

141
0:05:55.749,000 --> 0:05:57,000
so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,

142
0:05:58.463,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but also the context in which the knee is being fit.

143
0:06:01.631,000 --> 0:06:02,000
What is the local market like?

144
0:06:03.215,000 --> 0:06:04,000
How do all these components get to the clinic?

145
0:06:05.133,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.

146
0:06:07.455,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Everything that goes into ensuring

147
0:06:09.558,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that this product gets to the end user,

148
0:06:11.541,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.

149
0:06:15.962,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So I wanted to show you some of the iterations

150
0:06:17.828,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,

151
0:06:22.421,000 --> 0:06:23,000
so this is it right here.

152
0:06:24.242,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Clicking)

153
0:06:25.968,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Notice anything about it?

154
0:06:28.186,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It clicks.

155
0:06:30.747,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We'd seen that users had actually modified it.

156
0:06:33.613,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So do you see that black strip right there?

157
0:06:37.125,000 --> 0:06:39,000
That's a homemade noise dampener.

158
0:06:40.117,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We also saw that our users had modified it

159
0:06:42.335,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in other ways.

160
0:06:43.769,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You can see there that that particular amputee,

161
0:06:45.559,000 --> 0:06:47,000
he had wrapped bandages around the knee.

162
0:06:47.788,000 --> 0:06:48,000
He'd made a cosmesis.

163
0:06:49.512,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And if you look at the knee,

164
0:06:51.708,000 --> 0:06:54,000
it's got those pointy edges, right?

165
0:06:55.162,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt

166
0:06:57.365,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or a sari, it's really obvious

167
0:06:59.625,000 --> 0:07:,000
that you're wearing a prosthetic limb,

168
0:07:01.221,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled,

169
0:07:05.413,000 --> 0:07:07,000
people are particularly acute about this.

170
0:07:08.37,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did.

171
0:07:10.686,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We did a lot of iterations, not just around this, but some other things.

172
0:07:13.601,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But here we have the version three, the ReMotion Knee,

173
0:07:16.029,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but if you look in here, you can see

174
0:07:17.848,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the noise dampener. It's quieter.

175
0:07:22.566,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.

176
0:07:26.219,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We made it thinner.

177
0:07:27.651,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And something that's not obvious is that we

178
0:07:29.359,000 --> 0:07:32,000
designed it for mass production.

179
0:07:32.56,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And this goes into my last point.

180
0:07:34.256,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We really, truly believe that if a product

181
0:07:36.227,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,

182
0:07:38.564,000 --> 0:07:39,000
it needs to be market-driven,

183
0:07:40.399,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and market-driven means that products are sold.

184
0:07:43.644,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.

185
0:07:46.767,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Our product needs to be designed to offer value

186
0:07:48.98,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to the end user.

187
0:07:50.281,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It also has to be designed to be very affordable.

188
0:07:52.46,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But a product that is valued by a customer

189
0:07:54.634,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is used by a customer,

190
0:07:56.345,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and use is what creates impact.

191
0:07:58.518,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And we believe that as designers,

192
0:08:00.277,000 --> 0:08:03,000
it holds us accountable to our customers.

193
0:08:03.507,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And with centralized manufacturing,

194
0:08:06.123,000 --> 0:08:08,000
you can control the quality control,

195
0:08:08.15,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and you can hit that $80 price point

196
0:08:09.878,000 --> 0:08:11,000
with profit margins built in.

197
0:08:12.368,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And now, those profit margins are critical,

198
0:08:14.524,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because if you want to scale, if you want to reach

199
0:08:16.193,000 --> 0:08:18,000
all the people in the world who possibly need a knee,

200
0:08:18.452,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it needs to be economically sustainable.

201
0:08:21.609,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.

202
0:08:24.205,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We have fit over 5,000 amputees,

203
0:08:27.781,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course,

204
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is, does it improve lives?

205
0:08:31.913,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Well, the standard is, is someone

206
0:08:33.649,000 --> 0:08:35,000
still wearing their knee six months later?

207
0:08:36.174,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The industry average is about 65 percent.

208
0:08:38.877,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Ours is 79 percent,

209
0:08:41.169,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and we're hoping to get that higher.

210
0:08:44.113,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.

211
0:08:47.126,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is where we want to get, though,

212
0:08:48.736,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in the next three years.

213
0:08:50.254,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We'll double the impact in 2015,

214
0:08:52.754,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and we'll double it each of the following years after that.

215
0:08:55.872,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But then we hit a new challenge,

216
0:08:57.705,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and that's the number of skilled prosthetists

217
0:08:59.724,000 --> 0:09:02,000
who are able to fit knees.

218
0:09:02.832,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So I want to end with a story of Pournima.

219
0:09:05.513,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Pournima was 18 years old

220
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg,

221
0:09:10.028,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and she traveled 12 hours by train

222
0:09:13.469,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,

223
0:09:15.896,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and while all of the amputees who wear our knees

224
0:09:18.489,000 --> 0:09:2,000
affect us as the designers,

225
0:09:20.665,000 --> 0:09:24,000
she's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman,

226
0:09:24.932,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because she was in school,

227
0:09:26.496,000 --> 0:09:28,000
she had just started school to study engineering.

228
0:09:29.22,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And she said, "Well, now that I can walk again,

229
0:09:31.375,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I can go back and complete my studies."

230
0:09:33.783,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And to me she represents the next generation

231
0:09:36.953,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of engineers solving problems

232
0:09:39.985,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and ensuring meaningful technologies

233
0:09:42.43,000 --> 0:09:43,000
reach their users.

234
0:09:44.214,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So thank you.

235
0:09:46.252,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Applause)

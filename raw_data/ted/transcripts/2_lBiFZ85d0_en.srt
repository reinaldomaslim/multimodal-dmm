0:00:12.492,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Six months ago, I got an email

2
0:00:14.673,000 --> 0:00:15,000
from a man in Israel

3
0:00:16.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
who had read one of my books,

4
0:00:17.461,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and the email said,

5
0:00:18.964,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"You don't know me,

6
0:00:20.971,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but I'm your 12th cousin."

7
0:00:23.443,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And it said, "I have a family tree

8
0:00:25.82,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with 80,000 people on it, including you,

9
0:00:29.724,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Karl Marx,

10
0:00:30.878,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and several European aristocrats."

11
0:00:33.478,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Now I did not know what to make of this.

12
0:00:35.88,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Part of me was like, okay,

13
0:00:38.231,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when's he going to ask me to wire

14
0:00:40.191,000 --> 0:00:43,000
10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?

15
0:00:43.888,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I also thought, 80,000 relatives,

16
0:00:47.576,000 --> 0:00:48,000
do I want that?

17
0:00:48.854,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I have enough trouble with some of the ones

18
0:00:50.672,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I have already.

19
0:00:52.109,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I won't name names, but you know who you are.

20
0:00:55.775,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But another part of me said, this is remarkable.

21
0:00:59.024,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.

22
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,

23
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and that's four Madison Square Gardens

24
0:01:08.697,000 --> 0:01:09,000
full of cousins.

25
0:01:10.412,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And some of them are going to be great,

26
0:01:13.349,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and some of them are going to be irritating,

27
0:01:15.679,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but they're all related to me.

28
0:01:18.495,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,

29
0:01:22.366,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which I always thought was a very staid and proper field,

30
0:01:25.766,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but it turns out it's going through a fascinating

31
0:01:28.691,000 --> 0:01:3,000
revolution, and a controversial one.

32
0:01:31.184,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Partly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,

33
0:01:34.95,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but partly, it's because of the Internet.

34
0:01:38.9,000 --> 0:01:39,000
There are sites that now take

35
0:01:40.66,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the Wikipedia approach to family trees,

36
0:01:43.827,000 --> 0:01:45,000
collaboration and crowdsourcing,

37
0:01:46.18,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and what you do is,

38
0:01:47.358,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you load your family tree on,

39
0:01:50.24,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and then these sites search

40
0:01:51.72,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree

41
0:01:54.402,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,

42
0:01:56.882,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and if it is, then you can combine,

43
0:02:00.115,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and then you combine and combine and combine

44
0:02:02.01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
until you get these massive,

45
0:02:03.911,000 --> 0:02:04,000
mega-family trees

46
0:02:05.761,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with thousands of people on them,

47
0:02:08.262,000 --> 0:02:09,000
or even millions.

48
0:02:09.677,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I'm on something on Geni called

49
0:02:12.004,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the world family tree,

50
0:02:13.93,000 --> 0:02:15,000
which has no less than a jaw-dropping

51
0:02:16.487,000 --> 0:02:19,000
75 million people.

52
0:02:20.017,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So that's 75 million people connected by blood

53
0:02:23.857,000 --> 0:02:25,000
or marriage, sometimes both.

54
0:02:26.337,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:28.904,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.

56
0:02:33.089,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm on it. Many of you are on it,

57
0:02:35.466,000 --> 0:02:36,000
whether you know it or not,

58
0:02:37.17,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and you can see the links.

59
0:02:39.634,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.

60
0:02:44.226,000 --> 0:02:45,000
She has no idea I exist,

61
0:02:46.109,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but we are officially cousins.

62
0:02:48.8,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We have just 17 links between us.

63
0:02:52.996,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And there's my cousin Barack Obama.

64
0:02:55.689,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:56.881,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband's

66
0:03:00.506,000 --> 0:03:03,000
father's wife's seventh great-nephew,

67
0:03:04.014,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so practically my old brother.

68
0:03:09.079,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And my cousin, of course,

69
0:03:10.602,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the actor Kevin Bacon --

70
0:03:11.919,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter) —

71
0:03:13.571,000 --> 0:03:15,000
who is my first cousin's twice removed's

72
0:03:16.535,000 --> 0:03:18,000
wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's

73
0:03:18.927,000 --> 0:03:19,000
niece's husband.

74
0:03:20.137,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So six degrees of Kevin Bacon,

75
0:03:22.272,000 --> 0:03:26,000
plus or minus several degrees.

76
0:03:26.391,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, I'm not boasting, because all of you

77
0:03:28.772,000 --> 0:03:3,000
have famous people and historical figures

78
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in your tree, because we are all connected,

79
0:03:34.667,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and 75 million may seem like a lot,

80
0:03:37.83,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but in a few years, it's quite likely

81
0:03:40.556,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we will have a family tree

82
0:03:42.069,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.

83
0:03:46.82,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But does it really matter?

84
0:03:48.613,000 --> 0:03:49,000
What's the importance?

85
0:03:49.955,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And I do think it is important,

86
0:03:51.633,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.

87
0:03:54.111,000 --> 0:03:56,000
First, it's got scientific value.

88
0:03:56.931,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is an unprecedented history of the human race,

89
0:04:00.545,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and it's giving us valuable data

90
0:04:03.976,000 --> 0:04:05,000
about how diseases are inherited,

91
0:04:06.125,000 --> 0:04:07,000
how people migrate,

92
0:04:07.993,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now

93
0:04:10.913,000 --> 0:04:12,000
studying the world family tree.

94
0:04:13.593,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Number two, it brings history alive.

95
0:04:16.479,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,

96
0:04:19.94,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so I told my seven-year-old son that,

97
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and he was totally engaged.

98
0:04:24.846,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy

99
0:04:28.213,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with weird hair.

100
0:04:29.423,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He's Uncle Albert. (Laughter)

101
0:04:33.58,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And my son wanted to know,

102
0:04:35.14,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"What did he say? What is E = MC squared?"

103
0:04:37.297,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Also, it's not all good news.

104
0:04:39.356,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,

105
0:04:43.343,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but I will say that's on my wife's side.

106
0:04:45.96,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

107
0:04:48.648,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey.

108
0:04:51.243,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Number three, interconnectedness.

109
0:04:54.132,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We all come from the same ancestor,

110
0:04:57.495,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and you don't have to believe the literal Bible version,

111
0:05:00.063,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam

112
0:05:04.151,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and mitochondrial Eve,

113
0:05:07.004,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.

114
0:05:10.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We all have a bit of their DNA in us.

115
0:05:13.373,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They are our great-great-great-great-great-great --

116
0:05:16.19,000 --> 0:05:18,000
continue that for about 7,000 times --

117
0:05:18.93,000 --> 0:05:19,000
grandparents,

118
0:05:20.745,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and so that means we literally all are

119
0:05:23.391,000 --> 0:05:25,000
biological cousins as well,

120
0:05:25.546,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and estimates vary, but probably

121
0:05:28.102,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the farthest cousin you have on Earth

122
0:05:30.804,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is about a 50th cousin.

123
0:05:33.259,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.

124
0:05:37.44,000 --> 0:05:39,000
If you have kids, and they have kids,

125
0:05:40.14,000 --> 0:05:43,000
look how quickly the descendants accumulate.

126
0:05:43.605,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So in 10, 12 generations,

127
0:05:45.298,000 --> 0:05:47,000
you're going to have thousands of offspring,

128
0:05:47.429,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and millions of offspring.

129
0:05:48.946,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Number four, a kinder world.

130
0:05:50.935,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now, I know that there are family feuds.

131
0:05:53.424,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I have three sons, so I see how they fight.

132
0:05:55.719,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But I think that there's also a human bias

133
0:05:58.385,000 --> 0:06:,000
to treat your family a little better than strangers.

134
0:06:00.911,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,

135
0:06:04.735,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because they're going to have to realize

136
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that they are cousins with thousands of people

137
0:06:11.77,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in whatever ethnic group they happen

138
0:06:13.521,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to have issues with,

139
0:06:15.783,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and I think you look back at history,

140
0:06:17.668,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other

141
0:06:20.669,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is because one group thinks another group is sub-human,

142
0:06:23.575,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and you can't do that anymore.

143
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We're not just part of the same species.

144
0:06:26.41,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We're part of the same family.

145
0:06:28.177,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We share 99.9 percent of our DNA.

146
0:06:31.813,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now the final one is number five,

147
0:06:34.114,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a democratizing effect.

148
0:06:35.793,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Some genealogy has an elitist strain,

149
0:06:39.25,000 --> 0:06:4,000
like people say, "Oh, I'm descended

150
0:06:41.24,000 --> 0:06:42,000
from Mary Queen of Scots

151
0:06:42.511,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and you're not, so you cannot join my country club."

152
0:06:45.718,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But that's really going to be hard to do now,

153
0:06:48.659,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because everyone is related.

154
0:06:50.09,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots --

155
0:06:52.778,000 --> 0:06:55,000
by marriage, but still.

156
0:06:56.131,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So it's really a fascinating time

157
0:06:59.627,000 --> 0:07:,000
in the history of family,

158
0:07:01.183,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because it's changing so fast.

159
0:07:04.69,000 --> 0:07:06,000
There is gay marriage and sperm donors

160
0:07:07.265,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale,

161
0:07:12.185,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and this makes some of my more conservative cousins

162
0:07:14.411,000 --> 0:07:15,000
a little nervous,

163
0:07:16.02,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but I actually think it's a good thing.

164
0:07:17.824,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I think the more inclusive the idea of family is,

165
0:07:21.653,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the better,

166
0:07:22.68,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because then you have more potential caretakers,

167
0:07:24.784,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed

168
0:07:29.099,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Hillary Clinton says --

169
0:07:31.226,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter) —

170
0:07:32.97,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it takes a village.

171
0:07:34.299,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So I have all these hundreds and thousands,

172
0:07:39.562,000 --> 0:07:4,000
millions of new cousins.

173
0:07:40.68,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I thought, what can I do with this information?

174
0:07:43.421,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And that's when I decided,

175
0:07:45.277,000 --> 0:07:47,000
why not throw a party?

176
0:07:47.516,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So that's what I'm doing.

177
0:07:49.752,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And you're all invited.

178
0:07:52.312,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Next year, next summer,

179
0:07:54.21,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I will be hosting what I hope is

180
0:07:56.141,000 --> 0:08:,000
the biggest and best family reunion in history.

181
0:08:00.619,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Applause)

182
0:08:01.651,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Thank you. I want you there.

183
0:08:04.053,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I want you there.

184
0:08:05.165,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,

185
0:08:07.639,000 --> 0:08:09,000
which is a great venue,

186
0:08:09.921,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,

187
0:08:13.701,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which is, I think, very appropriate,

188
0:08:17.346,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because I see this as a family reunion

189
0:08:19.576,000 --> 0:08:2,000
meets a world's fair.

190
0:08:20.994,000 --> 0:08:22,000
There's going to be exhibits and food, music.

191
0:08:23.935,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Paul McCartney is 11 steps away,

192
0:08:26.244,000 --> 0:08:29,000
so I'm hoping he brings his guitar.

193
0:08:29.844,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.

194
0:08:32.579,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And there is going to be a day of speakers,

195
0:08:34.97,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of fascinating cousins.

196
0:08:36.971,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's early, but I've already,

197
0:08:38.153,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I've got some lined up.

198
0:08:40.025,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps

199
0:08:42.749,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.

200
0:08:45.137,000 --> 0:08:48,000
He was a former member of the Obama administration.

201
0:08:48.376,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And on the other side of the political spectrum,

202
0:08:51.2,000 --> 0:08:54,000
George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,

203
0:08:54.332,000 --> 0:08:55,000
he has agreed to participate,

204
0:08:56.187,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and Nick Kroll, the comedian,

205
0:08:58.623,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and Dr. Oz, and many more to come.

206
0:09:02.122,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And, of course, the most important is that you,

207
0:09:06.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I want you guys there,

208
0:09:08.466,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org

209
0:09:11.901,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and figure out how you're on the family tree,

210
0:09:14.996,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because these are big issues, family and tribe,

211
0:09:19.189,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and I don't know all the answers,

212
0:09:21.907,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but I have a lot of smart relatives,

213
0:09:24.756,000 --> 0:09:25,000
including you guys,

214
0:09:26.337,000 --> 0:09:29,000
so together, I think we can figure it out.

215
0:09:29.604,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Only together can we solve these big problems.

216
0:09:32.259,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So from cousin to cousin,

217
0:09:34.289,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I thank you. I can't wait to see you.

218
0:09:36.681,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Goodbye.

219
0:09:38.582,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

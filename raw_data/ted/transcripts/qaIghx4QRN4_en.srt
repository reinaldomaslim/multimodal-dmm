1
0:00:13.2,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I saw a UFO once.

2
0:00:15.4,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was eight or nine,

3
0:00:17.32,000 --> 0:00:2,000
playing in the street with a friend who was a couple of years older,

4
0:00:20.68,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and we saw a featureless silver disc hovering over the houses.

5
0:00:25.36,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We watched it for a few seconds,

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and then it shot away incredibly quickly.

7
0:00:30.44,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Even as a kid,

8
0:00:31.68,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I got angry it was ignoring the laws of physics.

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We ran inside to tell the grown-ups,

10
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and they were skeptical --

11
0:00:39.04,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you'd be skeptical too, right?

12
0:00:42.12,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I got my own back a few years later:

13
0:00:43.88,000 --> 0:00:44,000
one of those grown-ups told me,

14
0:00:45.4,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"Last night I saw a flying saucer.

15
0:00:47.24,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was coming out of the pub after a few drinks."

16
0:00:49.84,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I stopped him there. I said, "I can explain that sighting."

17
0:00:52.68,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:53.72,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Psychologists have shown we can't trust our brains

19
0:00:56.64,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to tell the truth.

20
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's easy to fool ourselves.

21
0:00:59.72,000 --> 0:01:,000
I saw something,

22
0:01:01.36,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but what's more likely --

23
0:01:02.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that I saw an alien spacecraft,

24
0:01:04.8,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or that my brain misinterpreted the data my eyes were giving it?

25
0:01:10.2,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Ever since though I've wondered:

26
0:01:11.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Why don't we see flying saucers flitting around?

27
0:01:14.84,000 --> 0:01:15,000
At the very least,

28
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:18,000
why don't we see life out there in the cosmos?

29
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's a puzzle,

30
0:01:20.2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I've discussed it with dozens of experts

31
0:01:22.68,000 --> 0:01:25,000
from different disciplines over the past three decades.

32
0:01:25.84,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And there's no consensus.

33
0:01:27.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Frank Drake began searching for alien signals back in 1960 --

34
0:01:32.08,000 --> 0:01:33,000
so far, nothing.

35
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And with each passing year,

36
0:01:35.44,000 --> 0:01:36,000
this nonobservation,

37
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:42,000
this lack of evidence for any alien activity gets more puzzling

38
0:01:42.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because we should see them, shouldn't we?

39
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The universe is 13.8 billion years old,

40
0:01:50.92,000 --> 0:01:51,000
give or take.

41
0:01:52.2,000 --> 0:01:55,000
If we represent the age of the universe by one year,

42
0:01:55.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
then our species came into being about 12 minutes before midnight,

43
0:02:00.32,000 --> 0:02:01,000
31st December.

44
0:02:02.12,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Western civilization has existed for a few seconds.

45
0:02:05.8,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Extraterrestrial civilizations could have started in the summer months.

46
0:02:10.6,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Imagine a summer civilization

47
0:02:13.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
developing a level of technology more advanced than ours,

48
0:02:17.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but tech based on accepted physics though,

49
0:02:19.8,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'm not talking wormholes or warp drives -- whatever --

50
0:02:23.76,000 --> 0:02:27,000
just an extrapolation of the sort of tech that TED celebrates.

51
0:02:28.88,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That civilization could program self-replicating probes

52
0:02:32.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to visit every planetary system in the galaxy.

53
0:02:35.84,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If they launched the first probes just after midnight one August day,

54
0:02:41.2,000 --> 0:02:43,000
then before breakfast same day,

55
0:02:43.48,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they could have colonized the galaxy.

56
0:02:46.64,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Intergalactic colonization isn't much more difficult,

57
0:02:49.24,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it just takes longer.

58
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:53,000
A civilization from any one of millions of galaxies

59
0:02:54.04,000 --> 0:02:56,000
could have colonized our galaxy.

60
0:02:56.96,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Seems far-fetched?

61
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Maybe it is,

62
0:02:59.96,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but wouldn't aliens engage in some recognizable activity --

63
0:03:05.08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
put worldlets around a star to capture free sunlight,

64
0:03:09.36,000 --> 0:03:12,000
collaborate on a Wikipedia Galactica,

65
0:03:12.56,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or just shout out to the universe, "We're here"?

66
0:03:16.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So where is everybody?

67
0:03:18.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's a puzzle because we do expect these civilizations to exist, don't we?

68
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:27,000
After all, there could be a trillion planets in the galaxy --

69
0:03:27.4,000 --> 0:03:28,000
maybe more.

70
0:03:29.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You don't need any special knowledge to consider this question,

71
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and I've explored it with lots of people over the years.

72
0:03:37.92,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I've found they often frame their thinking

73
0:03:40.92,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in terms of the barriers that would need to be cleared

74
0:03:44.04,000 --> 0:03:48,000
if a planet is to host a communicative civilization.

75
0:03:49.12,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And they usually identify four key barriers.

76
0:03:52.96,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Habitability --

77
0:03:54.36,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that's the first barrier.

78
0:03:55.8,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We need a terrestrial planet in that just right "Goldilocks zone,"

79
0:04:00.44,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where water flows as a liquid.

80
0:04:03.4,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They're out there.

81
0:04:04.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In 2016, astronomers confirmed there's a planet in the habitable zone

82
0:04:09.28,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of the closest star,

83
0:04:10.76,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Proxima Centauri --

84
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so close that Breakthrough Starshot project plans to send probes there.

85
0:04:17.64,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We'd become a starfaring species.

86
0:04:21.48,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But not all worlds are habitable.

87
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Some will be too close to a star and they'll fry,

88
0:04:25.48,000 --> 0:04:27,000
some will be too far away and they'll freeze.

89
0:04:28.8,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Abiogenesis --

90
0:04:30.04,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the creation of life from nonlife --

91
0:04:31.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that's the second barrier.

92
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The basic building blocks of life aren't unique to Earth:

93
0:04:37.92,000 --> 0:04:39,000
amino acids have been found in comets,

94
0:04:40.68,000 --> 0:04:43,000
complex organic molecules in interstellar dust clouds,

95
0:04:43.8,000 --> 0:04:45,000
water in exoplanetary systems.

96
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The ingredients are there,

97
0:04:48.44,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we just don't know how they combine to create life,

98
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and presumably there will be worlds on which life doesn't start.

99
0:04:55.84,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The development of technological civilization is a third barrier.

100
0:05:00.6,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Some say we already share our planet with alien intelligences.

101
0:05:05.4,000 --> 0:05:09,000
A 2011 study showed that elephants can cooperate to solve problems.

102
0:05:10.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
A 2010 study showed

103
0:05:12.4,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that an octopus in captivity can recognize different humans.

104
0:05:17.36,000 --> 0:05:2,000
2017 studies show that ravens can plan for future events --

105
0:05:21.28,000 --> 0:05:23,000
wonderful, clever creatures --

106
0:05:24.04,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but they can't contemplate the Breakthrough Starshot project,

107
0:05:27.28,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and if we vanished today,

108
0:05:29.56,000 --> 0:05:31,000
they wouldn't go on to implement Breakthrough Starshot --

109
0:05:32.44,000 --> 0:05:33,000
why should they?

110
0:05:33.84,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Evolution doesn't have space travel as an end goal.

111
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
There will be worlds where life doesn't give rise to advanced technology.

112
0:05:43.04,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Communication across space -- that's a fourth barrier.

113
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Maybe advanced civilizations choose to explore inner space

114
0:05:49.72,000 --> 0:05:51,000
rather than outer space,

115
0:05:52.08,000 --> 0:05:55,000
or engineer at small distances rather than large.

116
0:05:56.6,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Or maybe they just don't want to risk an encounter

117
0:05:59.48,000 --> 0:06:03,000
with a potentially more advanced and hostile neighbor.

118
0:06:03.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
There'll be worlds where, for whatever reason,

119
0:06:05.84,000 --> 0:06:09,000
civilizations either stay silent or don't spend long trying to communicate.

120
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:14,000
As for the height of the barriers,

121
0:06:14.72,000 --> 0:06:16,000
your guess is as good as anyone's.

122
0:06:18.08,000 --> 0:06:19,000
In my experience,

123
0:06:19.36,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when people sit down and do the math,

124
0:06:21.44,000 --> 0:06:25,000
they typically conclude there are thousands of civilizations in the galaxy.

125
0:06:27.64,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But then we're back to the puzzle: Where is everybody?

126
0:06:32.055,000 --> 0:06:33,000
By definition,

127
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:35,000
UFOs -- including the one I saw --

128
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
are unidentified.

129
0:06:37.12,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We can't simply infer they're spacecraft.

130
0:06:40.88,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You can still have some fun playing with the idea aliens are here.

131
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Some say a summer civilization did colonize the galaxy

132
0:06:48.88,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and seeded Earth with life ...

133
0:06:51.8,000 --> 0:06:53,000
others, that we're living in a cosmic wilderness preserve --

134
0:06:54.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
a zoo.

135
0:06:56.48,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Yet others --

136
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
that we're living in a simulation.

137
0:07:00.2,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Programmers just haven't revealed the aliens yet.

138
0:07:03.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Most of my colleagues though argue that E.T. is out there,

139
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we just need to keep looking,

140
0:07:09.68,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and this makes sense.

141
0:07:11.28,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Space is vast.

142
0:07:13.08,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Identifying a signal is hard,

143
0:07:15.92,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and we haven't been looking that long.

144
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Without doubt, we should spend more on the search.

145
0:07:22.32,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's about understanding our place in the universe.

146
0:07:25.68,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's too important a question to ignore.

147
0:07:29.84,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But there's an obvious answer:

148
0:07:31.96,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we're alone.

149
0:07:33.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's just us.

150
0:07:34.92,000 --> 0:07:37,000
There could be a trillion planets in the galaxy.

151
0:07:38.44,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Is it plausible we're the only creatures capable of contemplating this question?

152
0:07:43.84,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Well, yes, because in this context,

153
0:07:46.48,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we don't know whether a trillion is a big number.

154
0:07:50.04,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In 2000, Peter Ward and Don Brownlee proposed the Rare Earth idea.

155
0:07:55.36,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Remember those four barriers

156
0:07:57.2,000 --> 0:08:,000
that people use to estimate the number of civilizations?

157
0:08:01.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Ward and Brownlee said there might be more.

158
0:08:03.84,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Let's look at one possible barrier.

159
0:08:05.56,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's a recent suggestion by David Waltham,

160
0:08:08.24,000 --> 0:08:09,000
a geophysicist.

161
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
This is my very simplified version

162
0:08:12.48,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of Dave's much more sophisticated argument.

163
0:08:16.24,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We are able to be here now

164
0:08:18.28,000 --> 0:08:2,000
because Earth's previous inhabitants enjoyed

165
0:08:20.96,000 --> 0:08:22,000
four billion years of good weather --

166
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
ups and downs but more or less clement.

167
0:08:26.96,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But long-term climate stability is strange,

168
0:08:29.48,000 --> 0:08:31,000
if only because astronomical influences

169
0:08:31.92,000 --> 0:08:35,000
can push a planet towards freezing or frying.

170
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
There's a hint our moon has helped,

171
0:08:38.2,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and that's interesting

172
0:08:40.4,000 --> 0:08:41,000
because the prevailing theory is

173
0:08:42.08,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that the moon came into being when Theia,

174
0:08:44.6,000 --> 0:08:45,000
a body the size of Mars,

175
0:08:46.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
crashed into a newly formed Earth.

176
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The outcome of that crash could have been a quite different Earth-Moon system.

177
0:08:54.12,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We ended up with a large moon

178
0:08:56.4,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and that permitted Earth to have both a stable axial tilt

179
0:09:00.28,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and a slow rotation rate.

180
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Both factors influence climate

181
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and the suggestion is that they've helped moderate climate change.

182
0:09:09.44,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Great for us, right?

183
0:09:11.36,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But Waltham showed that if the moon were just a few miles bigger,

184
0:09:15.12,000 --> 0:09:16,000
things would be different.

185
0:09:16.76,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Earth's spin axis would now wander chaotically.

186
0:09:20.12,000 --> 0:09:22,000
There'd be episodes of rapid climate change --

187
0:09:23.04,000 --> 0:09:25,000
not good for complex life.

188
0:09:25.44,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The moon is just the right size:

189
0:09:27.68,000 --> 0:09:3,000
big but not too big.

190
0:09:30.76,000 --> 0:09:32,000
A "Goldilocks" moon around a "Goldilocks" planet --

191
0:09:33.2,000 --> 0:09:34,000
a barrier perhaps.

192
0:09:35.2,000 --> 0:09:36,000
You can imagine more barriers.

193
0:09:37.04,000 --> 0:09:38,000
For instance,

194
0:09:38.28,000 --> 0:09:41,000
simple cells came into being billions of years ago ...

195
0:09:42.48,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but perhaps the development of complex life

196
0:09:45.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
needed a series of unlikely events.

197
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Once life on Earth had access to multicellularity

198
0:09:51.32,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and sophisticated genetic structures,

199
0:09:53.4,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and sex,

200
0:09:54.68,000 --> 0:09:55,000
new opportunities opened up:

201
0:09:56.24,000 --> 0:09:57,000
animals became possible.

202
0:09:58.24,000 --> 0:10:,000
But maybe it's the fate of many planets

203
0:10:01.08,000 --> 0:10:04,000
for life to settle at the level of simple cells.

204
0:10:06.76,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Purely for the purposes of illustration,

205
0:10:09.88,000 --> 0:10:12,000
let me suggest four more barriers to add to the four

206
0:10:12.96,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that people said blocked the path to communicative civilization.

207
0:10:17.76,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Again, purely for the purposes of illustration,

208
0:10:21.04,000 --> 0:10:25,000
suppose there's a one-in-a-thousand chance of making it across each of the barriers.

209
0:10:25.32,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Of course there might be different ways of navigating the barriers,

210
0:10:28.48,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and some chances will be better than one in a thousand.

211
0:10:31.28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Equally, there might be more barriers

212
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and some chances might be one in a million.

213
0:10:35.44,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Let's just see what happens in this picture.

214
0:10:39.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
If the galaxy contains a trillion planets,

215
0:10:41.72,000 --> 0:10:46,000
how many will host a civilization capable of contemplating like us

216
0:10:47.24,000 --> 0:10:49,000
projects such as Breakthrough Starshot?

217
0:10:50.48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Habitability --

218
0:10:51.76,000 --> 0:10:53,000
right sort of planet around the right sort of star --

219
0:10:54.6,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the trillion becomes a billion.

220
0:10:56.96,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Stability --

221
0:10:58.32,000 --> 0:11:01,000
a climate that stays benign for eons --

222
0:11:01.76,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the billion becomes a million.

223
0:11:03.64,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Life must start --

224
0:11:05.6,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the million becomes a thousand.

225
0:11:07.84,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Complex life forms must arise --

226
0:11:10.12,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the thousand becomes one.

227
0:11:12.72,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Sophisticated tool use must develop --

228
0:11:14.6,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that's one planet in a thousand galaxies.

229
0:11:17.48,000 --> 0:11:18,000
To understand the universe,

230
0:11:19.08,000 --> 0:11:22,000
they'll have to develop the techniques of science and mathematics --

231
0:11:22.32,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that's one planet in a million galaxies.

232
0:11:24.44,000 --> 0:11:26,000
To reach the stars, they'll have to be social creatures,

233
0:11:27.12,000 --> 0:11:29,000
capable of discussing abstract concepts with each other

234
0:11:29.96,000 --> 0:11:3,000
using complex grammar --

235
0:11:31.88,000 --> 0:11:34,000
one planet in a billion galaxies.

236
0:11:35.12,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And they have to avoid disaster --

237
0:11:36.88,000 --> 0:11:4,000
not just self-inflicted but from the skies, too.

238
0:11:40.96,000 --> 0:11:42,000
That planet around Proxima Centauri,

239
0:11:43.92,000 --> 0:11:45,000
last year it got blasted by a flare.

240
0:11:47.2,000 --> 0:11:48,000
One planet in a trillion galaxies,

241
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
just as in the visible universe.

242
0:11:54.48,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I think we're alone.

243
0:11:57.24,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Those colleagues of mine who agree we're alone

244
0:11:59.56,000 --> 0:12:02,000
often see a barrier ahead --

245
0:12:02.72,000 --> 0:12:03,000
bioterror,

246
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:05,000
global warming, war.

247
0:12:06.32,000 --> 0:12:09,000
A universe that's silent

248
0:12:09.36,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because technology itself forms the barrier

249
0:12:12.8,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to the development of a truly advanced civilization.

250
0:12:16.76,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Depressing, right?

251
0:12:19.24,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I'm arguing the exact opposite.

252
0:12:22.56,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I grew up watching "Star Trek" and "Forbidden Planet,"

253
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and I saw a UFO once,

254
0:12:26.96,000 --> 0:12:32,000
so this idea of cosmic loneliness I certainly find slightly wistful.

255
0:12:34.24,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But for me,

256
0:12:36.36,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the silence of the universe is shouting,

257
0:12:38.32,000 --> 0:12:39,000
"We're the creatures who got lucky."

258
0:12:40.8,000 --> 0:12:41,000
All barriers are behind us.

259
0:12:42.68,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We're the only species that's cleared them --

260
0:12:45.12,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the only species capable of determining its own destiny.

261
0:12:49.56,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And if we learn to appreciate how special our planet is,

262
0:12:53.84,000 --> 0:12:55,000
how important it is to look after our home

263
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and to find others,

264
0:12:57.84,000 --> 0:13:01,000
how incredibly fortunate we all are simply to be aware of the universe,

265
0:13:02.68,000 --> 0:13:04,000
humanity might survive for a while.

266
0:13:05.04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And all those amazing things

267
0:13:06.72,000 --> 0:13:08,000
we dreamed aliens might have done in the past,

268
0:13:09.6,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that could be our future.

269
0:13:11.64,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Thank you very much.

270
0:13:12.92,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My travels to Afghanistan

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
began many, many years ago

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
on the eastern border of my country,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
my homeland, Poland.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was walking through the forests

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of my grandmother's tales.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
A land where every field hides a grave,

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
where millions of people

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
have been deported or killed

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in the 20th century.

11
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Behind the destruction,

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I found a soul of places.

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I met humble people.

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I heard their prayer

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and ate their bread.

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Then I have been walking East for 20 years --

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
from Eastern Europe to Central Asia --

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
through the Caucasus Mountains,

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Middle East,

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
North Africa,

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Russia.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And I ever met more humble people.

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I shared their bread and their prayer.

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This is why I went to Afghanistan.

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
One day, I crossed the bridge

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
over the Oxus River.

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I was alone on foot.

28
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that he forgot to stamp my passport.

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But he gave me a cup of tea.

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I understood

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that his surprise was my protection.

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So I have been walking and traveling,

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking,

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
from Iran's border

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And in this way

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.

39
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
My only weapon

40
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was my notebook and my Leica.

41
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I heard prayers of the Sufi --

42
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
humble Muslims,

43
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
hated by the Taliban.

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Hidden river,

45
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
interconnected with the mysticism

46
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from Gibraltar to India.

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The mosque where the respectful foreigner

48
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is showered with blessings

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and with tears,

50
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and welcomed as a gift.

51
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What do we know

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
about the country and the people

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that we pretend to protect,

54
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
about the villages

55
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
where the only one medicine

56
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to kill the pain and to stop the hunger

57
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is opium?

58
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
These are opium-addicted people

59
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
on the roofs of Kabul

60
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
10 years after the beginning of our war.

61
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
These are the nomad girls

62
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.

63
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
What do we know about the women

64
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
10 years after the war?

65
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Clothed in this nylon bag,

66
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
made in China,

67
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
with the name of burqa.

68
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I saw one day,

69
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the largest school in Afghanistan,

70
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
a girls' school.

71
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
13,000 girls

72
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
studying here

73
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in the rooms underground,

74
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
full of scorpions.

75
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And their love [for studying]

76
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
was so big that I cried.

77
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
What do we know

78
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
about the death threats by the Taliban

79
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
nailed on the doors

80
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?

81
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban,

82
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and they did it.

83
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
My aim is to give a voice

84
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to the silent people,

85
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to show the hidden lights

86
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
behind the curtain of the great game,

87
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the small worlds ignored by the media

88
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and the prophets of a global conflict.

89
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Thanks.

90
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I used to be a Malthusian.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This was my mental model of the world:

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
exploding population, small planet;

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
it's going to lead to ugly things.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But I'm moving past Malthus,

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because I think that we just might be about 150 years

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
from a kind of new enlightenment.

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Here's why.

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is the U.N.'s population data,

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
you may have seen, for the world.

11
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And the world's population expected to top out

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.

13
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So what then?

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So a lot of economists

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
look at declining population

18
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
and expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But a declining population is going to have

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
at least two very beneficial economic effects.

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
One: fewer people on a fixed amount of land

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
make investing in property a bad bet.

23
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In the cities, a lot of the cost of property

24
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.

25
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Take away land speculation,

26
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
price of land drops.

27
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And that begins to lift a heavy burden

28
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
off the world's poor.

29
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Number two: a declining population

30
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
means scarce labor.

31
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Scarce labor drives wages.

32
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
As wages increase

33
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.

34
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death.

35
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But look what happened in Europe

36
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
after the plague:

37
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
rising wages,

38
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
land reform,

39
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
technological innovation,

40
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
birth of the middle class;

41
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and after that, forward-looking social movements

42
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
like the Renaissance,

43
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and later the Enlightenment.

44
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward,

45
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
romanticizing the past.

46
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden,

47
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and descend through a kind of profligate present

48
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to a very ugly future.

49
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So human history is viewed

50
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
as sort of this downhill slide

51
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
from the good old days.

52
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But I think we're in for another change,

53
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
about two generations after the top of that curve,

54
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
once the effects of a declining population

55
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
start to settle in.

56
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again,

57
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
instead of the nasty, brutish past.

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So why does this matter?

59
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Why talk about social-economic movements

60
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that may be more than a century away?

61
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Because transitions are dangerous times.

62
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
When land owners start to lose money,

63
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and labor demands more pay,

64
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.

65
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.

66
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
If we have a positive view about the future

67
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
then we may be able to accelerate through that turn,

68
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
instead of careening off a cliff.

69
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If we can make it through the next 150 years,

70
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I think that your great great grandchildren

71
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
will forget all about Malthus.

72
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And instead, they'll be planning for the future

73
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.

74
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Thank you.

75
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Applause)

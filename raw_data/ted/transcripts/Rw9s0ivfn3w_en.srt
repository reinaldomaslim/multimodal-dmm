1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Why grow homes? Because we can.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And there's a cause for that, all right.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As an architect, I have to confront something like this.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So what's a technology that will allow us

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to make ginormous houses?

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And we do something different

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
than what we did in the past;

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We use CNC to make scaffolding

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
into a specific geometry

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It fits into the environment. It is the environment.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It is the landscape, right?

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And you can have a hundred million of these homes,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it's great because they suck carbon.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They're perfect.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because these are homes that are a part of the environment.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Imagine pre-growing a village --

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it takes about seven to 10 years --

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and everything is green.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So not only do we do the veggie house,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to put in a molecular cell biology lab

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and start experimenting with regenerative medicine

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and tissue engineering

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and start thinking about what the future would be

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
if architecture and biology became one.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And what we do is we grow

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
extracellular matrix from pigs.

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We use a modified inkjet printer,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and we print geometry.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
like, you know, shoes, leather belts,

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
handbags, etc.,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
where no sentient creature is harmed.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So our theory is that eventually

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we should be doing this with homes.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So here is a typical stud wall,

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
an architectural construction,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and this is a section

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of our proposal for a meat house,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
cilia for dealing with wind loads

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And we know it's incredibly ugly.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but we kind of chose this shape.

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We had a big show in Prague,

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so religion can confront the house of meat.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Applause)

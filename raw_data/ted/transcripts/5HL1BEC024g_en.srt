2
0:00:12.656,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Well, I have a big announcement to make today,

3
0:00:14.959,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I'm really excited about this.

4
0:00:17.132,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And this may be a little bit of a surprise

5
0:00:19.46,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to many of you who know my research

6
0:00:22.714,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and what I've done well.

7
0:00:24.869,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I've really tried to solve some big problems:

8
0:00:28.273,000 --> 0:00:3,000
counterterrorism, nuclear terrorism,

9
0:00:30.74,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer,

10
0:00:34.388,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but I started thinking about all these problems,

11
0:00:36.852,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I realized that the really biggest problem we face,

12
0:00:41.412,000 --> 0:00:43,000
what all these other problems come down to,

13
0:00:43.66,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.

14
0:00:47.302,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I decided that I was going to set out

15
0:00:50.421,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to try to solve this problem.

16
0:00:53.803,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this probably is not what you're expecting.

17
0:00:57.775,000 --> 0:00:58,000
You're probably expecting me to come up here

18
0:00:59.427,000 --> 0:01:,000
and talk about fusion,

19
0:01:01.006,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because that's what I've done most of my life.

20
0:01:02.986,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But this is actually a talk about, okay --

21
0:01:06.252,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter) —

22
0:01:08.876,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but this is actually a talk about fission.

23
0:01:11.843,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's about perfecting something old,

24
0:01:13.369,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and bringing something old into the 21st century.

25
0:01:16.019,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works.

26
0:01:20.644,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In a nuclear power plant, you have

27
0:01:22.388,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a big pot of water that's under high pressure,

28
0:01:25.036,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and you have some fuel rods,

29
0:01:26.554,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium,

30
0:01:28.923,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel,

31
0:01:31.793,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level,

32
0:01:35.949,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and that reaction heats up water,

33
0:01:39.1,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine,

34
0:01:41.925,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and you produce electricity from it.

35
0:01:43.855,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This is the same way we've been producing electricity,

36
0:01:46.635,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the steam turbine idea, for 100 years,

37
0:01:50.1,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and nuclear was a really big advancement

38
0:01:53.121,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in a way to heat the water,

39
0:01:54.701,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine.

40
0:01:59.156,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it?

41
0:02:02.972,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Is fission kind of played out,

42
0:02:05.772,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or is there something left to innovate here?

43
0:02:08.627,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I realized that I had hit upon something

44
0:02:11.212,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that I think has this huge potential to change the world.

45
0:02:15.516,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And this is what it is.

46
0:02:19.007,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is a small modular reactor.

47
0:02:21.612,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here.

48
0:02:26.316,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This is between 50 and 100 megawatts.

49
0:02:28.719,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But that's a ton of power.

50
0:02:30.34,000 --> 0:02:33,000
That's between, say at an average use,

51
0:02:33.789,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.

52
0:02:38.93,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now the really interesting thing about these reactors

53
0:02:41.508,000 --> 0:02:43,000
is they're built in a factory.

54
0:02:43.633,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So they're modular reactors that are built

55
0:02:45.596,000 --> 0:02:47,000
essentially on an assembly line,

56
0:02:47.941,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and they're trucked anywhere in the world,

57
0:02:50.1,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you plop them down, and they produce electricity.

58
0:02:52.411,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This region right here is the reactor.

59
0:02:55.853,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And this is buried below ground, which is really important.

60
0:02:58.164,000 --> 0:03:,000
For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work,

61
0:03:00.877,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I can't extol to you

62
0:03:03.573,000 --> 0:03:05,000
how great having something buried below the ground is

63
0:03:06.358,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for proliferation and security concerns.

64
0:03:10.397,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And inside this reactor is a molten salt,

65
0:03:13.91,000 --> 0:03:15,000
so anybody who's a fan of thorium,

66
0:03:16.688,000 --> 0:03:17,000
they're going to be really excited about this,

67
0:03:18.014,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because these reactors happen to be really good

68
0:03:23.096,000 --> 0:03:25,000
at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle,

69
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
uranium-233.

70
0:03:27.731,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But I'm not really concerned about the fuel.

71
0:03:30.301,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You can run these off -- they're really hungry,

72
0:03:33.525,000 --> 0:03:36,000
they really like down-blended weapons pits,

73
0:03:36.957,000 --> 0:03:38,000
so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium

74
0:03:39.821,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that's been down-blended.

75
0:03:40.854,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon,

76
0:03:44.246,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but they love this stuff.

77
0:03:47.397,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And we have a lot of it sitting around,

78
0:03:49.18,000 --> 0:03:5,000
because this is a big problem.

79
0:03:50.822,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal

80
0:03:52.939,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of nuclear weapons, and that was great,

81
0:03:55.279,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and we don't need them anymore,

82
0:03:57.734,000 --> 0:04:,000
and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially?

83
0:04:01.078,000 --> 0:04:03,000
What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons?

84
0:04:03.493,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, we're securing them, and it would be great

85
0:04:05.394,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if we could burn them, eat them up,

86
0:04:07.138,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and this reactor loves this stuff.

87
0:04:09.139,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core,

88
0:04:12.161,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt,

89
0:04:15.935,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.

90
0:04:20.005,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.

91
0:04:22.652,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And then that's a heat exchanger

92
0:04:24.432,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to what makes this design really, really interesting,

93
0:04:27.725,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and that's a heat exchanger to a gas.

94
0:04:30.733,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So going back to what I was saying before about all power

95
0:04:33.277,000 --> 0:04:35,000
being produced -- well, other than photovoltaic --

96
0:04:36.27,000 --> 0:04:39,000
being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine,

97
0:04:40.168,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that's actually not that efficient, and in fact,

98
0:04:42.688,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in a nuclear power plant like this,

99
0:04:45.064,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient.

100
0:04:49.872,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out

101
0:04:52.409,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to how much electricity it's producing.

102
0:04:54.062,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors

103
0:04:56.987,000 --> 0:04:57,000
operate at pretty low temperature.

104
0:04:58.693,000 --> 0:04:59,000
They operate anywhere from, you know,

105
0:05:00.448,000 --> 0:05:03,000
maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.

106
0:05:04.141,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius,

107
0:05:08.14,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which means the higher the temperature you go to,

108
0:05:10.845,000 --> 0:05:12,000
thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies.

109
0:05:13.741,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas,

110
0:05:17.415,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so supercritical CO2 or helium,

111
0:05:19.893,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and that goes into a turbine,

112
0:05:21.334,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and this is called the Brayton cycle.

113
0:05:23.195,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity,

114
0:05:25.669,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient,

115
0:05:28.099,000 --> 0:05:3,000
between 45 and 50 percent efficiency.

116
0:05:30.989,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I'm really excited about this,

117
0:05:32.66,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because it's a very compact core.

118
0:05:35.173,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature,

119
0:05:39.309,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out

120
0:05:42.614,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for how much uranium you're fissioning,

121
0:05:45.359,000 --> 0:05:47,000
not to mention the fact that these burn up.

122
0:05:47.438,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Their burn-up is much higher.

123
0:05:49.03,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor,

124
0:05:51.008,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a lot more of it's being used.

125
0:05:53.364,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this

126
0:05:56.549,000 --> 0:06:,000
is, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium,

127
0:06:00.821,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.

128
0:06:03.55,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic,

129
0:06:05.724,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.

130
0:06:08.94,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So you have what's called the xenon pit,

131
0:06:11.241,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and so some of these fission products love neutrons.

132
0:06:13.345,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They love the neutrons that are going on

133
0:06:14.592,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and helping this reaction take place.

134
0:06:16.992,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And they eat them up, which means that, combined with

135
0:06:19.968,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long,

136
0:06:22.205,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you can only run one of these reactors

137
0:06:23.919,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.

138
0:06:28.447,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So these reactors run for 30 years without refueling,

139
0:06:33.038,000 --> 0:06:35,000
which is, in my opinion, very, very amazing,

140
0:06:35.758,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because it means it's a sealed system.

141
0:06:37.711,000 --> 0:06:39,000
No refueling means you can seal them up

142
0:06:40.582,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and they're not going to be a proliferation risk,

143
0:06:43.495,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and they're not going to have

144
0:06:45.766,000 --> 0:06:47,000
either nuclear material or radiological material

145
0:06:48.27,000 --> 0:06:5,000
proliferated from their cores.

146
0:06:50.582,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But let's go back to safety, because everybody

147
0:06:53.646,000 --> 0:06:56,000
after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear,

148
0:06:57.424,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor

149
0:06:59.974,000 --> 0:07:02,000
was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe,

150
0:07:03.526,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and I'm really excited about this reactor

151
0:07:06.005,000 --> 0:07:08,000
for essentially two reasons.

152
0:07:08.334,000 --> 0:07:1,000
One, it doesn't operate at high pressure.

153
0:07:11.278,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor

154
0:07:14.519,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water

155
0:07:16.951,000 --> 0:07:19,000
at very high pressures, and this means, essentially,

156
0:07:20.358,000 --> 0:07:22,000
in the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach

157
0:07:23.222,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of this stainless steel pressure vessel,

158
0:07:26.263,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the coolant would leave the core.

159
0:07:28.535,000 --> 0:07:31,000
These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure,

160
0:07:31.574,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so there's no inclination for the fission products

161
0:07:35.48,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to leave the reactor in the event of an accident.

162
0:07:38.052,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Also, they operate at high temperatures,

163
0:07:40.37,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down,

164
0:07:43.249,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances,

165
0:07:47.827,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or you lost off-site power in the case

166
0:07:50.137,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank.

167
0:07:53.327,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant,

168
0:07:57.798,000 --> 0:07:59,000
you could actually just drain the core

169
0:08:00.169,000 --> 0:08:02,000
into what's called a sub-critical setting,

170
0:08:02.35,000 --> 0:08:03,000
basically a tank underneath the reactor

171
0:08:04.304,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that has some neutrons absorbers.

172
0:08:06.264,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And this is really important, because the reaction stops.

173
0:08:10.054,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In this kind of reactor, you can't do that.

174
0:08:12.718,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The fuel, like I said, is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods,

175
0:08:16.199,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors,

176
0:08:19.19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Fukushima and Three Mile Island --

177
0:08:21.327,000 --> 0:08:23,000
looking back at Three Mile Island, we didn't really see this for a while —

178
0:08:24.222,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods,

179
0:08:27.708,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what happens is, when they see high pressure water,

180
0:08:30.537,000 --> 0:08:32,000
steam, in an oxidizing environment,

181
0:08:33.094,000 --> 0:08:35,000
they'll actually produce hydrogen,

182
0:08:35.166,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and that hydrogen has this explosive capability

183
0:08:38.094,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to release fission products.

184
0:08:40.304,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure

185
0:08:42.518,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity,

186
0:08:44.782,000 --> 0:08:47,000
means that there's no inclination for the fission products

187
0:08:48.256,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to leave this reactor.

188
0:08:49.99,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So even in the event of an accident,

189
0:08:52.255,000 --> 0:08:55,000
yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know,

190
0:08:55.973,000 --> 0:08:56,000
sorry for the power company,

191
0:08:57.632,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.

192
0:08:59.732,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So I really think that in the, say,

193
0:09:03.744,000 --> 0:09:05,000
20 years it's going to take us to get fusion

194
0:09:05.872,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and make fusion a reality,

195
0:09:08.092,000 --> 0:09:1,000
this could be the source of energy

196
0:09:10.673,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that provides carbon-free electricity.

197
0:09:13.347,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Carbon-free electricity.

198
0:09:15.005,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And it's an amazing technology because

199
0:09:18.35,000 --> 0:09:2,000
not only does it combat climate change,

200
0:09:21.18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but it's an innovation.

201
0:09:22.684,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's a way to bring power to the developing world,

202
0:09:25.751,000 --> 0:09:27,000
because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap.

203
0:09:28.23,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You can put them anywhere in the world you want to.

204
0:09:30.366,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And maybe something else.

205
0:09:33.622,000 --> 0:09:35,000
As a kid, I was obsessed with space.

206
0:09:36.143,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point,

207
0:09:38.886,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but before that I was obsessed with space,

208
0:09:41.286,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and I was really excited about, you know,

209
0:09:43.197,000 --> 0:09:44,000
being an astronaut and designing rockets,

210
0:09:45.071,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which was something that was always exciting to me.

211
0:09:47.157,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But I think I get to come back to this,

212
0:09:50.563,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket

213
0:09:53.864,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that produces 50 to 100 megawatts.

214
0:09:56.694,000 --> 0:09:59,000
That is the rocket designer's dream.

215
0:09:59.971,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream.

216
0:10:03.702,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Not only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts

217
0:10:05.706,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there,

218
0:10:10.119,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but you have power once you get there.

219
0:10:11.518,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You know, rocket designers who use solar panels

220
0:10:15.039,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts --

221
0:10:17.998,000 --> 0:10:18,000
wow, that's a lot of power.

222
0:10:19.591,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.

223
0:10:22.036,000 --> 0:10:23,000
That's a ton of power.

224
0:10:23.209,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That could power a Martian community.

225
0:10:25.496,000 --> 0:10:26,000
That could power a rocket there.

226
0:10:27.093,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And so I hope that

227
0:10:29.8,000 --> 0:10:31,000
maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore

228
0:10:31.921,000 --> 0:10:35,000
my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion.

229
0:10:36.588,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And people say, "Oh, well, you've launched this thing,

230
0:10:39.578,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?"

231
0:10:42.142,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But we launch plutonium batteries all the time.

232
0:10:45.175,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Everybody was really excited about Curiosity,

233
0:10:47.294,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and that had this big plutonium battery on board

234
0:10:49.895,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that has plutonium-238,

235
0:10:52.014,000 --> 0:10:54,000
which actually has a higher specific activity

236
0:10:54.414,000 --> 0:10:57,000
than the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors,

237
0:10:58.158,000 --> 0:11:01,000
which means that the effects would be negligible,

238
0:11:01.661,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because you launch it cold,

239
0:11:03.113,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor.

240
0:11:06.824,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So I'm really excited.

241
0:11:08.132,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I think that I've designed this reactor here

242
0:11:10.669,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that can be an innovative source of energy,

243
0:11:14.574,000 --> 0:11:17,000
provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications,

244
0:11:18.255,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and I'm really prepared to do this.

245
0:11:20.783,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I graduated high school in May, and --

246
0:11:23.55,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter) (Applause) —

247
0:11:27.698,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I graduated high school in May,

248
0:11:29.749,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and I decided that I was going to start up a company

249
0:11:32.589,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to commercialize these technologies that I've developed,

250
0:11:34.957,000 --> 0:11:36,000
these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers

251
0:11:37.814,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and these systems to produce medical isotopes,

252
0:11:40.094,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up

253
0:11:43.542,000 --> 0:11:45,000
a team of some of the most incredible people

254
0:11:45.795,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I've ever had the chance to work with,

255
0:11:47.982,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and I'm really prepared to make this a reality.

256
0:11:50.744,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And I think, I think, that looking at the technology,

257
0:11:53.841,000 --> 0:11:58,000
this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas,

258
0:11:59.191,000 --> 0:12:,000
and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years,

259
0:12:00.991,000 --> 0:12:02,000
which is an advantage for the developing world.

260
0:12:03.718,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing

261
0:12:06.84,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to end with, which is weird for a scientist.

262
0:12:08.769,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But I think there's something really poetic

263
0:12:11.263,000 --> 0:12:14,000
about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars,

264
0:12:15.062,000 --> 0:12:17,000
because the stars are giant fusion reactors.

265
0:12:17.817,000 --> 0:12:19,000
They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.

266
0:12:20.158,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The energy that I'm able to talk to you today,

267
0:12:23.555,000 --> 0:12:25,000
while it was converted to chemical energy in my food,

268
0:12:25.65,000 --> 0:12:28,000
originally came from a nuclear reaction,

269
0:12:28.838,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and so there's something poetic about, in my opinion,

270
0:12:31.614,000 --> 0:12:33,000
perfecting nuclear fission

271
0:12:34.583,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and using it as a future source of innovative energy.

272
0:12:38.302,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So thank you guys.

273
0:12:40.253,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Applause)

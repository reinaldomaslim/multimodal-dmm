1
0:00:13.048,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In the rather delightful book "The Little Prince,"

2
0:00:19.921,000 --> 0:00:24,000
there is a quotation, which says

3
0:00:27.881,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"It's only with the heart that one can see rightly.

4
0:00:33.704,000 --> 0:00:36,000
What is essential is invisible."

5
0:00:38.355,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And while the author wrote these words sitting in a comfortable chair,

6
0:00:43.978,000 --> 0:00:46,000
somewhere in the United States,

7
0:00:47.895,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I learned this very same lesson

8
0:00:50.466,000 --> 0:00:53,000
miles away in a filthy, dirty barrack

9
0:00:54.077,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in an extermination camp in Poland.

10
0:00:57.979,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It isn't the value or the size of a gift that truly matters,

11
0:01:04.661,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it is how you hold it in your heart.

12
0:01:08.835,000 --> 0:01:1,000
When I was six years old,

13
0:01:11.12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
my mother, my father, my sister and myself

14
0:01:15.907,000 --> 0:01:19,000
left Jew-hating Germany, and we went to Yugoslavia.

15
0:01:21.204,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And we were in Yugoslavia for seven happy years,

16
0:01:25.22,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and then Germany invaded Yugoslavia

17
0:01:28.696,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we suddenly were persecuted again,

18
0:01:32.179,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I had to go into hiding.

19
0:01:34.163,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I was hiding for roughly two years

20
0:01:37.028,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with a couple who had worked for the resistance movement.

21
0:01:41.506,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I developed films, and I made enlargements.

22
0:01:46.633,000 --> 0:01:5,000
One day, when I was 15 years old,

23
0:01:51.069,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I was arrested by the gestapo

24
0:01:53.978,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and beaten up,

25
0:01:56.625,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and, for two months, dragged through various prisons,

26
0:01:59.85,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and eventually, I ended up

27
0:02:03.627,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in a 150-year-old fortress in Czechoslovakia,

28
0:02:09.966,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which the Nazis had converted into a concentration camp.

29
0:02:15.522,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I was there for 10 months.

30
0:02:17.752,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I laid railroad tracks,

31
0:02:19.798,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I exterminated vermin,

32
0:02:22.514,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I made baskets,

33
0:02:24.101,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and after 10 months,

34
0:02:25.331,000 --> 0:02:3,000
about 2,000 of us were loaded into cattle cars,

35
0:02:30.847,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the doors were closed, and we were shipped east.

36
0:02:35.649,000 --> 0:02:37,000
For three days, we traveled like that,

37
0:02:38.23,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and when we were unloaded,

38
0:02:40.141,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we were smelling of urine and of feces,

39
0:02:43.911,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and we found ourselves in the Auschwitz extermination camp.

40
0:02:48.879,000 --> 0:02:49,000
A camp that, by that time,

41
0:02:50.658,000 --> 0:02:53,000
had murdered already over one million people

42
0:02:54.458,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and sent them through the chimney into the sky.

43
0:03:00.379,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We arrived, we were stripped of all of our properties,

44
0:03:04.157,000 --> 0:03:06,000
whatever we had,

45
0:03:06.212,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and were given striped uniforms,

46
0:03:09.585,000 --> 0:03:12,000
were given a tattoo on our arms,

47
0:03:13.387,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and we also were given the message

48
0:03:16.569,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that we would be there for exactly six months.

49
0:03:21.712,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And after that, we would leave the camp.

50
0:03:25.323,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Through the chimney.

51
0:03:28.617,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We were assigned to different barracks.

52
0:03:32.49,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And the barracks were filled with wooden bunks,

53
0:03:37.387,000 --> 0:03:39,000
six people on each level,

54
0:03:40.141,000 --> 0:03:45,000
three people sleeping in one direction and three in the other direction,

55
0:03:45.176,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so whichever way you slept,

56
0:03:47.8,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you always had a pair of feet in your face.

57
0:03:52.188,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The man next to me was an extremely nice gentleman,

58
0:03:57.419,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and he introduced himself as Mr. Herbert Levine.

59
0:04:03.665,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Mr. Levine was kind and polite to me.

60
0:04:07.719,000 --> 0:04:1,000
One day, when I came back from a work assignment,

61
0:04:11.735,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I climbed up,

62
0:04:13.568,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I was at the top level of the three-tier bunk,

63
0:04:17.546,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and there was Mr. Levine with a deck of cards.

64
0:04:22.633,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And he was shuffling these cards.

65
0:04:25.149,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I couldn't understand it, you know,

66
0:04:27.037,000 --> 0:04:3,000
having a deck of cards in Auschwitz

67
0:04:30.173,000 --> 0:04:33,000
was like finding a gorilla in your bathroom.

68
0:04:33.448,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:34.473,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You know, "What is he doing there?"

70
0:04:36.434,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And then Mr. Levine turned to me

71
0:04:39.776,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and offered me the deck, and said, "Pick a card."

72
0:04:45.347,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I picked a card,

73
0:04:46.825,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and he performed a card trick for me.

74
0:04:49.752,000 --> 0:04:5,000
He performed a miracle.

75
0:04:52.196,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I'd never seen a card trick before,

76
0:04:55.276,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and the man who performed it was sitting right there.

77
0:05:00.466,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And then Mr. Levine did the unthinkable.

78
0:05:05.215,000 --> 0:05:08,000
He actually explained the trick to me.

79
0:05:09.025,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And the words got burned into my brain.

80
0:05:13.199,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I remembered every single word,

81
0:05:15.517,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and from that day on,

82
0:05:18.395,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I practiced that trick every day.

83
0:05:23.483,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Although I didn't have any cards.

84
0:05:27.689,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I just kept on practicing.

85
0:05:31.586,000 --> 0:05:34,000
About three weeks later,

86
0:05:37.029,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the entire camp, with the exception of a couple hundred of us,

87
0:05:41.687,000 --> 0:05:44,000
were sent to the gas chambers.

88
0:05:45.601,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I was sent to another camp where I worked in the stables,

89
0:05:50.387,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and then, in January 1945,

90
0:05:54.475,000 --> 0:05:58,000
when the Russians advanced,

91
0:05:59.483,000 --> 0:06:02,000
60,000 of us were sent on a death march.

92
0:06:04.537,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And we walked for three days, on and off,

93
0:06:09.276,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and in the middle of the winter,

94
0:06:12.058,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and by the time we arrived at a railroad siding,

95
0:06:15.624,000 --> 0:06:17,000
out of the 60,000 people,

96
0:06:17.934,000 --> 0:06:19,000
15,000 had died.

97
0:06:20.791,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And the rest of us were loaded into open railroad cars,

98
0:06:24.72,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and for four days, shipped all the way from Poland down to Austria.

99
0:06:32.077,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And we found ourselves in a death camp,

100
0:06:34.753,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in a concentration camp called Mauthausen,

101
0:06:38.292,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which again was built like a fortress.

102
0:06:41.827,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And at that point, the SS abandoned us,

103
0:06:47.486,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and there was no food there,

104
0:06:49.35,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and there were thousands and thousands of bodies there.

105
0:06:53.432,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I slept for three days next to a dead man,

106
0:06:56.863,000 --> 0:07:,000
just to get his ration of a tablespoon of moldy bread.

107
0:07:01.455,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And two days before the end of the war, May 5,

108
0:07:06.845,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we were liberated by American forces.

109
0:07:10.941,000 --> 0:07:13,000
At that time, I was 17 years old,

110
0:07:14.3,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and I weighed 64 pounds.

111
0:07:18.014,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And I hitchhiked back to Yugoslavia.

112
0:07:20.982,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And when I came back to Yugoslavia,

113
0:07:22.911,000 --> 0:07:24,000
there was communism there,

114
0:07:25.069,000 --> 0:07:26,000
there was no family there

115
0:07:26.828,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and there were no friends there.

116
0:07:29.008,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I stayed there for two years,

117
0:07:31.429,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and after two years, I managed to escape to England.

118
0:07:35.445,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And when I came to England,

119
0:07:36.77,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I couldn't speak English,

120
0:07:38.871,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I had no education, I had no skills.

121
0:07:43.331,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I started working,

122
0:07:45.125,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and about a year after I arrived in England,

123
0:07:48.641,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I bought myself a deck of cards.

124
0:07:51.498,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And for the very first time,

125
0:07:54.815,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I actually performed the trick

126
0:07:58.038,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that was shown to me in Auschwitz on top of a bunk bed.

127
0:08:04.593,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And it worked.

128
0:08:06.013,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It worked beautifully.

129
0:08:07.546,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And I showed it to some friends of mine,

130
0:08:09.49,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and they loved it.

131
0:08:11.546,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I went to a magic store, and I bought some magic tricks,

132
0:08:16.146,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and I showed them to my friends,

133
0:08:17.836,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and I bought some more magic tricks

134
0:08:20.13,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and I showed it to them.

135
0:08:22.162,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And then I bought some magic books, and I bought some more magic books.

136
0:08:27.242,000 --> 0:08:29,000
There's a very, very thin line

137
0:08:30.211,000 --> 0:08:33,000
between a hobby and insanity.

138
0:08:33.607,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

139
0:08:35.719,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Anyway, I got married,

140
0:08:39.125,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and I came to the United States,

141
0:08:42.448,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and one of the first jobs that I had

142
0:08:46.758,000 --> 0:08:51,000
demanded from me to speak to small groups of people.

143
0:08:51.853,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I managed it, I was very good at it.

144
0:08:55.226,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And then, 25 years ago, I retired.

145
0:08:59.3,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And I started speaking in schools.

146
0:09:03.236,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And the only reason why I could speak in schools

147
0:09:08.236,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is because a very friendly man

148
0:09:12.728,000 --> 0:09:17,000
showed a rather scared kid a card trick

149
0:09:17.99,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in a concentration camp.

150
0:09:21.058,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This man who showed it to me, Mr. Levine,

151
0:09:25.201,000 --> 0:09:27,000
had been a professional magician.

152
0:09:28.137,000 --> 0:09:29,000
He worked in Germany,

153
0:09:29.597,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and when he came to Auschwitz, the SS knew who he was,

154
0:09:34.675,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so they gave him some cards,

155
0:09:37.864,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they gave him a piece of string,

156
0:09:39.642,000 --> 0:09:4,000
they gave him some dice,

157
0:09:41.315,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and he performed for them.

158
0:09:44.355,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And then he also taught some of them.

159
0:09:47.125,000 --> 0:09:48,000
He survived the war,

160
0:09:48.475,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but his wife and his son died.

161
0:09:52.125,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He came to the United States and performed in various venues,

162
0:09:56.847,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but I never met him again.

163
0:10:00.998,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But the trick that he showed me stayed with me

164
0:10:05.204,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and enabled me to go around schools

165
0:10:08.553,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and try to make this world just a little bit better.

166
0:10:14.446,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So if you ever know somebody who needs help,

167
0:10:21.756,000 --> 0:10:24,000
if you know somebody who is scared,

168
0:10:25.292,000 --> 0:10:26,000
be kind to them.

169
0:10:28.165,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Give them advice,

170
0:10:31.442,000 --> 0:10:33,000
give them a hug,

171
0:10:33.522,000 --> 0:10:34,000
teach them a card trick.

172
0:10:37.538,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Whatever you are going to do,

173
0:10:39.942,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it's going to be hope for them.

174
0:10:44.354,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And if you do it at the right time,

175
0:10:47.879,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it will enter their heart,

176
0:10:49.76,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and it will be with them wherever they go, forever.

177
0:10:54.897,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Thank you.

178
0:10:56.072,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Applause)

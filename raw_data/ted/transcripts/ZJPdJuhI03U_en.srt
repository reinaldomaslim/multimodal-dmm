1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I guess because I'm from Tanzania

2
0:00:14.6,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I have a responsibility to welcome all of you once again.

3
0:00:18.36,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Thank you for coming.

4
0:00:19.76,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, first of all, before we start,

5
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:22,000
how many of you in the audience

6
0:00:22.96,000 --> 0:00:24,000
have been in the past a victim of this bug here?

7
0:00:28.12,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We apologize on behalf of all the mosquito catchers.

8
0:00:31.24,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:33.08,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
0:00:34.36,000 --> 0:00:37,000
imagine getting seven infectious mosquito bites every day.

11
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
That's 2,555 infectious bites every year.

12
0:00:44.36,000 --> 0:00:47,000
When I was in college, I moved to the Kilombero River valley

13
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in the southeastern part of Tanzania.

14
0:00:50.68,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is historically one of the most malarious zones

15
0:00:53.84,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in the world at that time.

16
0:00:55.56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Life here was difficult.

17
0:00:58.92,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In its later stages

18
0:01:00.8,000 --> 0:01:03,000
malaria manifested with extreme seizures locally known as degedege.

19
0:01:05.36,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's killed both women and men, adults and children,

20
0:01:08.08,000 --> 0:01:09,000
without mercy.

21
0:01:09.88,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My home institution, Ifakara Health Institute,

22
0:01:12.2,000 --> 0:01:13,000
began in this valley in the 1950s

23
0:01:14.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to address priority health needs for the local communities.

24
0:01:17.96,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In fact, the name Ifakara refers to a place you go to die,

25
0:01:22.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which is a reflection of what life used to be here

26
0:01:24.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in the days before organized public health care.

27
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
When I first moved here,

28
0:01:29.52,000 --> 0:01:3,000
my primary role was to estimate

29
0:01:31.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
how much malaria transmission was going on across the villages

30
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and which mosquitoes were transmitting the disease.

31
0:01:38.8,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So my colleague and myself came

32
0:01:41.12,000 --> 0:01:44,000
30 kilometers south of Ifakara town across the river.

33
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Every evening we went into the villages with flashlights and siphons.

34
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We rolled up our trousers,

35
0:01:51.52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and waited for mosquitoes that were coming to bite us

36
0:01:54.72,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so we could collect them

37
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to check if they were carrying malaria.

38
0:01:58.202,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:59.24,000 --> 0:02:01,000
My colleague and myself selected a household,

40
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and we started inside and outside, swapping positions every half hour.

41
0:02:06.44,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And we did this for 12 hours every night for 24 consecutive nights.

42
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We slept for four hours every morning

43
0:02:13.6,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and worked the rest of the day,

44
0:02:15.12,000 --> 0:02:18,000
sorting mosquitoes, identifying them and chopping off their heads

45
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so they could be analyzed in the lab

46
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to check if they were carrying malaria parasites

47
0:02:22.199,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in their blood mouthparts.

48
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This way we were able to not only know how much malaria was going on here

49
0:02:27.8,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but also which mosquitoes were carrying this malaria.

50
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We were also able to know

51
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
whether malaria was mostly inside houses or outside houses.

52
0:02:35.8,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Today, ladies and gentlemen, I still catch mosquitoes for a living.

53
0:02:39.72,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But I do this mostly to improve people's lives and well-being.

54
0:02:44.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This has been called by some people the most dangerous animal on earth --

55
0:02:48.6,000 --> 0:02:5,000
which unfortunately is true.

56
0:02:50.68,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But what do we really know about mosquitoes?

57
0:02:54.36,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It turns out we actually know very little.

58
0:02:58.08,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Consider the fact that at the moment our best practice against malaria

59
0:03:02.44,000 --> 0:03:04,000
are bednets -- insecticide treated bednets.

60
0:03:05.24,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We know now that across Africa

61
0:03:06.84,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you have widespread resistance to insecticides.

62
0:03:09.8,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And these are the same insecticides,

63
0:03:11.56,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the pyrethroid class, that are put on these bednets.

64
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We know now that these bednets protect you from bites

65
0:03:17.68,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but only minimally kill the mosquitoes that they should.

66
0:03:21.56,000 --> 0:03:24,000
What it means is that we've got to do more to be able to get to zero.

67
0:03:25.24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And that's part of our duty.

68
0:03:28.92,000 --> 0:03:29,000
At Ifakara Health Institute

69
0:03:30.28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we focus very much on the biology of the mosquito,

70
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and we try to do this so we can identify new opportunities.

71
0:03:37.2,000 --> 0:03:38,000
A new approach.

72
0:03:38.56,000 --> 0:03:4,000
New ways to try and get new options

73
0:03:41.44,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that we can use together with things such as bednets

74
0:03:43.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to be able to get to zero.

75
0:03:45.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And I'm going to share with you a few examples

76
0:03:47.48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of the things that my colleagues and myself do.

77
0:03:50.6,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Take this, for example.

78
0:03:52.24,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Mosquitoes breed in small pools of water.

79
0:03:56.32,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Not all of them are easy to find --

80
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:04:,000
they can be scattered across villages,

81
0:04:00.32,000 --> 0:04:02,000
they can be as small as hoofprints.

82
0:04:03.72,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They can be behind your house or far from your house.

83
0:04:06.64,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And so, if you wanted to control mosquito larvae,

84
0:04:09.24,000 --> 0:04:11,000
it can actually be quite difficult to get them.

85
0:04:12.52,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What my colleagues and I have decided to do

86
0:04:15.6,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is to think about what if we used mosquitoes themselves

87
0:04:18.24,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to carry the insecticides from a place of our choice

88
0:04:21.36,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to their own breeding habitats

89
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:26,000
so that whichever eggs they lay there shall not survive.

90
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is Dickson Lwetoijera.

91
0:04:30.079,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This is my colleague who runs this show at Ifakara.

92
0:04:32.8,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And he has demonstrated cleverly that you can actually get mosquitoes

93
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to come to the place where they normally come to get blood

94
0:04:38.84,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to pick up a dose of sterilants or insecticide,

95
0:04:42.92,000 --> 0:04:44,000
carry this back to their own breeding habitat

96
0:04:45.08,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and kill all their progeny.

97
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And we have demonstrated that you can do this

98
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and crush populations very, very rapidly.

99
0:04:53.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This is beautiful.

100
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is our mosquito city.

101
0:04:58.56,000 --> 0:05:,000
It is the largest mosquito farm

102
0:05:01.28,000 --> 0:05:03,000
available in the world for malaria research.

103
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Here we have large-scale self-sustaining colonies of malaria mosquitoes

104
0:05:09.08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that we rear in these facilities.

105
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Of course, they are disease-free.

106
0:05:12.56,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But what these systems allow us to do

107
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is to introduce new tools and test them immediately,

108
0:05:18.08,000 --> 0:05:19,000
very quickly,

109
0:05:19.32,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and see if we can crush these populations or control them in some way.

110
0:05:23.08,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And my colleagues have demonstrated

111
0:05:24.8,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that if you just put two or three positions

112
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
where mosquitoes can go pick up these lethal substances,

113
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:31,000
we can crush these colonies in just three months.

114
0:05:33.52,000 --> 0:05:34,000
That's autodissemination, as we call it.

115
0:05:36.4,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But what if we could use

116
0:05:38.92,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the mosquitoes' sexual behavior

117
0:05:42.04,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to also control them?

118
0:05:43.84,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So, first of all I would like to tell you

119
0:05:45.84,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that actually mosquitoes mate in what we call swarms.

120
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Male mosquitoes usually congregate

121
0:05:51.88,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in clusters around the horizon, usually after sunset.

122
0:05:55.64,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The males go there for a dance,

123
0:05:57.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the females fly into that dance

124
0:05:59.32,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and select a male mosquito of their choice,

125
0:06:02.08,000 --> 0:06:04,000
usually the best-looking male in their view.

126
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They clump together and fall down onto the floor.

127
0:06:07.28,000 --> 0:06:08,000
If you watch this, it's beautiful.

128
0:06:08.96,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's a fantastic phenomenon.

129
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This is where our mosquito-catching work gets really interesting.

130
0:06:15.24,000 --> 0:06:18,000
What we have seen, when we go swarm hunting in the villages,

131
0:06:18.96,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is that these swarm locations tend to be at exactly the same location

132
0:06:22.52,000 --> 0:06:24,000
every day, every week, every month,

133
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:26,000
year in, year out.

134
0:06:26.56,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They start at exactly the same time of the evening,

135
0:06:29.76,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and they are at exactly the same locations.

136
0:06:32.2,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What does this tell us?

137
0:06:33.48,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It means that if we can map all these locations across villages,

138
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we could actually

139
0:06:38.4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
crush these populations by just a single blow.

140
0:06:41.56,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Kind of, you know, bomb-spray them or nuke them out.

141
0:06:45.44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that is what we try to do with young men and women

142
0:06:48.04,000 --> 0:06:49,000
across the villages.

143
0:06:49.28,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We organize these crews, teach them how to identify the swarms,

144
0:06:53.36,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and spray them out.

145
0:06:54.76,000 --> 0:06:56,000
My colleagues and I believe we have a new window

146
0:06:57.4,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to get mosquitoes out of the valley.

147
0:07:01.12,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But perhaps the fact that mosquitoes eat blood, human blood,

148
0:07:05.52,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is the reason they are the most dangerous animal on earth.

149
0:07:09.76,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But think about it this way --

150
0:07:11.24,000 --> 0:07:12,000
mosquitoes actually smell you.

151
0:07:14.2,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And they have developed

152
0:07:16.28,000 --> 0:07:18,000
incredible sensory organs.

153
0:07:19.76,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They can smell from as far sometimes as 100 meters away.

154
0:07:24.04,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And when they get closer,

155
0:07:25.32,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they can even tell the difference between two family members.

156
0:07:28.32,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They know who you are based on what you produce

157
0:07:30.56,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from your breath, skin, sweat and body odor.

158
0:07:34.4,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What we have done at Ifakara

159
0:07:35.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is to identify what it is in your skin, your body, your sweat or your breath

160
0:07:39.48,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that these mosquitoes like.

161
0:07:41.12,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Once we identified these substances, we created a concoction,

162
0:07:44.36,000 --> 0:07:47,000
kind of a mixture, a blend of synthetic substances

163
0:07:47.52,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that are reminiscent of what you produce from your body.

164
0:07:50.2,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And we made a synthetic blend

165
0:07:52.4,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that was attracting three to five times more mosquitoes than a human being.

166
0:07:57.44,000 --> 0:07:58,000
What can you do with this?

167
0:07:58.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You put in a trap, lure a lot of mosquitoes and you kill them, right?

168
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And of course, you can also use it for surveillance.

169
0:08:04.48,000 --> 0:08:05,000
At Ifakara

170
0:08:06.28,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we wish to expand our knowledge on the biology of the mosquito;

171
0:08:11.12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to control many other diseases, including, of course, the malaria,

172
0:08:14.24,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but also those other diseases that mosquitoes transmit

173
0:08:16.84,000 --> 0:08:18,000
like dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus.

174
0:08:19.8,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And this is why my colleagues, for example --

175
0:08:21.96,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we have looked at the fact

176
0:08:23.24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that some mosquitoes like to bite you on the leg region.

177
0:08:26.84,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And we've now created these mosquito repellent sandals

178
0:08:30.24,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that tourists and locals can wear when they're coming.

179
0:08:33.56,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And you don't get bitten --

180
0:08:34.92,000 --> 0:08:36,000
this gives you 'round the clock protection

181
0:08:36.944,000 --> 0:08:38,000
until the time you go under your bednet.

182
0:08:39.12,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Applause)

183
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
My love-hate relationship with mosquitoes continues.

184
0:08:43.6,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:44.72,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And it's going to go a long way, I can see.

186
0:08:47.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But that's OK.

187
0:08:48.72,000 --> 0:08:53,000
WHO has set a goal of 2030 to eliminate malaria from 35 countries.

188
0:08:53.88,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The African Union has set a goal

189
0:08:55.48,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of 2030 to eliminate malaria from the continent.

190
0:08:58.64,000 --> 0:09:,000
At Ifakara we are firmly behind these goals.

191
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And we've put together a cohort of young scientists,

192
0:09:04.64,000 --> 0:09:05,000
male and female,

193
0:09:06.2,000 --> 0:09:07,000
who are champions,

194
0:09:07.44,000 --> 0:09:1,000
who are interested in coming together to make this vision come true.

195
0:09:11.76,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They do what they can

196
0:09:13.72,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to make it work.

197
0:09:16.64,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And we are supporting them.

198
0:09:18.52,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We are here to make sure that these dreams come true.

199
0:09:21.48,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

200
0:09:23.2,000 --> 0:09:25,000
even if it doesn't happen in our lifetime,

201
0:09:27.12,000 --> 0:09:28,000
even if it doesn't happen

202
0:09:29.4,000 --> 0:09:3,000
before you and me go away,

203
0:09:31.28,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I believe that your child and my child

204
0:09:34.6,000 --> 0:09:37,000
shall inherit a world free of malaria transmitting mosquitoes

205
0:09:37.88,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and free of malaria.

206
0:09:39.12,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

207
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause)

208
0:09:45.08,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Thank you.

209
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Kelo Kubu: OK, Fredros.

210
0:09:48.56,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Let's talk about CRISPR for a bit.

211
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Laughter)

212
0:09:52.08,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's taken the world by storm,

213
0:09:54.36,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it promises to do amazing things.

214
0:09:58.2,000 --> 0:10:02,000
What do you think of scientists using CRISPR to kill off mosquitoes?

215
0:10:03.52,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Fredros Okumu: To answer this question, let's start from what the problem is.

216
0:10:08.76,000 --> 0:10:11,000
First of all, we're talking about a disease that still kills --

217
0:10:12.28,000 --> 0:10:14,000
according to the latest figures we have from WHO --

218
0:10:14.72,000 --> 0:10:16,000
429,000 people.

219
0:10:16.96,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Most of these are African children.

220
0:10:19.6,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Of course, we've made progress,

221
0:10:21.12,000 --> 0:10:22,000
there are countries that have achieved

222
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
up to 50-60 percent reduction in malaria burden.

223
0:10:26.92,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But we still have to do more to get to zero.

224
0:10:29.36,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There is already proof of principle

225
0:10:31.56,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that gene-editing techniques, such as CRISPR,

226
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:36,000
can be used effectively

227
0:10:37.44,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to transform mosquitoes so that either they do not transmit malaria --

228
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we call this population alteration --

229
0:10:43.8,000 --> 0:10:45,000
or that they no longer exist,

230
0:10:46.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
population suppression.

231
0:10:48.52,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This is already proven in the lab.

232
0:10:50.44,000 --> 0:10:52,000
There is also modeling work

233
0:10:52.88,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that has demonstrated that even if you were to release

234
0:10:55.48,000 --> 0:10:58,000
just a small number of these genetically modified mosquitoes,

235
0:10:58.6,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that you can actually achieve elimination very, very quickly.

236
0:11:01.92,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So, CRISPR and tools like this offer us some real opportunities --

237
0:11:05.88,000 --> 0:11:08,000
real-life opportunities to have high-impact interventions

238
0:11:09.88,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that we can use in addition to what we have now

239
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to eventually go to zero.

240
0:11:14.28,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This is important.

241
0:11:15.96,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now, of course people always ask us --

242
0:11:18.96,000 --> 0:11:19,000
which is a common question,

243
0:11:20.32,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I guess you're going to ask this as well --

244
0:11:22.4,000 --> 0:11:24,000
"What happens if you eliminate mosquitoes?"

245
0:11:24.48,000 --> 0:11:25,000
KK: I won't ask then, you answer.

246
0:11:26.12,000 --> 0:11:3,000
FO: OK. In respect to this, I would just like to remind my colleagues

247
0:11:30.2,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that we have 3,500 mosquito species in this world.

248
0:11:34.64,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Maybe more than that.

249
0:11:35.96,000 --> 0:11:37,000
About 400 of these are Anophelenes,

250
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and only about 70 of them have any capacity to transmit malaria.

251
0:11:41.88,000 --> 0:11:44,000
In Africa, we're having to deal with three or four of these as the major guys.

252
0:11:45.68,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They carry most -- like 99 percent of all the malaria we have.

253
0:11:49.52,000 --> 0:11:51,000
If we were to go out with gene editing like CRISPR,

254
0:11:52.44,000 --> 0:11:54,000
if we were to go out with gene drives to control malaria,

255
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we would be going after only one or two.

256
0:11:57.28,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I don't see a diversity problem with that.

257
0:11:59.8,000 --> 0:12:,000
But that's personal view.

258
0:12:01.2,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I think it's OK.

259
0:12:02.44,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And remember, by the way,

260
0:12:03.72,000 --> 0:12:06,000
all these years we've been trying to eliminate these mosquitoes effectively

261
0:12:07.44,000 --> 0:12:11,000
by spraying them -- our colleagues in America have sprayed with --

262
0:12:11.52,000 --> 0:12:13,000
really bomb-spraying these insects out of the villages.

263
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
In Africa we do a lot of household spraying.

264
0:12:17.12,000 --> 0:12:19,000
All these are aimed solely at killing the mosquitoes.

265
0:12:20.28,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So there's really no problem if we had a new tool.

266
0:12:22.8,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But having said that, I have to say

267
0:12:24.52,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we also have to be very, very responsible here.

268
0:12:26.84,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So there's the regulatory side, and we have to partner with our regulators

269
0:12:30.32,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and make sure that everything that we do is done correctly,

270
0:12:33.32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is done responsibly

271
0:12:34.96,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and that we also have to do independent risk assessments,

272
0:12:37.68,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to just make sure

273
0:12:38.96,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that all these processes do not fall into the wrong hands.

274
0:12:42.24,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Thank you very much.

275
0:12:43.48,000 --> 0:12:44,000
KK: Thank you.

276
0:12:44.72,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Applause)

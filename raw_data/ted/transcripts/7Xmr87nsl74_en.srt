2
0:00:15.855,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Radical openness is still a distant future

3
0:00:18.975,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the field of school education.

4
0:00:21.271,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We have such a hard time figuring out

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that learning is not a place but an activity.

6
0:00:27.381,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But I want to tell you the story of PISA,

7
0:00:30.852,000 --> 0:00:32,000
OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills

8
0:00:33.23,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of 15-year-olds around the world,

9
0:00:34.859,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and it's really a story of how international comparisons

10
0:00:39.381,000 --> 0:00:42,000
have globalized the field of education that we usually treat

11
0:00:42.656,000 --> 0:00:44,000
as an affair of domestic policy.

12
0:00:45.591,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s,

13
0:00:48.015,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in terms of the proportion of people

14
0:00:49.846,000 --> 0:00:51,000
who had completed high school.

15
0:00:52.586,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You can see the United States ahead of everyone else,

16
0:00:56.406,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and much of the economic success of the United States

17
0:00:59.119,000 --> 0:01:01,000
draws on its long-standing advantage

18
0:01:01.863,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as the first mover in education.

19
0:01:04.735,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.

20
0:01:07.958,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In the 1980s, the global expansion

21
0:01:10.647,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of the talent pool continued.

22
0:01:13.243,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.

23
0:01:16.943,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.

24
0:01:18.967,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In the '90s, it was 13th,

25
0:01:21.903,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and not because standards had fallen,

26
0:01:24.304,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.

27
0:01:28.059,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Korea shows you what's possible in education.

28
0:01:31.589,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living

29
0:01:34.534,000 --> 0:01:36,000
of Afghanistan today,

30
0:01:36.965,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and was one of the lowest education performers.

31
0:01:41.106,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Today, every young Korean finishes high school.

32
0:01:46.658,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So this tells us that, in a global economy,

33
0:01:49.634,000 --> 0:01:53,000
it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success,

34
0:01:54.215,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but the best performing education systems internationally.

35
0:01:59.396,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The trouble is that

36
0:02:01.839,000 --> 0:02:02,000
measuring how much time people spend in school

37
0:02:03.709,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or what degree they have got is not always

38
0:02:05.733,000 --> 0:02:1,000
a good way of seeing what they can actually do.

39
0:02:10.757,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets,

40
0:02:14.43,000 --> 0:02:16,000
while employers say they cannot find the people

41
0:02:16.624,000 --> 0:02:19,000
with the skills they need.

42
0:02:20.423,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate

43
0:02:24.087,000 --> 0:02:28,000
into better skills and better jobs and better lives.

44
0:02:28.457,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So with PISA, we try to change this

45
0:02:31.066,000 --> 0:02:32,000
by measuring the knowledge and skills

46
0:02:32.937,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of people directly.

47
0:02:36.373,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And we took a very special angle to this.

48
0:02:38.271,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We were less interested in whether students can simply

49
0:02:40.753,000 --> 0:02:43,000
reproduce what they have learned in school,

50
0:02:43.854,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate

51
0:02:46.57,000 --> 0:02:47,000
from what they know

52
0:02:48.483,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and apply their knowledge in novel situations.

53
0:02:52.362,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, some people have criticized us for this.

54
0:02:55.194,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes

55
0:02:57.141,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is terribly unfair to people, because we test students

56
0:02:59.953,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with problems they haven't seen before.

57
0:03:02.926,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But if you take that logic, you know,

58
0:03:04.967,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you should consider life unfair, because

59
0:03:07.895,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember

60
0:03:11.084,000 --> 0:03:12,000
what we learned in school,

61
0:03:12.204,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but whether we are prepared for change,

62
0:03:15.525,000 --> 0:03:17,000
whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created,

63
0:03:17.946,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to use technologies that haven't been invented,

64
0:03:20.292,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to solve problems we just can't anticipate today.

65
0:03:25.209,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And once hotly contested,

66
0:03:27.394,000 --> 0:03:3,000
our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.

67
0:03:30.831,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In our latest assessment in 2009,

68
0:03:33.073,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we measured 74 school systems

69
0:03:36.485,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that together cover 87 percent of the economy.

70
0:03:40.072,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This chart shows you the performance of countries.

71
0:03:43.746,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In red, sort of below OECD average.

72
0:03:46.633,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.

73
0:03:50.009,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia;

74
0:03:54.363,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Finland in Europe;

75
0:03:56.053,000 --> 0:04:,000
Canada in North America doing really well.

76
0:04:00.419,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You can also see that there is a gap of almost

77
0:04:02.86,000 --> 0:04:04,000
three and a half school years between

78
0:04:04.937,000 --> 0:04:07,000
15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile,

79
0:04:08.305,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the gap grows to seven school years

80
0:04:11.01,000 --> 0:04:14,000
when you include the countries with really poor performance.

81
0:04:14.633,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There's a world of difference in the way in which

82
0:04:17.104,000 --> 0:04:22,000
young people are prepared for today's economy.

83
0:04:22.306,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But I want to introduce a second important dimension

84
0:04:25.852,000 --> 0:04:27,000
into this picture.

85
0:04:28.073,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Educators like to talk about equity.

86
0:04:32.448,000 --> 0:04:35,000
With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity,

87
0:04:36.158,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in terms of ensuring that people

88
0:04:38.385,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from different social backgrounds have equal chances.

89
0:04:41.825,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we see that in some countries, the impact

90
0:04:43.56,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of social background on learning outcomes

91
0:04:45.439,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is very, very strong.

92
0:04:46.577,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Opportunities are unequally distributed.

93
0:04:49.495,000 --> 0:04:52,000
A lot of potential of young children is wasted.

94
0:04:53.11,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We see in other countries that it matters much less

95
0:04:56.178,000 --> 0:04:59,000
into which social context you're born.

96
0:04:59.671,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant,

97
0:05:02.066,000 --> 0:05:06,000
where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.

98
0:05:06.562,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there,

99
0:05:09.233,000 --> 0:05:1,000
where performance is poor

100
0:05:10.614,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and there are large social disparities.

101
0:05:13.959,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And then we can debate, you know, is it better

102
0:05:16.114,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to be there, where performance is strong

103
0:05:17.913,000 --> 0:05:19,000
at the price of large disparities?

104
0:05:20.873,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?

105
0:05:26.492,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture,

106
0:05:29.474,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you see there are a lot of countries that actually

107
0:05:32.217,000 --> 0:05:36,000
are combining excellence with equity.

108
0:05:36.985,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison

109
0:05:39.593,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is that you don't have to compromise equity

110
0:05:42.699,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to achieve excellence.

111
0:05:45.546,000 --> 0:05:47,000
These countries have moved on from providing excellence

112
0:05:47.985,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for just some to providing excellence for all,

113
0:05:51.254,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a very important lesson.

114
0:05:53.226,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems

115
0:05:58.202,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that believe they are mainly there to sort people.

116
0:06:02.505,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And ever since those results came out, policymakers,

117
0:06:05.017,000 --> 0:06:06,000
educators, researchers from around the world

118
0:06:06.994,000 --> 0:06:07,000
have tried to figure out

119
0:06:08.355,000 --> 0:06:11,000
what's behind the success of those systems.

120
0:06:11.785,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But let's step back for a moment

121
0:06:13.609,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and focus on the countries that actually started PISA,

122
0:06:16.623,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I'm giving them a colored bubble now.

123
0:06:19.169,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And I'm making the size of the bubble

124
0:06:22.661,000 --> 0:06:23,000
proportional

125
0:06:24.203,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to the amount of money that countries spent on students.

126
0:06:27.998,000 --> 0:06:28,000
If money would tell you everything

127
0:06:29.55,000 --> 0:06:31,000
about the quality of learning outcomes,

128
0:06:31.629,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?

129
0:06:34.96,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But that's not what you see.

130
0:06:37.505,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Spending per student only explains about,

131
0:06:39.81,000 --> 0:06:41,000
well, less than 20 percent

132
0:06:42.106,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of the performance variation among countries,

133
0:06:45.624,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system,

134
0:06:47.914,000 --> 0:06:49,000
doesn't do particularly well.

135
0:06:50.378,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What you see is that two countries with similar spending

136
0:06:52.754,000 --> 0:06:53,000
achieve very different results.

137
0:06:54.674,000 --> 0:06:58,000
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings --

138
0:06:58.923,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided

139
0:07:02.512,000 --> 0:07:04,000
between rich and well-educated countries,

140
0:07:05.202,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and poor and badly-educated ones,

141
0:07:07.522,000 --> 0:07:1,000
a very, very important lesson.

142
0:07:11.117,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Let's look at this in greater detail.

143
0:07:13.699,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The red dot shows you

144
0:07:15.505,000 --> 0:07:19,000
spending per student relative to a country's wealth.

145
0:07:19.962,000 --> 0:07:21,000
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well,

146
0:07:22.769,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and you can see Korea investing a lot

147
0:07:25.274,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.

148
0:07:28.298,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And Korea also invests into long school days,

149
0:07:30.224,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which drives up costs further.

150
0:07:32.98,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers

151
0:07:35.12,000 --> 0:07:37,000
not only to teach but also to develop.

152
0:07:37.4,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They invest in professional development and collaboration

153
0:07:39.735,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and many other things.

154
0:07:41.815,000 --> 0:07:42,000
All that costs money.

155
0:07:43.456,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How can Korea afford all of this?

156
0:07:46.126,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.

157
0:07:49.866,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.

158
0:07:54.334,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg,

159
0:07:57.229,000 --> 0:08:,000
and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea,

160
0:08:00.332,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.

161
0:08:03.865,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers

162
0:08:06.759,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in Luxembourg all like small classes.

163
0:08:09.206,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.

164
0:08:11.974,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So they have invested all their money into there,

165
0:08:13.878,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.

166
0:08:17.224,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once,

167
0:08:21.385,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and the price for this is that

168
0:08:23.59,000 --> 0:08:25,000
teachers are not paid particularly well.

169
0:08:25.694,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Students don't have long hours of learning.

170
0:08:28.373,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.

171
0:08:31.615,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently,

172
0:08:35.296,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and actually how they spent their money

173
0:08:37.616,000 --> 0:08:43,000
matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.

174
0:08:43.619,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Let's go back to the year 2000.

175
0:08:46.173,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.

176
0:08:50.168,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is how the world looked then

177
0:08:52.292,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in terms of PISA performance.

178
0:08:56.553,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?

179
0:08:59.368,000 --> 0:09:,000
We spent a lot less on education,

180
0:09:00.999,000 --> 0:09:02,000
about 35 percent less on education.

181
0:09:03.071,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive,

182
0:09:06.816,000 --> 0:09:09,000
has it become so much better?

183
0:09:10.169,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the bitter truth really is that, you know,

184
0:09:13.168,000 --> 0:09:15,000
not in many countries.

185
0:09:15.613,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But there are some countries which have seen

186
0:09:17.696,000 --> 0:09:19,000
impressive improvements.

187
0:09:20.644,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000,

188
0:09:24.44,000 --> 0:09:25,000
featured in the lower quadrant,

189
0:09:26.328,000 --> 0:09:29,000
below average performance, large social disparities.

190
0:09:29.493,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries

191
0:09:31.496,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.

192
0:09:35.224,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Very disappointing results.

193
0:09:36.985,000 --> 0:09:38,000
People were stunned by the results.

194
0:09:39.722,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany

195
0:09:43.513,000 --> 0:09:46,000
was dominated for months by education,

196
0:09:47.219,000 --> 0:09:49,000
not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education

197
0:09:49.953,000 --> 0:09:51,000
was the center of the public debate.

198
0:09:52.504,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And then policymakers began to respond to this.

199
0:09:55.723,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.

200
0:09:59.953,000 --> 0:10:02,000
A lot was done to increase the life chances of students

201
0:10:03.582,000 --> 0:10:05,000
with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.

202
0:10:06.544,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about

203
0:10:11.052,000 --> 0:10:14,000
optimizing existing policies,

204
0:10:14.811,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms

205
0:10:18.224,000 --> 0:10:19,000
underlying German education.

206
0:10:20.011,000 --> 0:10:23,000
For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children

207
0:10:23.897,000 --> 0:10:25,000
was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases

208
0:10:26.515,000 --> 0:10:29,000
where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities

209
0:10:29.547,000 --> 0:10:32,000
when they sent their children to kindergarten.

210
0:10:32.635,000 --> 0:10:34,000
PISA has transformed that debate,

211
0:10:35.283,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and pushed early childhood education right at the center

212
0:10:38.056,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of public policy in Germany.

213
0:10:40.448,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Or traditionally, the German education divides children

214
0:10:44.149,000 --> 0:10:46,000
at the age of 10, very young children,

215
0:10:46.897,000 --> 0:10:5,000
between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers

216
0:10:51.086,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers,

217
0:10:54.436,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and that mainly along socioeconomic lines,

218
0:10:56.912,000 --> 0:11:,000
and that paradigm is being challenged now too.

219
0:11:01.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
A lot of change.

220
0:11:03.564,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And the good news is, nine years later,

221
0:11:06.518,000 --> 0:11:09,000
you can see improvements in quality and equity.

222
0:11:09.617,000 --> 0:11:11,000
People have taken up the challenge, done something about it.

223
0:11:11.893,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.

224
0:11:14.021,000 --> 0:11:16,000
In the year 2000, Korea did already very well,

225
0:11:16.566,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share

226
0:11:19.891,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.

227
0:11:24.25,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They took up the challenge,

228
0:11:26.064,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and Korea was able to double the proportion of students

229
0:11:29.598,000 --> 0:11:33,000
achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.

230
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students,

231
0:11:36.553,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you know what happens is disparities grow,

232
0:11:38.472,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction,

233
0:11:42.272,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but still, an impressive improvement.

234
0:11:44.983,000 --> 0:11:46,000
A major overhaul of Poland's education

235
0:11:47.569,000 --> 0:11:5,000
helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools,

236
0:11:51.202,000 --> 0:11:53,000
turn around many of the lowest-performing schools,

237
0:11:53.896,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and raise performance by over half a school year.

238
0:11:58.73,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And you can see other countries as well.

239
0:12:00.521,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system,

240
0:12:03.464,000 --> 0:12:05,000
raise quality and improve equity,

241
0:12:06.456,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and so did Hungary.

242
0:12:08.332,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.

243
0:12:11.763,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And even those people who complain and say that

244
0:12:14.696,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the relative standing of countries

245
0:12:16.385,000 --> 0:12:19,000
on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture,

246
0:12:19.807,000 --> 0:12:22,000
of economic factors, of social issues,

247
0:12:22.849,000 --> 0:12:25,000
of homogeneity of societies, and so on,

248
0:12:25.911,000 --> 0:12:29,000
these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.

249
0:12:30.753,000 --> 0:12:33,000
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.

250
0:12:33.793,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It didn't change its economy. It didn't change

251
0:12:36.297,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the compositions of its population.

252
0:12:38.389,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies

253
0:12:41.243,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and practice. Very impressive.

254
0:12:43.883,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn

255
0:12:46.848,000 --> 0:12:48,000
from those countries in the green quadrant

256
0:12:48.952,000 --> 0:12:5,000
who have achieved high levels of equity,

257
0:12:51.227,000 --> 0:12:54,000
high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?

258
0:12:54.959,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context

259
0:12:58.873,000 --> 0:13:,000
provide a model elsewhere?

260
0:13:01.589,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale,

261
0:13:04.919,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but these comparisons have identified a range of factors

262
0:13:08.846,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that high-performing systems share.

263
0:13:12.167,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Everybody agrees that education is important.

264
0:13:14.727,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Everybody says that.

265
0:13:16.714,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority

266
0:13:19.969,000 --> 0:13:21,000
against other priorities?

267
0:13:22.265,000 --> 0:13:24,000
How do countries pay their teachers

268
0:13:24.278,000 --> 0:13:27,000
relative to other highly skilled workers?

269
0:13:27.383,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Would you want your child to become a teacher

270
0:13:29.868,000 --> 0:13:31,000
rather than a lawyer?

271
0:13:31.98,000 --> 0:13:33,000
How do the media talk about schools and teachers?

272
0:13:33.982,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned

273
0:13:36.487,000 --> 0:13:4,000
from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems,

274
0:13:40.581,000 --> 0:13:43,000
the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices

275
0:13:44.131,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that value education, their future,

276
0:13:46.509,000 --> 0:13:48,000
more than consumption today.

277
0:13:49.181,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it,

278
0:13:51.227,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but there are countries in which the most attractive place

279
0:13:54.213,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to be is not the shopping center but the school.

280
0:13:57.133,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Those things really exist.

281
0:13:59.4,000 --> 0:14:,000
But placing a high value on education

282
0:14:01.373,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is just part of the picture.

283
0:14:04.224,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The other part is the belief that all children

284
0:14:07.253,000 --> 0:14:1,000
are capable of success.

285
0:14:10.688,000 --> 0:14:11,000
You have some countries where students

286
0:14:12.449,000 --> 0:14:14,000
are segregated early in their ages.

287
0:14:14.688,000 --> 0:14:16,000
You know, students are divided up,

288
0:14:16.734,000 --> 0:14:18,000
reflecting the belief that only some children

289
0:14:19.069,000 --> 0:14:22,000
can achieve world-class standards.

290
0:14:22.621,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.

291
0:14:26.676,000 --> 0:14:29,000
If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe,

292
0:14:30.06,000 --> 0:14:32,000
parents and teachers in those countries

293
0:14:32.166,000 --> 0:14:35,000
expect every student to succeed,

294
0:14:36.077,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.

295
0:14:39.569,000 --> 0:14:41,000
When we asked students what counts

296
0:14:42.285,000 --> 0:14:44,000
for success in mathematics,

297
0:14:45.021,000 --> 0:14:47,000
students in North America would typically tell us,

298
0:14:47.413,000 --> 0:14:48,000
you know, it's all about talent.

299
0:14:48.959,000 --> 0:14:52,000
If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.

300
0:14:53.585,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say

301
0:14:56.311,000 --> 0:15:,000
that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort,

302
0:15:00.557,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.

303
0:15:05.292,000 --> 0:15:09,000
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.

304
0:15:10.101,000 --> 0:15:13,000
High performers on PISA embrace diversity

305
0:15:13.433,000 --> 0:15:16,000
with differentiated pedagogical practices.

306
0:15:17.181,000 --> 0:15:18,000
They realize that

307
0:15:19.157,000 --> 0:15:22,000
ordinary students have extraordinary talents,

308
0:15:22.301,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and they personalize learning opportunities.

309
0:15:25.661,000 --> 0:15:27,000
High-performing systems also share

310
0:15:27.697,000 --> 0:15:3,000
clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.

311
0:15:31.303,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Every student knows what matters.

312
0:15:33.505,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Every student knows what's required to be successful.

313
0:15:37.592,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And nowhere does the quality of an education system

314
0:15:40.457,000 --> 0:15:42,000
exceed the quality of its teachers.

315
0:15:42.9,000 --> 0:15:45,000
High-performing systems are very careful

316
0:15:45.968,000 --> 0:15:47,000
in how they recruit and select their teachers

317
0:15:48.102,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and how they train them.

318
0:15:49.823,000 --> 0:15:51,000
They watch how they improve the performances of teachers

319
0:15:52.653,000 --> 0:15:54,000
in difficulties who are struggling,

320
0:15:54.973,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and how they structure teacher pay.

321
0:15:57.882,000 --> 0:16:,000
They provide an environment also in which teachers work together

322
0:16:01.578,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to frame good practice.

323
0:16:05.135,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow

324
0:16:09.296,000 --> 0:16:11,000
in their careers.

325
0:16:11.411,000 --> 0:16:12,000
In bureaucratic school systems,

326
0:16:13.035,000 --> 0:16:14,000
teachers are often left alone in classrooms

327
0:16:15.028,000 --> 0:16:18,000
with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.

328
0:16:18.195,000 --> 0:16:21,000
High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.

329
0:16:21.405,000 --> 0:16:23,000
They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable

330
0:16:24.179,000 --> 0:16:25,000
their teachers to figure out,

331
0:16:25.956,000 --> 0:16:29,000
what do I need to teach to my students today?

332
0:16:30.071,000 --> 0:16:34,000
The past was about delivered wisdom in education.

333
0:16:34.617,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.

334
0:16:39.859,000 --> 0:16:42,000
High performers have moved on from professional

335
0:16:43.499,000 --> 0:16:46,000
or from administrative forms of accountability and control --

336
0:16:47.163,000 --> 0:16:5,000
sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education --

337
0:16:50.4,000 --> 0:16:53,000
to professional forms of work organization.

338
0:16:54.066,000 --> 0:16:57,000
They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.

339
0:16:57.938,000 --> 0:16:59,000
They provide them with the kind of development they need

340
0:17:00.428,000 --> 0:17:04,000
to develop stronger pedagogical practices.

341
0:17:04.49,000 --> 0:17:09,000
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.

342
0:17:10.148,000 --> 0:17:12,000
High-performing systems have made teachers

343
0:17:12.882,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and school principals inventive.

344
0:17:16.168,000 --> 0:17:18,000
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes,

345
0:17:18.867,000 --> 0:17:2,000
on provision.

346
0:17:21.049,000 --> 0:17:23,000
The high-performing systems have helped teachers

347
0:17:23.852,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher,

348
0:17:26.293,000 --> 0:17:28,000
the next school around their lives.

349
0:17:28.986,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems

350
0:17:31.152,000 --> 0:17:34,000
is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.

351
0:17:34.299,000 --> 0:17:36,000
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA,

352
0:17:36.496,000 --> 0:17:37,000
but what makes Finland so impressive

353
0:17:38.186,000 --> 0:17:41,000
is that only five percent of the performance variation

354
0:17:42.163,000 --> 0:17:44,000
amongst students lies between schools.

355
0:17:44.619,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Every school succeeds.

356
0:17:46.935,000 --> 0:17:48,000
This is where success is systemic.

357
0:17:49.666,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And how do they do that?

358
0:17:51.37,000 --> 0:17:53,000
They invest resources where they can make the most difference.

359
0:17:54.062,000 --> 0:17:59,000
They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools,

360
0:17:59.17,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and the most talented teachers

361
0:18:01.378,000 --> 0:18:02,000
into the most challenging classroom.

362
0:18:03.321,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Last but not least, those countries align policies

363
0:18:06.45,000 --> 0:18:08,000
across all areas of public policy.

364
0:18:08.67,000 --> 0:18:11,000
They make them coherent over sustained periods of time,

365
0:18:11.803,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.

366
0:18:16.506,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Now, knowing what successful systems are doing

367
0:18:18.81,000 --> 0:18:2,000
doesn't yet tell us how to improve.

368
0:18:21.601,000 --> 0:18:23,000
That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits

369
0:18:24.059,000 --> 0:18:27,000
of international comparisons of PISA are.

370
0:18:27.534,000 --> 0:18:29,000
That's where other forms of research need to kick in,

371
0:18:30.237,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into

372
0:18:32.695,000 --> 0:18:33,000
telling countries what they should be doing.

373
0:18:34.455,000 --> 0:18:35,000
But its strength lies in telling them

374
0:18:36.278,000 --> 0:18:38,000
what everybody else has been doing.

375
0:18:39.033,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And the example of PISA shows that data

376
0:18:41.229,000 --> 0:18:44,000
can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy

377
0:18:44.547,000 --> 0:18:47,000
through which we usually run education systems.

378
0:18:48.488,000 --> 0:18:51,000
You know, some people argue that

379
0:18:51.526,000 --> 0:18:53,000
changing educational administration

380
0:18:53.714,000 --> 0:18:55,000
is like moving graveyards.

381
0:18:56.155,000 --> 0:19:,000
You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this. (Laughter)

382
0:19:01.042,000 --> 0:19:05,000
But PISA has shown what's possible in education.

383
0:19:05.909,000 --> 0:19:08,000
It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.

384
0:19:09.714,000 --> 0:19:13,000
It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.

385
0:19:13.922,000 --> 0:19:16,000
And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets

386
0:19:17.355,000 --> 0:19:2,000
in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.

387
0:19:20.453,000 --> 0:19:24,000
If we can help every child, every teacher, every school,

388
0:19:25.003,000 --> 0:19:28,000
every principal, every parent see what improvement is possible,

389
0:19:28.658,000 --> 0:19:3,000
that only the sky is the limit to education improvement,

390
0:19:31.394,000 --> 0:19:32,000
we have laid the foundations

391
0:19:33.29,000 --> 0:19:35,000
for better policies and better lives.

392
0:19:35.473,000 --> 0:19:37,000
Thank you.

393
0:19:38.006,000 --> 0:19:42,000
(Applause)

0:00:13.754,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Colfax Avenue, here in Denver, Colorado,

3
0:00:17.294,000 --> 0:00:2,000
was once called the longest, wickedest street in America.

4
0:00:22.252,000 --> 0:00:25,000
My office is there in the same place -- it's a medical desert.

5
0:00:26.014,000 --> 0:00:28,000
There are government clinics and hospitals nearby,

6
0:00:28.394,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but they're not enough to handle the poor who live in the area.

7
0:00:31.386,000 --> 0:00:33,000
By poor, I mean those who are on Medicaid.

8
0:00:34.022,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Not just for the homeless; 20 percent of this country is on Medicaid.

9
0:00:38.341,000 --> 0:00:42,000
If your neighbors have a family of four and make less than $33,000 a year,

10
0:00:42.579,000 --> 0:00:43,000
then they can get Medicaid.

11
0:00:44.849,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But they can't find a doctor to see them.

12
0:00:47.498,000 --> 0:00:48,000
A study by Merritt Hawkins

13
0:00:48.871,000 --> 0:00:5,000
found that only 20 percent of the family doctors in Denver

14
0:00:51.657,000 --> 0:00:52,000
take any Medicaid patients.

15
0:00:53.95,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And of those 20 percent, some have caps, like five Medicaid patients a month.

16
0:00:59.133,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Others make Medicaid patients wait months to be seen,

17
0:01:02.732,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but will see you today, if you have Blue Cross.

18
0:01:06.303,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This form of classist discrimination is legal

19
0:01:09.629,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and is not just a problem in Denver.

20
0:01:12.18,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Almost half the family doctors in the country

21
0:01:14.339,000 --> 0:01:16,000
refuse to see Medicaid patients.

22
0:01:17.165,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Why?

23
0:01:18.53,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Well, because Medicaid pays less than private insurance

24
0:01:21.248,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and because Medicaid patients are seen as more challenging.

25
0:01:26.053,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Some show up late for appointments, some don't speak English

26
0:01:28.902,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and some have trouble following instructions.

27
0:01:32.784,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I thought about this while in medical school.

28
0:01:36.466,000 --> 0:01:4,000
If I could design a practice that caters to low-income folks

29
0:01:40.76,000 --> 0:01:42,000
instead of avoiding them,

30
0:01:42.784,000 --> 0:01:46,000
then I would have guaranteed customers and very little competition.

31
0:01:47.6,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:48.958,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So after residency, I opened up shop, doing underserved medicine.

33
0:01:53.744,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Not as a nonprofit, but as a private practice.

34
0:01:56.823,000 --> 0:02:,000
A small business seeing only resettled refugees.

35
0:02:02.078,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That was six years ago,

36
0:02:03.267,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and since then, we've served 50,000 refugee medical visits.

37
0:02:06.744,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Applause)

38
0:02:14.287,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Ninety percent of our patients have Medicaid,

39
0:02:17.168,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and most of the rest, we see for free.

40
0:02:19.945,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Most doctors say you can't make money on Medicaid,

41
0:02:22.318,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but we're doing it just fine.

42
0:02:24.173,000 --> 0:02:25,000
How?

43
0:02:25.807,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Well, if this were real capitalism, then I wouldn't tell you,

44
0:02:28.697,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because you'd become my competition.

45
0:02:30.445,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:31.965,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But I call this "bleeding-heart" capitalism.

47
0:02:34.405,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:35.782,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And we need more people doing this, not less, so here's how.

49
0:02:40.243,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We break down the walls of our medical maze

50
0:02:43.22,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by taking the challenges of Medicaid patients,

51
0:02:45.626,000 --> 0:02:48,000
turning them into opportunities, and pocketing the difference.

52
0:02:50.387,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The nuts and bolts may seem simple, but they add up.

53
0:02:53.268,000 --> 0:02:55,000
For example, we have no appointments.

54
0:02:56.053,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We're walk-in only.

55
0:02:58.49,000 --> 0:03:,000
Of course, that's how it works at the emergency room,

56
0:03:01.03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
at urgent cares and at Taco Bell.

57
0:03:04.527,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:05.553,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But not usually at family doctor's offices.

59
0:03:08.857,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Why do we do it?

60
0:03:10.633,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Because Nasra can't call for an appointment.

61
0:03:13.927,000 --> 0:03:16,000
She has a phone, but she doesn't have phone minutes.

62
0:03:17.262,000 --> 0:03:2,000
She can't speak English, and she can't navigate a phone tree.

63
0:03:21.518,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And she can't show up on time for an appointment

64
0:03:23.844,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because she doesn't have a car, she takes the bus,

65
0:03:26.204,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and she takes care of three kids plus her disabled father.

66
0:03:30.331,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So we have no appointments;

67
0:03:31.688,000 --> 0:03:32,000
she shows up when she wants,

68
0:03:33.474,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but usually waits less than 15 minutes to be seen.

69
0:03:37.165,000 --> 0:03:4,000
She then spends as much time with us as she needs.

70
0:03:41.394,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Sometimes that's 40 minutes, usually it's less than five.

71
0:03:45.173,000 --> 0:03:46,000
She loves this flexibility.

72
0:03:47.196,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's how she saw doctors in Somalia.

73
0:03:50.236,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I love it, because I don't pay staff to do scheduling,

74
0:03:53.347,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and we have a zero no-show rate and a zero late-show rate.

75
0:03:56.668,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:59.737,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Applause)

77
0:04:04.327,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It makes business sense.

78
0:04:06.97,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Another difference is our office layout.

79
0:04:09.343,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Our exam rooms open right to the waiting room,

80
0:04:11.923,000 --> 0:04:13,000
our medical providers room their own patients,

81
0:04:14.415,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and our providers stay in one room instead of alternating between rooms.

82
0:04:19.383,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Cutting steps cuts costs and increases customer satisfaction.

83
0:04:24.708,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We also hand out free medicines, right from our exam room:

84
0:04:28.284,000 --> 0:04:3,000
over-the-counter ones and some prescription ones, too.

85
0:04:31.117,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If Nasra's baby is sick,

86
0:04:33.188,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we put a bottle of children's Tylenol or amoxicillin right in her hand.

87
0:04:37.49,000 --> 0:04:4,000
She can take that baby straight back home instead of stopping at the pharmacy.

88
0:04:43.21,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I don't know about you, but I get sick just looking at all those choices.

89
0:04:47.053,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Nasra doesn't stand a chance in there.

90
0:04:51.49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We also text patients.

91
0:04:53.522,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We're open evenings and weekends.

92
0:04:55.411,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We do home visits.

93
0:04:56.617,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We've jumped dead car batteries.

94
0:04:58.862,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:00.109,000 --> 0:05:04,000
With customer satisfaction so high, we've never had to advertise,

96
0:05:04.45,000 --> 0:05:06,000
yet are growing at 25 percent a year.

97
0:05:08.292,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And we've become real good at working with Medicaid,

98
0:05:11.174,000 --> 0:05:14,000
since it's pretty much the only insurance company we deal with.

99
0:05:14.942,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Other doctor's offices chase 10 insurance companies

100
0:05:17.356,000 --> 0:05:18,000
just to make ends meet.

101
0:05:19.053,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's just draining.

102
0:05:21.165,000 --> 0:05:25,000
A single-payer system is like monogamy: it just works better.

103
0:05:25.394,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:27.961,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

105
0:05:31.497,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Of course, Medicaid is funded by tax payers like you,

106
0:05:35.093,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so you might be wondering, "How much does this cost the system?"

107
0:05:38.506,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Well, we're cheaper than the alternatives.

108
0:05:41.093,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Some of our patients might go to the emergency room,

109
0:05:43.57,000 --> 0:05:45,000
which can cost thousands, just for a simple cold.

110
0:05:46.795,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Some may stay home and let their problems get worse.

111
0:05:50.272,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But most would try to make an appointment at a clinic that's part of the system

112
0:05:56.141,000 --> 0:05:59,000
called the Federally Qualified Health Centers.

113
0:06:00.792,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is a nationwide network of safety-net clinics

114
0:06:04.371,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that receive twice as much government funding per visit

115
0:06:08.538,000 --> 0:06:09,000
than private doctors like me.

116
0:06:11.688,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Not only they get more money,

117
0:06:13.109,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but by law, there can only be one in each area.

118
0:06:16.568,000 --> 0:06:19,000
That means they have a monopoly on special funding for the poor.

119
0:06:21.002,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And like any monopoly,

120
0:06:22.344,000 --> 0:06:25,000
there's a tendency for cost to go up and quality to go down.

121
0:06:27.645,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I'm not a government entity; I'm not a nonprofit.

122
0:06:31.398,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'm a private practice.

123
0:06:32.882,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I have a capitalist drive to innovate.

124
0:06:35.938,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I have to be fast and friendly.

125
0:06:39.12,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I have to be cost-effective and culturally sensitive.

126
0:06:43.692,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I have to be tall, dark and handsome.

127
0:06:46.153,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:47.701,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:49.288,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And if I'm not, I'm going out of business.

130
0:06:52.387,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I can innovate faster than a nonprofit,

131
0:06:54.434,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because I don't need a meeting to move a stapler.

132
0:06:57.311,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

133
0:07:03.336,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Really, none of our innovations are new or unique --

134
0:07:06.509,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we just put them together in a unique way

135
0:07:08.501,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to help low-income folks while making money.

136
0:07:11.287,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then, instead of taking that money home,

137
0:07:13.359,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I put it back into the refugee community as a business expense.

138
0:07:17.794,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This is Mango House.

139
0:07:19.342,000 --> 0:07:2,000
My version of a medical home.

140
0:07:21.999,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In it, we have programs to feed and clothe the poor,

141
0:07:24.818,000 --> 0:07:27,000
an after-school program, English classes,

142
0:07:27.917,000 --> 0:07:31,000
churches, dentist, legal help, mental health and the scout groups.

143
0:07:33.821,000 --> 0:07:35,000
These programs are run by tenant organizations

144
0:07:36.298,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and amazing staff,

145
0:07:38.196,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but all receive some amount of funding form profits from my clinic.

146
0:07:45.221,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Some call this social entrepreneurship.

147
0:07:49.253,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I call it social-service arbitrage.

148
0:07:52.911,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Exploiting inefficiencies in our health care system to serve the poor.

149
0:07:57.974,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We're serving 15,000 refugees a year

150
0:08:00.302,000 --> 0:08:02,000
at less cost than where else they would be going.

151
0:08:05.093,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Of course, there's downsides to doing this as a private business,

152
0:08:08.173,000 --> 0:08:1,000
rather than as a nonprofit or a government entity.

153
0:08:10.609,000 --> 0:08:13,000
There's taxes and legal exposures.

154
0:08:14.544,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There's changing Medicaid rates and specialists who don't take Medicaid.

155
0:08:19.633,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And there's bomb threats.

156
0:08:22.686,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Notice there's no apostrophes, it's like,

157
0:08:25.408,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"We were going to blow up all you refugees!"

158
0:08:27.623,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:33.292,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"We were going to blow up all you refugees,

160
0:08:35.363,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but then we went to your English class, instead."

161
0:08:37.721,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:41.326,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Applause)

163
0:08:47.429,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now, you might be thinking, "This guy's a bit different."

164
0:08:50.12,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

165
0:08:51.214,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Uncommon.

166
0:08:52.432,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:53.457,000 --> 0:08:54,000
A communal narcissist?

168
0:08:55.299,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:56.355,000 --> 0:08:57,000
A unicorn, maybe,

170
0:08:57.53,000 --> 0:09:,000
because if this was so easy, then other doctors would be doing it.

171
0:09:01.633,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Well, based on Medicaid rates, you can do this in most of the country.

172
0:09:04.974,000 --> 0:09:05,000
You can be your own boss,

173
0:09:06.595,000 --> 0:09:08,000
help the poor and make good money doing it.

174
0:09:09.381,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Medical folks,

175
0:09:10.619,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you wrote on your school application essays

176
0:09:12.659,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that you wanted to help those less fortunate.

177
0:09:15.34,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But then you had your idealism beaten out of you in training.

178
0:09:18.922,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Your creativity bred out of you.

179
0:09:21.922,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It doesn't have to be that way.

180
0:09:24.383,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You can choose underserved medicine as a lifestyle specialty.

181
0:09:29.022,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Or you can be a specialist

182
0:09:30.602,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who cuts cost in order to see low-income folks.

183
0:09:34.53,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And for the rest of you, who don't work in health care,

184
0:09:37.195,000 --> 0:09:39,000
what did you write on your applications?

185
0:09:39.242,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Most of us wanted to save the world, to make a difference.

186
0:09:43.885,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Maybe you've been successful in your career

187
0:09:45.98,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but are now looking for that meaning?

188
0:09:48.752,000 --> 0:09:49,000
How can you get there?

189
0:09:51.53,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I don't just mean giving a few dollars or a few hours;

190
0:09:54.093,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I mean how can you use your expertise to innovate new ways of serving others.

191
0:10:00.419,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It might be easier than you think.

192
0:10:03.617,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The only way we're going to bridge the underserved medicine gap

193
0:10:06.641,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is by seeing it as a business opportunity.

194
0:10:08.688,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The only way we're going to bridge the inequality gap

195
0:10:11.196,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is by recognizing our privileges and using them to help others.

196
0:10:16.238,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Applause)

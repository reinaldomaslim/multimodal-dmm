0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Welcome to Bayeku,

2
0:00:15.12,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos --

3
0:00:18.52,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria,

4
0:00:24.92,000 --> 0:00:27,000
communities whose waterways have been infested

5
0:00:28.92,000 --> 0:00:3,000
by an invasive aquatic weed;

6
0:00:31.8,000 --> 0:00:36,000
communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered:

7
0:00:37.08,000 --> 0:00:4,000
fishing, marine transportation

8
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and trading;

9
0:00:41.6,000 --> 0:00:45,000
communities where fish yields have diminished;

10
0:00:45.8,000 --> 0:00:49,000
communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school

11
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for days, sometimes weeks, on end.

12
0:00:54.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Who would have thought that this plant

13
0:00:57.64,000 --> 0:01:03,000
with round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers

14
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:07,000
would cause such havoc in these communities.

15
0:01:08.2,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The plant is known as water hyacinth

16
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes.

17
0:01:14.32,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names,

18
0:01:18.88,000 --> 0:01:2,000
names associated with historical events,

19
0:01:21.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
as well as myths.

20
0:01:23.68,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In some places, the plant is called Babangida.

21
0:01:27.8,000 --> 0:01:32,000
When you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups.

22
0:01:32.96,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And you think: fear, restraint.

23
0:01:36.32,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola.

24
0:01:41.72,000 --> 0:01:45,000
When you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections

25
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and you think: dashed hopes.

26
0:01:48.8,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In the southwestern part of Nigeria,

27
0:01:51.36,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the plant is known as Gbe'borun.

28
0:01:53.6,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase

29
0:01:55.4,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which translates to "gossip," or "talebearer."

30
0:01:59.4,000 --> 0:02:04,000
When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction.

31
0:02:05.24,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,

32
0:02:07.8,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,

33
0:02:10.68,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And when you hear that, you think of death.

34
0:02:13.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It literally translates to "death to mother and child."

35
0:02:18.28,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009.

36
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria.

37
0:02:28.92,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'd quit my job in corporate America

38
0:02:31.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and decided to take this big leap of faith,

39
0:02:34.68,000 --> 0:02:37,000
a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction

40
0:02:38.2,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria

41
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in the area of sustainable development.

42
0:02:42.84,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And so here I was in the year 2009,

43
0:02:45.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
actually, at the end of 2009,

44
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.

45
0:02:51.04,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image.

46
0:02:55.72,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It was an image of fishing boats

47
0:02:57.52,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth.

48
0:03:03.28,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And I was really pained by what I saw

49
0:03:05.68,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because I thought to myself,

50
0:03:07.2,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"These poor fisherfolk,

51
0:03:09.08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
how are they going to go about their daily activities

52
0:03:13.96,000 --> 0:03:15,000
with these restrictions."

53
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And then I thought, "There's got to be a better way."

54
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
A win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of

55
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
by the weeds being cleared out of the way

56
0:03:26.6,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and then this being turned into an economic benefit

57
0:03:29.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for the communities whose lives are impacted the most

58
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
by the infestation of the weed.

59
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
That, I would say, was my spark moment.

60
0:03:38.76,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so I did further research to find out more

61
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:44,000
about the beneficial uses of this weed.

62
0:03:45.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Out of the several, one struck me the most.

63
0:03:48.64,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It was the use of the plant for handicrafts.

64
0:03:51.76,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I thought, "What a great idea."

65
0:03:54.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Personally, I love handicrafts,

66
0:03:56.52,000 --> 0:04:,000
especially handicrafts that are woven around a story.

67
0:04:01.2,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And so I thought, "This could be easily deployed within the communities

68
0:04:05.84,000 --> 0:04:08,000
without the requirement of technical skills."

69
0:04:09.4,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I thought to myself, "Three simple steps to a mega solution."

70
0:04:15.04,000 --> 0:04:2,000
First step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth.

71
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That way, you create access.

72
0:04:22.48,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Secondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems.

73
0:04:27.08,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products.

74
0:04:32.519,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The third step was a challenge.

75
0:04:34.92,000 --> 0:04:36,000
See, I'm a computer scientist by background

76
0:04:37.64,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and not someone in the creative arts.

77
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And so I began my quest

78
0:04:42.04,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to find out how I can learn how to weave.

79
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,

80
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
called Sabo.

81
0:04:50.6,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters."

82
0:04:53.48,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And the community is predominantly made up of people

83
0:04:56.52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from the northern part of the country.

84
0:04:58.52,000 --> 0:05:,000
So I literally took my dried weeds in hand,

85
0:05:01.48,000 --> 0:05:02,000
there were several more of them,

86
0:05:03.08,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me

87
0:05:06.44,000 --> 0:05:1,000
how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes.

88
0:05:10.88,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya.

89
0:05:14.88,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English

90
0:05:17.92,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and neither did I speak Hausa.

91
0:05:20.04,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But some little kids came to the rescue

92
0:05:22.2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and helped translate.

93
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And that began my journey of learning how to weave

94
0:05:27.28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and transform these dried water hyacinth stems

95
0:05:31.88,000 --> 0:05:33,000
into long ropes.

96
0:05:35.4,000 --> 0:05:37,000
With my long ropes in hand,

97
0:05:37.68,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I was now equipped to make products.

98
0:05:40.8,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And that was the beginning of partnerships.

99
0:05:43.24,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products.

100
0:05:47.24,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So with this in hand, I felt confident

101
0:05:50.04,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that I would be able to take this knowledge

102
0:05:52.064,000 --> 0:05:54,000
back into the riverine communities

103
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity.

104
0:05:59.92,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So taking these weeds and actually weaving them

105
0:06:03.12,000 --> 0:06:05,000
into products that can be sold.

106
0:06:05.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So we have pens, we have tableware,

107
0:06:09.48,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we have purses, we have tissue boxes.

108
0:06:13.28,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Thereby, helping the communities

109
0:06:15.84,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to see water hyacinth in a different light.

110
0:06:19.04,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable,

111
0:06:21.72,000 --> 0:06:27,000
being aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient.

112
0:06:27.88,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Changing names, changing livelihoods.

113
0:06:31.28,000 --> 0:06:33,000
From Gbe'borun, gossip,

114
0:06:34.28,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to Olusotan, storyteller.

115
0:06:37.12,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is "killer of mother and child,"

116
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,

117
0:06:43.52,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"provider of food for mother and child."

118
0:06:46.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis.

119
0:06:50.8,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He said, "If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories.

120
0:06:55.84,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And if you want to change a culture, change the stories."

121
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi,

122
0:07:05.04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,

123
0:07:08.72,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we have changed the story.

124
0:07:11.32,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Thank you for listening.

125
0:07:12.88,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.565,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There is a pastor in Baltimore.

2
0:00:14.938,000 --> 0:00:15,000
His name is Michael Phillips,

3
0:00:16.699,000 --> 0:00:18,000
he is the pastor of Kingdom Life Church,

4
0:00:18.818,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and he often talks about how problems show up in our lives so arrogantly,

5
0:00:23.985,000 --> 0:00:27,000
with so much confidence, as if there is just nothing we can do about them.

6
0:00:28.132,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And the murder rate in Baltimore had been doing that.

7
0:00:30.633,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Year after year, it just kept showing up as this big thing

8
0:00:34.739,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that there was nothing any of us could do anything about.

9
0:00:37.884,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But the thing about Baltimore

10
0:00:40.13,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is that it has never been the one to just be defeated.

11
0:00:43.982,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So the story about the Baltimore Ceasefire

12
0:00:46.716,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is that Baltimore looked the murder rate in the eye

13
0:00:50.175,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and said, "What you're not going to do is snatch our greatness."

14
0:00:54.899,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So two years ago, I'm at a 300 Man March meeting.

15
0:00:58.665,000 --> 0:01:,000
At the time, I was a leader in that movement.

16
0:01:00.786,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And this guy named Ogun --

17
0:01:02.409,000 --> 0:01:04,000
he's like a godfather of hip-hop in Baltimore --

18
0:01:04.818,000 --> 0:01:05,000
he came over to me and he said,

19
0:01:06.41,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Yo, I have this idea about calling a ceasefire in Baltimore,

20
0:01:09.945,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I feel like you are somebody I should talk to about that."

21
0:01:12.912,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I was like, "I'm absolutely somebody you should talk to about that,

22
0:01:16.27,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because that's something we should do."

23
0:01:18.152,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And so we played phone tag and meeting tag,

24
0:01:20.221,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and two years went by and we never really sat down and talked about it.

25
0:01:24.551,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So now we're in May of 2017.

26
0:01:27.426,000 --> 0:01:3,000
My son Paul, he's 19 years old, he's driving me home from work one day,

27
0:01:31.401,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and he says, "Ma, did you know that the murder rate in Baltimore

28
0:01:34.426,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is higher than it's ever been?"

29
0:01:36.006,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I said, "What you mean it's higher than it's ever been?

30
0:01:38.975,000 --> 0:01:39,000
How is that possible?

31
0:01:40.38,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Like, I mean, what about people who say they have connections to the streets?

32
0:01:44.025,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Why won't they use those connections and call a cease-fire or something?"

33
0:01:47.531,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And on and on I went

34
0:01:48.797,000 --> 0:01:52,000
from my own feelings of helplessness about what other people weren't doing.

35
0:01:53.261,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The next morning I woke up

36
0:01:55.043,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and I realized that what I was really angry about

37
0:01:57.433,000 --> 0:01:59,000
wasn't about what other people weren't doing,

38
0:02:00.289,000 --> 0:02:02,000
it was that I had heard this message years ago,

39
0:02:03.099,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I hadn't moved on it.

40
0:02:04.496,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So it was about what I was supposed to be doing.

41
0:02:07.297,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So I got up and I'm going,

42
0:02:09.36,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"OK, if we could just have three days

43
0:02:11.498,000 --> 0:02:13,000
where everybody in the city was committing,

44
0:02:14.164,000 --> 0:02:16,000
nobody is going to kill anybody,

45
0:02:17.003,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we're going to celebrate life instead,

46
0:02:19.459,000 --> 0:02:2,000
when can we do that?"

47
0:02:20.634,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So it's May, I look at my calendar,

48
0:02:22.389,000 --> 0:02:25,000
all right, I've got some free time the first weekend in August,

49
0:02:26.328,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we'll do it August 4th through August 6th, right?

50
0:02:29.971,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So I'm all excited, I start driving to work,

51
0:02:32.897,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the more I drive, the scareder I get.

52
0:02:36.685,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And so I start going, "Never mind ...

53
0:02:39.693,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:40.718,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I won't say this thing out loud.

55
0:02:42.32,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Nobody will ever know I was thinking it if I don't say it."

56
0:02:45.165,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But it wouldn't let me go,

57
0:02:47.349,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because God loves to show up as us,

58
0:02:51.046,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and because I look broken

59
0:02:52.713,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and I'm always called to stand in my wholeness,

60
0:02:55.332,000 --> 0:02:57,000
there was a call on my life to say this thing out loud.

61
0:02:58.198,000 --> 0:03:,000
And because my city looks broken

62
0:03:00.38,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and is always yearning to show up in its wholeness,

63
0:03:03.444,000 --> 0:03:06,000
there were hearts that morning calling all through my chest

64
0:03:07.278,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that people around this city wanted to do something great together.

65
0:03:10.81,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And people who had already been killed in my city

66
0:03:14.438,000 --> 0:03:15,000
were calling to me

67
0:03:16.135,000 --> 0:03:18,000
up through my gut and my chest,

68
0:03:18.707,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as a knot in my throat, "Yo, E, you cannot just let us be dead in vain

69
0:03:23.827,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when you know how to say this thing out loud."

70
0:03:26.158,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I responded to them with my fear.

71
0:03:28.895,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"But somebody might get killed anyway that weekend."

72
0:03:31.595,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And that was the moment where I had to accept

73
0:03:33.788,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that maybe while we're out spreading this message --

74
0:03:36.662,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"Hey, nobody's going to kill anybody. We're going to celebrate life!" --

75
0:03:40.076,000 --> 0:03:43,000
maybe somebody will be plotting to take a life right then and there,

76
0:03:43.442,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but now they would have a rumbling in their spirit.

77
0:03:47.532,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And so I knew it was time for my city

78
0:03:50.074,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to have a collective rumbling in our spirit.

79
0:03:53.693,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So I got on the phone, got around to Ogun,

80
0:03:56.51,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I said, "Yo, you said you wanted to do a cease-fire?

81
0:03:59.174,000 --> 0:04:,000
What is it? I'm ready."

82
0:04:00.364,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So he said, "You know, when I hear about the Israelis and Palestinians at war,

83
0:04:04.596,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm like, that's too bad, they should stop that,

84
0:04:06.859,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but when I hear the word 'cease-fire,'

85
0:04:08.712,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that makes me pause and stop and really research what's going on."

86
0:04:12.11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And he wanted Baltimore to get that same kind of attention

87
0:04:15.089,000 --> 0:04:16,000
from the outside,

88
0:04:16.293,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but introspection from the inside about what was going on with us.

89
0:04:20.146,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And we talked about how it couldn't belong to one person.

90
0:04:23.178,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Not one person or one organization should call a cease-fire.

91
0:04:26.621,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The whole city had to own it and do it together.

92
0:04:30.172,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So we had our first meeting in May.

93
0:04:32.122,000 --> 0:04:34,000
About 12 or 15 people show up,

94
0:04:34.7,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and this is where it gets named the Baltimore Ceasefire,

95
0:04:37.873,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because you know what that means when you hear the word "cease-fire."

96
0:04:41.188,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Just don't kill nobody.

97
0:04:42.547,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And this is where the Baltimore Peace Challenge was born.

98
0:04:46.216,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Because it's not just about not being violent.

99
0:04:48.913,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It is about being purposefully peaceful.

100
0:04:52.166,000 --> 0:04:53,000
What is going on in your thoughts?

101
0:04:54.042,000 --> 0:04:57,000
What kind of petty things are you not saying out of your mouth?

102
0:04:57.186,000 --> 0:05:,000
How are you responding in your behaviors to conflict?

103
0:05:00.749,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I grabbed up five people who I trusted,

104
0:05:03.289,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and the six of us became the organizing squad.

105
0:05:06.411,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So let's give them props real quick.

106
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
On the count of three, I want you to yell "squad."

107
0:05:11.021,000 --> 0:05:12,000
One, two, three: squad! Audience: Squad!

108
0:05:13.116,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And it's Shellers's birthday. Happy birthday, Shellers.

109
0:05:15.727,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Audience: Happy birthday!

110
0:05:17.021,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so we put out a press release,

111
0:05:19.355,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the media told us, this is not really a story yet,

112
0:05:22.149,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we will get with you on August 7th to see how the cease-fire went.

113
0:05:25.53,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So we went, "Oh, word? Oh, all right then."

114
0:05:28.17,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And Baltimore got to work,

115
0:05:29.508,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and not only did people send money to the PayPal account

116
0:05:32.849,000 --> 0:05:34,000
so we could buy flyers and posters,

117
0:05:35.126,000 --> 0:05:37,000
people came and got the flyers and posters

118
0:05:37.754,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and they put them all around the city,

119
0:05:39.873,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and people were having conversations with each other.

120
0:05:42.478,000 --> 0:05:45,000
What kind of resources do you need? What are you going through?

121
0:05:45.938,000 --> 0:05:46,000
What has happened to you?

122
0:05:47.183,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Because we understand the root causes of violence in this country.

123
0:05:51.413,000 --> 0:05:53,000
People who said it wouldn't work still ended their sentence

124
0:05:54.215,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with "but please keep trying. Somebody needs to do something anyway."

125
0:05:58.017,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Teenagers who would tell us

126
0:05:59.732,000 --> 0:06:02,000
about the stuff they were doing in the streets all day asked,

127
0:06:02.831,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"But can I have a poster to put it on my wall at night

128
0:06:05.75,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so I can see it on my way to bed?"

129
0:06:08.14,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Gangsters were calling, saying,

130
0:06:09.736,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"I can tell you where violence is not going to come from,

131
0:06:12.665,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because we're committing to the Peace Challenge."

132
0:06:15.065,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And they kept their word.

133
0:06:16.34,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When people said, "It's not going to work,

134
0:06:18.364,000 --> 0:06:2,000
because somebody's going to kill over West or over East,"

135
0:06:21.07,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we said, "That doesn't matter. It's about self-determination, yo.

136
0:06:24.661,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You telling me you can't keep this three- or six-block radius safe?"

137
0:06:28.107,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And they would say, "Don't get it twisted.

138
0:06:30.132,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It's going to stay safe around here." And they kept their promise.

139
0:06:33.719,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

140
0:06:41.031,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Four songs --

141
0:06:42.509,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and I know it looks like I'm holding up five fingers,

142
0:06:45.072,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but I have four fingers, so this is four for me --

143
0:06:47.501,000 --> 0:06:49,000
four songs got made about the Baltimore Ceasefire,

144
0:06:50.21,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and the one that most exemplifies it,

145
0:06:53.012,000 --> 0:06:55,000
where a bunch of artists came together and made a song,

146
0:06:55.83,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that one is currently nominated for a Grammy out here. Right?

147
0:07:00.142,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And so now what was happening

148
0:07:02.801,000 --> 0:07:05,000
was from the most beautiful corners of crack houses

149
0:07:05.838,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to the grimiest corners of politicians' offices,

150
0:07:09.281,000 --> 0:07:1,000
everybody --

151
0:07:10.494,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:12.13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
was talking about this thing Baltimore was doing together. Right?

153
0:07:16.762,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And then, the weekend came:

154
0:07:19.44,000 --> 0:07:22,000
events all over the city, people yelling "Happy Ceasefire Day!"

155
0:07:22.83,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Over 200 people got their records expunged and got jobs,

156
0:07:26.011,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and people went into drug recovery programs

157
0:07:28.71,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because of what was happening in our city that weekend.

158
0:07:31.869,000 --> 0:07:33,000
People were going, "But the air feels different in Baltimore.

159
0:07:34.86,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Nobody's mother got that phone call last night.

160
0:07:37.086,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I didn't hear any gunshots."

161
0:07:38.515,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And on Saturday, Trey went to go get a job

162
0:07:41.61,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and was excited about it.

163
0:07:42.939,000 --> 0:07:44,000
At 24 hours of no killing,

164
0:07:45.053,000 --> 0:07:5,000
we were singing Kendrick Lamar. "We gon' be alright. We gon' be alright."

165
0:07:50.388,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And then at 4:59 on Saturday,

166
0:07:53.261,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we get a message that somebody was killed.

167
0:07:55.306,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We didn't know his name, but it turned out to be Trey.

168
0:08:00.988,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we rushed over to Sargeant Street,

169
0:08:04.181,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and we held hands in a circle

170
0:08:06.433,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and we looked at the pavement,

171
0:08:08.12,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and we said, "This is sacred ground because we make it so,

172
0:08:12.238,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because everywhere in our city where people lose their lives to violence

173
0:08:16.13,000 --> 0:08:18,000
needs to be sacred ground."

174
0:08:18.199,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And it wasn't just about upholding Trey and his transition

175
0:08:22.49,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and sending love to his family.

176
0:08:25.07,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It was about us pausing to really think about what must it feel like

177
0:08:29.557,000 --> 0:08:32,000
20 minutes after you kill somebody?

178
0:08:32.674,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Can't we pour love into that?

179
0:08:35.116,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Because until we do, we will not heal this epidemic.

180
0:08:39.107,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Later on in the day, we get another call.

181
0:08:42.937,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Dante is murdered.

182
0:08:44.605,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So by the end of this day, we were shook.

183
0:08:47.898,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In real life, we were shook,

184
0:08:49.793,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because we had opened up our hearts together

185
0:08:52.287,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and changed the atmosphere of this city,

186
0:08:54.217,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and now our hearts were broken together.

187
0:08:56.923,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And we had to be honest about the fact that last weekend,

188
0:09:00.281,000 --> 0:09:02,000
when we lost six people to violence,

189
0:09:02.526,000 --> 0:09:05,000
it didn't feel the way it felt this weekend when we lost these two,

190
0:09:06.227,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because now we were paying attention.

191
0:09:09.376,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now we were all hoping together

192
0:09:11.774,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that nobody got killed.

193
0:09:13.762,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And so we had to make a vow with ourselves

194
0:09:17.083,000 --> 0:09:21,000
not to be numb anymore when we lose people in our city.

195
0:09:21.861,000 --> 0:09:26,000
These two lives were going to remind us to vibrate higher and to move forward.

196
0:09:27.725,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So as we move forward into Baltimore Ceasefire 365,

197
0:09:32.204,000 --> 0:09:34,000
because there's work that needs to be done all year,

198
0:09:34.689,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and there's another cease-fire happening next weekend,

199
0:09:37.371,000 --> 0:09:4,000
November 3rd through 5th. Mark your calendar.

200
0:09:40.403,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Applause)

201
0:09:41.428,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Right? And we expect the same thing.

202
0:09:43.491,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It was news media from all around the world,

203
0:09:45.654,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Australia and Norway and China.

204
0:09:47.359,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Everybody wanted to come get this work from Baltimore,

205
0:09:49.908,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and y'all could come get it. Right?

206
0:09:52.198,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So as we push forward, we don't need to keep asking now

207
0:09:55.346,000 --> 0:09:56,000
"What can we do?"

208
0:09:56.521,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We have seen the power of collective consciousness.

209
0:10:00.029,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Y'all were the ones who misunderstood Baltimore.

210
0:10:02.786,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Y'all thought Baltimore was just "The Wire."

211
0:10:05.763,000 --> 0:10:06,000
When we lost Freddie Gray,

212
0:10:07.565,000 --> 0:10:08,000
y'all saw the Baltimore uprising,

213
0:10:09.574,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and people around this world mischaracterized it and misunderstood it.

214
0:10:13.889,000 --> 0:10:18,000
What you failed to realize is Baltimore is the power to rise up,

215
0:10:19.541,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and that is what we continue to do.

216
0:10:21.849,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Applause)

217
0:10:22.966,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And so as we move forward, we see you, America,

218
0:10:26.498,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with your systems of violent oppression trying to beat us into the ground,

219
0:10:30.927,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and still, we rise.

220
0:10:33.054,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We rise and stand with cities all over this country just like us

221
0:10:37.825,000 --> 0:10:39,000
who are handed, through no fault of their own,

222
0:10:40.444,000 --> 0:10:42,000
criminal conditions in which to live,

223
0:10:42.857,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and then they get labeled savages for how they live.

224
0:10:46.945,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We stand with them.

225
0:10:48.953,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We remind them we are an example of what you can do when you say,

226
0:10:52.987,000 --> 0:10:55,000
"No, I don't have to accept these conditions

227
0:10:56.083,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that you are trying to hand me.

228
0:10:57.612,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I get to decide what the greatest vision of myself looks like.

229
0:11:02.956,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And so the next time

230
0:11:05.683,000 --> 0:11:08,000
you are faced with a dilemma, with a problem,

231
0:11:09.045,000 --> 0:11:12,000
you can say, "Let me be like Baltimore,

232
0:11:12.596,000 --> 0:11:14,000
let me look it in the face,

233
0:11:15.06,000 --> 0:11:16,000
let me tell it."

234
0:11:16.554,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But what you're not going to do is snatch my greatness.

235
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Please believe it.

236
0:11:22.141,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Thank you.

237
0:11:23.316,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Applause)

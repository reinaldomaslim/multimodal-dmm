1
0:00:13.166,000 --> 0:00:14,000
For much of the past century,

2
0:00:14.882,000 --> 0:00:16,000
architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.

3
0:00:18.396,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto

4
0:00:22.015,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and detrimental straitjacket,

5
0:00:24.292,000 --> 0:00:26,000
as it liberated architecture from the decorative,

6
0:00:27.285,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose.

7
0:00:32.418,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Of course, architecture is about function,

8
0:00:35.148,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,

9
0:00:38.839,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I want to propose a completely different quality.

10
0:00:43.14,000 --> 0:00:44,000
If form follows fiction,

11
0:00:45.556,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories --

12
0:00:49.763,000 --> 0:00:51,000
stories of the people that live there,

13
0:00:52.267,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of the people that work in these buildings.

14
0:00:55.088,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create.

15
0:00:59.965,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In this sense, I'm interested in fiction

16
0:01:02.592,000 --> 0:01:05,000
not as the implausible but as the real,

17
0:01:06.194,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as the reality of what architecture means

18
0:01:08.216,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for the people that live in it and with it.

19
0:01:11.666,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Our buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living

20
0:01:15.289,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or how the space of working could be different,

21
0:01:18.728,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today.

22
0:01:23.246,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Our buildings are real; they're being built.

23
0:01:25.35,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They're an explicit engagement in physical reality

24
0:01:28.233,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and conceptual possibility.

25
0:01:32.013,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I think of our architecture as organizational structures.

26
0:01:36.276,000 --> 0:01:39,000
At their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system:

27
0:01:39.928,000 --> 0:01:42,000
How can we arrange things in both a functional

28
0:01:43.103,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and experiential way?

29
0:01:46.188,000 --> 0:01:48,000
How can we create structures that generate a series

30
0:01:48.88,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of relationships and narratives?

31
0:01:51.672,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And how can fictive stories

32
0:01:53.287,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of the inhabitants and users of our buildings

33
0:01:56.125,000 --> 0:01:57,000
script the architecture,

34
0:01:58.101,000 --> 0:02:01,000
while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?

35
0:02:02.428,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And here comes the second term into play,

36
0:02:04.437,000 --> 0:02:06,000
what I call "narrative hybrids" --

37
0:02:06.699,000 --> 0:02:08,000
structures of multiple simultaneous stories

38
0:02:09.468,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that unfold throughout the buildings we create.

39
0:02:12.706,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships,

40
0:02:17.59,000 --> 0:02:19,000
both in a programmatic and functional way

41
0:02:20.898,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and in an experiential and emotive or social way.

42
0:02:27.187,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster,

43
0:02:29.958,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.

44
0:02:33.882,000 --> 0:02:37,000
When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image:

45
0:02:38.045,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a forest of several hundred skyscrapers

46
0:02:40.236,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to emerge in the central business district,

47
0:02:42.331,000 --> 0:02:44,000
except at that time, only a handful of them existed.

48
0:02:45.389,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about,

49
0:02:48.676,000 --> 0:02:51,000
except one thing: it would all be about verticality.

50
0:02:52.366,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical -- it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,

51
0:02:57.169,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the top always the best, the bottom the worst,

52
0:02:59.609,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and the taller you are, the better, so it seems.

53
0:03:03.661,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And we wanted to ask ourselves,

54
0:03:05.194,000 --> 0:03:07,000
could a building be about a completely different quality?

55
0:03:08.011,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Could it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system

56
0:03:11.988,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that is more about collaboration, rather than isolation?

57
0:03:15.236,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So we took this needle and bent it back into itself,

58
0:03:18.314,000 --> 0:03:2,000
into a loop of interconnected activities.

59
0:03:21.866,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making

60
0:03:25.169,000 --> 0:03:28,000
into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting,

61
0:03:29.18,000 --> 0:03:31,000
research and training, administration --

62
0:03:31.426,000 --> 0:03:34,000
all into a circuit of interconnected activities

63
0:03:35.118,000 --> 0:03:38,000
where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration.

64
0:03:39.959,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I still very much like this image.

65
0:03:41.801,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body

66
0:03:44.948,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school.

67
0:03:47.876,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance,

68
0:03:51.897,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but as an organism, as a life form.

69
0:03:54.436,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And as you start to dissect this organism,

70
0:03:56.807,000 --> 0:04:,000
you can identify a series of primary technical clusters --

71
0:04:01.56,000 --> 0:04:03,000
program production, broadcasting center and news.

72
0:04:04.857,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters:

73
0:04:08.361,000 --> 0:04:11,000
meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --

74
0:04:11.449,000 --> 0:04:14,000
informal spaces for people to meet and exchange.

75
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid

76
0:04:19.522,000 --> 0:04:21,000
between the technical and the social,

77
0:04:21.992,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the human and the performative.

78
0:04:24.333,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system,

79
0:04:27.997,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff

80
0:04:31.93,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to experience all these different functions in a great unity.

81
0:04:37.118,000 --> 0:04:4,000
With 473,000 square meters,

82
0:04:40.202,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world.

83
0:04:43.237,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It has a population of over 10,000 people,

84
0:04:45.929,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension

85
0:04:49.539,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of many things and the scale of typical architecture.

86
0:04:52.323,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So we stopped work for a while

87
0:04:53.975,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model,

88
0:04:58.304,000 --> 0:05:02,000
just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant.

89
0:05:03.261,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But of course, it's not a number,

90
0:05:04.895,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building,

91
0:05:09.528,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture,

92
0:05:14.005,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we identified five characters, hypothetical characters,

93
0:05:17.275,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building,

94
0:05:21.868,000 --> 0:05:23,000
thought of where they would meet, what they would experience.

95
0:05:24.775,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So it was a way to script and design the building, but of course,

96
0:05:27.938,000 --> 0:05:29,000
also to communicate its experiences.

97
0:05:29.999,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art

98
0:05:33.311,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in both New York and Beijing.

99
0:05:36.865,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is the main broadcast control room,

100
0:05:39.088,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a technical installation so large,

101
0:05:40.93,000 --> 0:05:43,000
it can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously.

102
0:05:45.643,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And this is how the building stands in Beijing today.

103
0:05:49.801,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012,

104
0:05:53.119,000 --> 0:05:57,000
after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.

105
0:05:57.998,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever,

106
0:06:02.085,000 --> 0:06:03,000
those three little circles.

107
0:06:03.663,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building.

108
0:06:07.188,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They're a piece of glass that you can stand on

109
0:06:09.764,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion.

110
0:06:15.524,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing.

111
0:06:18.798,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It is there.

112
0:06:20.313,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It has also become a very popular backdrop

113
0:06:23.425,000 --> 0:06:24,000
for wedding photography.

114
0:06:24.934,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:30.621,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But its most important moment is maybe sill this one.

116
0:06:33.619,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,"

117
0:06:35.697,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week,

118
0:06:40.571,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter,

119
0:06:45.558,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but actually as an urban actor,

120
0:06:47.097,000 --> 0:06:51,000
as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city.

121
0:06:52.987,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player,

122
0:06:57.921,000 --> 0:07:,000
of something that writes stories and performs stories.

123
0:07:02.619,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I think that could be one of its primary meanings

124
0:07:06.955,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that we believe in.

125
0:07:08.226,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But of course, there's another story to this building.

126
0:07:10.861,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It is the story of the people that made it --

127
0:07:13.814,000 --> 0:07:15,000
400 engineers and architects that I was guiding

128
0:07:16.656,000 --> 0:07:18,000
over almost a decade of collaborative work

129
0:07:19.271,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that we spent together in scripting this building,

130
0:07:22.262,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in imagining its reality

131
0:07:24.192,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and ultimately getting it built in China.

132
0:07:29.737,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This is a residential development in Singapore, large scale.

133
0:07:34.541,000 --> 0:07:38,000
If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world,

134
0:07:38.795,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of course, it is dominated by the tower,

135
0:07:42.366,000 --> 0:07:46,000
a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness,

136
0:07:46.911,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and I wanted to ask, how could we think about living,

137
0:07:50.146,000 --> 0:07:53,000
not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves

138
0:07:53.995,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and our apartment,

139
0:07:55.455,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but in an idea of a collective?

140
0:07:58.115,000 --> 0:08:01,000
How could we think about creating a communal environment

141
0:08:01.538,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in which sharing things was as great as having your own?

142
0:08:06.664,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The typical answer to the question -- we had to design 1,040 apartments --

143
0:08:11.384,000 --> 0:08:12,000
would have looked like this:

144
0:08:12.765,000 --> 0:08:14,000
24-story height limit given by the planning authorities,

145
0:08:15.535,000 --> 0:08:18,000
12 towers with nothing but residual in between --

146
0:08:19.533,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a very tight system that, although the tower isolates you,

147
0:08:22.47,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one,

148
0:08:26.001,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be.

149
0:08:30.488,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal

150
0:08:34.806,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and stack them up,

151
0:08:36.62,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and what looks a bit random from the side,

152
0:08:39.191,000 --> 0:08:41,000
if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter,

153
0:08:42.009,000 --> 0:08:46,000
you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid,

154
0:08:46.762,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up

155
0:08:50.523,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to create huge outdoor courtyards -- central spaces for the community,

156
0:08:55.616,000 --> 0:08:58,000
programmed with a variety of amenities and functions.

157
0:08:59.8,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces.

158
0:09:03.111,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They're open, permeable; they're interconnected.

159
0:09:05.627,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We called the project "The Interlace,"

160
0:09:07.875,000 --> 0:09:09,000
thinking that we interlace and interconnect

161
0:09:10.873,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the human beings and the spaces alike.

162
0:09:14.502,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And the detailed quality of everything we designed

163
0:09:17.417,000 --> 0:09:2,000
was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants.

164
0:09:21.273,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And, in fact, it was a system

165
0:09:22.694,000 --> 0:09:25,000
where we would layer primarily communal spaces,

166
0:09:26.186,000 --> 0:09:29,000
stacked to more and more individual and private spaces.

167
0:09:30.662,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So we would open up a spectrum

168
0:09:32.529,000 --> 0:09:35,000
between the collective and the individual.

169
0:09:36.203,000 --> 0:09:37,000
A little piece of math:

170
0:09:37.378,000 --> 0:09:39,000
if we count all the green that we left on the ground,

171
0:09:39.953,000 --> 0:09:41,000
minus the footprint of the buildings,

172
0:09:42.062,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and we would add back the green of all the terraces,

173
0:09:45.513,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we have 112 percent green space,

174
0:09:47.591,000 --> 0:09:49,000
so more nature than not having built a building.

175
0:09:50.463,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying

176
0:09:54.489,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the space available to those who live there.

177
0:09:57.83,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces.

178
0:10:01.038,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity.

179
0:10:06.792,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We paid a lot of attention to sustainability.

180
0:10:10.212,000 --> 0:10:13,000
In the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to,

181
0:10:13.815,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun.

182
0:10:16.901,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight

183
0:10:20.062,000 --> 0:10:21,000
through the year.

184
0:10:21.648,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades

185
0:10:24.333,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to minimize the energy consumption of the building.

186
0:10:27.981,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But most importantly, we could prove that through the geometry

187
0:10:31.42,000 --> 0:10:32,000
of the building design,

188
0:10:33.02,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards

189
0:10:36.406,000 --> 0:10:39,000
so that those would be usable throughout the entire year.

190
0:10:39.432,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors,

191
0:10:42.934,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates

192
0:10:46.678,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that, again, would enhance the quality of those spaces

193
0:10:50.187,000 --> 0:10:52,000
available for the inhabitants.

194
0:10:53.773,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices,

195
0:10:57.543,000 --> 0:11:01,000
of freedom to think where you would want to be,

196
0:11:01.64,000 --> 0:11:02,000
where you would want to escape, maybe,

197
0:11:03.568,000 --> 0:11:06,000
within the own complexity of the complex in which you live.

198
0:11:09.036,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But coming from Asia to Europe:

199
0:11:11.1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
a building for a German media company based in Berlin,

200
0:11:14.98,000 --> 0:11:18,000
transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media.

201
0:11:19.83,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions:

202
0:11:23.146,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Why would anyone today still want to go to the office,

203
0:11:25.775,000 --> 0:11:27,000
because you can actually work anywhere?

204
0:11:27.988,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied

205
0:11:31.885,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in a building?

206
0:11:34.147,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We created not only an object, but at the center of this object

207
0:11:37.994,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we created a giant space,

208
0:11:39.613,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and this space was about the experience of a collective,

209
0:11:43.311,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the experience of collaboration and of togetherness.

210
0:11:47.011,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Communication, interaction as the center of a space

211
0:11:50.65,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that in itself would float,

212
0:11:53.213,000 --> 0:11:55,000
like what we call the collaborative cloud,

213
0:11:55.349,000 --> 0:11:56,000
in the middle of the building,

214
0:11:56.881,000 --> 0:11:59,000
surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices.

215
0:12:00.944,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk,

216
0:12:04.118,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you could participate in the giant collective experience

217
0:12:07.869,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of the central space.

218
0:12:12.159,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Finally, we come to London, a project commissioned

219
0:12:15.762,000 --> 0:12:17,000
by the London Legacy Development Corporation

220
0:12:18.364,000 --> 0:12:19,000
of the Mayor of London.

221
0:12:20.309,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We were asked to undertake a study

222
0:12:22.521,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and investigate the potential of a site

223
0:12:25.337,000 --> 0:12:27,000
out in Stratford in the Olympic Park.

224
0:12:28.229,000 --> 0:12:31,000
In the 19th century, Prince Albert had created Albertopolis.

225
0:12:32.513,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis.

226
0:12:37.211,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions,

227
0:12:41.507,000 --> 0:12:44,000
some international ones, and to create a new system of synergies.

228
0:12:45.803,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Prince Albert, as yet, created Albertopolis in the 19th century,

229
0:12:50.351,000 --> 0:12:52,000
thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind,

230
0:12:52.838,000 --> 0:12:54,000
bringing arts and science closer together.

231
0:12:56.082,000 --> 0:13:,000
And he built Exhibition Road, a linear sequence of those institutions.

232
0:13:01.836,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But of course, today's society has moved on from there.

233
0:13:05.551,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We no longer live in a world

234
0:13:07.531,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in which everything is as clearly delineated

235
0:13:10.235,000 --> 0:13:11,000
or separated from each other.

236
0:13:11.761,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur

237
0:13:15.174,000 --> 0:13:16,000
between the different domains,

238
0:13:16.666,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important

239
0:13:20.68,000 --> 0:13:21,000
than keeping separations.

240
0:13:23.408,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine,

241
0:13:26.451,000 --> 0:13:3,000
a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains,

242
0:13:31.252,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but allow them to interact and collaborate.

243
0:13:35.211,000 --> 0:13:37,000
At the base of it is a very simple module,

244
0:13:37.34,000 --> 0:13:38,000
a ring module.

245
0:13:38.515,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It can function as a double-loaded corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.

246
0:13:42.182,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It can be glazed over

247
0:13:43.357,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space.

248
0:13:46.254,000 --> 0:13:48,000
These modules were stacked together

249
0:13:48.403,000 --> 0:13:51,000
with the idea that almost any function could, over time,

250
0:13:52.189,000 --> 0:13:53,000
occupy any of these modules.

251
0:13:53.95,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So institutions could shrink or contract,

252
0:13:57.09,000 --> 0:14:01,000
as, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.

253
0:14:02.733,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,

254
0:14:05.712,000 --> 0:14:06,000
opposite the Olympic Stadium.

255
0:14:08.608,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And you can see how its cantilevering volumes

256
0:14:10.965,000 --> 0:14:12,000
project out and engage the public space

257
0:14:13.779,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and how its courtyards animate the public inside.

258
0:14:19.313,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The idea was to create a complex system

259
0:14:22.565,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity,

260
0:14:27.477,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume.

261
0:14:30.434,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

262
0:14:33.624,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project,

263
0:14:37.013,000 --> 0:14:38,000
but also the difference:

264
0:14:38.324,000 --> 0:14:42,000
here, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure,

265
0:14:42.523,000 --> 0:14:44,000
in which different entities can interact

266
0:14:45.058,000 --> 0:14:47,000
without losing their own identity.

267
0:14:48.395,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And it was this thought: to create an organizational structure

268
0:14:52.369,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted --

269
0:14:55.226,000 --> 0:15:,000
for those in the educational parts that create and think culture;

270
0:15:00.704,000 --> 0:15:03,000
for those that present the visual arts, the dance;

271
0:15:04.234,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and for the public to be admitted into all of this

272
0:15:07.067,000 --> 0:15:09,000
with a series of possible trajectories,

273
0:15:09.737,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to script their own reading of these narratives

274
0:15:12.493,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and their own experience.

275
0:15:16.475,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And I want to end on a project that is very small,

276
0:15:19.905,000 --> 0:15:2,000
in a way, very different:

277
0:15:21.896,000 --> 0:15:23,000
a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand.

278
0:15:23.968,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Friends of mine had founded a film festival,

279
0:15:27.528,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and I thought,

280
0:15:29.226,000 --> 0:15:32,000
if we think of the stories and narratives of movies,

281
0:15:32.529,000 --> 0:15:35,000
we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them.

282
0:15:36.096,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So I designed a small modular floating platform,

283
0:15:39.405,000 --> 0:15:41,000
based on the techniques of local fishermen,

284
0:15:41.703,000 --> 0:15:43,000
how they built their lobster and fish farms.

285
0:15:43.814,000 --> 0:15:45,000
We collaborated with the local community

286
0:15:46.217,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and built, out of recycled materials of their own,

287
0:15:49.973,000 --> 0:15:51,000
this fantastical floating platform

288
0:15:52.119,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that gently moved in the ocean

289
0:15:54.064,000 --> 0:15:56,000
as we watched films from the British film archive,

290
0:15:56.972,000 --> 0:15:58,000
[1903] "Alice in Wonderland," for example.

291
0:15:59.987,000 --> 0:16:02,000
The most primordial experiences of the audience

292
0:16:03.068,000 --> 0:16:06,000
merged with the stories of the movies.

293
0:16:07.84,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter,

294
0:16:12.674,000 --> 0:16:13,000
of the built environment,

295
0:16:14.158,000 --> 0:16:17,000
but is really about how we want to live our lives,

296
0:16:17.371,000 --> 0:16:2,000
how we script our own stories and those of others.

297
0:16:20.885,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Thank you.

298
0:16:22.06,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Applause)

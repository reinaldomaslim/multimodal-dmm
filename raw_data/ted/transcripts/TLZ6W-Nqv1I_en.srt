1
0:00:13.5,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Who remembers this infamous Styrofoam container?

2
0:00:17.667,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Applause)

3
0:00:20.25,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Well, it sure changed me, it changed my company,

4
0:00:23.583,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it started a revelatory journey

5
0:00:25.542,000 --> 0:00:29,000
about how adversaries can be your best allies.

6
0:00:29.792,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You know, back in the late '80s,

7
0:00:31.375,000 --> 0:00:36,000
this Big Mac clamshell was the symbol of a garbage crisis.

8
0:00:36.542,000 --> 0:00:37,000
People were really angry.

9
0:00:38.542,000 --> 0:00:4,000
For example, thousands of students,

10
0:00:40.792,000 --> 0:00:43,000
young students around the globe were sending letters, blaming McDonald's,

11
0:00:44.583,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because we were using millions of these at that time.

12
0:00:48.458,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, no one at McDonald's knew anything about environmentally friendly packaging,

13
0:00:52.542,000 --> 0:00:53,000
including me.

14
0:00:54.042,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The last 10 years,

15
0:00:55.333,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers.

16
0:00:58.375,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Then out of nowhere, my boss comes to me

17
0:01:00.375,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and says, "Hey, we want you to save this clamshell for the company

18
0:01:05.625,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and lead the effort to reduce waste within McDonald's."

19
0:01:10.167,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I looked at him and I asked him,

20
0:01:12.25,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"What is polystyrene?"

21
0:01:15.875,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But it all sounded intriguing to me

22
0:01:18.042,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because it brought me back to my roots.

23
0:01:25.875,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You see, I grew up in the late '60s, early '70s,

24
0:01:28.833,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in a time of huge social upheaval in the United States.

25
0:01:33.333,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I was really in tune with the protests, the sit-ins,

26
0:01:36.458,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the anti-Vietnam sentiment,

27
0:01:38.208,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I really felt there was a need to question authority.

28
0:01:42.958,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But as I went into university,

29
0:01:45.5,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I realized that I'm not going to make a living doing this.

30
0:01:49.75,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And that whole movement had subsided,

31
0:01:52.292,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and my activist spirit went dormant.

32
0:01:55.708,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And I needed to make a living,

33
0:01:57.208,000 --> 0:01:58,000
so I got involved in the business world.

34
0:01:59.958,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So, now these students against pollution,

35
0:02:02.667,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who were sending those protest letters to McDonald's,

36
0:02:05.917,000 --> 0:02:09,000
they reminded me of myself 20 years ago.

37
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
They're questioning authority.

38
0:02:12.042,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But now, I'm the man.

39
0:02:14.542,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:16.417,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I'm the corporate suit.

41
0:02:19.042,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I'm the one representing authority.

42
0:02:22.25,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And this new thing was emerging

43
0:02:24.083,000 --> 0:02:26,000
called corporate social responsibility,

44
0:02:26.458,000 --> 0:02:28,000
later corporate sustainability,

45
0:02:28.958,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and now I had a chance to make a difference.

46
0:02:33.042,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So the beginning of this journey

47
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
started when McDonald's agreed to a partnership

48
0:02:38.458,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with the Environmental Defense Fund.

49
0:02:40.792,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They were an NGO

50
0:02:42.333,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that was founded with the principle of "sue the bastards."

51
0:02:47.708,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I'm thinking,

52
0:02:49.625,000 --> 0:02:51,000
what are they thinking about me and my team?

53
0:02:52.458,000 --> 0:02:54,000
When I first met Richard Denison,

54
0:02:54.958,000 --> 0:02:57,000
he's the senior scientist for EDF,

55
0:02:58.375,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I was very apprehensive.

56
0:03:00.167,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I thought he's a tree-hugger,

57
0:03:02.083,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and I'm thinking he thinks all I care about is the money.

58
0:03:05.458,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So we wanted the EDF team to give us real-world solutions.

59
0:03:10.875,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So we did the logical thing.

60
0:03:13.75,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We had them flip burgers in our restaurants.

61
0:03:17.167,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So you have to imagine Richard,

62
0:03:19.208,000 --> 0:03:21,000
who, by the way, is a PhD in physics,

63
0:03:22.042,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and there he is, he's trying to dress a quarter-pounder,

64
0:03:24.833,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you're supposed to have two squirts of ketchup, one mustard,

65
0:03:27.875,000 --> 0:03:29,000
three pickles and an onion, go on to the next one,

66
0:03:30.292,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you've got to be so fast.

67
0:03:31.583,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And you know what? He couldn't get it right all day long.

68
0:03:34.333,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And he was frustrated.

69
0:03:35.958,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And I was so impressed,

70
0:03:38.875,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because he was trying to understand our business.

71
0:03:43.583,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, the EDF team,

72
0:03:44.875,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they thought reusables were the holy grail for our business.

73
0:03:49.792,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Me and my team thought, reusables?

74
0:03:52.792,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Too much space, they'd make a mess,

75
0:03:54.625,000 --> 0:03:55,000
they would slow us down.

76
0:03:56.458,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But we didn't reject the idea.

77
0:03:58.458,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We went to the restaurant they chose outside DC, we went to the back room.

78
0:04:03.625,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The dishwasher wasn't working properly,

79
0:04:05.583,000 --> 0:04:06,000
it's spitting out dirty dishes.

80
0:04:07.417,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The kitchen area is dirty and grimy.

81
0:04:10.167,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And compared to their experience at McDonald's

82
0:04:12.375,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that's clean and organized,

83
0:04:13.75,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they could see the stark difference.

84
0:04:16.542,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We also sat in a restaurant at McDonald's, all day long,

85
0:04:19.542,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and watched the customers eating in.

86
0:04:22.542,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Their behavior.

87
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Ends up that many customers left with the food,

88
0:04:26.708,000 --> 0:04:27,000
they left with the beverage.

89
0:04:28.417,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And EDF came to their own conclusion

90
0:04:31.292,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that reusables wouldn't work for us.

91
0:04:34.208,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But they did have a lot of ideas that did work.

92
0:04:37.792,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And we never would have thought of them by ourselves,

93
0:04:40.792,000 --> 0:04:41,000
without the EDF team.

94
0:04:42.708,000 --> 0:04:46,000
My favorite was switching from the white carry-out bag

95
0:04:46.958,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to the brown bag.

96
0:04:54.292,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We had been using the white bag.

97
0:04:57.25,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's virgin material,

98
0:04:59.208,000 --> 0:05:02,000
it's made from chlorine bleaching chemicals,

99
0:05:02.583,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and they said, use an unbleached bag,

100
0:05:05.125,000 --> 0:05:06,000
no chemicals.

101
0:05:07.667,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's made from recycled content,

102
0:05:09.5,000 --> 0:05:11,000
mostly recycled shipping corrugated boxes.

103
0:05:12.125,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Ends up that the bag is stronger, the fiber is stronger,

104
0:05:15.792,000 --> 0:05:16,000
it didn't cost us more money.

105
0:05:17.5,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It was win-win.

106
0:05:24.875,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Another idea they had

107
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
was that we could reduce our napkin by one inch.

108
0:05:30.667,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And make it from recycled office paper.

109
0:05:34.833,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I'm thinking, one inch, no big deal.

110
0:05:37.583,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We did it, it reduced waste by three million pounds a year.

111
0:05:41.708,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Sixteen thousand trees saved.

112
0:05:44.208,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:48.375,000 --> 0:05:51,000
What was really cool is we changed that bright white napkin,

114
0:05:52.25,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because the recycled content became gray and speckled.

115
0:05:56.208,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we made that look, you know,

116
0:05:58.458,000 --> 0:06:,000
in tune, in vogue with customers.

117
0:06:02.667,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So, I came to really enjoy

118
0:06:06.5,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the time working with the EDF team.

119
0:06:09.375,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We had many dinners, late-night discussions,

120
0:06:11.583,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we went to a ball game together.

121
0:06:13.667,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We became friends.

122
0:06:16.667,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And that's when I learned a life lesson.

123
0:06:18.917,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That these NGO crusaders,

124
0:06:21.875,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they're really no different than me.

125
0:06:23.667,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They care, they have passion,

126
0:06:26.083,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we're just not different.

127
0:06:28.208,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So, we had a six-month partnership

128
0:06:30.25,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that ended up producing a 42-point waste reduction action plan.

129
0:06:34.708,000 --> 0:06:36,000
To reduce, reuse, recycle.

130
0:06:37.375,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We measured it during the decade of the '90s,

131
0:06:39.5,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and over 10 years we reduced 300 million pounds of waste.

132
0:06:46.667,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now, if you're wondering about that polystyrene clamshell,

133
0:06:50.042,000 --> 0:06:51,000
yeah, we ditched it.

134
0:06:51.875,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And luckily, I still had a job.

135
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And this partnership was so successful

136
0:06:59.417,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that we went on to recycle the idea to work with critics.

137
0:07:04.375,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Collaborate with them on solutions that could work

138
0:07:06.75,000 --> 0:07:08,000
for society and for business.

139
0:07:10.917,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But could this idea of collaborating

140
0:07:14.125,000 --> 0:07:17,000
work with the most contrarian folks?

141
0:07:17.333,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And on issues that are, you know, not within our direct control.

142
0:07:21.208,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Like animal rights.

143
0:07:24.042,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Now, animal rights,

144
0:07:25.333,000 --> 0:07:27,000
obviously they don't want animals used for meat.

145
0:07:28.25,000 --> 0:07:3,000
McDonald's, probably the biggest purchaser of meat

146
0:07:30.875,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in the food service industry.

147
0:07:32.333,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So there's a natural conflict there.

148
0:07:34.917,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But I thought it would be best

149
0:07:36.458,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to go visit and learn from the most vociferous and vigilant critics

150
0:07:41.333,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we had at that time,

151
0:07:43.125,000 --> 0:07:46,000
which were Henry Spira, head of Animal Rights International,

152
0:07:47.042,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and Peter Singer,

153
0:07:48.667,000 --> 0:07:5,000
who wrote the book "Animal Liberation,"

154
0:07:50.708,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which is considered the modern treatise about animal rights.

155
0:07:55.208,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You know, I read Peter's book to prepare,

156
0:07:57.208,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I tried to get into his mindset,

157
0:07:59.25,000 --> 0:08:,000
and I have to admit, it was tough,

158
0:08:00.917,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I'm not becoming a vegan,

159
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
my company wasn't going that way.

160
0:08:05.542,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But I really thought we could learn a lot.

161
0:08:07.917,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And so I set up a breakfast meeting in New York City.

162
0:08:10.917,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And I remember sitting down, getting ready,

163
0:08:13.167,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and I decided I'm not going to order my favorite,

164
0:08:15.583,000 --> 0:08:17,000
which is you know, bacon and sausage and eggs.

165
0:08:17.958,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:20.125,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I'm just going to stick to the pastries.

167
0:08:22.708,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But I have to admit,

168
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I was waiting for the adversarial discussion to happen.

169
0:08:27.333,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And it never did.

170
0:08:29.292,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Henry and Peter were just gracious,

171
0:08:32.042,000 --> 0:08:35,000
they were caring, they were smart, they asked good questions.

172
0:08:35.583,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I told them about how working on animal welfare

173
0:08:38.167,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is very tough for McDonald's

174
0:08:39.583,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because our direct suppliers, they only make meat patties.

175
0:08:43.5,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The animals are three or four steps removed from our influence.

176
0:08:47.583,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And they were very empathetic.

177
0:08:49.875,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And while we were so directly opposed

178
0:08:52.667,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in terms of the missions of our organizations,

179
0:08:55.458,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I felt that I had learned a lot.

180
0:08:57.292,000 --> 0:09:,000
And best of all, they gave me a terrific recommendation.

181
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And that is, they said,

182
0:09:02.375,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin."

183
0:09:05.417,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, I didn't know her at the time.

184
0:09:08.125,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But I tell you,

185
0:09:09.417,000 --> 0:09:14,000
she's the most renowned expert, then and now, on animal behavior.

186
0:09:14.667,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities.

187
0:09:19.708,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So I end up meeting her,

188
0:09:21.25,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and she's the very best type of critic,

189
0:09:24.5,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in a sense that she just loves the animals,

190
0:09:26.75,000 --> 0:09:27,000
wants to protect them,

191
0:09:28.042,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but she also understands the reality of the meat business.

192
0:09:31.75,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And I'll always remember,

193
0:09:33.042,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I had never been to a slaughterhouse in my life,

194
0:09:36.042,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and so I go with her for my first trip.

195
0:09:38.5,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I didn't know what to expect.

196
0:09:40.542,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And we find that the animal handlers have electric prods in their hands,

197
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and are basically zapping almost every animal in the facility.

198
0:09:51.292,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We're both appalled, she's jumping up and down,

199
0:09:54.333,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you'd have to know her,

200
0:09:55.625,000 --> 0:09:57,000
she's saying, "This can't be, this isn't right,

201
0:09:57.84,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we could use flags, we could use plastic bags,

202
0:10:00.007,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we could redesign the corrals for natural behavior."

203
0:10:04.125,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Well I set up Temple with our suppliers

204
0:10:06.25,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to set up standards and guidelines.

205
0:10:09.333,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And ways to measure her ideas of implementing animal welfare.

206
0:10:13.25,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We did this for the next two to five years.

207
0:10:15.833,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And it all got integrated, it all got enforced.

208
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
By the way, two of McDonald's suppliers lost business

209
0:10:21.583,000 --> 0:10:22,000
because they didn't meet our standards.

210
0:10:23.465,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And best of all,

211
0:10:24.75,000 --> 0:10:28,000
all these standards ended up scaling to the entire industry.

212
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And no more zapping of those animals.

213
0:10:32.25,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now, what about issues that we're blamed for elsewhere?

214
0:10:36.875,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Like deforestation.

215
0:10:39.083,000 --> 0:10:41,000
You know, on that issue, I always thought,

216
0:10:41.125,000 --> 0:10:43,000
policy makers and government, that's their role.

217
0:10:44.125,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Never thought it would end up in my lap.

218
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But I remember in early April 2006,

219
0:10:49.583,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I opened up my Blackberry,

220
0:10:52.125,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and I'm reading about Greenpeace campaigners

221
0:10:56.042,000 --> 0:11:,000
showing up in the UK by the dozens,

222
0:11:00.208,000 --> 0:11:01,000
dressed as chickens,

223
0:11:02.208,000 --> 0:11:04,000
having breakfast at McDonald's

224
0:11:04.5,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and chaining themselves to the chairs and tables.

225
0:11:07.625,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So they got a lot of attention,

226
0:11:09.542,000 --> 0:11:1,000
including mine.

227
0:11:11.417,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I was wondering if the report that they had just released,

228
0:11:14.375,000 --> 0:11:16,000
it was called "Eating Up the Amazon."

229
0:11:16.792,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And by the way, soy is a key ingredient for chicken feed,

230
0:11:20.208,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and that's the connection to McDonald's.

231
0:11:22.75,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So I called my trusted friends at the World Wildlife Fund,

232
0:11:25.917,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I called Conservation International,

233
0:11:28.417,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and I soon learned that the Greenpeace report was accurate.

234
0:11:33.542,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So I gathered internal support,

235
0:11:35.292,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and I'll always remember, next day, after that campaign,

236
0:11:38.542,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I called them up,

237
0:11:39.833,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and I said, "We agree with you."

238
0:11:43.083,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And I said, "How about working together?"

239
0:11:46.375,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So three days later,

240
0:11:49.042,000 --> 0:11:51,000
miraculously, four people from McDonald's,

241
0:11:51.25,000 --> 0:11:52,000
four people from Greenpeace,

242
0:11:52.75,000 --> 0:11:54,000
we're meeting in the London Heathrow airport.

243
0:11:55.542,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And I have to say, the first hour was shaky,

244
0:11:58.5,000 --> 0:12:,000
it wasn't a whole lot of trust in the room.

245
0:12:00.875,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But it seemed like everything came together,

246
0:12:04.083,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because each of us wanted to save the Amazon.

247
0:12:08.583,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And during our discussions,

248
0:12:09.958,000 --> 0:12:11,000
you couldn't really tell, I don't think,

249
0:12:12.25,000 --> 0:12:15,000
who was from Greenpeace and who was from McDonald's.

250
0:12:17.458,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So one of the best things we did

251
0:12:19.583,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is we traveled with them for nine days on a trip through the Amazon,

252
0:12:24.458,000 --> 0:12:27,000
on the Greenpeace airplane, on the Greenpeace boat.

253
0:12:28.083,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And I'll always remember,

254
0:12:30.625,000 --> 0:12:33,000
imagine traveling hundreds of miles west of Manaus,

255
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
the capital city of the Amazon.

256
0:12:36.667,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And it's so pristine beauty,

257
0:12:38.625,000 --> 0:12:4,000
there's no man-made structures, there's no roads,

258
0:12:41.375,000 --> 0:12:43,000
not one wire, not one house.

259
0:12:43.5,000 --> 0:12:45,000
You would travel east of Manaus

260
0:12:45.833,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and you would see the blatant rainforest destruction.

261
0:12:50.542,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So this very unlikely collaboration produced outstanding results.

262
0:12:56.833,000 --> 0:12:57,000
By working together,

263
0:12:58.125,000 --> 0:13:02,000
we recruited over a dozen other retailers and suppliers

264
0:13:02.167,000 --> 0:13:04,000
for the same cause.

265
0:13:04.208,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And by the way, within three months,

266
0:13:06.708,000 --> 0:13:09,000
a moratorium on these clear-cutting practices

267
0:13:09.833,000 --> 0:13:11,000
was announced by the industry.

268
0:13:12.292,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And Greenpeace themselves declared it as a spectacular drop in deforestation

269
0:13:17.375,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and it's been in effect ever since.

270
0:13:20.917,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now, you think these types of collaborations that I've described

271
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
would be commonplace today.

272
0:13:26.375,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But they're not.

273
0:13:27.792,000 --> 0:13:29,000
When organizations are battered,

274
0:13:30.292,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the common response is to deny and push back,

275
0:13:34.083,000 --> 0:13:36,000
put out some sort of lame statement

276
0:13:36.167,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and no progress is made at all.

277
0:13:38.917,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I say the alternative is really powerful.

278
0:13:41.792,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I mean, it's not going to fix every problem,

279
0:13:44.042,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and there's more to do for sure,

280
0:13:45.917,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but this idea of working with critics

281
0:13:48.5,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and trying to do more good for society

282
0:13:51.208,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that actually is good for business,

283
0:13:53.208,000 --> 0:13:55,000
believe me, it's possible.

284
0:13:55.792,000 --> 0:13:56,000
But it starts with the idea

285
0:13:57.75,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that you need to assume the best intentions of your critics.

286
0:14:02.917,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Just like you have the best intentions.

287
0:14:05.792,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And then secondly,

288
0:14:07.208,000 --> 0:14:09,000
you need to look past a lot of these tactics.

289
0:14:09.542,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I admit, I did not like a lot of the tactics

290
0:14:13.375,000 --> 0:14:14,000
used on my company.

291
0:14:15.125,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But instead, focus on what the truth is,

292
0:14:18.292,000 --> 0:14:19,000
what's the right thing to do,

293
0:14:19.875,000 --> 0:14:22,000
what's the science, what's the facts.

294
0:14:22.958,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And lastly, you know, I would say,

295
0:14:25.25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
give the critics the keys.

296
0:14:27.708,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Show them the back room.

297
0:14:29.833,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Bring them there, don't hide the details,

298
0:14:31.833,000 --> 0:14:33,000
because if you want allies and support,

299
0:14:34.375,000 --> 0:14:36,000
you need to be open and transparent.

300
0:14:38.208,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Now, whether you're a corporate suit,

301
0:14:41.083,000 --> 0:14:42,000
whether you're a tree-hugger,

302
0:14:43.042,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I say the next time you're criticized,

303
0:14:45.833,000 --> 0:14:47,000
reach out, listen, learn.

304
0:14:48.333,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You'll become better, your organization will become better,

305
0:14:51.625,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and you might make some good friends along the way.

306
0:14:55.083,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Thank you.

307
0:14:56.375,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Applause)

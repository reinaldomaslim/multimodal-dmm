1
0:00:12.793,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What do you do when you have a headache?

2
0:00:15.832,000 --> 0:00:16,000
You swallow an aspirin.

3
0:00:18.247,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is,

4
0:00:22.594,000 --> 0:00:27,000
it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first.

5
0:00:28.947,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering

6
0:00:34.093,000 --> 0:00:36,000
any medication in the body.

7
0:00:37.452,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution.

8
0:00:43.134,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients.

9
0:00:48.783,000 --> 0:00:51,000
When they take their anti-HIV drugs,

10
0:00:51.96,000 --> 0:00:55,000
these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood,

11
0:00:56.05,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and increasing the CD4 cell counts.

12
0:00:58.618,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects,

13
0:01:03.007,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood,

14
0:01:08.524,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and worse, by the time they get to the sites

15
0:01:11.425,000 --> 0:01:16,000
where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs.

16
0:01:17.751,000 --> 0:01:21,000
These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes,

17
0:01:22.298,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the nervous system, as well as the lungs --

18
0:01:25.207,000 --> 0:01:27,000
where the virus is sleeping,

19
0:01:27.735,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and will not readily get delivered in the blood

20
0:01:30.967,000 --> 0:01:35,000
of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.

21
0:01:36.502,000 --> 0:01:39,000
However, upon discontinuation of therapy,

22
0:01:40.212,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood.

23
0:01:44.728,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment,

24
0:01:51.337,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients.

25
0:01:55.395,000 --> 0:01:57,000
One day, I sat and thought,

26
0:01:57.79,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites,

27
0:02:03.551,000 --> 0:02:05,000
without the risk of drug dilution?"

28
0:02:06.525,000 --> 0:02:1,000
As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes:

29
0:02:11.142,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Lasers, of course.

30
0:02:12.976,000 --> 0:02:14,000
If they can be used for dentistry,

31
0:02:15.864,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,

32
0:02:18.739,000 --> 0:02:2,000
they can be used for anything imaginable,

33
0:02:21.468,000 --> 0:02:24,000
including transporting drugs into cells.

34
0:02:25.403,000 --> 0:02:3,000
As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses

35
0:02:30.657,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,

36
0:02:34.31,000 --> 0:02:38,000
which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells,

37
0:02:39.246,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in order to deliver drugs within them.

38
0:02:42.38,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"How is that possible?" you may ask.

39
0:02:45.119,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam

40
0:02:51.476,000 --> 0:02:54,000
onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells

41
0:02:55.304,000 --> 0:02:59,000
while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug.

42
0:03:00.395,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug

43
0:03:05.277,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in a matter of microseconds.

44
0:03:07.446,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Before you even know it,

45
0:03:09.042,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the induced hole becomes immediately repaired.

46
0:03:13.246,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes

47
0:03:17.69,000 --> 0:03:18,000
or in Petri dishes,

48
0:03:19.221,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but the goal is to get this technology in the human body,

49
0:03:23.581,000 --> 0:03:24,000
apply it in the human body.

50
0:03:25.928,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"How is that possible?" you may ask.

51
0:03:28.422,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device.

52
0:03:33.506,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Using the first head, which is our laser,

53
0:03:36.452,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we will make an incision in the site of infection.

54
0:03:40.498,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Using the second head, which is a camera,

55
0:03:43.15,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we meander to the site of infection.

56
0:03:45.813,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,

57
0:03:50.604,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection,

58
0:03:53.635,000 --> 0:03:57,000
while the laser is again used to poke those cells open.

59
0:03:58.815,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Well, this might not seem like much right now.

60
0:04:02.68,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But one day, if successful, this technology can lead

61
0:04:07.767,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to complete eradication of HIV in the body.

62
0:04:11.401,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Yes. A cure for HIV.

63
0:04:14.147,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This is every HIV researcher's dream --

64
0:04:17.085,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in our case, a cure lead by lasers.

65
0:04:20.636,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Thank you.

66
0:04:21.813,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Applause)

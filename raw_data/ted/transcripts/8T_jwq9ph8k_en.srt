1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society,

2
0:00:27.556,000 --> 0:00:28,000
publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.

3
0:00:29.112,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We investigate claims of the paranormal,

4
0:00:31.049,000 --> 0:00:34,000
pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between,

5
0:00:34.755,000 --> 0:00:36,000
science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science,

6
0:00:37.673,000 --> 0:00:4,000
voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science,

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and plain old non-sense.

8
0:00:42.911,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And unless you've been on Mars recently,

9
0:00:44.852,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you know there's a lot of that out there.

10
0:00:46.894,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Some people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term.

11
0:00:49.94,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.

12
0:00:52.072,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there --

13
0:00:55.549,000 --> 0:00:58,000
well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,

14
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:00.254,000 --> 0:01:02,000
trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.

16
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'll show you an example of a bad idea.

17
0:01:04.887,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I brought this with me,

18
0:01:06.069,000 --> 0:01:09,000
this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.

19
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.

20
0:01:13.31,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.

21
0:01:16.244,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:17.714,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.

23
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.

24
0:01:27.351,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You could dowse for all sorts of things,

25
0:01:29.341,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana

26
0:01:32.758,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in students' lockers.

27
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:36.484,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So the way it works is you go down the hallway,

29
0:01:40.053,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker,

30
0:01:43.076,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and then you open the locker.

31
0:01:44.544,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So it looks something like this.

32
0:01:46.145,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I'll show you.

33
0:01:48.809,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.

35
0:01:53.415,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.

36
0:01:56.244,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It'll go this way for sure.

37
0:01:57.85,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:01.808,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Sir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir?

39
0:02:04.358,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:06.22,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers?

41
0:02:09.701,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.

42
0:02:12.323,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:13.37,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Applause)

44
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits.

45
0:02:18.405,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here:

46
0:02:21.695,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on.

47
0:02:25.453,000 --> 0:02:27,000
People remember the hits and forget the misses.

48
0:02:27.696,000 --> 0:02:28,000
In science, we keep the whole database,

49
0:02:29.615,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out

50
0:02:32.3,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from the total number you'd expect by chance.

51
0:02:34.537,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In this case, we tested it.

52
0:02:35.855,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We had two opaque boxes:

53
0:02:37.371,000 --> 0:02:4,000
one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.

54
0:02:41.029,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And it got it 50 percent of the time --

55
0:02:42.934,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:44.051,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model.

57
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.

58
0:02:51.015,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication. Each one has a particular theme.

59
0:02:54.507,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This one is on the future of intelligence.

60
0:02:56.605,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Are people getting smarter or dumber?

61
0:02:58.4,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in,

62
0:03:01.472,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter.

63
0:03:04.163,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.

64
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Sort of an interesting thing.

65
0:03:08.675,000 --> 0:03:11,000
With science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing.

66
0:03:12.246,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Are science and religion compatible?

67
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's like, are science and plumbing compatible?

68
0:03:16.255,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They're just two different things.

69
0:03:17.913,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Science is not a thing. It's a verb.

70
0:03:19.676,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's a way of thinking about things.

71
0:03:21.422,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.

72
0:03:24.516,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I mean, what's more likely:

73
0:03:25.89,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings

74
0:03:29.477,000 --> 0:03:31,000
travel across vast distances of interstellar space

75
0:03:31.891,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas

76
0:03:35.095,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to promote skeptic.com, our web page?

77
0:03:36.929,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Or is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?

78
0:03:41.431,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And in all cases we have to ask --

79
0:03:43.105,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:44.953,000 --> 0:03:46,000
What's the more likely explanation?

81
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Before we say something is out of this world,

82
0:03:49.191,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we should first make sure that it's not in this world.

83
0:03:51.879,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What's more likely:

84
0:03:53.054,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship,

85
0:03:56.404,000 --> 0:03:58,000
or that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up?

86
0:03:58.926,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:00.339,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.

88
0:04:05.025,000 --> 0:04:08,000
For those of you in the back, it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.

89
0:04:08.264,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two."

90
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments.

91
0:04:15.52,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There's nothing more to it than that.

92
0:04:17.392,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Applause)

93
0:04:18.466,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You can say a miracle occurs,

94
0:04:19.878,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything.

95
0:04:22.868,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There's nothing to test.

96
0:04:24.042,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists.

97
0:04:27.514,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers --

98
0:04:32.424,000 --> 0:04:34,000
dark energy or dark matter, something like that --

99
0:04:34.796,000 --> 0:04:36,000
until we figure out what it is, we'll call it this.

100
0:04:37.28,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's the beginning of the causal chain for science.

101
0:04:40.005,000 --> 0:04:44,000
For intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.

102
0:04:44.104,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So again, we can ask this: what's more likely?

103
0:04:46.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?

104
0:04:50.715,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California,

105
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:55,000
looking down over Pasadena.

106
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.

107
0:04:59.545,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment,

108
0:05:02.307,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you don't need computers.

109
0:05:03.529,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera.

110
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.

111
0:05:10.12,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Camera's ready -- that's it.

112
0:05:12.042,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:13.503,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So, although it's possible that most of these things are fake

114
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
or illusions or so on, and that some of them are real,

115
0:05:20.738,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles.

116
0:05:23.895,000 --> 0:05:26,000
On a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance

117
0:05:27.3,000 --> 0:05:28,000
between data and theory.

118
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In the case of Galileo, he had two problems

119
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
when he turned his telescope to Saturn.

120
0:05:35.385,000 --> 0:05:38,000
First of all, there was no theory of planetary rings.

121
0:05:38.531,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy,

122
0:05:40.748,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.

123
0:05:43.3,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So he wrote that he had seen --

124
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies."

125
0:05:48.531,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.

126
0:05:51.42,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data,

127
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:56,000
you can't have a good theory.

128
0:05:56.942,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It wasn't solved until 1655.

129
0:05:58.585,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes

130
0:06:01.623,000 --> 0:06:03,000
people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.

131
0:06:04.609,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It wasn't till Huygens had two things:

132
0:06:06.489,000 --> 0:06:1,000
He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated,

133
0:06:10.999,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data

134
0:06:13.886,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster --

135
0:06:17.453,000 --> 0:06:2,000
according to Kepler's Laws -- than Saturn, then we catch up with it.

136
0:06:20.705,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.

137
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.

138
0:06:26.244,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases.

139
0:06:31.565,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things

140
0:06:34.856,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is that we have things, on a simple level,

141
0:06:36.948,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and then I'll go to more serious ones.

142
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.

143
0:06:40.7,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is the face on Mars.

144
0:06:42.5,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area

145
0:06:47.036,000 --> 0:06:5,000
because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians.

146
0:06:50.976,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Here's the close-up of it from 2001.

147
0:06:53.771,000 --> 0:06:55,000
If you squint, you can still see the face.

148
0:06:56.255,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And when you're squinting,

149
0:06:57.581,000 --> 0:07:,000
you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain,

150
0:07:00.628,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so you're reducing the quality of your data.

151
0:07:02.939,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face,

152
0:07:06.192,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because we're programmed by evolution to see faces.

153
0:07:08.645,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Faces are important for us socially.

154
0:07:10.82,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.

155
0:07:14.312,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You see the happy face on Mars, there.

156
0:07:16.232,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:17.407,000 --> 0:07:19,000
If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.

158
0:07:20.344,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs.

159
0:07:22.688,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Or if geologists were elephants?

160
0:07:25.736,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Religious iconography.

161
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

162
0:07:31.825,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.

163
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun

164
0:07:36.501,000 --> 0:07:39,000
till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.

165
0:07:40.238,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,

166
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or is it up the street from here?

167
0:07:45.628,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy,

168
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking --

169
0:07:52.024,000 --> 0:07:53,000
humans are pattern-seeking animals.

170
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.

171
0:07:57.587,000 --> 0:08:,000
Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich --

172
0:08:01.025,000 --> 0:08:03,000
which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino --

173
0:08:03.539,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of course, this being America.

174
0:08:05.1,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:06.649,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.

176
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary?

178
0:08:15.405,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:17.408,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look.

180
0:08:21.297,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.

181
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I actually went to see this one.

182
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:26,000
There was a lot of people there.

183
0:08:26.858,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.

184
0:08:31.534,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We went down and investigated.

185
0:08:33.419,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi,

186
0:08:36.616,000 --> 0:08:38,000
next to this two, two and a half story-sized image.

187
0:08:39.053,000 --> 0:08:42,000
All these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this.

188
0:08:42.579,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So we walked around the backside, to see what was going on.

189
0:08:45.408,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree,

190
0:08:48.763,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you get the effect.

191
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.

192
0:08:53.405,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I guess you can only have one miracle per building.

193
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

194
0:08:59.357,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge?

195
0:09:03.06,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

196
0:09:04.085,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this,

197
0:09:07.712,000 --> 0:09:09,000
with auditory illusions.

198
0:09:10.513,000 --> 0:09:12,000
There's this film, "White Noise," with Michael Keaton,

199
0:09:13.063,000 --> 0:09:15,000
about the dead talking back to us.

200
0:09:15.621,000 --> 0:09:18,000
By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.

201
0:09:19.31,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Anybody can do it, turns out.

202
0:09:20.819,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part.

203
0:09:23.931,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:25.053,000 --> 0:09:28,000
In this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena.

205
0:09:28.859,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff.

206
0:09:32.168,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This is the most famous one of all of these.

207
0:09:35.343,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Here's the forward version of the very famous song.

208
0:09:38.168,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Music with lyrics)

209
0:09:39.263,000 --> 0:09:44,000
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now.

210
0:09:45.089,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen.

211
0:09:50.764,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run,

212
0:09:56.87,000 --> 0:09:59,000
There's still time to change the road you're on.

213
0:10:01.514,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Music ends)

214
0:10:03.733,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Couldn't you just listen to that all day?

215
0:10:06.368,000 --> 0:10:07,000
All right, here it is backwards,

216
0:10:07.999,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.

217
0:10:12.513,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Music with unintelligible lyrics)

218
0:10:26.45,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Lyrics) Satan!

219
0:10:27.768,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Unintelligible lyrics continue)

220
0:10:41.934,000 --> 0:10:42,000
What did you get? Audience: Satan!

221
0:10:43.578,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan".

222
0:10:45.314,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Now, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain

223
0:10:47.64,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.

224
0:10:51.101,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Music with lyrics)

225
0:11:17.673,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Music ends)

226
0:11:18.783,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:20.014,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Applause)

228
0:11:26.427,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You can't miss it when I tell you what's there.

229
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:32.274,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story.

231
0:11:36.333,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.

232
0:11:39.202,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We're always looking for little good things that people do.

233
0:11:42.046,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And in England, there's a pop singer.

234
0:11:44.079,000 --> 0:11:47,000
One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.

235
0:11:47.848,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And she wrote a beautiful song.

236
0:11:49.4,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."

237
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It's a love story -- she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK --

238
0:11:58.12,000 --> 0:11:59,000
about how she much loves her guy,

239
0:11:59.765,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.

240
0:12:02.265,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And she has this one passage here.

241
0:12:04.514,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Music)

242
0:12:05.574,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Lyrics) We are 12 billion light-years from the edge

243
0:12:11.369,000 --> 0:12:13,000
That's a guess,

244
0:12:13.718,000 --> 0:12:16,000
No one can ever say it's true,

245
0:12:17.453,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But I know that I will always be with you.

246
0:12:22.731,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice. At least she got it close.

247
0:12:25.72,000 --> 0:12:27,000
In America it'd be, "We're 6,000 light years from the edge."

248
0:12:28.667,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Laughter)

249
0:12:29.727,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator,

250
0:12:33.52,000 --> 0:12:35,000
who wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on,

251
0:12:35.671,000 --> 0:12:37,000
uses every chance he gets to promote good science.

252
0:12:38.1,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song,

253
0:12:41.41,000 --> 0:12:46,000
in which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge.

254
0:12:46.47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.

255
0:12:50.312,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We know within precise error bars how close it is.

256
0:12:54.6,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.

257
0:12:58.434,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said,

258
0:13:03.197,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club.

259
0:13:05.592,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I should've known better."

260
0:13:06.894,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And she re-cut the song.

261
0:13:08.14,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So I will end with the new version.

262
0:13:10.012,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Music with lyrics)

263
0:13:11.3,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We are 13.7 billion light years

264
0:13:13.745,000 --> 0:13:16,000
from the edge of the observable universe.

265
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars.

266
0:13:21.053,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And with the available information,

267
0:13:24.229,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I predict that I will always be with you.

268
0:13:28.596,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:29.777,000 --> 0:13:3,000
How cool is that?

270
0:13:30.969,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

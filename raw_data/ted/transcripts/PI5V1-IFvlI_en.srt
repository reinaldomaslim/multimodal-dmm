1
0:00:12.939,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's April of 2007,

2
0:00:15.455,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and Jon Corzine, the Governor of New Jersey,

3
0:00:18.536,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is in this horrific car accident.

4
0:00:21.18,000 --> 0:00:23,000
He's in the right front passenger seat of this SUV

5
0:00:23.855,000 --> 0:00:25,000
when it crashes on the Garden State Parkway.

6
0:00:26.304,000 --> 0:00:28,000
He's transported to a New Jersey trauma center

7
0:00:28.613,000 --> 0:00:3,000
with multiple broken bones and multiple lacerations.

8
0:00:31.821,000 --> 0:00:33,000
He needs immediate surgery, seven units of blood,

9
0:00:34.646,000 --> 0:00:36,000
a mechanical ventilator to help him breathe

10
0:00:36.896,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and several more operations along the way.

11
0:00:39.792,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's amazing he survived.

12
0:00:41.881,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But perhaps even more amazing,

13
0:00:43.654,000 --> 0:00:45,000
he was not wearing a seat belt.

14
0:00:45.725,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And, in fact, he never wore a seat belt,

15
0:00:47.772,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the New Jersey state troopers who used to drive Governor Corzine around

16
0:00:51.629,000 --> 0:00:53,000
used to beg him to wear a seat belt,

17
0:00:53.817,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but he didn't do it.

18
0:00:55.159,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, before Corzine was Governor of New Jersey,

19
0:00:57.458,000 --> 0:00:59,000
he was the US Senator from New Jersey,

20
0:01:00.072,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and before that, he was the CEO of Goldman Sachs,

21
0:01:02.991,000 --> 0:01:04,000
responsible for taking Goldman Sachs public,

22
0:01:05.389,000 --> 0:01:07,000
making hundreds of millions of dollars.

23
0:01:07.803,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, no matter what you think of Jon Corzine politically

24
0:01:10.567,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or how he made his money,

25
0:01:12.294,000 --> 0:01:13,000
nobody would say that he was stupid.

26
0:01:14.205,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But there he was,

27
0:01:15.593,000 --> 0:01:17,000
an unrestrained passenger in a car accident,

28
0:01:18.236,000 --> 0:01:22,000
at a time when every American knows that seat belts save lives.

29
0:01:23.836,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This single story reflects a fundamental weakness

30
0:01:26.893,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in our approach to improving health behavior.

31
0:01:29.822,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Nearly everything we tell doctors and everything we tell patients

32
0:01:33.416,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is based on the idea that we behave rationally.

33
0:01:36.981,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If you give me information, I will process that information in my head,

34
0:01:40.905,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and my behavior will change as a result.

35
0:01:43.939,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Do you think Jon Corzine didn't know that seat belts save lives?

36
0:01:47.018,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Do you think he, like, just didn't get the memo?

37
0:01:49.324,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:50.499,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Jon Corzine did not have a knowledge deficit,

39
0:01:53.3,000 --> 0:01:55,000
he had a behavior deficit.

40
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It's not that he didn't know better.

41
0:01:57.259,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He knew better.

42
0:01:58.466,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's that he didn't do better.

43
0:02:02.171,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Instead, I think the mind is a high-resistance pathway.

44
0:02:07.501,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Changing someone's mind with information is hard enough.

45
0:02:11.026,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Changing their behavior with information

46
0:02:13.55,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is harder still.

47
0:02:15.836,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The only way we're going to make substantial improvements

48
0:02:18.857,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in health and health care

49
0:02:20.355,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is to make substantial improvements in the behavior of health and health care.

50
0:02:26.096,000 --> 0:02:29,000
If you hit my patellar tendon with a reflex hammer,

51
0:02:29.391,000 --> 0:02:3,000
my leg is going to jerk forward,

52
0:02:31.233,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and it's going to jerk forward a lot faster and a lot more predictably

53
0:02:34.697,000 --> 0:02:36,000
than if I had to think about it myself.

54
0:02:37.038,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's a reflex.

55
0:02:38.563,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We need to look for the equivalent behavioral reflexes

56
0:02:42.21,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and hitch our health care wagon to those.

57
0:02:45.898,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Turns out, though,

58
0:02:47.099,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that most conventional approaches to human motivation

59
0:02:50.352,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are based on the idea of education.

60
0:02:53.509,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We assume that if people don't behave as they should,

61
0:02:56.067,000 --> 0:02:57,000
it's because they didn't know any better.

62
0:02:58.09,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"If only people knew that smoking was dangerous, they wouldn't smoke."

63
0:03:02.398,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Or, we think about economics.

64
0:03:03.841,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The assumption there is that we're all constantly calculating

65
0:03:06.772,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the costs and benefits of every one of our actions

66
0:03:09.494,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and optimizing that to make the perfectly right, rational decision.

67
0:03:13.566,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If that were true, then all we need to do

68
0:03:15.578,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is to find the perfect payment system for doctors

69
0:03:17.932,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or the perfect co-payments and deductibles for patients,

70
0:03:20.615,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and everything would work out.

71
0:03:22.363,000 --> 0:03:25,000
A better approach lies in behavioral economics.

72
0:03:25.836,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Behavioral economists recognize that we are irrational.

73
0:03:29.593,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Our decisions are based on emotion,

74
0:03:31.513,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or they're sensitive to framing or to social context.

75
0:03:34.38,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We don't always do what's in our own long-term best interests.

76
0:03:38.524,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But the key contribution to behavioral economics

77
0:03:41.06,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is not in recognizing that we are irrational;

78
0:03:44.029,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it's recognizing that we are irrational in highly predictable ways.

79
0:03:48.807,000 --> 0:03:51,000
In fact, it's the predictability of our psychological foibles

80
0:03:52.125,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that allows us to design strategies to overcome them.

81
0:03:55.366,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Forewarned is forearmed.

82
0:03:57.761,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In fact, behavioral economists often use

83
0:03:59.793,000 --> 0:04:02,000
precisely the same behavioral reflexes that get us into trouble

84
0:04:03.811,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and turn them around to help us,

85
0:04:06.063,000 --> 0:04:07,000
rather than to hurt us.

86
0:04:08.64,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We see irrationality play out in something called "present bias,"

87
0:04:13.308,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where the outcomes in front of us are much more motivating

88
0:04:16.685,000 --> 0:04:2,000
than even more important outcomes far in the future.

89
0:04:22.056,000 --> 0:04:24,000
If I'm on a diet -- and I'm always on a diet --

90
0:04:24.595,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:26.415,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and someone offers me a luscious-looking piece of chocolate cake,

92
0:04:30.643,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I know I should not eat that chocolate cake.

93
0:04:34.256,000 --> 0:04:38,000
That chocolate cake will land on that part of my body -- permanently --

94
0:04:38.93,000 --> 0:04:4,000
where that kind of food naturally settles.

95
0:04:41.558,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But the chocolate cake looks so good and delicious,

96
0:04:44.025,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and it's right in front of me,

97
0:04:45.51,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the diet can wait 'til tomorrow.

98
0:04:47.669,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I used to love the comedian Steven Wright.

99
0:04:49.725,000 --> 0:04:5,000
He would have these Zen-like quips.

100
0:04:52.072,000 --> 0:04:53,000
My favorite one was this:

101
0:04:54.187,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"Hard work pays off in the future,

102
0:04:56.49,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but laziness pays off right now."

103
0:04:58.888,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:00.37,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And patients also have present bias.

105
0:05:03.265,000 --> 0:05:04,000
If you have high blood pressure,

106
0:05:04.923,000 --> 0:05:06,000
even if you would desperately like to avoid a stroke,

107
0:05:07.479,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and you know that taking your antihypertensive medications

108
0:05:10.511,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is one of the best ways to reduce that risk,

109
0:05:13.237,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the stroke you avoid is far in the future and taking medications is right now.

110
0:05:18.437,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Almost half of the patients who are prescribed high blood pressure pills

111
0:05:22.625,000 --> 0:05:23,000
stop taking them within a year.

112
0:05:25.062,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Think of how many lives we could save

113
0:05:27.042,000 --> 0:05:3,000
if we could solve just that one problem.

114
0:05:31.903,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We also tend to overestimate the value of small probabilities.

115
0:05:36.474,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This actually explains why state lotteries are so popular,

116
0:05:39.268,000 --> 0:05:41,000
even though they return pennies on the dollar.

117
0:05:41.759,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, some of you may buy lottery tickets --

118
0:05:43.847,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it's fun, there's the chance you might strike it rich ...

119
0:05:46.695,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But let's face it:

120
0:05:47.883,000 --> 0:05:5,000
this would be a horrible way to invest your retirement savings.

121
0:05:51.84,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I once saw a bumper sticker -- I am not making this up -- that said,

122
0:05:55.448,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"State lotteries are a special tax on people who can't do math."

123
0:06:00.404,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:01.925,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's not that we can't do the math,

125
0:06:03.664,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it's that we can't feel the math.

126
0:06:06.547,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And we also pay much too much attention to regret.

127
0:06:09.926,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We all hate the feeling of missing out.

128
0:06:12.549,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So, actually, there was this recent lottery,

129
0:06:14.625,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a mega-jackpot lottery,

130
0:06:16.155,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that had a huge payoff, something like over a billion dollars.

131
0:06:19.129,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And everyone in my office is pooling money to buy lottery tickets,

132
0:06:22.332,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and I'm not having any of this.

133
0:06:23.997,000 --> 0:06:25,000
There I am, like, swaggering around the office,

134
0:06:26.271,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"Lotteries are a special tax on people who can't do math."

135
0:06:29.134,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:30.211,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And then it hits me:

137
0:06:31.973,000 --> 0:06:32,000
uh oh.

138
0:06:33.249,000 --> 0:06:34,000
What if they win?

139
0:06:34.622,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:36.741,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I'm the only one who shows up at work the next day.

141
0:06:39.19,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:40.372,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Now, it's not that I didn't want my colleagues to win.

143
0:06:42.94,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I just didn't want them to win without me.

144
0:06:45.608,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, it would have been easier if I had just taken my 20-dollar bill

145
0:06:49.005,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and put it into the office shredder,

146
0:06:51.013,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and the results would have been the same.

147
0:06:53.029,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Even though I knew I shouldn't participate,

148
0:06:55.137,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I handed over my $20 bill,

149
0:06:58.052,000 --> 0:07:,000
and I never saw it again.

150
0:07:00.114,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:01.431,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We've done a bunch of experiments with patients

152
0:07:04.989,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in which we give them these electronic pill bottles

153
0:07:07.528,000 --> 0:07:09,000
so we can tell whether they're taking their medication or not.

154
0:07:10.538,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And we reward them with a lottery.

155
0:07:13.714,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They get prizes.

156
0:07:15.368,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But they only get prizes

157
0:07:17.682,000 --> 0:07:19,000
if they had taken their medication the day before.

158
0:07:20.421,000 --> 0:07:23,000
If not, they get a message that says something like,

159
0:07:23.475,000 --> 0:07:24,000
"You would have won a hundred dollars,

160
0:07:25.332,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but you didn't take your medicine yesterday, so you don't get it."

161
0:07:28.486,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Well, it turns out, patients hate that.

162
0:07:30.517,000 --> 0:07:32,000
They hate the sense of missing out,

163
0:07:32.805,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and because they can anticipate that feeling of regret

164
0:07:35.493,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and they'd like to avoid it,

165
0:07:37.187,000 --> 0:07:39,000
they're much more likely to take their medications.

166
0:07:40.07,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Harnessing that sense of hating regret works.

167
0:07:43.93,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And it leads to the more general point,

168
0:07:46.706,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which is: once you recognize how people are irrational,

169
0:07:50.246,000 --> 0:07:53,000
you're in a much better position to help them.

170
0:07:54.174,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now, this kind of irrationality works out even in men's restrooms.

171
0:07:59.05,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So, for those of you who don't frequent urinals,

172
0:08:03.874,000 --> 0:08:04,000
let me break this down for you.

173
0:08:05.549,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:06.786,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There is pee all over the floor.

175
0:08:08.424,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:11.164,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And it turns out that you can solve this problem

177
0:08:13.691,000 --> 0:08:16,000
by etching the image of a fly in the back of the urinal.

178
0:08:17.521,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

179
0:08:21.444,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And it makes perfect sense.

180
0:08:22.804,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:24.431,000 --> 0:08:25,000
If I see a fly,

182
0:08:26.124,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I'm gonna get that fly.

183
0:08:27.387,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:31.36,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That fly is going down.

185
0:08:33.286,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:34.881,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, this naturally begs the question that if men can aim,

187
0:08:38.376,000 --> 0:08:4,000
why were they peeing on the floor in the first place?

188
0:08:40.892,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In fact, if they were going to pee on the floor,

189
0:08:43.18,000 --> 0:08:44,000
why pee in front of the urinal?

190
0:08:44.7,000 --> 0:08:45,000
You could pee anywhere.

191
0:08:45.877,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:46.939,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And the same thing works in health care.

193
0:08:50.603,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We had a problem in our hospital

194
0:08:52.919,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in which the physicians were prescribing brand-name drugs

195
0:08:57.22,000 --> 0:08:59,000
when a generic drug was available.

196
0:08:59.555,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Each one of the lines on this graph represents a different drug.

197
0:09:03.421,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And they're listed according to how often they're prescribed as generic medications.

198
0:09:07.594,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Those are the top are prescribed as generics 100 percent of the time.

199
0:09:11.079,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Those down at the bottom are prescribed as generics

200
0:09:13.533,000 --> 0:09:14,000
less than 20 percent of the time.

201
0:09:15.142,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we'd have meetings with clinicians and all sorts of education sessions,

202
0:09:18.719,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and nothing worked --

203
0:09:19.909,000 --> 0:09:21,000
all the lines are pretty much horizontal.

204
0:09:22.895,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Until, someone installed a little piece of software

205
0:09:26.132,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the electronic health record

206
0:09:27.886,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that defaulted the prescriptions to generic medications

207
0:09:31.696,000 --> 0:09:32,000
instead of the brand-name drugs.

208
0:09:34.103,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now, it doesn't take a statistician

209
0:09:35.872,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to see that this problem was solved overnight,

210
0:09:38.949,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and it has stayed solved ever since.

211
0:09:41.486,000 --> 0:09:44,000
In fact, in the two and a half years since this program started,

212
0:09:44.894,000 --> 0:09:47,000
our hospital has saved 32 million dollars.

213
0:09:47.928,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Let me say that again: 32 million dollars.

214
0:09:51.415,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And all we did was make it easier

215
0:09:54.396,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for the doctors to do what they fundamentally wanted to do all along.

216
0:10:00.587,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It also works to play into people's notions of loss.

217
0:10:06.255,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We did this with a contest to help people walk more.

218
0:10:10.717,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We wanted everyone to walk at least 7,000 steps,

219
0:10:14.621,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and we measured their step count

220
0:10:16.209,000 --> 0:10:18,000
with the accelerometer on their cell phone.

221
0:10:19.388,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Group A, the control group, just got told whether they had walked

222
0:10:22.697,000 --> 0:10:23,000
7,000 steps or not.

223
0:10:25.281,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Group B got a financial incentive.

224
0:10:28.244,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We gave them $1.40 for every day they walked 7,000 steps.

225
0:10:33.22,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Group C got the same financial incentive,

226
0:10:35.384,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but it was framed as a loss rather than a gain:

227
0:10:38.73,000 --> 0:10:4,000
$1.40 a day is 42 dollars a month,

228
0:10:41.552,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so we gave these participants 42 dollars at the beginning of each month

229
0:10:45.833,000 --> 0:10:47,000
in a virtual account that they could see,

230
0:10:48.037,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and we took away $1.40 for every day they didn't walk 7,000 steps.

231
0:10:52.819,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now, an economist would say that those two financial incentives

232
0:10:55.968,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are the same.

233
0:10:57.319,000 --> 0:11:01,000
For every day you walk 7,000 steps, you're $1.40 richer.

234
0:11:01.678,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But a behavioral economist would say that they're different,

235
0:11:04.647,000 --> 0:11:08,000
because we're much more motivated to avoid a $1.40 loss

236
0:11:08.848,000 --> 0:11:11,000
than we are motivated to achieve a $1.40 gain.

237
0:11:12.122,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And that's exactly what happened.

238
0:11:14.579,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Those in the group that received $1.40 for every day they walked 7,000 steps

239
0:11:18.792,000 --> 0:11:21,000
were no more likely to meet their goal than the control group.

240
0:11:21.923,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The financial incentive didn't work.

241
0:11:24.034,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But those who had a loss-framed incentive

242
0:11:26.615,000 --> 0:11:29,000
met their goal 50 percent more of the time.

243
0:11:29.799,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It doesn't make economic sense, but it makes psychological sense,

244
0:11:33.325,000 --> 0:11:35,000
because losses loom larger than gains.

245
0:11:35.958,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And now we're using loss-framed incentives to help patients walk more,

246
0:11:40.146,000 --> 0:11:41,000
lose weight

247
0:11:41.438,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and take their medications.

248
0:11:43.815,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Money can be a motivator.

249
0:11:46.176,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We all know that.

250
0:11:47.365,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But it's far more influential when it's paired with psychology.

251
0:11:52.728,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And money, of course, has its own disadvantages.

252
0:11:55.042,000 --> 0:11:58,000
My favorite example of this involves a daycare program.

253
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The greatest sin you can commit in daycare is picking up your kids late.

254
0:12:04.39,000 --> 0:12:05,000
No one is happy.

255
0:12:05.898,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Your kids are crying because you don't love them.

256
0:12:08.285,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Laughter)

257
0:12:09.475,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The teachers are unhappy because they leave work late.

258
0:12:12.162,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And you feel terribly guilty.

259
0:12:14.496,000 --> 0:12:17,000
This daycare program in Israel decided they wanted to stop this problem,

260
0:12:18.214,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and they did something that many daycare programs in the US do,

261
0:12:21.247,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which is they installed a fine for late pickups.

262
0:12:23.801,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And the fine they chose was 10 shekels,

263
0:12:26.901,000 --> 0:12:27,000
which is about three bucks.

264
0:12:29.257,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And guess what happened?

265
0:12:31.191,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Late pickups increased.

266
0:12:34.2,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And if you think about it, it makes perfect sense.

267
0:12:37.2,000 --> 0:12:38,000
What a deal!

268
0:12:38.376,000 --> 0:12:39,000
For 10 shekels --

269
0:12:39.567,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Laughter)

270
0:12:40.873,000 --> 0:12:41,000
you can keep my kids all night!

271
0:12:42.641,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Laughter)

272
0:12:45.213,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They took a perfectly strong intrinsic motivation not to be late,

273
0:12:49.214,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and they cheapened it.

274
0:12:50.999,000 --> 0:12:52,000
What's worse, when they realized their mistake

275
0:12:53.795,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and they took away the financial incentive,

276
0:12:56.375,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the late pickups still stayed at the high level.

277
0:12:58.996,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They had already poisoned the social contract.

278
0:13:02.133,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Health care is full of strong intrinsic motivations.

279
0:13:05.9,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We have doctors and patients who already want to do the right thing.

280
0:13:09.935,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Financial incentives can help,

281
0:13:12.888,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but we shouldn't expect money in health care

282
0:13:15.117,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to do all of the heavy lifting.

283
0:13:18.014,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Instead, perhaps the most powerful influencers of health behavior

284
0:13:22.528,000 --> 0:13:23,000
are our social interactions.

285
0:13:24.519,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Social engagement works in health care,

286
0:13:27.043,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and it works in two directions.

287
0:13:29.684,000 --> 0:13:33,000
First, we fundamentally care what others think of us.

288
0:13:34.569,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And so one of the most powerful ways to change our behavior

289
0:13:38.17,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is to make our activities witnessable to others.

290
0:13:41.792,000 --> 0:13:43,000
We behave differently when we're being observed

291
0:13:44.233,000 --> 0:13:45,000
than when we're not.

292
0:13:45.551,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I've been to some restaurants that don't have sinks in the bathrooms.

293
0:13:48.874,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Instead, when you step out, the sink is outside

294
0:13:51.102,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in the main part of the restaurant,

295
0:13:52.829,000 --> 0:13:54,000
where everyone can see whether you wash your hands or not.

296
0:13:55.594,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Now, I don't know for sure,

297
0:13:56.933,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but I am convinced that handwashing is much greater

298
0:13:59.44,000 --> 0:14:,000
in those particular settings.

299
0:14:00.864,000 --> 0:14:03,000
We are always on our best behavior when we're being observed.

300
0:14:04.373,000 --> 0:14:05,000
In fact, there was this amazing study

301
0:14:06.236,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that was done in an intensive care unit in a Florida hospital.

302
0:14:09.728,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The handwashing rates were very low, which is dangerous, of course,

303
0:14:12.929,000 --> 0:14:13,000
because it can spread infection.

304
0:14:15.056,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And so some researchers pasted a picture of someone's eyes over the sink.

305
0:14:20.288,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It wasn't a real person, it was just a photograph.

306
0:14:22.664,000 --> 0:14:25,000
In fact, it wasn't even their whole face, it was just their eyes looking at you.

307
0:14:26.476,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Laughter)

308
0:14:27.548,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Handwashing rates more than doubled.

309
0:14:29.309,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It seems we care so much what other people think of us

310
0:14:32.273,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that our behavior improves

311
0:14:33.749,000 --> 0:14:36,000
even if we merely imagine that we're being observed.

312
0:14:37.556,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And not only do we care what others think of us,

313
0:14:40.742,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we fundamentally model our behaviors on what we see other people do.

314
0:14:45.898,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And it all comes back to seat belts.

315
0:14:48.552,000 --> 0:14:53,000
When I was a kid, I used to love the "Batman" TV series with Adam West.

316
0:14:54.246,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Everything that Batman and Robin did was so cool,

317
0:14:57.125,000 --> 0:15:,000
and, of course, the Batmobile was the coolest thing of all.

318
0:15:00.282,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Now, that show aired from 1966 to 1968,

319
0:15:04.511,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and at that time, seat belts were optional accessories in cars.

320
0:15:08.892,000 --> 0:15:1,000
But the producers of that show did something really important.

321
0:15:11.876,000 --> 0:15:13,000
When Batman and Robin got in the Batmobile,

322
0:15:14.697,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the camera would focus on their laps,

323
0:15:16.506,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and you would see Batman and Robin put on their seat belts.

324
0:15:19.42,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Now, if Batman and Robin put on their seat belts,

325
0:15:21.746,000 --> 0:15:23,000
you can bet that I was going to wear my seat belt, too.

326
0:15:24.422,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I bet that show saved thousands of lives.

327
0:15:26.893,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And again, it works in health care, too.

328
0:15:29.575,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Doctors use antibiotics more appropriately when they see how other doctors use them.

329
0:15:35.401,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So many activities in health care are hidden, they're unwitnessed,

330
0:15:40.119,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but doctors are social animals,

331
0:15:42.296,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and they perform better when they see what other doctors do.

332
0:15:47.355,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So social influence works in health care.

333
0:15:49.802,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So does tying it to notions of regret or to loss aversion.

334
0:15:53.793,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We would never think of using these tools if we thought that everyone was rational

335
0:15:59.122,000 --> 0:16:,000
all the time.

336
0:16:00.668,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now, just to be clear: I am not condemning rationality.

337
0:16:03.863,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I mean, that really would be irrational.

338
0:16:06.537,000 --> 0:16:1,000
But we all know that it's the nonrational parts of our minds

339
0:16:11.233,000 --> 0:16:14,000
where we get courage, creativity, inspiration

340
0:16:14.778,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and everything else that sparks passion.

341
0:16:17.357,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And we know something else, too.

342
0:16:19.238,000 --> 0:16:22,000
We know that we can be much more effective at improving health behavior

343
0:16:24.111,000 --> 0:16:27,000
if we work with the irrational parts of our nature

344
0:16:27.846,000 --> 0:16:3,000
instead of ignoring them or fighting against them.

345
0:16:30.966,000 --> 0:16:31,000
When it comes to health care,

346
0:16:32.824,000 --> 0:16:37,000
understanding our irrationality is just another tool in our toolbox.

347
0:16:38.081,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And harnessing that irrationality --

348
0:16:40.523,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that may be the most rational move of all.

349
0:16:44.312,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Thank you.

350
0:16:45.53,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Applause)

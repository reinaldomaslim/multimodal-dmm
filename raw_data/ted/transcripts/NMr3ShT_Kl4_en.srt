1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What I want to talk about today is one idea.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's an idea for a new kind of school,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about what schools are for and how they work.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Where it comes from

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is an organization called the Young Foundation,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which, over many decades,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
has come up with many innovations in education, like the Open University

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and things like Extended Schools,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Schools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the School of Everything.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And about five years ago, we asked

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
what was the most important need for innovation

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in schooling here in the U.K.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And we felt the most important priority

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
was to bring together two sets of problems.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
One was large numbers of bored teenagers

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
who just didn't like school,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and future jobs.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And employers who kept complaining

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work,

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
didn't have the right attitudes and experience.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And so we try to ask:

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
not fighting to stay out?

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And after hundreds of conversations

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
with teenagers and teachers and parents

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and employers and schools

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
from Paraguay to Australia,

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and looking at some of the academic research,

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which showed the importance

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of what's now called non-cognitive skills --

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the skills of motivation, resilience --

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and that these are as important

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills --

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which we called the Studio School.

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And we called it a studio school

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
where work and learning are integrated.

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You work by learning,

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and you learn by working.

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And the design we came up with had the following characteristics.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
First of all, we wanted small schools --

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
about 300, 400 pupils --

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
14 to 19 year-olds,

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done

50
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
not through sitting in classrooms,

51
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but through real-life, practical projects,

52
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
working on commission

53
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to businesses, NGO's and others.

54
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
who would have timetables

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
much more like a work environment in a business.

57
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And all of this will be done within the public system,

58
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
funded by public money,

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but independently run.

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And all at no extra cost, no selection,

61
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and allowing the pupils the route into university,

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and have manual jobs as well.

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Underlying it was some very simple ideas

65
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,

66
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
they learn best in teams

67
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and they learn best by doing things for real --

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
all the opposite of what mainstream schooling

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
actually does.

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now that was a nice idea,

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase.

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We tried it out,

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
first in Luton --

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
famous for its airport and not much else, I fear --

75
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and in Blackpool -- famous for its beaches and leisure.

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and then improved them --

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but we found that the young people loved it.

79
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They found it much more motivational, much more exciting

80
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
than traditional education.

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And perhaps most important of all,

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
two years later when the exam results came through,

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the pupils who had been put on these field trials

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
who were in the lowest performing groups

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
had jumped right to the top --

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance

87
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in terms of GCSE's,

88
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which is the British marking system.

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now not surprisingly,

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that influenced some people to think we were onto something.

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The minister of education

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
down south in London

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
described himself as a "big fan."

94
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the business organizations thought we were onto something

95
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in terms of a way of preparing children much better

96
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for real-life work today.

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust

99
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and helping it, not just with big businesses,

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but small businesses all over the country.

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We started with two schools.

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's grown this year to about 10.

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And next year, we're expecting about 35 schools

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
open across England,

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and another 40 areas

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
want to have their own schools opening --

107
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
a pretty rapid spread

108
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of this idea.

109
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Interestingly,

110
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it's happened almost entirely without media coverage.

111
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it.

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,

113
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
across teachers, parents,

114
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
people involved in education.

115
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And it spread because of the power of an idea --

116
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so the very, very simple idea

117
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
about turning education on its head

118
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and putting the things which were marginal,

119
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
things like working in teams, doing practical projects,

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and putting them right at the heart of learning,

121
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
rather than on the edges.

122
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now there's a whole set of new schools

123
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
opening up this autumn.

124
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is one from Yorkshire

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
where, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.

126
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And this one is focused

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
on creative and media industries.

128
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Other ones have a focus on health care,

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
tourism, engineering

130
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and other fields.

131
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We think we're onto something.

132
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's not perfect yet,

133
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but we think this is one idea

134
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which can transform the lives

135
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of thousands, possibly millions, of teenagers

136
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who are really bored by schooling.

137
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It doesn't animate them.

138
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
They're not like all of you who can sit in rows

139
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and hear things said to you for hour after hour.

140
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,

141
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
they want education to be for real.

142
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And my hope is that some of you out there

143
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
may be able to help us.

144
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We feel we're on the beginning of a journey

145
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of experiment and improvement

146
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to turn the Studio School idea

147
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
into something which is present,

148
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
not as a universal answer for every child,

149
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world.

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.

151
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Thank you very much.

152
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Applause)

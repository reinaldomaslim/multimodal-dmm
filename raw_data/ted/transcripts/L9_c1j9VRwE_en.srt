1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The humanitarian model has barely changed

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
since the early 20th century.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Its origins are firmly rooted

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the analog age.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The catalyst for this change

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
was the major earthquake that struck Haiti

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
on the 12th of January in 2010.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Haiti was a game changer.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince,

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
claiming the lives of some 320,000 people,

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
rendering homeless

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
about 1.2 million people.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Government institutions were completely decapitated,

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
including the presidential palace.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I remember standing

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
on the roof of the Ministry of Justice

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in downtown Port-au-Prince.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It was about two meters high,

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
completely squashed

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
by the violence of the earthquake.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
For those of us on the ground in those early days,

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that Haiti was something different.

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Haiti was something we hadn't seen before.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented.

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of what disaster response might look like

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in a hyper-connected world

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
where people have access

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to mobile smart devices.

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Because out of the urban devastation

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in Port-au-Prince

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
came a torrent of SMS texts --

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
people crying for help,

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
beseeching us for assistance,

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
sharing data, offering support,

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
looking for their loved ones.

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This was a situation

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet,

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but 80 percent of the people

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
had mobile devices in their hands.

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And we were unprepared for this,

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and they were shaping the aid effort.

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Outside Haiti also, things were looking different.

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
were scouring the Internet,

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
converting tweets

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that had already been converted from texts

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and putting these into open-source maps,

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
layering them with all sorts of important information --

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map --

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and putting these on the Web for everybody --

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves --

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to participate in and to use.

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Back in Haiti,

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
people were increasingly turning

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to the medium of SMS.

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
People that were hungry and hurting

61
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
were signaling their distress,

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
were signaling their need for help.

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
On street sides all over Port-au-Prince,

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
entrepreneurs sprung up

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
offering mobile phone charging stations.

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
They understood more than we did

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
people's innate need

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to be connected.

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Never having been confronted

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with this type of situation before,

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we wanted to try and understand

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
how we could tap into this incredible resource,

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
how we could really leverage

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
this incredible use of mobile technology

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and SMS technology.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We started talking with a local telecom provider called Voilà,

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International.

78
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We had basically three requirements.

79
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We wanted to communicate

80
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in a two-way form of communication.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well.

82
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We wanted to be able to target

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
specific geographic communities.

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And we wanted it to be easy to use.

86
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation

87
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
came something that we call TERA --

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the Trilogy Emergency Response Application --

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which has been used to support the aid effort

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
ever since.

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It has been used to signal early warning

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in advance of weather-related disasters.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's used for public health awareness campaigns

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
such as the prevention of cholera.

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And it is even used for sensitive issues

97
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
such as building awareness

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
around gender-based violence.

99
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But does it work?

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We have just published

101
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
an evaluation of this program,

102
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the evidence that is there for all to see

103
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is quite remarkable.

104
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Some 74 percent of people

105
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
received the data.

106
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Those who were intended to receive the data,

107
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
74 percent of them received it.

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
96 percent of them

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
found it useful.

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
83 percent of them took action --

111
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
evidence that it is indeed empowering.

112
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And 73 percent of them shared it.

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The TERA system

114
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
was developed from Haiti

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
with support of engineers in the region.

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It is a user-appropriate technology

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Technology is transformational.

119
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Right across the developing world,

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
citizens and communities

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
are using technology

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to enable them to bring about change, positive change,

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in their own communities.

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The grassroots has been strengthened

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
through the social power of sharing

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and they are challenging the old models,

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the old analog models

128
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of control and command.

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
One illustration of the transformational power of technology

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is in Kibera.

131
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums.

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's on the outskirts of Nairobi,

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the capital city of Kenya.

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's home to an unknown number of people --

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
some say between 250,000

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and 1.2 million.

137
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
If you were to arrive in Nairobi today

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and pick up a tourist map,

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Kibera is represented

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
as a lush, green national park

141
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
devoid of human settlement.

142
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Young people living in Kibera

143
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in their community,

144
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
with simple handheld devices,

145
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones,

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
have literally put themselves on the map.

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They have collated crowd-sourced data

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and rendered the invisible visible.

149
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
People like Josh and Steve

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
are continuing to layer information upon information,

151
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps

152
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
for all to use.

153
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session.

154
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You can find out about the latest security incident.

155
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You can find out about places of worship.

156
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You can find out about the health centers.

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You can feel the dynamism

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of this living, breathing community.

159
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They also have their own news network on YouTube

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
with 36,000 viewers at the moment.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They're showing us what can be done

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
with mobile, digital technologies.

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
They're showing that the magic of technology

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
can bring the invisible visible.

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And they are giving a voice to themselves.

166
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They are telling their own story,

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
bypassing the official narrative.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In Mongolia for instance,

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
where 30 percent of the people are nomadic,

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
SMS information systems are being used

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to track migration and weather patterns.

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
SMS is even used

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to hold herder summits

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
from remote participation.

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And if people are migrating

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments,

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they can also be helped in anticipation

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
with social supporters ready and waiting for them

180
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
based on SMS knowledge.

181
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In Nigeria,

182
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
open-source SMS tools

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
are being used by the Red Cross community workers

184
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to gather information from the local community

185
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in an attempt to better understand and mitigate

186
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the prevalence of malaria.

187
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program,

188
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper

189
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
than the traditional way of doing things.

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And not only is it empowering to the communities,

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but really importantly,

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
this information stays in the community

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.

194
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We are on a planet

195
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
of seven billion people,

196
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
five billion mobile subscriptions.

197
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
By 2015,

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
there will be three billion smartphones in the world.

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The U.N. broadband commission

200
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
has recently set targets

201
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to help broadband access

202
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in 50 percent of the Developing World,

203
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
compared to 20 percent today.

204
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world

205
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
where citizens from all cultures and all social strata

206
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
will have access to smart, fast mobile devices.

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
People are understanding,

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
from Cairo to Oakland,

209
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that there are new ways to come together,

210
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
there are new ways to mobilize,

211
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
there are new ways to influence.

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
A transformation is coming which needs to be understood

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models.

214
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
The collective voices of people

215
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
needs to be more integrated through new technologies

216
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
into the organizational strategies and plans of actions

217
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and not just recycled

218
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
for fundraising or marketing.

219
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We need to, for example, embrace

220
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the big data,

221
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the knowledge that is there from market leaders

222
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
who understand what it means

223
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to use and leverage big data.

224
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
One idea that I'd like you to consider, for instance,

225
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is to take a look at our IT departments.

226
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers,

227
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but they need to be elevated to software strategists.

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We need people in our organizations

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
who know what it's like to work with big data.

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We need technology

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
as a core organizational principle.

232
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We need technological strategists in the boardroom

233
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
who can ask and answer the question,

234
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
"What would Amazon or Google

235
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
do with all of this data?"

236
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and convert it to humanitarian good.

237
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The possibilities

238
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that new digital technologies are bringing

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
can help humanitarian organizations,

240
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
not only ensure

241
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that people's right to information is met,

242
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
or that they have their right to communicate,

243
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but I think in the future,

244
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate

245
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the right for people to access

246
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
critical communication technologies

247
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in order to ensure

248
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that their voices are heard,

249
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that they're truly participating,

250
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world.

251
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It has always been the elusive ideal

252
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters

253
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in the humanitarian effort.

254
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.

255
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
There are no more reasons not to do it.

256
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world

257
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
from analog to digital.

258
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Thank you very much.

259
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Applause)

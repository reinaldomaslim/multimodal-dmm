2
0:00:15.91,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have a friend in Portugal

3
0:00:18.158,000 --> 0:00:2,000
whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle

4
0:00:20.582,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and a washing machine so he could transport his family.

5
0:00:23.734,000 --> 0:00:25,000
He did it because he couldn't afford a car,

6
0:00:26.278,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but also because he knew how to build one.

7
0:00:29.182,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There was a time when we understood how things worked

8
0:00:32.318,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and how they were made, so we could build and repair them,

9
0:00:36.15,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or at the very least

10
0:00:37.277,000 --> 0:00:4,000
make informed decisions about what to buy.

11
0:00:40.757,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Many of these do-it-yourself practices

12
0:00:43.149,000 --> 0:00:46,000
were lost in the second half of the 20th century.

13
0:00:46.358,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But now, the maker community and the open-source model

14
0:00:50.03,000 --> 0:00:53,000
are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work

15
0:00:53.178,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and what they're made of back into our lives,

16
0:00:56.373,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I believe we need to take them to the next level,

17
0:00:59.397,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to the components things are made of.

18
0:01:02.365,000 --> 0:01:04,000
For the most part, we still know

19
0:01:04.517,000 --> 0:01:07,000
what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of

20
0:01:08.039,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and how they are produced.

21
0:01:10.068,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But now we have these amazing, futuristic composites --

22
0:01:14.131,000 --> 0:01:16,000
plastics that change shape,

23
0:01:16.334,000 --> 0:01:18,000
paints that conduct electricity,

24
0:01:18.686,000 --> 0:01:22,000
pigments that change color, fabrics that light up.

25
0:01:23.102,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Let me show you some examples.

26
0:01:29.429,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits

27
0:01:33.145,000 --> 0:01:34,000
instead of using the traditional

28
0:01:35.088,000 --> 0:01:37,000
printed circuit boards or wires.

29
0:01:37.686,000 --> 0:01:39,000
In the case of this little example I'm holding,

30
0:01:40.075,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin

31
0:01:43.956,000 --> 0:01:45,000
by turning on this little light.

32
0:01:46.671,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Conductive ink has been used by artists,

33
0:01:49.766,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able

34
0:01:53.141,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to use it in laser printers and pens.

35
0:01:57.636,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused

36
0:01:59.966,000 --> 0:02:01,000
with colorless light-diffusing particles.

37
0:02:02.762,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What this means is that, while regular acrylic

38
0:02:05.379,000 --> 0:02:07,000
only diffuses light around the edges,

39
0:02:07.727,000 --> 0:02:1,000
this one illuminates across the entire surface

40
0:02:10.997,000 --> 0:02:12,000
when I turn on the lights around it.

41
0:02:13.91,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Two of the known applications for this material

42
0:02:16.212,000 --> 0:02:21,000
include interior design and multi-touch systems.

43
0:02:21.325,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And thermochromic pigments

44
0:02:23.326,000 --> 0:02:25,000
change color at a given temperature.

45
0:02:25.939,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So I'm going to place this on a hot plate

46
0:02:28.725,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient

47
0:02:32.23,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and you can see what happens.

48
0:02:38.076,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So one of the principle applications for this material

49
0:02:40.836,000 --> 0:02:43,000
is, amongst other things, in baby bottles,

50
0:02:44.078,000 --> 0:02:49,000
so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink.

51
0:02:49.432,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So these are just a few of what are commonly known

52
0:02:52.188,000 --> 0:02:53,000
as smart materials.

53
0:02:54.097,000 --> 0:02:56,000
In a few years, they will be in many of the objects

54
0:02:57.037,000 --> 0:03:,000
and technologies we use on a daily basis.

55
0:03:00.396,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us,

56
0:03:04.61,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but we can have walls that change color

57
0:03:06.979,000 --> 0:03:07,000
depending on temperature,

58
0:03:08.741,000 --> 0:03:09,000
keyboards that roll up,

59
0:03:10.635,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch.

60
0:03:15.067,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So I'm a social scientist by training,

61
0:03:17.572,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so why am I here today talking about smart materials?

62
0:03:21.429,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Well first of all, because I am a maker.

63
0:03:24.142,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I'm curious about how things work

64
0:03:26.548,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and how they are made,

65
0:03:28.175,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding

66
0:03:31.483,000 --> 0:03:33,000
of the components that make up our world,

67
0:03:34.304,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and right now, we don't know enough about

68
0:03:36.784,000 --> 0:03:39,000
these high-tech composites our future will be made of.

69
0:03:40.473,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities.

70
0:03:43.998,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There's barely any information available on how to use them,

71
0:03:48.038,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and very little is said about how they are produced.

72
0:03:51.935,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So for now, they exist mostly in this realm

73
0:03:54.602,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of trade secrets and patents

74
0:03:57.314,000 --> 0:04:01,000
only universities and corporations have access to.

75
0:04:01.426,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I

76
0:04:04.275,000 --> 0:04:07,000
started a project we called Open Materials.

77
0:04:07.492,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's a website where we,

78
0:04:09.299,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and anyone else who wants to join us,

79
0:04:11.811,000 --> 0:04:14,000
share experiments, publish information,

80
0:04:14.867,000 --> 0:04:17,000
encourage others to contribute whenever they can,

81
0:04:18.067,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and aggregate resources such as research papers

82
0:04:22.076,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and tutorials by other makers like ourselves.

83
0:04:25.416,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We would like it to become a large,

84
0:04:28.038,000 --> 0:04:3,000
collectively generated database

85
0:04:30.576,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of do-it-yourself information on smart materials.

86
0:04:34.869,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But why should we care

87
0:04:37.089,000 --> 0:04:4,000
how smart materials work and what they are made of?

88
0:04:40.852,000 --> 0:04:44,000
First of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,

89
0:04:45.03,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and what we don't understand and use

90
0:04:47.382,000 --> 0:04:49,000
ends up shaping us.

91
0:04:49.59,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The objects we use, the clothes we wear,

92
0:04:52.342,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the houses we live in, all have a profound impact

93
0:04:55.906,000 --> 0:04:58,000
on our behavior, health and quality of life.

94
0:04:59.489,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials,

95
0:05:02.63,000 --> 0:05:05,000
we should know and understand them.

96
0:05:05.989,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Secondly, and just as important,

97
0:05:08.333,000 --> 0:05:11,000
innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers.

98
0:05:11.693,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So many times, amateurs, not experts,

99
0:05:15.078,000 --> 0:05:17,000
have been the inventors and improvers

100
0:05:17.397,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of things ranging from mountain bikes

101
0:05:19.877,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to semiconductors, personal computers,

102
0:05:23.189,000 --> 0:05:25,000
airplanes.

103
0:05:26.128,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The biggest challenge is that material science is complex

104
0:05:30.157,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and requires expensive equipment.

105
0:05:32.653,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But that's not always the case.

106
0:05:34.821,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this

107
0:05:38.409,000 --> 0:05:4,000
when they published a paper on a simpler method

108
0:05:41.009,000 --> 0:05:43,000
for making conductive ink.

109
0:05:43.429,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Jordan Bunker, who had had

110
0:05:45.341,000 --> 0:05:47,000
no experience with chemistry until then,

111
0:05:48.301,000 --> 0:05:5,000
read this paper and reproduced the experiment

112
0:05:51.088,000 --> 0:05:55,000
at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances

113
0:05:55.477,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and tools.

114
0:05:57.069,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He used a toaster oven,

115
0:05:58.67,000 --> 0:06:,000
and he even made his own vortex mixer,

116
0:06:01.636,000 --> 0:06:05,000
based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.

117
0:06:05.671,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Jordan then published his results online,

118
0:06:08.423,000 --> 0:06:11,000
including all the things he had tried and didn't work,

119
0:06:11.911,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so others could study and reproduce it.

120
0:06:15.055,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So Jordan's main form of innovation

121
0:06:17.727,000 --> 0:06:2,000
was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab

122
0:06:21.606,000 --> 0:06:22,000
at the university

123
0:06:23.108,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and recreate it in a garage in Chicago

124
0:06:26.295,000 --> 0:06:3,000
using only cheap materials and tools he made himself.

125
0:06:30.556,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And now that he published this work,

126
0:06:32.829,000 --> 0:06:33,000
others can pick up where he left

127
0:06:34.553,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and devise even simpler processes and improvements.

128
0:06:39.097,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Another example I'd like to mention

129
0:06:41.313,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts.

130
0:06:44.978,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Her project's goal is to highlight

131
0:06:47.858,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the expressive qualities of materials

132
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.

133
0:06:55.354,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Electronics kits are very powerful

134
0:06:57.794,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in that they teach us how things work,

135
0:07:00.346,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but the constraints inherent in their design

136
0:07:03.322,000 --> 0:07:05,000
influence the way we learn.

137
0:07:05.482,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So Hannah's approach, on the other hand,

138
0:07:07.97,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is to formulate a series of techniques

139
0:07:11.186,000 --> 0:07:13,000
for creating unusual objects

140
0:07:13.885,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that free us from pre-designed constraints

141
0:07:16.69,000 --> 0:07:19,000
by teaching us about the materials themselves.

142
0:07:20.101,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments,

143
0:07:22.834,000 --> 0:07:23,000
this is one of my favorites.

144
0:07:24.804,000 --> 0:07:27,000
["Paper speakers"]

145
0:07:28.221,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper

146
0:07:31.499,000 --> 0:07:35,000
with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player

147
0:07:35.941,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and a magnet.

148
0:07:37.594,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Music: "Happy Together")

149
0:07:48.191,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,

150
0:07:52.027,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Hannah created a series of paper speakers

151
0:07:54.81,000 --> 0:07:56,000
out of a wide range of materials

152
0:07:57.213,000 --> 0:08:01,000
from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.

153
0:08:01.488,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Just like Jordan and so many other makers,

154
0:08:04.224,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Hannah published her recipes

155
0:08:05.851,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.

156
0:08:10.985,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches

157
0:08:14.189,000 --> 0:08:15,000
of material science

158
0:08:15.996,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.

159
0:08:20.198,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So Hannah's artisanal work,

160
0:08:22.754,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the fact that she shared her findings,

161
0:08:25.002,000 --> 0:08:28,000
opens the doors to a series of new possibilities

162
0:08:28.822,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.

163
0:08:34.262,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So the interesting thing about makers

164
0:08:37.167,000 --> 0:08:4,000
is that we create out of passion and curiosity,

165
0:08:40.21,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and we are not afraid to fail.

166
0:08:42.289,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We often tackle problems from unconventional angles,

167
0:08:46.177,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and, in the process, end up discovering alternatives

168
0:08:49.166,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or even better ways to do things.

169
0:08:51.598,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So the more people experiment with materials,

170
0:08:55.366,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the more researchers are willing to share their research,

171
0:08:58.842,000 --> 0:09:,000
and manufacturers their knowledge,

172
0:09:01.282,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the better chances we have to create technologies

173
0:09:04.122,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that truly serve us all.

174
0:09:07.06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have

175
0:09:09.553,000 --> 0:09:12,000
when, in the early 1970s, he wrote,

176
0:09:13.264,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"You must understand computers now."

177
0:09:16.262,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Back then, computers were these large mainframes

178
0:09:20.116,000 --> 0:09:22,000
only scientists cared about,

179
0:09:22.246,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and no one dreamed of even having one at home.

180
0:09:24.966,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying,

181
0:09:27.942,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"You must understand smart materials now."

182
0:09:30.982,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge

183
0:09:34.718,000 --> 0:09:36,000
about emerging technologies

184
0:09:36.982,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is the best way to ensure that we have a say

185
0:09:39.379,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in the making of our future.

186
0:09:41.542,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Thank you.

187
0:09:44.013,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Applause)

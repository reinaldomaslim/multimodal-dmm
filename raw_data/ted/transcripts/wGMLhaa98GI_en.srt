0:00:12.859,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Diana Reiss: You may think you're looking

2
0:00:14.836,000 --> 0:00:18,000
through a window at a dolphin spinning playfully,

3
0:00:18.942,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but what you're actually looking through

4
0:00:21.1,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is a two-way mirror at a dolphin

5
0:00:23.661,000 --> 0:00:26,000
looking at itself spinning playfully.

6
0:00:26.851,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is a dolphin that is self-aware.

7
0:00:28.974,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This dolphin has self-awareness.

8
0:00:30.596,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's a young dolphin named Bayley.

9
0:00:32.676,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've been very interested in understanding the nature

10
0:00:35.724,000 --> 0:00:38,000
of the intelligence of dolphins for the past 30 years.

11
0:00:39.147,000 --> 0:00:42,000
How do we explore intelligence in this animal

12
0:00:42.331,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that's so different from us?

13
0:00:43.821,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And what I've used is a very simple research tool,

14
0:00:46.881,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a mirror, and we've gained great information,

15
0:00:49.461,000 --> 0:00:52,000
reflections of these animal minds.

16
0:00:52.918,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Dolphins aren't the only animals, the only non-human animals,

17
0:00:56.518,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to show mirror self-recognition.

18
0:00:58.658,000 --> 0:01:,000
We used to think this was a uniquely human ability,

19
0:01:01.65,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but we learned that the great apes, our closest relatives,

20
0:01:04.951,000 --> 0:01:05,000
also show this ability.

21
0:01:06.536,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Then we showed it in dolphins,

22
0:01:08.235,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and then later in elephants.

23
0:01:10.247,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants,

24
0:01:13.081,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and it's been recently shown in the magpie.

25
0:01:15.25,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, it's interesting, because we've embraced

26
0:01:18.15,000 --> 0:01:21,000
this Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution,

27
0:01:22.172,000 --> 0:01:23,000
this physical continuity.

28
0:01:23.764,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But we've been much more reticent, much slower

29
0:01:27.047,000 --> 0:01:3,000
at recognizing this continuity in cognition,

30
0:01:30.983,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in emotion, in consciousness in other animals.

31
0:01:33.967,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Other animals are conscious.

32
0:01:36.533,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They're emotional. They're aware.

33
0:01:39.823,000 --> 0:01:41,000
There have been multitudes of studies with many species

34
0:01:42.708,000 --> 0:01:45,000
over the years that have given us exquisite evidence

35
0:01:46.279,000 --> 0:01:48,000
for thinking and consciousness in other animals,

36
0:01:49.15,000 --> 0:01:52,000
other animals that are quite different than we are in form.

37
0:01:52.741,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We are not alone.

38
0:01:55.434,000 --> 0:01:59,000
We are not alone in these abilities.

39
0:01:59.564,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I hope, and one of my biggest dreams,

40
0:02:02.929,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is that, with our growing awareness

41
0:02:05.7,000 --> 0:02:06,000
about the consciousness of others

42
0:02:07.296,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and our relationship with the rest of the animal world,

43
0:02:09.94,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that we'll give them the respect and protection

44
0:02:12.53,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that they deserve.

45
0:02:13.411,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody,

46
0:02:15.959,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I hope I can really engage you in this idea.

47
0:02:19.8,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, I want to return to dolphins,

48
0:02:21.443,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because these are the animals that I feel like

49
0:02:23.659,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I've been working up closely and personal with

50
0:02:26.204,000 --> 0:02:27,000
for over 30 years.

51
0:02:27.614,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And these are real personalities.

52
0:02:29.463,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They are not persons, but they're personalities

53
0:02:32.564,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in every sense of the word.

54
0:02:34.05,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And you can't get more alien than the dolphin.

55
0:02:37.236,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They are very different from us in body form.

56
0:02:39.732,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They're radically different. They come from a radically different environment.

57
0:02:43.471,000 --> 0:02:46,000
In fact, we're separated by 95 million years

58
0:02:47.081,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of divergent evolution.

59
0:02:49.227,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Look at this body.

60
0:02:51.127,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And in every sense of making a pun here,

61
0:02:54.817,000 --> 0:02:58,000
these are true non-terrestrials.

62
0:02:59.18,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I wondered how we might interface with these animals.

63
0:03:02.628,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In the 1980s, I developed an underwater keyboard.

64
0:03:05.95,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This was a custom-made touch-screen keyboard.

65
0:03:08.369,000 --> 0:03:1,000
What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control.

66
0:03:11.298,000 --> 0:03:13,000
These are big brains, highly social animals,

67
0:03:13.42,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I thought, well, if we give them choice and control,

68
0:03:16.586,000 --> 0:03:18,000
if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard --

69
0:03:18.658,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and by the way, it was interfaced by fiber optic cables

70
0:03:21.329,000 --> 0:03:23,000
from Hewlett-Packard with an Apple II computer.

71
0:03:24.199,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This seems prehistoric now,

72
0:03:26.086,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but this was where we were with technology.

73
0:03:28.283,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol,

74
0:03:31.106,000 --> 0:03:33,000
they heard a computer-generated whistle,

75
0:03:33.28,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and they got an object or activity.

76
0:03:35.085,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now here's a little video.

77
0:03:36.503,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This is Delphi and Pan, and you're going to see Delphi

78
0:03:39.321,000 --> 0:03:43,000
hitting a key, he hears a computer-generated whistle -- (Whistle) --

79
0:03:43.47,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and gets a ball, so they can actually ask for things they want.

80
0:03:47.183,000 --> 0:03:51,000
What was remarkable is, they explored this keyboard

81
0:03:51.322,000 --> 0:03:54,000
on their own. There was no intervention on our part.

82
0:03:54.669,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They explored the keyboard. They played around with it.

83
0:03:57.313,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They figured out how it worked.

84
0:03:58.872,000 --> 0:04:,000
And they started to quickly imitate the sounds

85
0:04:01.087,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they were hearing on the keyboard.

86
0:04:03.836,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They imitated on their own.

87
0:04:05.793,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Beyond that, though, they started learning

88
0:04:07.964,000 --> 0:04:09,000
associations between the symbols, the sounds

89
0:04:10.724,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and the objects.

90
0:04:13.049,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What we saw was self-organized learning,

91
0:04:16.576,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and now I'm imagining, what can we do

92
0:04:19.975,000 --> 0:04:2,000
with new technologies?

93
0:04:21.377,000 --> 0:04:23,000
How can we create interfaces, new windows into

94
0:04:24.312,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the minds of animals, with the technologies that exist today?

95
0:04:29.233,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So I was thinking about this, and then, one day,

96
0:04:32.32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I got a call from Peter.

97
0:04:38.753,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living.

98
0:04:40.777,000 --> 0:04:41,000
On a good day, it's music,

99
0:04:42.515,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I want to talk a little bit about

100
0:04:44.301,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the most amazing music-making experience I ever had.

101
0:04:48.44,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'm a farm boy. I grew up surrounded by animals,

102
0:04:51.656,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and I would look in these eyes and wonder

103
0:04:53.655,000 --> 0:04:54,000
what was going on there?

104
0:04:55.35,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So as an adult, when I started to read about

105
0:04:57.618,000 --> 0:05:,000
the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko,

106
0:05:00.887,000 --> 0:05:03,000
with Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Kanzi, Panbanisha,

107
0:05:04.121,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Irene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot,

108
0:05:06.542,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I got all excited.

109
0:05:09.01,000 --> 0:05:1,000
What was amazing to me also

110
0:05:10.981,000 --> 0:05:13,000
was they seemed a lot more adept

111
0:05:14.81,000 --> 0:05:16,000
at getting a handle on our language

112
0:05:17.774,000 --> 0:05:21,000
than we were on getting a handle on theirs.

113
0:05:21.938,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I work with a lot of musicians from around the world,

114
0:05:25.557,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and often we don't have any common language at all,

115
0:05:28.325,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but we sit down behind our instruments,

116
0:05:32.012,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote.

117
0:05:35.349,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So I started cold-calling, and eventually got through

118
0:05:38.165,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh,

119
0:05:40.298,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and she invited me down.

120
0:05:42.197,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I went down, and the bonobos

121
0:05:46.579,000 --> 0:05:48,000
had had access to percussion instruments,

122
0:05:49.35,000 --> 0:05:52,000
musical toys, but never before to a keyboard.

123
0:05:52.984,000 --> 0:05:53,000
At first they did what infants do,

124
0:05:54.628,000 --> 0:05:56,000
just bashed it with their fists,

125
0:05:56.659,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and then I asked, through Sue,

126
0:05:59.132,000 --> 0:06:02,000
if Panbanisha could try with one finger only.

127
0:06:03.105,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Sue Savage-Rumbaugh: Can you play a grooming song?

128
0:06:08.282,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I want to hear a grooming song.

129
0:06:10.208,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Play a real quiet grooming song.

130
0:06:16.808,000 --> 0:06:19,000
PG: So groom was the subject of the piece.

131
0:06:20.4,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Music)

132
0:06:37.895,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So I'm just behind, jamming,

133
0:06:41.665,000 --> 0:06:45,000
yeah, this is what we started with.

134
0:06:46.41,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Sue's encouraging her to continue a little more.

135
0:06:49.927,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Music)

136
0:07:38.746,000 --> 0:07:42,000
She discovers a note she likes,

137
0:07:43.652,000 --> 0:07:46,000
finds the octave.

138
0:07:47.367,000 --> 0:07:51,000
She'd never sat at a keyboard before.

139
0:07:58.178,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Nice triplets.

140
0:08:12.709,000 --> 0:08:15,000
SSR: You did good. That was very good.

141
0:08:16.043,000 --> 0:08:17,000
PG: She hit good.

142
0:08:17.458,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Applause)

143
0:08:22.949,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So that night, we began to dream,

144
0:08:27.194,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we thought, perhaps the most amazing tool

145
0:08:29.969,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that man's created is the Internet,

146
0:08:32.149,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and what would happen if we could somehow

147
0:08:35.957,000 --> 0:08:36,000
find new interfaces,

148
0:08:37.853,000 --> 0:08:4,000
visual-audio interfaces that would allow

149
0:08:41.456,000 --> 0:08:43,000
these remarkable sentient beings

150
0:08:43.816,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that we share the planet with access?

151
0:08:46.402,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And Sue Savage-Rumbaugh got excited about that,

152
0:08:50.414,000 --> 0:08:52,000
called her friend Steve Woodruff,

153
0:08:52.535,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and we began hustling all sorts of people

154
0:08:55.623,000 --> 0:08:58,000
whose work related or was inspiring,

155
0:08:58.686,000 --> 0:09:,000
which led us to Diana,

156
0:09:00.855,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and led us to Neil.

157
0:09:03.842,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Neil Gershenfeld: Thanks, Peter. PG: Thank you.

158
0:09:06.057,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

159
0:09:09.666,000 --> 0:09:1,000
NG: So Peter approached me.

160
0:09:11.338,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I lost it when I saw that clip.

161
0:09:13.958,000 --> 0:09:16,000
He approached me with a vision of doing these things

162
0:09:17.018,000 --> 0:09:18,000
not for people, for animals.

163
0:09:18.632,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And then I was struck in the history of the Internet.

164
0:09:21.41,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This is what the Internet looked like when it was born

165
0:09:25.313,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and you can call that the Internet

166
0:09:27.846,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of middle-aged white men,

167
0:09:29.474,000 --> 0:09:29,000
mostly middle-aged white men.

168
0:09:30.494,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Vint Cerf: (Laughs)

169
0:09:32.571,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:35.609,000 --> 0:09:36,000
NG: Speaking as one.

171
0:09:37.231,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Then, when I first came to TED,

172
0:09:40.339,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which was where I met Peter, I showed this.

173
0:09:42.465,000 --> 0:09:44,000
This is a $1 web server,

174
0:09:44.851,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and at the time that was radical.

175
0:09:47.3,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And the possibility of making a web server for a dollar

176
0:09:51.006,000 --> 0:09:54,000
grew into what became known as the Internet of Things,

177
0:09:54.551,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications

178
0:09:57.803,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for health care, energy efficiency.

179
0:10:00.28,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And we were happy with ourselves.

180
0:10:01.697,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And then when Peter showed me that,

181
0:10:03.388,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I realized we had missed something,

182
0:10:05.079,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which is the rest of the planet.

183
0:10:07.106,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So we started up this interspecies Internet project.

184
0:10:09.607,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now we started talking with TED

185
0:10:11.233,000 --> 0:10:13,000
about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants

186
0:10:13.972,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to TED, and we realized that wouldn't work.

187
0:10:16.547,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So we're going to bring you to them.

188
0:10:18.621,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So if we could switch to the audio from this computer,

189
0:10:21.217,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals,

190
0:10:24.562,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and we're going to have each of them

191
0:10:25.774,000 --> 0:10:26,000
just briefly introduce them.

192
0:10:27.509,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And so if we could also have this up, great.

193
0:10:29.629,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So the first site we're going to meet

194
0:10:31.456,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, with orangutans.

195
0:10:34.524,000 --> 0:10:36,000
In the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now.

196
0:10:37.358,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So can you please go ahead?

197
0:10:40.423,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Terri Cox: Hi, I'm Terri Cox

198
0:10:43.082,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas,

199
0:10:45.512,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei,

200
0:10:49.203,000 --> 0:10:51,000
two of our Bornean orangutans.

201
0:10:51.275,000 --> 0:10:56,000
During the day, they have a beautiful, large outdoor habitat,

202
0:10:56.403,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and at night, they come into this habitat,

203
0:10:59.095,000 --> 0:11:,000
into their night quarters,

204
0:11:00.811,000 --> 0:11:01,000
where they can have a climate-controlled

205
0:11:02.74,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and secure environment to sleep in.

206
0:11:04.732,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We participate in the Apps for Apes program

207
0:11:09.127,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Orangutan Outreach, and we use iPads

208
0:11:12.56,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to help stimulate and enrich the animals,

209
0:11:14.749,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and also help raise awareness

210
0:11:16.458,000 --> 0:11:18,000
for these critically endangered animals.

211
0:11:18.895,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And they share 97 percent of our DNA

212
0:11:23.143,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and are incredibly intelligent,

213
0:11:24.951,000 --> 0:11:27,000
so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities

214
0:11:28.462,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that we have via technology and the Internet

215
0:11:31.498,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to really enrich their lives and open up their world.

216
0:11:35.24,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We're really excited about the possibility

217
0:11:37.317,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of an interspecies Internet,

218
0:11:39.167,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and K.J. has been enjoying the conference very much.

219
0:11:43.52,000 --> 0:11:45,000
NG: That's great. When we were rehearsing last night,

220
0:11:46.068,000 --> 0:11:47,000
he had fun watching the elephants.

221
0:11:47.964,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium.

222
0:11:51.032,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Please go ahead.

223
0:11:53.526,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Allison Ginsburg: Good evening.

224
0:11:54.675,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Well, my name is Allison Ginsburg,

225
0:11:56.319,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium.

226
0:11:59.165,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins:

227
0:12:02.81,000 --> 0:12:05,000
20-year-old Chesapeake, who was our first dolphin born here,

228
0:12:05.969,000 --> 0:12:07,000
her four-year-old daughter Bayley,

229
0:12:08.681,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and her half sister, 11-year-old Maya.

230
0:12:12.1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Now, here at the National Aquarium

231
0:12:13.744,000 --> 0:12:15,000
we are committed to excellence in animal care,

232
0:12:16.721,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to research, and to conservation.

233
0:12:19.193,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight.

234
0:12:22.505,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They're not really used to having cameras here

235
0:12:24.72,000 --> 0:12:25,000
at 8 o'clock at night.

236
0:12:26.197,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In addition, we are very committed to doing

237
0:12:28.931,000 --> 0:12:29,000
different types of research.

238
0:12:30.389,000 --> 0:12:32,000
As Diana mentioned, our animals are involved

239
0:12:33.002,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in many different research studies.

240
0:12:46.927,000 --> 0:12:49,000
NG: Those are for you.

241
0:12:50.316,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Okay, that's great, thank you.

242
0:12:52.114,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And the third user group, in Thailand,

243
0:12:55.356,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is Think Elephants. Go ahead, Josh.

244
0:12:59.709,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Josh Plotnik: Hi, my name is Josh Plotnik,

245
0:13:01.984,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I'm with Think Elephants International,

246
0:13:04.2,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand

247
0:13:06.558,000 --> 0:13:09,000
with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants.

248
0:13:09.633,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And we have 26 elephants here,

249
0:13:12.013,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants,

250
0:13:16.206,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but our foundation Think Elephants is focused

251
0:13:18.569,000 --> 0:13:21,000
on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world

252
0:13:21.615,000 --> 0:13:23,000
virtually like this and showing people

253
0:13:23.819,000 --> 0:13:25,000
how incredible these animals are.

254
0:13:25.952,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant,

255
0:13:28.111,000 --> 0:13:3,000
put food into the elephant's mouth,

256
0:13:30.329,000 --> 0:13:32,000
show people what's going on inside their mouths,

257
0:13:32.775,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and show everyone around the world

258
0:13:34.911,000 --> 0:13:36,000
how incredible these animals really are.

259
0:13:37.815,000 --> 0:13:39,000
NG: Okay, that's great. Thanks Josh.

260
0:13:40.319,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And once again, we've been building great relationships

261
0:13:42.311,000 --> 0:13:44,000
among them just since we've been rehearsing.

262
0:13:44.767,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So at that point, if we can go back to the other computer,

263
0:13:47.553,000 --> 0:13:49,000
we were starting to think about how you integrate

264
0:13:49.911,000 --> 0:13:51,000
the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet,

265
0:13:52.76,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and we went to the best possible person

266
0:13:55.367,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I can think of, which is Vint Cerf,

267
0:13:58.03,000 --> 0:14:01,000
who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint?

268
0:14:01.076,000 --> 0:14:03,000
VC: Thank you, Neil.

269
0:14:03.444,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Applause)

270
0:14:07.03,000 --> 0:14:12,000
A long time ago in a galaxy — oops, wrong script.

271
0:14:12.11,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Forty years ago, Bob Kahn and I

272
0:14:14.58,000 --> 0:14:15,000
did the design of the Internet.

273
0:14:16.179,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Thirty years ago, we turned it on.

274
0:14:18.942,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Just last year, we turned on the production Internet.

275
0:14:22.027,000 --> 0:14:24,000
You've been using the experimental version

276
0:14:24.15,000 --> 0:14:25,000
for the last 30 years.

277
0:14:25.626,000 --> 0:14:28,000
The production version, it uses IP version 6.

278
0:14:28.98,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It has 3.4 times 10 to the 38th possible terminations.

279
0:14:33.98,000 --> 0:14:36,000
That's a number only that Congress can appreciate.

280
0:14:37.137,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But it leads to what is coming next.

281
0:14:41.238,000 --> 0:14:43,000
When Bob and I did this design,

282
0:14:43.9,000 --> 0:14:46,000
we thought we were building a system to connect computers together.

283
0:14:47.406,000 --> 0:14:48,000
What we very quickly discovered

284
0:14:49.241,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is that this was a system for connecting people together.

285
0:14:52.424,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And what you've seen tonight

286
0:14:54.892,000 --> 0:14:57,000
tells you that we should not restrict this network

287
0:14:58.834,000 --> 0:15:,000
to one species,

288
0:15:01.016,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that these other intelligent, sentient species

289
0:15:04.857,000 --> 0:15:06,000
should be part of the system too.

290
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
This is the system as it looks today, by the way.

291
0:15:09.688,000 --> 0:15:12,000
This is what the Internet looks like to a computer

292
0:15:12.883,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that's trying to figure out where the traffic

293
0:15:15.153,000 --> 0:15:16,000
is supposed to go.

294
0:15:16.802,000 --> 0:15:18,000
This is generated by a program

295
0:15:19.427,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that's looking at the connectivity of the Internet,

296
0:15:22.176,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and how all the various networks are connected together.

297
0:15:25.013,000 --> 0:15:28,000
There are about 400,000 networks, interconnected,

298
0:15:28.378,000 --> 0:15:33,000
run independently by 400,000 different operating agencies,

299
0:15:33.517,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and the only reason this works

300
0:15:34.97,000 --> 0:15:37,000
is that they all use the same standard TCP/IP protocols.

301
0:15:38.795,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Well, you know where this is headed.

302
0:15:41.15,000 --> 0:15:43,000
The Internet of Things tell us

303
0:15:43.441,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that a lot of computer-enabled appliances and devices

304
0:15:47.737,000 --> 0:15:49,000
are going to become part of this system too:

305
0:15:50.193,000 --> 0:15:52,000
appliances that you use around the house,

306
0:15:52.466,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that you use in your office,

307
0:15:54.385,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that you carry around with yourself or in the car.

308
0:15:57.01,000 --> 0:15:59,000
That's the Internet of Things that's coming.

309
0:15:59.377,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Now, what's important about what these people are doing

310
0:16:02.179,000 --> 0:16:04,000
is that they're beginning to learn

311
0:16:04.53,000 --> 0:16:07,000
how to communicate with species

312
0:16:07.78,000 --> 0:16:08,000
that are not us

313
0:16:09.122,000 --> 0:16:12,000
but share a common sensory environment.

314
0:16:12.225,000 --> 0:16:14,000
We're beginning to explore what it means

315
0:16:14.449,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to communicate with something

316
0:16:16.013,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that isn't just another person.

317
0:16:18.375,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Well, you can see what's coming next.

318
0:16:21.101,000 --> 0:16:23,000
All kinds of possible sentient beings

319
0:16:24.029,000 --> 0:16:26,000
may be interconnected through this system,

320
0:16:26.053,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold.

321
0:16:29.17,000 --> 0:16:3,000
What happens after that?

322
0:16:31.185,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Well, let's see.

323
0:16:33.915,000 --> 0:16:36,000
There are machines that need to talk to machines

324
0:16:37.1,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and that we need to talk to, and so as time goes on,

325
0:16:40.358,000 --> 0:16:41,000
we're going to have to learn

326
0:16:42.177,000 --> 0:16:43,000
how to communicate with computers

327
0:16:43.945,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and how to get computers to communicate with us

328
0:16:46.444,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in the way that we're accustomed to,

329
0:16:48.263,000 --> 0:16:5,000
not with keyboards, not with mice,

330
0:16:51.126,000 --> 0:16:53,000
but with speech and gestures

331
0:16:53.19,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to.

332
0:16:56.174,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So we'll need something like C3PO

333
0:16:58.311,000 --> 0:17:01,000
to become a translator between ourselves

334
0:17:01.759,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and some of the other machines we live with.

335
0:17:03.901,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Now, there is a project that's underway

336
0:17:06.277,000 --> 0:17:07,000
called the interplanetary Internet.

337
0:17:08.099,000 --> 0:17:1,000
It's in operation between Earth and Mars.

338
0:17:10.823,000 --> 0:17:12,000
It's operating on the International Space Station.

339
0:17:13.845,000 --> 0:17:16,000
It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun

340
0:17:17.536,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that's rendezvoused with two planets.

341
0:17:19.358,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So the interplanetary system is on its way,

342
0:17:21.623,000 --> 0:17:22,000
but there's a last project,

343
0:17:23.329,000 --> 0:17:25,000
which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,

344
0:17:26.126,000 --> 0:17:27,000
which funded the original ARPANET,

345
0:17:28.086,000 --> 0:17:31,000
funded the Internet, funded the interplanetary architecture,

346
0:17:31.576,000 --> 0:17:34,000
is now funding a project to design a spacecraft

347
0:17:34.911,000 --> 0:17:38,000
to get to the nearest star in 100 years' time.

348
0:17:39.073,000 --> 0:17:41,000
What that means is that what we're learning

349
0:17:41.676,000 --> 0:17:43,000
with these interactions with other species

350
0:17:43.848,000 --> 0:17:45,000
will teach us, ultimately,

351
0:17:45.987,000 --> 0:17:48,000
how we might interact with an alien from another world.

352
0:17:49.98,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I can hardly wait.

353
0:17:52.63,000 --> 0:17:59,000
(Applause)

354
0:17:59.831,000 --> 0:17:59,000
June Cohen: So first of all, thank you,

355
0:18:00.809,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and I would like to acknowledge that four people

356
0:18:03.367,000 --> 0:18:04,000
who could talk to us for full four days

357
0:18:05.28,000 --> 0:18:07,000
actually managed to stay to four minutes each,

358
0:18:07.495,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and we thank you for that.

359
0:18:08.878,000 --> 0:18:09,000
I have so many questions,

360
0:18:10.157,000 --> 0:18:13,000
but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know.

361
0:18:13.515,000 --> 0:18:15,000
You're launching this idea here at TED — PG: Today.

362
0:18:16.041,000 --> 0:18:17,000
JC: Today. This is the first time you're talking about it.

363
0:18:17.237,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Tell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea.

364
0:18:20.261,000 --> 0:18:21,000
What's next?

365
0:18:21.294,000 --> 0:18:24,000
PG: I think we want to engage as many people

366
0:18:24.582,000 --> 0:18:26,000
here as possible in helping us

367
0:18:26.642,000 --> 0:18:3,000
think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible.

368
0:18:30.991,000 --> 0:18:31,000
NG: And just mechanically,

369
0:18:32.357,000 --> 0:18:34,000
there's a 501(c)(3) and web infrastructure

370
0:18:34.862,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and all of that, but it's not quite ready to turn on,

371
0:18:36.885,000 --> 0:18:38,000
so we'll roll that out, and contact us

372
0:18:38.917,000 --> 0:18:39,000
if you want the information on it.

373
0:18:40.561,000 --> 0:18:43,000
The idea is this will be -- much like the Internet functions

374
0:18:43.668,000 --> 0:18:43,000
as a network of networks,

375
0:18:44.673,000 --> 0:18:45,000
which is Vint's core contribution,

376
0:18:46.317,000 --> 0:18:48,000
this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives,

377
0:18:48.582,000 --> 0:18:5,000
that are wonderful individually, to link them globally.

378
0:18:51.377,000 --> 0:18:52,000
JC: Right, and do you have a web address

379
0:18:52.941,000 --> 0:18:53,000
that we might look for yet?

380
0:18:53.985,000 --> 0:18:55,000
NG: Shortly. JC: Shortly. We will come back to you on that.

381
0:18:56.771,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And very quickly, just to clarify.

382
0:19:00.048,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Some people might have looked at the video that you showed

383
0:19:02.255,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and thought, well, that's just a webcam.

384
0:19:03.763,000 --> 0:19:04,000
What's special about it?

385
0:19:04.834,000 --> 0:19:05,000
If you could talk for just a moment

386
0:19:06.525,000 --> 0:19:07,000
about how you want to go past that?

387
0:19:08.266,000 --> 0:19:11,000
NG: So this is scalable video infrastructure,

388
0:19:11.783,000 --> 0:19:13,000
not for a few to a few but many to many,

389
0:19:14.196,000 --> 0:19:16,000
so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing

390
0:19:17.206,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and content sharing across these sites around the planet.

391
0:19:20.344,000 --> 0:19:22,000
So there's a lot of back-end signal processing,

392
0:19:23.032,000 --> 0:19:25,000
not for one to many, but for many to many.

393
0:19:25.65,000 --> 0:19:26,000
JC: Right, and then on a practical level,

394
0:19:27.202,000 --> 0:19:28,000
which technologies are you looking at first?

395
0:19:28.913,000 --> 0:19:31,000
I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this.

396
0:19:32.263,000 --> 0:19:35,000
DR: We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins.

397
0:19:35.299,000 --> 0:19:37,000
This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work,

398
0:19:38.133,000 --> 0:19:4,000
and we just got our first seed money today towards that,

399
0:19:41.013,000 --> 0:19:42,000
so it's our first project.

400
0:19:42.386,000 --> 0:19:43,000
JC: Before the talk, even. DR: Yeah.

401
0:19:44.125,000 --> 0:19:45,000
JC: Wow. Well done.

402
0:19:45.476,000 --> 0:19:47,000
All right, well thank you all so much for joining us.

403
0:19:47.977,000 --> 0:19:49,000
It's such a delight to have you on the stage.

404
0:19:50.112,000 --> 0:19:51,000
DR: Thank you. VC: Thank you.

405
0:19:51.517,000 --> 0:19:56,000
(Applause)

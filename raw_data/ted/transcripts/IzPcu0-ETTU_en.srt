2
0:00:16.779,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes,

3
0:00:19.554,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and this is from a book I'm preparing called

4
0:00:23.37,000 --> 0:00:25,000
"Letters to a Young Scientist."

5
0:00:25.795,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'd thought it'd be appropriate to

6
0:00:27.946,000 --> 0:00:32,000
present it, on the basis that I have had extensive experience

7
0:00:33.035,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in teaching, counseling scientists across a broad array of fields.

8
0:00:36.731,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing

9
0:00:42.13,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that teaching and counseling.

10
0:00:43.811,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So let me begin by urging you,

11
0:00:46.709,000 --> 0:00:48,000
particularly you on the youngsters' side,

12
0:00:49.258,000 --> 0:00:5,000
on this path you've chosen,

13
0:00:51.234,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to go as far as you can.

14
0:00:53.138,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The world needs you, badly.

15
0:00:56.606,000 --> 0:01:,000
Humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age.

16
0:01:01.124,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There is going to be no turning back.

17
0:01:03.603,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Although varying among disciplines -- say, astrophysics,

18
0:01:08.528,000 --> 0:01:11,000
molecular genetics, the immunology, the microbiology, the public

19
0:01:12.49,000 --> 0:01:18,000
health, to the new area of the human body as a symbiont,

20
0:01:18.684,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to public health, environmental science.

21
0:01:21.165,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Knowledge in medical science and science overall

22
0:01:24.281,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is doubling every 15 to 20 years.

23
0:01:27.418,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Technology is increasing at a comparable rate.

24
0:01:30.506,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Between them, the two already pervade,

25
0:01:33.49,000 --> 0:01:35,000
as most of you here seated realize,

26
0:01:36.354,000 --> 0:01:38,000
every dimension of human life.

27
0:01:38.739,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution,

28
0:01:43.795,000 --> 0:01:47,000
so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict

29
0:01:48.522,000 --> 0:01:52,000
its outcome even a decade from the present moment.

30
0:01:52.97,000 --> 0:01:53,000
There will come a time, of course,

31
0:01:54.667,000 --> 0:01:57,000
when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,

32
0:01:58.418,000 --> 0:02:,000
which actually began in the 1600s,

33
0:02:00.554,000 --> 0:02:02,000
has to peak and level off,

34
0:02:03.37,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but that's not going to matter to you.

35
0:02:04.618,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The revolution is going to continue

36
0:02:05.932,000 --> 0:02:07,000
for at least several more decades.

37
0:02:08.89,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It'll render the human condition

38
0:02:10.634,000 --> 0:02:12,000
radically different from what it is today.

39
0:02:12.98,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow

40
0:02:19.298,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines.

41
0:02:24.123,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In time, all of science will come to be

42
0:02:27.97,000 --> 0:02:32,000
a continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.

43
0:02:33.426,000 --> 0:02:36,000
That's why you need not just be training

44
0:02:36.626,000 --> 0:02:4,000
in one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields,

45
0:02:41.066,000 --> 0:02:44,000
related to and even distant from your own initial choice.

46
0:02:44.754,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning.

47
0:02:48.699,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The search for knowledge is in our genes.

48
0:02:51.764,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It was put there by our distant ancestors

49
0:02:55.276,000 --> 0:02:56,000
who spread across the world,

50
0:02:56.899,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and it's never going to be quenched.

51
0:02:58.594,000 --> 0:03:01,000
To understand and use it sanely,

52
0:03:01.787,000 --> 0:03:04,000
as a part of the civilization yet to evolve

53
0:03:05.746,000 --> 0:03:1,000
requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you.

54
0:03:11.588,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In education, medicine, law, diplomacy,

55
0:03:15.626,000 --> 0:03:19,000
government, business and the media that exist today.

56
0:03:19.914,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific

57
0:03:24.874,000 --> 0:03:27,000
literacy, which most badly lack today --

58
0:03:27.97,000 --> 0:03:28,000
no applause, please.

59
0:03:29.514,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It will be better for all

60
0:03:31.972,000 --> 0:03:35,000
if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.

61
0:03:36.643,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Therefore you will do well to act on the side,

62
0:03:39.802,000 --> 0:03:41,000
no matter how far into the laboratory

63
0:03:42.507,000 --> 0:03:45,000
you may go, to serve as teachers

64
0:03:45.826,000 --> 0:03:47,000
during the span of your career.

65
0:03:47.834,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I'll now proceed quickly,

66
0:03:49.909,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset

67
0:03:53.098,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and a potential barrier to a scientific career.

68
0:03:56.53,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills,

69
0:04:00.01,000 --> 0:04:01,000
don't worry.

70
0:04:01.339,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Many of the most successful scientists

71
0:04:03.85,000 --> 0:04:07,000
at work today are mathematically semi-literate.

72
0:04:08.05,000 --> 0:04:1,000
A metaphor will serve here:

73
0:04:10.535,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Where elite mathematicians and statisticians

74
0:04:16.538,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm

75
0:04:21.603,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of science, the remaining large majority of

76
0:04:25.306,000 --> 0:04:29,000
basic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be

77
0:04:30.018,000 --> 0:04:35,000
said to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout

78
0:04:35.37,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the frontiers, they cut the pathways,

79
0:04:38.122,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they raise the buildings along the way.

80
0:04:40.858,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Some may have considered me foolhardy,

81
0:04:44.034,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics

82
0:04:47.795,000 --> 0:04:49,000
when talking to candidate scientists.

83
0:04:49.858,000 --> 0:04:52,000
During 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard,

84
0:04:53.658,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I watched sadly as bright students turned away

85
0:04:57.775,000 --> 0:04:59,000
from the possibility of a scientific career

86
0:05:00.699,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or even from taking non-required courses in science

87
0:05:04.427,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because they were afraid of failure.

88
0:05:06.258,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These math-phobes deprive science and medicine

89
0:05:09.618,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.

90
0:05:12.867,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Here's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them:

91
0:05:16.818,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Understand that mathematics is a language

92
0:05:19.41,000 --> 0:05:22,000
ruled like other verbal languages,

93
0:05:23.234,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or like verbal language generally, by its own grammar

94
0:05:26.233,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and system of logic.

95
0:05:28.138,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Any person with average quantitative intelligence

96
0:05:30.996,000 --> 0:05:33,000
who learns to read and write mathematics

97
0:05:34.138,000 --> 0:05:4,000
at an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty

98
0:05:40.89,000 --> 0:05:42,000
picking up most of the fundamentals

99
0:05:42.954,000 --> 0:05:47,000
if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science.

100
0:05:48.291,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The longer you wait to become at least semi-literate

101
0:05:52.074,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal

102
0:05:58.082,000 --> 0:06:,000
language, but it can be done at any age.

103
0:06:01.059,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I speak as an authority

104
0:06:02.77,000 --> 0:06:05,000
on that subject, because I'm an extreme case.

105
0:06:06.621,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I didn't take algebra until my freshman year

106
0:06:10.282,000 --> 0:06:12,000
at the University of Alabama.

107
0:06:12.313,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They didn't teach it before then.

108
0:06:14.634,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,

109
0:06:19.538,000 --> 0:06:23,000
where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,

110
0:06:24.164,000 --> 0:06:26,000
little more than half my age.

111
0:06:26.594,000 --> 0:06:27,000
A couple of them were students

112
0:06:28.066,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.

113
0:06:31.322,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.

114
0:06:36.578,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I found out that in science and all its applications,

115
0:06:39.674,000 --> 0:06:42,000
what is crucial is not that technical ability,

116
0:06:43.636,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but it is imagination in all of its applications.

117
0:06:46.805,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes

118
0:06:51.139,000 --> 0:06:53,000
pictured by intuition.

119
0:06:54.075,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream

120
0:06:58.419,000 --> 0:07:01,000
from an ability to stand at a blackboard

121
0:07:01.451,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions

122
0:07:04.586,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and equations.

123
0:07:06.442,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,

124
0:07:11.874,000 --> 0:07:15,000
during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.

125
0:07:16.434,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied

126
0:07:21.633,000 --> 0:07:22,000
for its own sake.

127
0:07:23.05,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge

128
0:07:28.691,000 --> 0:07:34,000
of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain

129
0:07:35.34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
you propose to enter.

130
0:07:36.78,000 --> 0:07:38,000
When something new is discovered,

131
0:07:38.906,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is

132
0:07:43.875,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.

133
0:07:48.027,000 --> 0:07:5,000
If that step proves too difficult for

134
0:07:50.579,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the person or team that made the discovery,

135
0:07:54.751,000 --> 0:07:59,000
a mathematician can then be added by them

136
0:08:00.05,000 --> 0:08:02,000
as a collaborator.

137
0:08:02.347,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Consider the following principle,

138
0:08:04.506,000 --> 0:08:09,000
which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:

139
0:08:09.706,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It is far easier for scientists

140
0:08:14.106,000 --> 0:08:18,000
including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration

141
0:08:18.675,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in mathematics and statistics

142
0:08:20.793,000 --> 0:08:23,000
than it is for mathematicians and statisticians

143
0:08:24.474,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to find scientists able to make use of their equations.

144
0:08:28.57,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It is important in choosing the direction to take in science

145
0:08:32.664,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,

146
0:08:38.41,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and focus on that.

147
0:08:40.05,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Keep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:

148
0:08:44.746,000 --> 0:08:48,000
For every scientist, whether researcher, technician,

149
0:08:49.282,000 --> 0:08:52,000
teacher, manager or businessman,

150
0:08:52.377,000 --> 0:08:55,000
working at any level of mathematical competence,

151
0:08:56.364,000 --> 0:08:59,000
there exists a discipline in science or medicine

152
0:08:59.818,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for which that level is enough to achieve excellence.

153
0:09:03.754,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now I'm going to offer quickly

154
0:09:06.314,000 --> 0:09:08,000
several more principles that will be useful

155
0:09:08.722,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in organizing your education and career,

156
0:09:11.41,000 --> 0:09:15,000
or if you're teaching, how you might

157
0:09:15.795,000 --> 0:09:19,000
enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists.

158
0:09:20.683,000 --> 0:09:23,000
In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research,

159
0:09:24.482,000 --> 0:09:27,000
or to develop world-class expertise,

160
0:09:27.682,000 --> 0:09:32,000
take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.

161
0:09:33.01,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers

162
0:09:37.722,000 --> 0:09:38,000
are on hand.

163
0:09:39.258,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement

164
0:09:42.908,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself

165
0:09:46.347,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in ongoing research to programs of high quality.

166
0:09:50.81,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful

167
0:09:55.538,000 --> 0:09:58,000
programs, and to make friends and colleagues of your age

168
0:09:59.426,000 --> 0:10:,000
for mutual support.

169
0:10:01.282,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But through it all, look for a way to break out,

170
0:10:03.97,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to find a field and subject not yet popular.

171
0:10:07.906,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine.

172
0:10:11.683,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,

173
0:10:16.794,000 --> 0:10:19,000
as measured in discoveries per investigator per year.

174
0:10:20.411,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You may have heard the

175
0:10:22.018,000 --> 0:10:25,000
military dictum for the gathering of armies:

176
0:10:25.778,000 --> 0:10:27,000
March to the sound of the guns.

177
0:10:28.499,000 --> 0:10:34,000
In science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.

178
0:10:35.009,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So Wilson's Principle Number Three:

179
0:10:37.714,000 --> 0:10:4,000
March away from the sound of the guns.

180
0:10:41.058,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Observe from a distance,

181
0:10:42.922,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but do not join the fray.

182
0:10:45.019,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Make a fray of your own.

183
0:10:47.387,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Once you have settled on a specialty,

184
0:10:51.642,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity,

185
0:10:56.922,000 --> 0:11:01,000
your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it

186
0:11:02.203,000 --> 0:11:04,000
enough to become an expert.

187
0:11:04.883,000 --> 0:11:07,000
There are thousands of professionally delimited

188
0:11:08.21,000 --> 0:11:1,000
subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry

189
0:11:10.686,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to biology and medicine.

190
0:11:12.602,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And on then into the social sciences,

191
0:11:15.498,000 --> 0:11:18,000
where it is possible in short time to acquire

192
0:11:18.7,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the status of an authority.

193
0:11:21.274,000 --> 0:11:24,000
When the subject is still very thinly populated,

194
0:11:24.786,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you can with diligence and hard work become

195
0:11:27.407,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the world authority.

196
0:11:29.618,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The world needs this kind of expertise,

197
0:11:33.579,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and it rewards the kind of people

198
0:11:35.754,000 --> 0:11:37,000
willing to acquire it.

199
0:11:37.906,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The existing information and what you self-discover

200
0:11:42.402,000 --> 0:11:46,000
may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect

201
0:11:46.513,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to other bodies of knowledge.

202
0:11:48.549,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Well, if that's the case,

203
0:11:50.418,000 --> 0:11:54,000
good. Why hard instead of easy?

204
0:11:54.56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.

205
0:11:59.415,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In the attempt to make scientific discoveries,

206
0:12:02.834,000 --> 0:12:03,000
every problem is an opportunity,

207
0:12:04.827,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and the more difficult the problem,

208
0:12:06.322,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the greater will be the importance of its solution.

209
0:12:09.082,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now this brings me to a basic categorization

210
0:12:12.89,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in the way scientific discoveries are made.

211
0:12:15.765,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them,

212
0:12:19.129,000 --> 0:12:22,000
follow one or the other of two pathways:

213
0:12:22.396,000 --> 0:12:24,000
First through early discoveries,

214
0:12:24.506,000 --> 0:12:26,000
a problem is identified

215
0:12:26.65,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and a solution is sought.

216
0:12:28.482,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The problem may be relatively small;

217
0:12:31.011,000 --> 0:12:36,000
for example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?

218
0:12:36.432,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Or larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?

219
0:12:42.338,000 --> 0:12:46,000
As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered

220
0:12:46.797,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and other questions are asked.

221
0:12:48.442,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter,

222
0:12:51.458,000 --> 0:12:55,000
exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,

223
0:12:55.707,000 --> 0:12:57,000
who finds other quarries along the way.

224
0:12:58.626,000 --> 0:13:,000
The second strategy of research

225
0:13:01.458,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is to study a subject broadly

226
0:13:03.25,000 --> 0:13:07,000
searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena

227
0:13:08.026,000 --> 0:13:11,000
like a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance,"

228
0:13:11.827,000 --> 0:13:14,000
the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,

229
0:13:15.49,000 --> 0:13:16,000
any quarry worth taking.

230
0:13:16.874,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The search is not for the solution of the problem,

231
0:13:19.227,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but for problems themselves worth solving.

232
0:13:22.434,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The two strategies of research,

233
0:13:24.426,000 --> 0:13:27,000
original research, can be stated as follows,

234
0:13:27.611,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in the final principle I'm going to offer you:

235
0:13:31.899,000 --> 0:13:35,000
For every problem in a given discipline of science,

236
0:13:36.163,000 --> 0:13:39,000
there exists a species or entity or phenomenon

237
0:13:39.738,000 --> 0:13:4,000
ideal for its solution.

238
0:13:41.684,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And conversely, for every species or other entity

239
0:13:47.082,000 --> 0:13:49,000
or phenomenon, there exist important problems

240
0:13:50.018,000 --> 0:13:57,000
for the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.

241
0:13:57.595,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Find out what they are.

242
0:13:59.532,000 --> 0:14:02,000
You'll find your own way to discover,

243
0:14:02.667,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to learn, to teach.

244
0:14:04.85,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The decades ahead will see dramatic advances

245
0:14:08.283,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in disease prevention, general health, the quality of life.

246
0:14:12.85,000 --> 0:14:18,000
All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science

247
0:14:18.875,000 --> 0:14:19,000
behind it you will master.

248
0:14:20.458,000 --> 0:14:23,000
You have chosen a calling that will come in steps

249
0:14:23.922,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived.

250
0:14:29.333,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I thank you for having me here tonight.

251
0:14:31.946,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

252
0:14:37.314,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Oh, thank you.

253
0:14:38.586,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Thank you very much.

254
0:14:45.742,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I salute you.

1
0:00:13.246,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Computers used to be as big as a room.

2
0:00:16.854,000 --> 0:00:17,000
But now they fit in your pocket,

3
0:00:18.47,000 --> 0:00:19,000
on your wrist

4
0:00:19.665,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and can even be implanted inside of your body.

5
0:00:23.008,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How cool is that?

6
0:00:24.809,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And this has been enabled by the miniaturization of transistors,

7
0:00:29.17,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which are the tiny switches in the circuits

8
0:00:31.686,000 --> 0:00:32,000
at the heart of our computers.

9
0:00:34.051,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it's been achieved through decades of development

10
0:00:37.247,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and breakthroughs in science and engineering

11
0:00:40.069,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and of billions of dollars of investment.

12
0:00:43.352,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But it's given us vast amounts of computing,

13
0:00:46.124,000 --> 0:00:47,000
huge amounts of memory

14
0:00:47.953,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the digital revolution that we all experience and enjoy today.

15
0:00:53.665,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But the bad news is,

16
0:00:56.457,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we're about to hit a digital roadblock,

17
0:00:59.613,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down.

18
0:01:04.471,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And this is happening at exactly the same time

19
0:01:07.369,000 --> 0:01:1,000
as our innovation in software is continuing relentlessly

20
0:01:11.391,000 --> 0:01:14,000
with artificial intelligence and big data.

21
0:01:15.175,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And our devices regularly perform facial recognition or augment our reality

22
0:01:20.239,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or even drive cars down our treacherous, chaotic roads.

23
0:01:24.959,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's amazing.

24
0:01:26.618,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But if we don't keep up with the appetite of our software,

25
0:01:31.309,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we could reach a point in the development of our technology

26
0:01:35.12,000 --> 0:01:39,000
where the things that we could do with software could, in fact, be limited

27
0:01:39.354,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by our hardware.

28
0:01:41.075,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We've all experienced the frustration of an old smartphone or tablet

29
0:01:45.607,000 --> 0:01:48,000
grinding slowly to a halt over time

30
0:01:48.795,000 --> 0:01:51,000
under the ever-increasing weight of software updates and new features.

31
0:01:52.794,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And it worked just fine when we bought it not so long ago.

32
0:01:56.201,000 --> 0:02:,000
But the hungry software engineers have eaten up all the hardware capacity

33
0:02:00.735,000 --> 0:02:01,000
over time.

34
0:02:03.883,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The semiconductor industry is very well aware of this

35
0:02:07.519,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and is working on all sorts of creative solutions,

36
0:02:11.427,000 --> 0:02:15,000
such as going beyond transistors to quantum computing

37
0:02:15.762,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or even working with transistors in alternative architectures

38
0:02:19.998,000 --> 0:02:2,000
such as neural networks

39
0:02:21.625,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to make more robust and efficient circuits.

40
0:02:25.27,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But these approaches will take quite some time,

41
0:02:28.633,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we're really looking for a much more immediate solution to this problem.

42
0:02:34.899,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The reason why the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down

43
0:02:39.705,000 --> 0:02:43,000
is due to the ever-increasing complexity of the manufacturing process.

44
0:02:45.142,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The transistor used to be a big, bulky device,

45
0:02:48.416,000 --> 0:02:51,000
until the invent of the integrated circuit

46
0:02:51.749,000 --> 0:02:53,000
based on pure crystalline silicon wafers.

47
0:02:54.946,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And after 50 years of continuous development,

48
0:02:57.749,000 --> 0:03:,000
we can now achieve transistor features dimensions

49
0:03:01.146,000 --> 0:03:03,000
down to 10 nanometers.

50
0:03:04.361,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You can fit more than a billion transistors

51
0:03:06.822,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in a single square millimeter of silicon.

52
0:03:10.273,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And to put this into perspective:

53
0:03:12.319,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a human hair is 100 microns across.

54
0:03:16.169,000 --> 0:03:18,000
A red blood cell, which is essentially invisible,

55
0:03:18.712,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is eight microns across,

56
0:03:20.335,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and you can place 12 across the width of a human hair.

57
0:03:24.467,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But a transistor, in comparison, is much smaller,

58
0:03:27.591,000 --> 0:03:3,000
at a tiny fraction of a micron across.

59
0:03:31.463,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You could place more than 260 transistors

60
0:03:35.033,000 --> 0:03:36,000
across a single red blood cell

61
0:03:37.035,000 --> 0:03:41,000
or more than 3,000 across the width of a human hair.

62
0:03:41.523,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It really is incredible nanotechnology in your pocket right now.

63
0:03:47.204,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And besides the obvious benefit

64
0:03:49.416,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of being able to place more, smaller transistors on a chip,

65
0:03:53.984,000 --> 0:03:56,000
smaller transistors are faster switches,

66
0:03:58.166,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and smaller transistors are also more efficient switches.

67
0:04:02.591,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So this combination has given us

68
0:04:05.092,000 --> 0:04:09,000
lower cost, higher performance and higher efficiency electronics

69
0:04:09.415,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that we all enjoy today.

70
0:04:14.415,000 --> 0:04:16,000
To manufacture these integrated circuits,

71
0:04:17.203,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the transistors are built up layer by layer,

72
0:04:20.435,000 --> 0:04:22,000
on a pure crystalline silicon wafer.

73
0:04:23.332,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And in an oversimplified sense,

74
0:04:25.584,000 --> 0:04:29,000
every tiny feature of the circuit is projected

75
0:04:29.889,000 --> 0:04:31,000
onto the surface of the silicon wafer

76
0:04:32.245,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and recorded in a light-sensitive material

77
0:04:35.948,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then etched through the light-sensitive material

78
0:04:38.911,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to leave the pattern in the underlying layers.

79
0:04:42.612,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And this process has been dramatically improved over the years

80
0:04:46.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to give the electronics performance we have today.

81
0:04:50.279,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But as the transistor features get smaller and smaller,

82
0:04:53.745,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we're really approaching the physical limitations

83
0:04:56.806,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of this manufacturing technique.

84
0:05:00.515,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The latest systems for doing this patterning

85
0:05:03.644,000 --> 0:05:05,000
have become so complex

86
0:05:05.971,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that they reportedly cost more than 100 million dollars each.

87
0:05:10.725,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And semiconductor factories contain dozens of these machines.

88
0:05:15.036,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So people are seriously questioning: Is this approach long-term viable?

89
0:05:20.441,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But we believe we can do this chip manufacturing

90
0:05:24.145,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in a totally different and much more cost-effective way

91
0:05:28.966,000 --> 0:05:31,000
using molecular engineering and mimicking nature

92
0:05:32.963,000 --> 0:05:35,000
down at the nanoscale dimensions of our transistors.

93
0:05:37.267,000 --> 0:05:41,000
As I said, the conventional manufacturing takes every tiny feature of the circuit

94
0:05:41.952,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and projects it onto the silicon.

95
0:05:44.818,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But if you look at the structure of an integrated circuit,

96
0:05:47.586,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the transistor arrays,

97
0:05:49.584,000 --> 0:05:52,000
many of the features are repeated millions of times.

98
0:05:53.237,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's a highly periodic structure.

99
0:05:56.331,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So we want to take advantage of this periodicity

100
0:05:59.423,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in our alternative manufacturing technique.

101
0:06:02.144,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We want to use self-assembling materials

102
0:06:05.603,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to naturally form the periodic structures

103
0:06:08.604,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that we need for our transistors.

104
0:06:12.052,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We do this with the materials,

105
0:06:14.218,000 --> 0:06:17,000
then the materials do the hard work of the fine patterning,

106
0:06:17.679,000 --> 0:06:21,000
rather than pushing the projection technology to its limits and beyond.

107
0:06:23.909,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Self-assembly is seen in nature in many different places,

108
0:06:27.832,000 --> 0:06:3,000
from lipid membranes to cell structures,

109
0:06:31.266,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so we do know it can be a robust solution.

110
0:06:34.345,000 --> 0:06:37,000
If it's good enough for nature, it should be good enough for us.

111
0:06:38.549,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So we want to take this naturally occurring, robust self-assembly

112
0:06:43.373,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and use it for the manufacturing of our semiconductor technology.

113
0:06:48.929,000 --> 0:06:5,000
One type of self-assemble material --

114
0:06:52.388,000 --> 0:06:54,000
it's called a block co-polymer --

115
0:06:54.659,000 --> 0:06:58,000
consists of two polymer chains just a few tens of nanometers in length.

116
0:06:59.466,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But these chains hate each other.

117
0:07:01.541,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They repel each other,

118
0:07:03.049,000 --> 0:07:06,000
very much like oil and water or my teenage son and daughter.

119
0:07:06.97,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

120
0:07:08.351,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But we cruelly bond them together,

121
0:07:11.149,000 --> 0:07:13,000
creating an inbuilt frustration in the system,

122
0:07:13.868,000 --> 0:07:15,000
as they try to separate from each other.

123
0:07:16.716,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And in the bulk material, there are billions of these,

124
0:07:20.025,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and the similar components try to stick together,

125
0:07:23.35,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and the opposing components try to separate from each other

126
0:07:26.183,000 --> 0:07:27,000
at the same time.

127
0:07:27.362,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And this has a built-in frustration, a tension in the system.

128
0:07:31.14,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So it moves around, it squirms until a shape is formed.

129
0:07:36.209,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the natural self-assembled shape that is formed is nanoscale,

130
0:07:40.281,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it's regular, it's periodic, and it's long range,

131
0:07:44.032,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which is exactly what we need for our transistor arrays.

132
0:07:49.347,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So we can use molecular engineering

133
0:07:51.902,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to design different shapes of different sizes

134
0:07:54.99,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and of different periodicities.

135
0:07:57.077,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So for example, if we take a symmetrical molecule,

136
0:07:59.832,000 --> 0:08:02,000
where the two polymer chains are similar length,

137
0:08:02.931,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the natural self-assembled structure that is formed

138
0:08:05.626,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is a long, meandering line,

139
0:08:08.579,000 --> 0:08:09,000
very much like a fingerprint.

140
0:08:10.951,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And the width of the fingerprint lines

141
0:08:13.297,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and the distance between them

142
0:08:15.331,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is determined by the lengths of our polymer chains

143
0:08:19.266,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but also the level of built-in frustration in the system.

144
0:08:23.32,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And we can even create more elaborate structures

145
0:08:27.487,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if we use unsymmetrical molecules,

146
0:08:30.839,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where one polymer chain is significantly shorter than the other.

147
0:08:35.749,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And the self-assembled structure that forms in this case

148
0:08:38.483,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is with the shorter chains forming a tight ball in the middle,

149
0:08:42.307,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and it's surrounded by the longer, opposing polymer chains,

150
0:08:46.172,000 --> 0:08:48,000
forming a natural cylinder.

151
0:08:49.089,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And the size of this cylinder

152
0:08:51.188,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the distance between the cylinders, the periodicity,

153
0:08:54.627,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is again determined by how long we make the polymer chains

154
0:08:58.245,000 --> 0:09:,000
and the level of built-in frustration.

155
0:09:01.896,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So in other words, we're using molecular engineering

156
0:09:05.798,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to self-assemble nanoscale structures

157
0:09:08.647,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that can be lines or cylinders the size and periodicity of our design.

158
0:09:14.369,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We're using chemistry, chemical engineering,

159
0:09:17.69,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to manufacture the nanoscale features that we need for our transistors.

160
0:09:25.611,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But the ability to self-assemble these structures

161
0:09:29.684,000 --> 0:09:31,000
only takes us half of the way,

162
0:09:32.145,000 --> 0:09:34,000
because we still need to position these structures

163
0:09:34.978,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where we want the transistors in the integrated circuit.

164
0:09:39.246,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But we can do this relatively easily

165
0:09:42.008,000 --> 0:09:48,000
using wide guide structures that pin down the self-assembled structures,

166
0:09:49.009,000 --> 0:09:5,000
anchoring them in place

167
0:09:50.954,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and forcing the rest of the self-assembled structures

168
0:09:53.825,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to lie parallel,

169
0:09:55.199,000 --> 0:09:57,000
aligned with our guide structure.

170
0:09:58.51,000 --> 0:10:02,000
For example, if we want to make a fine, 40-nanometer line,

171
0:10:03.173,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which is very difficult to manufacture with conventional projection technology,

172
0:10:08.274,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we can manufacture a 120-nanometer guide structure

173
0:10:13.083,000 --> 0:10:15,000
with normal projection technology,

174
0:10:15.611,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and this structure will align three of the 40-nanometer lines in between.

175
0:10:22.226,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So the materials are doing the most difficult fine patterning.

176
0:10:27.79,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And we call this whole approach "directed self-assembly."

177
0:10:33.586,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The challenge with directed self-assembly

178
0:10:36.364,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is that the whole system needs to align almost perfectly,

179
0:10:40.864,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because any tiny defect in the structure could cause a transistor failure.

180
0:10:46.169,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And because there are billions of transistors in our circuit,

181
0:10:49.162,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we need an almost molecularly perfect system.

182
0:10:52.977,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But we're going to extraordinary measures

183
0:10:55.006,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to achieve this,

184
0:10:56.197,000 --> 0:10:58,000
from the cleanliness of our chemistry

185
0:10:59.213,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to the careful processing of these materials

186
0:11:01.563,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in the semiconductor factory

187
0:11:03.158,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to remove even the smallest nanoscopic defects.

188
0:11:09.311,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So directed self-assembly is an exciting new disruptive technology,

189
0:11:14.525,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but it is still in the development stage.

190
0:11:17.68,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But we're growing in confidence that we could, in fact, introduce it

191
0:11:21.565,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to the semiconductor industry

192
0:11:23.276,000 --> 0:11:25,000
as a revolutionary new manufacturing process

193
0:11:26.257,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in just the next few years.

194
0:11:29.014,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And if we can do this, if we're successful,

195
0:11:32.072,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we'll be able to continue

196
0:11:33.627,000 --> 0:11:36,000
with the cost-effective miniaturization of transistors,

197
0:11:36.909,000 --> 0:11:39,000
continue with the spectacular expansion of computing

198
0:11:40.686,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and the digital revolution.

199
0:11:42.592,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And what's more, this could even be the dawn of a new era

200
0:11:46.161,000 --> 0:11:48,000
of molecular manufacturing.

201
0:11:48.416,000 --> 0:11:49,000
How cool is that?

202
0:11:50.519,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Thank you.

203
0:11:51.701,000 --> 0:11:55,000

1
0:00:12.724,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I used to think

2
0:00:14.027,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness.

3
0:00:18.5,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Everyone said the path to happiness was success,

4
0:00:21.908,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so I searched for that ideal job,

5
0:00:24.43,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that perfect boyfriend, that beautiful apartment.

6
0:00:28.818,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,

7
0:00:31.84,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I felt anxious and adrift.

8
0:00:35.015,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I wasn't alone; my friends -- they struggled with this, too.

9
0:00:40.54,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Eventually, I decided to go to graduate school for positive psychology

10
0:00:44.833,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to learn what truly makes people happy.

11
0:00:48.791,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But what I discovered there changed my life.

12
0:00:52.272,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy.

13
0:00:57.787,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And what really struck me was this:

14
0:01:00.878,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the suicide rate has been rising around the world,

15
0:01:03.689,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it recently reached a 30-year high in America.

16
0:01:07.573,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Even though life is getting objectively better

17
0:01:10.36,000 --> 0:01:12,000
by nearly every conceivable standard,

18
0:01:13.074,000 --> 0:01:15,000
more people feel hopeless,

19
0:01:15.297,000 --> 0:01:17,000
depressed and alone.

20
0:01:18.034,000 --> 0:01:2,000
There's an emptiness gnawing away at people,

21
0:01:20.871,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it.

22
0:01:24.165,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:

23
0:01:27.604,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Is this all there is?

24
0:01:30.987,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And according to the research, what predicts this despair

25
0:01:34.217,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is not a lack of happiness.

26
0:01:36.068,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's a lack of something else,

27
0:01:38.637,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a lack of having meaning in life.

28
0:01:42.782,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But that raised some questions for me.

29
0:01:45.675,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Is there more to life than being happy?

30
0:01:49.036,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And what's the difference between being happy

31
0:01:51.483,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and having meaning in life?

32
0:01:54.699,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease,

33
0:01:59.323,000 --> 0:02:,000
feeling good in the moment.

34
0:02:01.918,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Meaning, though, is deeper.

35
0:02:04.098,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says

36
0:02:06.686,000 --> 0:02:1,000
meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself

37
0:02:11.357,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and from developing the best within you.

38
0:02:15.437,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Our culture is obsessed with happiness,

39
0:02:18.056,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path.

40
0:02:22.187,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the studies show that people who have meaning in life,

41
0:02:25.14,000 --> 0:02:26,000
they're more resilient,

42
0:02:26.574,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they do better in school and at work,

43
0:02:29.155,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and they even live longer.

44
0:02:31.805,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So this all made me wonder:

45
0:02:33.85,000 --> 0:02:35,000
How can we each live more meaningfully?

46
0:02:37.8,000 --> 0:02:4,000
To find out, I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people

47
0:02:41.502,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and reading through thousands of pages of psychology,

48
0:02:44.427,000 --> 0:02:46,000
neuroscience and philosophy.

49
0:02:47.186,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Bringing it all together,

50
0:02:48.999,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life.

51
0:02:54.364,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And we can each create lives of meaning

52
0:02:56.822,000 --> 0:02:59,000
by building some or all of these pillars in our lives.

53
0:03:01.248,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The first pillar is belonging.

54
0:03:04.198,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Belonging comes from being in relationships

55
0:03:06.529,000 --> 0:03:08,000
where you're valued for who you are intrinsically

56
0:03:09.258,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and where you value others as well.

57
0:03:12.038,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging;

58
0:03:16.752,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you're valued for what you believe,

59
0:03:18.669,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for who you hate,

60
0:03:19.939,000 --> 0:03:2,000
not for who you are.

61
0:03:22.24,000 --> 0:03:24,000
True belonging springs from love.

62
0:03:25.047,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It lives in moments among individuals,

63
0:03:28.056,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and it's a choice -- you can choose to cultivate belonging with others.

64
0:03:32.481,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Here's an example.

65
0:03:34.112,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Each morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper

66
0:03:37.691,000 --> 0:03:39,000
from the same street vendor in New York.

67
0:03:40.322,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They don't just conduct a transaction, though.

68
0:03:42.626,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They take a moment to slow down, talk,

69
0:03:45.333,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and treat each other like humans.

70
0:03:47.858,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But one time, Jonathan didn't have the right change,

71
0:03:51.276,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and the vendor said,

72
0:03:52.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"Don't worry about it."

73
0:03:54.064,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But Jonathan insisted on paying,

74
0:03:56.575,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so he went to the store and bought something he didn't need

75
0:03:59.611,000 --> 0:04:,000
to make change.

76
0:04:01.812,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But when he gave the money to the vendor,

77
0:04:04.459,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the vendor drew back.

78
0:04:06.64,000 --> 0:04:07,000
He was hurt.

79
0:04:08.535,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He was trying to do something kind,

80
0:04:10.408,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but Jonathan had rejected him.

81
0:04:13.933,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it.

82
0:04:18.108,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I do.

83
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I'll walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them.

84
0:04:22.417,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I'll check my phone when someone's talking to me.

85
0:04:25.498,000 --> 0:04:26,000
These acts devalue others.

86
0:04:27.451,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They make them feel invisible and unworthy.

87
0:04:30.95,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But when you lead with love, you create a bond

88
0:04:33.726,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that lifts each of you up.

89
0:04:36.85,000 --> 0:04:39,000
For many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning,

90
0:04:40.502,000 --> 0:04:41,000
those bonds to family and friends.

91
0:04:42.996,000 --> 0:04:46,000
For others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose.

92
0:04:47.664,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, finding your purpose is not the same thing

93
0:04:50.603,000 --> 0:04:52,000
as finding that job that makes you happy.

94
0:04:53.34,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give.

95
0:04:56.823,000 --> 0:05:,000
A hospital custodian told me her purpose is healing sick people.

96
0:05:01.335,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Many parents tell me,

97
0:05:03.07,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"My purpose is raising my children."

98
0:05:05.347,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others.

99
0:05:10.201,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Of course, for many of us, that happens through work.

100
0:05:13.733,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That's how we contribute and feel needed.

101
0:05:16.736,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But that also means that issues like disengagement at work,

102
0:05:20.62,000 --> 0:05:21,000
unemployment,

103
0:05:22.057,000 --> 0:05:24,000
low labor force participation --

104
0:05:24.308,000 --> 0:05:27,000
these aren't just economic problems, they're existential ones, too.

105
0:05:28.641,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Without something worthwhile to do,

106
0:05:30.878,000 --> 0:05:31,000
people flounder.

107
0:05:33.313,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Of course, you don't have to find purpose at work,

108
0:05:35.953,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but purpose gives you something to live for,

109
0:05:38.706,000 --> 0:05:4,000
some "why" that drives you forward.

110
0:05:42.967,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself,

111
0:05:46.291,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but in a completely different way:

112
0:05:48.157,000 --> 0:05:49,000
transcendence.

113
0:05:49.768,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Transcendent states are those rare moments

114
0:05:52.169,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life,

115
0:05:55.605,000 --> 0:05:56,000
your sense of self fades away,

116
0:05:57.334,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and you feel connected to a higher reality.

117
0:06:01.034,000 --> 0:06:04,000
For one person I talked to, transcendence came from seeing art.

118
0:06:04.748,000 --> 0:06:06,000
For another person, it was at church.

119
0:06:07.302,000 --> 0:06:1,000
For me, I'm a writer, and it happens through writing.

120
0:06:10.88,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Sometimes I get so in the zone that I lose all sense of time and place.

121
0:06:16.577,000 --> 0:06:19,000
These transcendent experiences can change you.

122
0:06:19.747,000 --> 0:06:23,000
One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees

123
0:06:24.295,000 --> 0:06:25,000
for one minute.

124
0:06:26.083,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But afterwards they felt less self-centered,

125
0:06:28.261,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and they even behaved more generously

126
0:06:30.229,000 --> 0:06:32,000
when given the chance to help someone.

127
0:06:33.402,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Belonging, purpose, transcendence.

128
0:06:38.194,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now, the fourth pillar of meaning, I've found,

129
0:06:40.941,000 --> 0:06:41,000
tends to surprise people.

130
0:06:43.186,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The fourth pillar is storytelling,

131
0:06:45.944,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the story you tell yourself about yourself.

132
0:06:49.436,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity.

133
0:06:53.604,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It helps you understand how you became you.

134
0:06:57.489,000 --> 0:07:,000
But we don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories

135
0:07:00.609,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and can change the way we're telling them.

136
0:07:02.796,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Your life isn't just a list of events.

137
0:07:05.311,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You can edit, interpret and retell your story,

138
0:07:08.551,000 --> 0:07:1,000
even as you're constrained by the facts.

139
0:07:11.501,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I met a young man named Emeka, who'd been paralyzed playing football.

140
0:07:16.74,000 --> 0:07:18,000
After his injury, Emeka told himself,

141
0:07:19.223,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"My life was great playing football,

142
0:07:21.952,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but now look at me."

143
0:07:25.822,000 --> 0:07:27,000
People who tell stories like this --

144
0:07:28.138,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"My life was good. Now it's bad." --

145
0:07:30.686,000 --> 0:07:32,000
tend to be more anxious and depressed.

146
0:07:33.532,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And that was Emeka for a while.

147
0:07:36.393,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But with time, he started to weave a different story.

148
0:07:40.235,000 --> 0:07:41,000
His new story was,

149
0:07:41.992,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Before my injury, my life was purposeless.

150
0:07:45.283,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy.

151
0:07:48.56,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But my injury made me realize I could be a better man."

152
0:07:53.308,000 --> 0:07:56,000
That edit to his story changed Emeka's life.

153
0:07:56.873,000 --> 0:07:58,000
After telling the new story to himself,

154
0:07:59.328,000 --> 0:08:,000
Emeka started mentoring kids,

155
0:08:01.274,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and he discovered what his purpose was:

156
0:08:03.664,000 --> 0:08:04,000
serving others.

157
0:08:05.921,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a "redemptive story,"

158
0:08:09.323,000 --> 0:08:11,000
where the bad is redeemed by the good.

159
0:08:12.447,000 --> 0:08:14,000
People leading meaningful lives, he's found,

160
0:08:14.654,000 --> 0:08:15,000
tend to tell stories about their lives

161
0:08:16.609,000 --> 0:08:19,000
defined by redemption, growth and love.

162
0:08:20.543,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But what makes people change their stories?

163
0:08:23.545,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Some people get help from a therapist,

164
0:08:25.497,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but you can do it on your own, too,

165
0:08:27.331,000 --> 0:08:29,000
just by reflecting on your life thoughtfully,

166
0:08:30.115,000 --> 0:08:32,000
how your defining experiences shaped you,

167
0:08:32.226,000 --> 0:08:33,000
what you lost, what you gained.

168
0:08:34.409,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That's what Emeka did.

169
0:08:36.832,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You won't change your story overnight;

170
0:08:38.902,000 --> 0:08:4,000
it could take years and be painful.

171
0:08:41.271,000 --> 0:08:43,000
After all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle.

172
0:08:44.777,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom,

173
0:08:49.14,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to finding that good that sustains you.

174
0:08:54.404,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling:

175
0:08:59.683,000 --> 0:09:01,000
those are the four pillars of meaning.

176
0:09:03.446,000 --> 0:09:04,000
When I was younger,

177
0:09:05.076,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars.

178
0:09:09.201,000 --> 0:09:13,000
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse from our home in Montreal.

179
0:09:14.506,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Sufism is a spiritual practice associated with the whirling dervishes

180
0:09:19.013,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and the poet Rumi.

181
0:09:21.25,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home

182
0:09:23.849,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to meditate, drink Persian tea, and share stories.

183
0:09:28.029,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Their practice also involved serving all of creation

184
0:09:31.01,000 --> 0:09:32,000
through small acts of love,

185
0:09:32.844,000 --> 0:09:35,000
which meant being kind even when people wronged you.

186
0:09:36.209,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But it gave them a purpose: to rein in the ego.

187
0:09:40.732,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Eventually, I left home for college

188
0:09:43.372,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and without the daily grounding of Sufism in my life,

189
0:09:47.098,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I felt unmoored.

190
0:09:48.71,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I started searching for those things that make life worth living.

191
0:09:52.322,000 --> 0:09:54,000
That's what set me on this journey.

192
0:09:54.832,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Looking back, I now realize

193
0:09:56.613,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that the Sufi house had a real culture of meaning.

194
0:09:59.879,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The pillars were part of the architecture,

195
0:10:02.409,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply.

196
0:10:06.234,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Of course, the same principle applies

197
0:10:08.579,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in other strong communities as well --

198
0:10:10.804,000 --> 0:10:12,000
good ones and bad ones.

199
0:10:13.376,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Gangs, cults:

200
0:10:15.429,000 --> 0:10:18,000
these are cultures of meaning that use the pillars

201
0:10:18.466,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and give people something to live and die for.

202
0:10:21.868,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But that's exactly why we as a society

203
0:10:24.759,000 --> 0:10:26,000
must offer better alternatives.

204
0:10:26.892,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We need to build these pillars within our families and our institutions

205
0:10:30.667,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to help people become their best selves.

206
0:10:34.344,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But living a meaningful life takes work.

207
0:10:36.954,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's an ongoing process.

208
0:10:38.853,000 --> 0:10:41,000
As each day goes by, we're constantly creating our lives,

209
0:10:42.606,000 --> 0:10:43,000
adding to our story.

210
0:10:44.651,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And sometimes we can get off track.

211
0:10:48.182,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Whenever that happens to me,

212
0:10:50.117,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I remember a powerful experience I had with my father.

213
0:10:55.641,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Several months after I graduated from college,

214
0:10:58.312,000 --> 0:11:01,000
my dad had a massive heart attack that should have killed him.

215
0:11:02.853,000 --> 0:11:05,000
He survived, and when I asked him what was going through his mind

216
0:11:06.091,000 --> 0:11:07,000
as he faced death,

217
0:11:07.737,000 --> 0:11:09,000
he said all he could think about was needing to live

218
0:11:10.444,000 --> 0:11:12,000
so he could be there for my brother and me,

219
0:11:12.606,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and this gave him the will to fight for life.

220
0:11:15.883,000 --> 0:11:18,000
When he went under anesthesia for emergency surgery,

221
0:11:19.205,000 --> 0:11:21,000
instead of counting backwards from 10,

222
0:11:21.559,000 --> 0:11:24,000
he repeated our names like a mantra.

223
0:11:25.61,000 --> 0:11:28,000
He wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth

224
0:11:29.445,000 --> 0:11:3,000
if he died.

225
0:11:32.853,000 --> 0:11:35,000
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.

226
0:11:37.005,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's a humble life,

227
0:11:38.576,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but a good life.

228
0:11:40.384,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Lying there facing death, he had a reason to live:

229
0:11:44.32,000 --> 0:11:45,000
love.

230
0:11:45.752,000 --> 0:11:47,000
His sense of belonging within his family,

231
0:11:48.227,000 --> 0:11:49,000
his purpose as a dad,

232
0:11:49.98,000 --> 0:11:52,000
his transcendent meditation, repeating our names --

233
0:11:53.018,000 --> 0:11:55,000
these, he says, are the reasons why he survived.

234
0:11:55.823,000 --> 0:11:57,000
That's the story he tells himself.

235
0:11:59.567,000 --> 0:12:01,000
That's the power of meaning.

236
0:12:02.463,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Happiness comes and goes.

237
0:12:05.279,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But when life is really good

238
0:12:07.152,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and when things are really bad,

239
0:12:09.061,000 --> 0:12:12,000
having meaning gives you something to hold on to.

240
0:12:12.142,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Thank you.

241
0:12:13.39,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Do you know

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
deployed worldwide?

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And these are base stations.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And we also have

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
more than five billion

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of these devices here.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
These are cellular mobile phones.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And with these mobile phones,

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
every month.

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes --

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a very large number.

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And wireless communications

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
has become a utility

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
like electricity and water.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now --

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in our private lives, in our business lives.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to switch off the mobile phone at events like this

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for good reasons.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And it's this importance

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
why I decided to look into the issues

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that this technology has,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because it's so fundamental to our lives.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And one of the issues is capacity.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves --

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in particular, radio waves.

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And radio waves are limited.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They are scarce; they are expensive;

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and we only have a certain range of it.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And it's this limitation

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that doesn't cope

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with the demand of wireless data transmissions

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And we are simply running out of spectrum.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
There's another problem.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That is efficiency.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
These 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations,

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
consume a lot of energy.

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And mind you, most of the energy

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is not used to transmit the radio waves,

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it is used to cool the base stations.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Then the efficiency of such a base station

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is only at about five percent.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And that creates a big problem.

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Then there's another issue that you're all aware of.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You have to switch off your mobile phone

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
during flights.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
In hospitals, they are security issues.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And security is another issue.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
These radio waves penetrate through walls.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They can be intercepted,

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and somebody can make use of your network

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
if he has bad intentions.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So these are the main four issues.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But on the other hand,

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we have 14 billion of these:

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
light bulbs, light.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So let's look at this in the context

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Then there's ultraviolet light.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it's good for a nice suntan,

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but otherwise dangerous for the human body.

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Infrared --

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
due to eye safety regulations,

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
can be only used with low power.

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's light,

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and light has been around for many millions of years.

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And in fact, it has created us,

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
has created life,

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
has created all the stuff of life.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So it's inherently safe to use.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I compared the radio waves spectrum --

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the size of it --

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with the size of the visible light spectrum.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And guess what?

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum,

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
which is there for us to use.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum,

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We have 1.4 million

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
expensively deployed,

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
inefficient radio cellular base stations.

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And multiply that by 10,000,

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
then you end up at 14 billion.

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So we have the infrastructure there.

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Look at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Can we use them for communications?

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Yes.

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What do we need to do?

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The one thing we need to do

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs,

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
florescent lights,

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
with this new technology of LED,

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
LED light bulbs.

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And it has a very nice acute property.

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Its intensity can be modulated

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
at very high speeds,

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and it can be switched off at very high speeds.

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And this is a fundamental basic property

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that we exploit

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
with our technology.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So let's show how we do that.

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum --

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
go to remote controls.

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You all know remote controls have an infrared LED --

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
basically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And it creates a simple, low-speed data stream

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in 10,000 bits per second,

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
20,000 bits per second.

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Not usable for a YouTube video.

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What we have done

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is we have developed a technology

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
with which we can furthermore

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
replace the remote control of our light bulb.

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We transmit with our technology,

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
not only a single data stream,

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we transmit thousands of data streams

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in parallel,

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
at even higher speeds.

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And the technology we have developed --

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
it's called SIM OFDM.

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And it's spacial modulation --

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details --

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but this is how we enabled

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that light source

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to transmit data.

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You will say, "Okay, this is nice --

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
a slide created in 10 minutes."

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But not only that.

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What we've done

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is we have also developed a demonstrator.

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I'm showing for the first time in public

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
this visible light demonstrator.

146
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And what we have here

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is no ordinary desk lamp.

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We fit in an LED light bulb,

149
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
worth three U.S. dollars,

150
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
put in our signal processing technology.

151
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And then what we have here is a little hole.

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And the light goes through that hole.

153
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
There's a receiver.

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that we create there

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
into an electrical signal.

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And that signal is then converted back

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to a high-speed data stream.

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
In the future we hope

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that we can integrate this little hole

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
into these smart phones.

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And not only integrate a photo detector here,

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but maybe use the camera inside.

164
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So what happens

165
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
when I switch on that light?

166
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
As you would expect,

167
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
it's a light, a desk lamp.

168
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Put your book beneath it and you can read.

169
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's illuminating the space.

170
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But at the same time, you see this video coming up here.

171
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And that's a video, a high-definition video

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that is transmitted through that light beam.

173
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You're critical.

174
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You think, "Ha, ha, ha.

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here."

176
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But let me do this.

177
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Once again.

179
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Still don't believe?

180
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It is this light

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And if you look at the light,

183
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it is illuminating as you would expect.

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You don't notice with your human eye.

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude

186
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that we impress onto this light bulb.

187
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's serving the purpose of illumination,

188
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And you see,

190
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.

191
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It can ignore that constant light,

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because all the receiver's interested in

193
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
are subtle changes.

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You also have a critical question now, and

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
you say, "Okay,

196
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
do I have to have the light on all the time

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to have this working?"

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And the answer is yes.

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But, you can dim down the light

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to a level that it appears to be off.

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible.

202
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Capacity:

204
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We have 10,000 times more spectrum,

205
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
10,000 times more LEDs

206
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
installed already in the infrastructure there.

207
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
You would agree with me, hopefully,

208
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
there's no issue of capacity anymore.

209
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Efficiency:

210
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is data through illumination --

211
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it's first of all an illumination device.

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And if you do the energy budget,

213
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the data transmission comes for free --

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
highly energy efficient.

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I don't mention the high energy efficiency

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of these LED light bulbs.

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
If the whole world would deploy them,

218
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you would save hundreds of power plants.

219
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
That's aside.

220
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And then I've mentioned the availability.

221
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.

222
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You need to see what to do.

223
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
You have lights in an aircraft.

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So it's everywhere in a day there is light.

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission.

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And then there's security.

229
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
You would agree with me

230
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that light doesn't penetrate through walls.

231
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So no one, if I have a light here,

232
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
if I have secure data,

233
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
no one on the other side of this room through that wall

234
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
would be able to read that data.

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And there's only data where there is light.

236
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data,

237
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
then what I could do,

238
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
turn it away.

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.

240
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to.

241
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So for me,

242
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the applications of it,

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to me, are beyond imagination at the moment.

244
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.

245
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And you only have to notice, where we have light,

246
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
there is a potential way to transmit data.

247
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But I can give you a few examples.

248
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Well you may see the impact already now.

249
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
This is a remote operated vehicle

250
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
beneath the ocean.

251
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And they use light to illuminate space down there.

252
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And this light can be used to transmit wireless data

253
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that these things [use] to communicate with each other.

254
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Intrinsically safe environments

255
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
like this petrochemical plant --

256
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks,

257
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there.

258
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In hospitals,

259
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
for new medical instruments;

260
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in streets for traffic control.

261
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Cars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights,

262
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and cars can communicate with each other

263
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and prevent accidents

264
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in the way that they exchange information.

265
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.

266
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And then you have these millions of street lamps

267
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
deployed around the world.

268
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And every street lamp could be a free access point.

269
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We call it, in fact, a Li-Fi,

270
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
light-fidelity.

271
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And then we have these aircraft cabins.

272
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin,

273
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and each of these lights

274
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
could be a potential transmitter of wireless data.

275
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video

276
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
on your long flight back home.

277
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Online life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible.

278
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So, all we would need to do

279
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is to fit a small microchip

280
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to every potential illumination device.

281
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And this would then combine

282
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
two basic functionalities:

283
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
illumination and wireless data transmission.

284
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe

285
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
could solve the four essential problems

286
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that face us in wireless communication these days.

287
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And in the future,

288
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs,

289
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
you may have 14 billion Li-Fis

290
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
deployed worldwide --

291
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
for a cleaner, a greener,

292
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and even a brighter future.

293
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Thank you.

294
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because until a couple of years ago,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
people knew hardly anything about us,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I could basically come out here

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and say only good things about us.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But in the last couple of years

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
we've become infamous for a couple of things.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
First, of course, the economic meltdown.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It actually got so bad

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and no reserve.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Then there was the volcano

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that interrupted the travel plans

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of almost all of you and many of your friends,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
including President Obama.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
By the way, the pronunciation

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is "Eyjafjallajokull."

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
None of your media got it right.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But I'm not here to share these stories

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
about these two things exactly.

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital,

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which is a financial firm founded by me

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and Kristin -- who you see in the picture --

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in the spring of 2007,

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
just over a year before the economic collapse hit.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Why would two women

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the corporate sector

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
leave to found a financial services firm?

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Well let it suffice to say

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that we felt a bit overwhelmed

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with testosterone.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I'm not here to say

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that men are to blame for the crisis

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and what happened in my country.

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But I can surely tell you that in my country,

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere,

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
men were at the helm

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of the game of the financial sector,

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and that kind of lack of diversity

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and sameness

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
leads to disastrous problems.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and also with the strong feeling in our stomach

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that this wasn't sustainable,

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to found a financial services firm

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
based on our values,

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and we decided to incorporate feminine values

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
into the world of finance.

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We weren't known

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as the typical "women" women

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in Iceland up until then.

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So it was almost like coming out of the closet

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to actually talk about the fact that we were women

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and that we believed that we had a set of values

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and a way of doing business

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that would be more sustainable

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
than what we had experienced until then.

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And we got a great group of people to join us --

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
principled people with great skills,

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and investors with a vision

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and values to match ours.

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
without taking any direct losses to our equity

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
or to the funds of our clients.

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And although I want to thank

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the talented people of our company

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
foremost for that --

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and also there's a factor of luck and timing --

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we are absolutely convinced

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that we did this because of our values.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So let me share with you our values.

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We believe in risk awareness.

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What does that mean?

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking,

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and we will not invest

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in things we don't understand.

83
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Not a complicated thing.

84
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But in 2007,

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
at the height of the sub-prime

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and all the complicated financial structures,

87
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it was quite opposite

88
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to the reckless risk-taking behaviors

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that we saw on the market.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We also believe in straight-talking,

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
telling it as it is,

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
using simple language that people understand,

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
telling people about the downsides

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
as well as the potential upsides,

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
like our lack of belief in the sustainability

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of the Icelandic financial sector

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that already we had

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
months before the collapse hit us.

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And, although we do work in the financial sector,

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where Excel is king,

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we believe in emotional capital.

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And we believe

104
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that doing emotional due diligence

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is just as important

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
as doing financial due diligence.

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It is actually people

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that make money and lose money,

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
not Excel spreadsheets.

110
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Last, but not least,

112
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we believe in profit with principles.

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We care how we make our profit.

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we are willing to do it with a long-term view,

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we like to have a wider definition of profits

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
than just the economic profit in the next quarter.

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So we like to see profits,

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
plus positive social

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and environmental benefits, when we invest.

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But it wasn't just about the values,

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
although we are convinced that they matter.

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It was also about a business opportunity.

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that are going to create

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
some of the most interesting investment opportunities

127
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in the years to come.

128
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The whole thing about the female trend

129
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is not about women being better than men;

130
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
it is actually about

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
women being different from men,

132
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
bringing different values and different ways to the table.

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So what do you get? You get better decision-making,

134
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and you get less herd behavior,

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and both of those things hit your bottom line

136
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with very positive results.

137
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But one has to wonder,

138
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and many would say that you in America

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
are heading for some more trouble as well.

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now that we've had all that happen,

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and we have all this data out there

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
telling us that it's much better to have diversity

145
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
around the decision-making tables,

146
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
will we see business and finance change?

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Will government change?

148
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this.

149
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I have days that I believe,

150
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but I have days that I'm full of doubt.

151
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Have you seen the incredible urge out there

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to rebuild the very things that failed us?

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

154
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Einstein said

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that this was the definition of insanity --

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to do the same things

157
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
over and over again,

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
hoping for a different outcome.

159
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So I guess the world is insane,

160
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because I see entirely too much

161
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
of doing the same things over and over again,

162
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.

163
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I want to see more revolutionary thinking,

164
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I remain hopeful.

165
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Like TED, I believe in people.

166
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And I know that consumers

167
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
are becoming more conscious,

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and they are going to start voting with their wallets,

169
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and they are going to change the face

170
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of business and finance from the outside,

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
if they don't do it from the inside.

172
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But I'm more of the revolutionary,

173
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and I should be; I'm from Iceland.

174
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We have a long history

175
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of strong, courageous, independent women,

176
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
ever since the Viking age.

177
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And I want to tell you when

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I first realized that women matter to the economy

179
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and to the society,

180
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday --

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
October 24, 1975.

182
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Women in Iceland took the day off.

183
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
From work or from home, they took the day off,

184
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and nothing worked in Iceland.

185
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

186
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They marched into the center of Reykjavik,

187
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and they put women's issues onto the agenda.

188
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And some say this was the start of a global movement.

189
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
For me it was the start of a long journey,

190
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but I decided that day to matter.

191
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Five years later,

192
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president --

193
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
first female to become head of state,

194
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
single mom,

195
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
a breast cancer survivor

196
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
who had had one of her breasts removed.

197
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And at one of the campaign sessions,

198
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
she had one of her male contenders

199
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
allude to the fact that she couldn't become president --

200
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
she was a woman, and even half a woman.

201
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
That night she won the election,

202
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because she came back --

203
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
not just because of his crappy behavior --

204
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but she came back and said,

205
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation;

206
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I'm going to lead it."

207
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Applause)

208
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So I've had incredibly many

209
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
women role models

210
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that have influenced who I am and where I am today.

211
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But in spite of that,

212
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career

213
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
mostly in denial of being a woman.

214
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Started in corporate America,

215
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I was absolutely convinced

216
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that it was just about the individual,

217
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that women and men would have just the same opportunities.

218
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But I've come to conclude lately

219
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that it isn't like that.

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We are not the same,

221
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and it's great. Because of our differences,

222
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we create and sustain life.

223
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.

224
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The final thought I want to leave with you

225
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is that I'm fed up with this tyranny

226
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of either/or choices in life --

227
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
either it's men or it's women.

228
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance.

229
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So let's move away

230
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
from thinking about business here and philanthropy there,

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and let's start thinking about

232
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
doing good business.

233
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.

234
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Thank you.

235
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

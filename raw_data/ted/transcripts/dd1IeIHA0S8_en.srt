1
0:00:13.793,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Come on:

2
0:00:15.344,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hasn't everyone here dreamt of flying?

3
0:00:18.758,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So why haven't humans flown yet?

4
0:00:23.153,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've been obsessed with learning to fly my whole life.

5
0:00:26.818,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I grew up a feral, adopted child on the northern shore of Lake Ontario,

6
0:00:31.477,000 --> 0:00:35,000
following my bricklayer/fisherman father around.

7
0:00:35.68,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was always fascinated by things that moved,

8
0:00:38.278,000 --> 0:00:41,000
catching small animals, holding them in my hands,

9
0:00:41.382,000 --> 0:00:42,000
feeling the magic of their movement;

10
0:00:44.412,000 --> 0:00:45,000
playing with fire,

11
0:00:46.11,000 --> 0:00:49,000
thrilled and terrified at its unrelenting force,

12
0:00:49.964,000 --> 0:00:52,000
accidentally burning my father's barn down --

13
0:00:53.004,000 --> 0:00:54,000
just once.

14
0:00:54.347,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:55.92,000 --> 0:00:57,000
That was my first brush with real danger,

16
0:00:58.441,000 --> 0:01:,000
the fire and my father.

17
0:01:01.174,000 --> 0:01:05,000
When I was about eight or nine years old, I caught a fly in a mason jar.

18
0:01:05.606,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Studying that fly, I thought, "Wow,

19
0:01:07.892,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it's changing directions in midair with acute angles,

20
0:01:11.503,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and it's going so fast, it's a blur.

21
0:01:13.859,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Why can't we do that? Can we?"

22
0:01:18.065,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Everywhere I looked, there were things moving.

23
0:01:21.836,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And these things moved with their very own causal rhythms,

24
0:01:25.339,000 --> 0:01:28,000
their very own mechanistic anatomies.

25
0:01:28.38,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It was clear to me -- and to Newton --

26
0:01:31.104,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that things move based on their component parts:

27
0:01:34.05,000 --> 0:01:37,000
worms squirmed, birds flew, kangaroos hopped.

28
0:01:37.809,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And a human's first bout with flying was falling accidentally, tripping,

29
0:01:43.042,000 --> 0:01:45,000
or slipping on that fabled banana peel.

30
0:01:46.603,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Once your ground is dragged out from under you,

31
0:01:50.167,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a world of wonder comes rushing in.

32
0:01:54.132,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I had found my territory.

33
0:01:56.507,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I was seized with a compulsion,

34
0:01:59.004,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a primordial urge to learn how to fly,

35
0:02:02.065,000 --> 0:02:03,000
like a human.

36
0:02:03.61,000 --> 0:02:06,000
For the next 10 years, I did my experiments alone,

37
0:02:06.901,000 --> 0:02:07,000
on my own body.

38
0:02:08.286,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I drove my Honda 350 across the United States

39
0:02:11.394,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in an "Easy Rider" kind of way.

40
0:02:14.551,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I got my degree in modern dance. I mimicked that fly in the box.

41
0:02:19.009,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I dove horizontally through glass;

42
0:02:21.086,000 --> 0:02:22,000
on the way, I punched a hole in it.

43
0:02:22.985,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I was trying to figure out something about flight.

44
0:02:26.95,000 --> 0:02:27,000
When I was 27 years old,

45
0:02:28.938,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I found myself in a rat-infested New York City loft,

46
0:02:32.974,000 --> 0:02:34,000
getting ready to hurl myself off a ladder.

47
0:02:35.815,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I climbed higher, higher, higher,

48
0:02:37.459,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and I jumped.

49
0:02:38.697,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Wham-o! I landed.

50
0:02:41.543,000 --> 0:02:42,000
That hurt.

51
0:02:42.727,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:43.778,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And it occurred to me that people didn't really enjoy getting hurt,

53
0:02:48.449,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and that maybe the reason that we weren't flying yet

54
0:02:51.633,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is that we were still attached to that false idea

55
0:02:54.051,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that we would fly the way birds do,

56
0:02:56.872,000 --> 0:02:57,000
or butterflies.

57
0:02:58.605,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Maybe we needed to assumption-bust,

58
0:03:02.359,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to ask a different kind of question --

59
0:03:05.219,000 --> 0:03:06,000
about duration, for instance.

60
0:03:06.822,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Humans in the air? A few seconds.

61
0:03:09.473,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Birds and butterflies? Minutes, maybe hours.

62
0:03:14.706,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And what about fear?

63
0:03:16.892,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I think fear is complex and personal.

64
0:03:20.892,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I really think it has to do with curiosity

65
0:03:23.434,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and not taking yourself so seriously.

66
0:03:26.764,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We might need to get a little hurt,

67
0:03:29.514,000 --> 0:03:3,000
just not too hurt.

68
0:03:32.175,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And pain: redefine it.

69
0:03:34.502,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Rather than "pain," say, "another rather interesting, foreign sensation."

70
0:03:39.296,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Something like that.

71
0:03:42.63,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I realized then that to learn to fly, we were going to have to learn to land.

72
0:03:46.318,000 --> 0:03:48,000
My hero, Evel Knievel -- one of them -- said,

73
0:03:49.316,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Anyone can jump a motorcycle.

74
0:03:51.588,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The trouble begins when you try to land it."

75
0:03:54.004,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:57.062,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Landing hurts.

77
0:03:59.961,000 --> 0:04:,000
I was curious, though.

78
0:04:01.137,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I thought, "Well, why don't we invent an impact technique?

79
0:04:04.575,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Why don't we just expand our base of support?"

80
0:04:07.554,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I had seen pieces of plywood fall,

81
0:04:09.722,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and they didn't flinch on the way down.

82
0:04:12.072,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So I made my body into a perfect line

83
0:04:14.619,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and tilted back.

84
0:04:16.061,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Whaft!

85
0:04:17.275,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It was a totally different sound than "wham-o."

86
0:04:20.721,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I rushed out onto the streets of New York City

87
0:04:23.62,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and went up to complete strangers,

88
0:04:25.382,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I said -- well, I thought --

89
0:04:27.365,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"I did a backfall today. Did you?"

90
0:04:30.214,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In 1985, we started to tour all over the world a little bit,

91
0:04:35.708,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and I started my company,

92
0:04:37.912,000 --> 0:04:38,000
called STREB EXTREME ACTION.

93
0:04:40.205,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In 2003, we were invited to go to Kitty Hawk

94
0:04:43.379,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of flight with the Wright Brothers.

95
0:04:47.595,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We had gotten very good at landing;

96
0:04:49.897,000 --> 0:04:51,000
now we needed to get up into the air.

97
0:04:52.339,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And like them, we wanted to stay there longer.

98
0:04:55.669,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I came across this quote by Wilbur:

99
0:04:58.357,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"If you are looking for perfect safety, you will do well to sit on a fence

100
0:05:02.466,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and watch the birds;

101
0:05:04.079,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but if you really wish to learn, you must mount a machine

102
0:05:07.53,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and become acquainted with its tricks by actual trial."

103
0:05:11.906,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Ah, machines.

104
0:05:13.54,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It incited the hardware junkie inside of me.

105
0:05:16.906,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And if we did want to go or travel to unhabitual places in space --

106
0:05:20.987,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to that banana peel spot that confuses us;

107
0:05:24.454,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to that place outside our vertical comfort zone,

108
0:05:27.807,000 --> 0:05:3,000
where we encounter unexpected turbulence

109
0:05:30.991,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and get accelerated oddly,

110
0:05:34.189,000 --> 0:05:37,000
where the ground changes and moves out from under us --

111
0:05:37.711,000 --> 0:05:39,000
like the composer who is trying to hit a note

112
0:05:40.564,000 --> 0:05:42,000
higher than the human voice can sing,

113
0:05:43.223,000 --> 0:05:45,000
he invents a piccolo or a flute,

114
0:05:45.653,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I set about the invention of my prototypic machines.

115
0:05:50.601,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And if we wanted to go higher, faster, sooner, harder,

116
0:05:54.393,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it was necessary that we create our very own spaceships.

117
0:05:57.401,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we did.

118
0:05:58.588,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And we did travel to unknown, invisible, dangerous territories,

119
0:06:03.486,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and it changed us.

120
0:06:06.733,000 --> 0:06:08,000
If any of you want to try this, let me know.

121
0:06:08.919,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:10.039,000 --> 0:06:13,000
In 2012, we brought all of our best machines to London

123
0:06:13.486,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and put them in their most iconic places.

124
0:06:16.833,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We got on the London Eye.

125
0:06:18.79,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It was 443 feet above the earth.

126
0:06:22.238,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And as we reached the zenith, we unlocked our brake and fell --

127
0:06:27.071,000 --> 0:06:29,000
200 feet on the radius,

128
0:06:29.226,000 --> 0:06:31,000
on the spoke that we were attached to.

129
0:06:32.68,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We reached as far up as heaven that day,

130
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I'm pretty sure of it.

131
0:06:36.897,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And then I and two of my dancers

132
0:06:38.817,000 --> 0:06:4,000
walked down the outside of London's City Hall.

133
0:06:41.285,000 --> 0:06:44,000
As I stood up there, 300 feet above the ground,

134
0:06:44.569,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and looked down,

135
0:06:45.85,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I saw 2,000 eyes staring up at me,

136
0:06:48.764,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and they saw what they usually do -- the sky, a bird, a plane -- and then us.

137
0:06:53.7,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And we were just a tiny speck up there.

138
0:06:56.858,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And I realized that action is for everybody.

139
0:06:59.778,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now we have our very own mason jar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

140
0:07:03.448,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It's called SLAM: STREB Lab for Action Mechanics.

141
0:07:06.928,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It was a former mustard seed factory.

142
0:07:09.958,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I designed it after the use of a petri dish,

143
0:07:13.017,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and in that petri dish,

144
0:07:14.463,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I put Kid Action, STREB EXTREME ACTION

145
0:07:17.338,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and circus arts,

146
0:07:18.752,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and we all learned to fly, fall and land and invent extreme action together.

147
0:07:23.111,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And you know what we found?

148
0:07:24.849,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In comes everyone --

149
0:07:27.148,000 --> 0:07:3,000
every size, shape, age, capacity,

150
0:07:30.326,000 --> 0:07:34,000
every nationality, every race, every class, all genders,

151
0:07:35.214,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the timid and the bold, the outcast and the cool,

152
0:07:38.278,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the risk avoiders and the risk obsessives.

153
0:07:42.422,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And these buildings exist all over the world,

154
0:07:45.784,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and every one of them can be a flying training center.

155
0:07:51.754,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And you know, as it turns out,

156
0:07:54.329,000 --> 0:07:56,000
people don't want to just dream about flying,

157
0:07:57.287,000 --> 0:07:59,000
nor do they want to watch us fly.

158
0:07:59.803,000 --> 0:08:01,000
They want to do it, too, and they can.

159
0:08:01.892,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And with a little training,

160
0:08:03.733,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they learn to relish the hit and the impact,

161
0:08:06.913,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and, I guess even more, getting up afterwards.

162
0:08:10.872,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I've found that the effect of flying causes smiles to get more common,

163
0:08:16.072,000 --> 0:08:18,000
self-esteem to blossom,

164
0:08:18.681,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and people get just a little bit braver.

165
0:08:22.713,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And people do learn to fly,

166
0:08:25.984,000 --> 0:08:26,000
as only humans can.

167
0:08:28.482,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So can you.

168
0:08:29.86,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Come fly with us.

169
0:08:32.015,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Applause)

170
0:08:36.658,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Music)

171
0:09:07.698,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

172
0:09:11.255,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Applause)

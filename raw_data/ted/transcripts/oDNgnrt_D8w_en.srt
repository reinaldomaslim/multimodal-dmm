2
0:00:16.267,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In my previous life, I was an artist.

3
0:00:19.754,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I still paint. I love art.

4
0:00:22.227,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I love the joy that color can give to our lives

5
0:00:27.826,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and to our communities,

6
0:00:30.474,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I try to bring something of the artist in me

7
0:00:35.753,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in my politics,

8
0:00:37.874,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I see

9
0:00:41.802,000 --> 0:00:46,000
part of my job today, the reason for being here,

10
0:00:46.986,000 --> 0:00:5,000
not just to campaign for my party,

11
0:00:51.913,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but for politics, and the role it can play

12
0:00:56.618,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for the better in our lives.

13
0:01:00.434,000 --> 0:01:05,000
For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.

14
0:01:06.306,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We faced many challenges.

15
0:01:08.998,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Art was part of the answer,

16
0:01:11.482,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and my name, in the very beginning,

17
0:01:14.1,000 --> 0:01:16,000
was linked with two things:

18
0:01:16.515,000 --> 0:01:2,000
demolition of illegal constructions

19
0:01:20.608,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in order to get public space back,

20
0:01:24.688,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and use of colors in order to revive the hope

21
0:01:28.366,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that had been lost in my city.

22
0:01:31.685,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act.

23
0:01:37.546,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Rather, it was a form of political action

24
0:01:41.662,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in a context when the city budget I had available

25
0:01:46.764,000 --> 0:01:52,000
after being elected amounted to zero comma something.

26
0:01:53.471,000 --> 0:01:55,000
When we painted the first building,

27
0:01:56.462,000 --> 0:02:,000
by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray

28
0:02:01.014,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of a facade,

29
0:02:03.278,000 --> 0:02:07,000
something unimaginable happened.

30
0:02:07.502,000 --> 0:02:09,000
There was a traffic jam

31
0:02:09.572,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and a crowd of people gathered

32
0:02:12.577,000 --> 0:02:16,000
as if it were the location of some spectacular accident,

33
0:02:17.495,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.

34
0:02:22.214,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The French E.U. official in charge of the funding

35
0:02:27.016,000 --> 0:02:3,000
rushed to block the painting.

36
0:02:30.11,000 --> 0:02:34,000
He screeched that he would block the financing.

37
0:02:34.856,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"But why?" I asked him.

38
0:02:38.486,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"Because the colors you have ordered

39
0:02:41.278,000 --> 0:02:45,000
do not meet European standards," he replied.

40
0:02:45.99,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"Well," I told him,

41
0:02:48.919,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"the surroundings do not meet European standards,

42
0:02:52.107,000 --> 0:02:57,000
even though this is not what we want,

43
0:02:57.402,000 --> 0:03:,000
but we will choose the colors ourselves,

44
0:03:00.573,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because this is exactly what we want.

45
0:03:04.243,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And if you do not let us continue with our work,

46
0:03:08.126,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I will hold a press conference here,

47
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:13,000
right now, right in this road,

48
0:03:14.076,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we will tell people that you look to me

49
0:03:17.326,000 --> 0:03:22,000
just like the censors of the socialist realism era."

50
0:03:23.2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Then he was kind of troubled,

51
0:03:25.855,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and asked me for a compromise.

52
0:03:28.447,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But I told him no, I'm sorry,

53
0:03:30.767,000 --> 0:03:34,000
compromise in colors is gray,

54
0:03:35.269,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.

55
0:03:40.357,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:41.574,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So it's time for change.

57
0:03:46.693,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The rehabilitation of public spaces

58
0:03:48.863,000 --> 0:03:5,000
revived the feeling of belonging

59
0:03:51.597,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to a city that people lost.

60
0:03:56.466,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The pride of people about their own place of living,

61
0:04:02.906,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and there were feelings that had been buried

62
0:04:06.325,000 --> 0:04:1,000
deep for years under the fury of the illegal,

63
0:04:10.98,000 --> 0:04:15,000
barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.

64
0:04:16.454,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And when colors came out everywhere,

65
0:04:19.498,000 --> 0:04:23,000
a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.

66
0:04:23.986,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Big noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening?

67
0:04:26.933,000 --> 0:04:27,000
What are colors doing to us?"

68
0:04:28.894,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And we made a poll,

69
0:04:29.949,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.

70
0:04:32.351,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We asked people, "Do you want this action,

71
0:04:39.608,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and to have buildings painted like that?"

72
0:04:44.098,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then the second question was,

73
0:04:46.469,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"

74
0:04:49.473,000 --> 0:04:5,000
To the first question,

75
0:04:51.157,000 --> 0:04:54,000
63 percent of people said yes, we like it.

76
0:04:55.063,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.

77
0:04:57.423,000 --> 0:05:,000
But to the second question, half of them that didn't like it,

78
0:05:01.095,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they wanted it to continue. (Laughter)

79
0:05:04.174,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So we noticed change.

80
0:05:07.301,000 --> 0:05:11,000
People started to drop less litter in the streets, for example,

81
0:05:11.696,000 --> 0:05:13,000
started to pay taxes,

82
0:05:14.326,000 --> 0:05:18,000
started to feel something they had forgotten,

83
0:05:18.775,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and beauty was acting as a guardsman

84
0:05:23.839,000 --> 0:05:29,000
where municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.

85
0:05:30.381,000 --> 0:05:33,000
One day I remember walking along a street

86
0:05:34.082,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that had just been colored,

87
0:05:36.678,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and where we were in the process of planting trees,

88
0:05:40.457,000 --> 0:05:43,000
when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife

89
0:05:43.702,000 --> 0:05:46,000
putting a glass facade to their shop.

90
0:05:47.669,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They had thrown the old shutter

91
0:05:49.966,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in the garbage collection place.

92
0:05:52.958,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"Why did you throw away the shutters?" I asked him.

93
0:05:56.518,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered.

94
0:06:01.75,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?"

95
0:06:07.318,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Come on, man! What policemen?

96
0:06:10.142,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You can see it for yourself. There are colors,

97
0:06:13.234,000 --> 0:06:18,000
streetlights, new pavement with no potholes,

98
0:06:19.054,000 --> 0:06:23,000
trees. So it's beautiful; it's safe."

99
0:06:23.846,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And indeed, it was beauty that was giving people

100
0:06:27.79,000 --> 0:06:31,000
this feeling of being protected.

101
0:06:32.217,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And this was not a misplaced feeling.

102
0:06:35.719,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Crime did fall.

103
0:06:40.476,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The freedom that was won in 1990

104
0:06:43.822,000 --> 0:06:47,000
brought about a state of anarchy in the city,

105
0:06:47.959,000 --> 0:06:49,000
while the barbarism of the '90s

106
0:06:50.87,000 --> 0:06:53,000
brought about a loss of hope for the city.

107
0:06:54.352,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The paint on the walls did not feed children,

108
0:06:58.622,000 --> 0:07:02,000
nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant,

109
0:07:02.686,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but it gave hope and light,

110
0:07:06.127,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and helped to make people see

111
0:07:08.567,000 --> 0:07:11,000
there could be a different way of doing things,

112
0:07:11.67,000 --> 0:07:14,000
a different spirit, a different feel to our lives,

113
0:07:15.581,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and that if we brought the same energy and hope

114
0:07:21.8,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to our politics, we could build a better life

115
0:07:26.088,000 --> 0:07:31,000
for each other and for our country.

116
0:07:31.283,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete

117
0:07:38.133,000 --> 0:07:4,000
only from the riverbanks.

118
0:07:40.74,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings

119
0:07:45.89,000 --> 0:07:47,000
all over the city,

120
0:07:48.872,000 --> 0:07:52,000
up to eight stories high, the tallest of them.

121
0:07:53.341,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.

122
0:07:59.87,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We established a green tax,

123
0:08:02.953,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and then everybody accepted it

124
0:08:06.983,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and all businessmen paid it regularly.

125
0:08:11.977,000 --> 0:08:13,000
By means of open competitions,

126
0:08:14.364,000 --> 0:08:16,000
we managed to recruit in our administration

127
0:08:17.357,000 --> 0:08:18,000
many young people,

128
0:08:19.352,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and we thus managed to build

129
0:08:21.214,000 --> 0:08:24,000
a de-politicized public institution

130
0:08:24.485,000 --> 0:08:28,000
where men and women were equally represented.

131
0:08:29.005,000 --> 0:08:31,000
International organizations

132
0:08:31.547,000 --> 0:08:34,000
have invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years,

133
0:08:34.925,000 --> 0:08:37,000
not all of it well spent.

134
0:08:38.157,000 --> 0:08:41,000
When I told the World Bank directors

135
0:08:41.285,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that I wanted them to finance a project to build

136
0:08:46.198,000 --> 0:08:48,000
a model reception hall for citizens

137
0:08:49.093,000 --> 0:08:53,000
precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption,

138
0:08:53.253,000 --> 0:08:55,000
they did not understand me.

139
0:08:55.503,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But people were waiting in long queues

140
0:08:58.781,000 --> 0:09:,000
under sun and under rain

141
0:09:01.704,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer

142
0:09:05.929,000 --> 0:09:12,000
from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.

143
0:09:13.367,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They were paying in order to skip the queue,

144
0:09:17.551,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the long queue.

145
0:09:19.907,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The reply to their requests was met

146
0:09:23.87,000 --> 0:09:27,000
by a voice coming from this dark hole,

147
0:09:28.571,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and, on the other hand,

148
0:09:32.813,000 --> 0:09:37,000
a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents

149
0:09:38.255,000 --> 0:09:43,000
while searching through old documents for the bribe.

150
0:09:44.063,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks,

151
0:09:48.37,000 --> 0:09:53,000
every week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.

152
0:09:54.009,000 --> 0:09:57,000
"I'm convinced," I told a German official

153
0:09:57.783,000 --> 0:09:59,000
with the World Bank,

154
0:10:00.559,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"that it would be impossible for them to be bribed

155
0:10:04.401,000 --> 0:10:06,000
if they worked in Germany,

156
0:10:06.855,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in a German administration,

157
0:10:08.806,000 --> 0:10:12,000
just as I am convinced that if you put German officials

158
0:10:13.212,000 --> 0:10:16,000
from the German administration in those holes,

159
0:10:16.435,000 --> 0:10:2,000
they would be bribed just the same."

160
0:10:20.583,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Applause)

161
0:10:27.287,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's not about genes.

162
0:10:29.119,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It's not about some being with a high conscience

163
0:10:34.853,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and some others having not a conscience.

164
0:10:37.295,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's about system, it's about organization.

165
0:10:40.067,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's also about environment and respect.

166
0:10:43.327,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We removed the kiosks.

167
0:10:46.21,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We built the bright new reception hall

168
0:10:49.906,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that made people, Tirana citizens,

169
0:10:53.477,000 --> 0:10:56,000
think they had traveled abroad when they entered

170
0:10:57.163,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to make their requests.

171
0:10:59.587,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We created an online system of control

172
0:11:03.031,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and so speeded up all the processes.

173
0:11:06.947,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We put the citizen first, and not the clerks.

174
0:11:11.603,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The corruption in the state administration

175
0:11:15.807,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of countries like Albania --

176
0:11:18.507,000 --> 0:11:22,000
it's not up to me to say also like Greece --

177
0:11:22.683,000 --> 0:11:27,000
can be fought only by modernization.

178
0:11:28.063,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself

179
0:11:32.815,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is the answer, and not reinventing people

180
0:11:36.334,000 --> 0:11:38,000
based on a ready-made formula

181
0:11:38.982,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that the developed world often tries in vain to impose

182
0:11:43.238,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to people like us.

183
0:11:45.344,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Applause)

184
0:11:48.051,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Things have come to this point

185
0:11:50.035,000 --> 0:11:52,000
because politicians in general,

186
0:11:52.527,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but especially in our countries, let's face it,

187
0:11:55.423,000 --> 0:11:57,000
think people are stupid.

188
0:11:57.886,000 --> 0:12:,000
They take it for granted that, come what may,

189
0:12:01.43,000 --> 0:12:03,000
people have to follow them,

190
0:12:03.642,000 --> 0:12:07,000
while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers

191
0:12:07.736,000 --> 0:12:11,000
for their public concerns

192
0:12:11.759,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or the exigencies of the common people.

193
0:12:16.43,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Politics has come to resemble

194
0:12:19.232,000 --> 0:12:22,000
a cynical team game played by politicians,

195
0:12:22.718,000 --> 0:12:25,000
while the public has been pushed aside

196
0:12:26.647,000 --> 0:12:29,000
as if sitting on the seats of a stadium

197
0:12:30.534,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in which passion for politics

198
0:12:32.384,000 --> 0:12:37,000
is gradually making room for blindness and desperation.

199
0:12:37.993,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Seen from those stairs, all politicians today

200
0:12:42.887,000 --> 0:12:43,000
seem the same,

201
0:12:44.85,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and politics has come to resemble

202
0:12:49.487,000 --> 0:12:53,000
a sport that inspires more aggressiveness

203
0:12:54.088,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and pessimism than social cohesion

204
0:12:57.4,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and the desire for civic protaganism.

205
0:13:01.673,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Barack Obama won

206
0:13:03.699,000 --> 0:13:09,000
— (Applause) —

207
0:13:09.976,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because he mobilized people as never before

208
0:13:13.539,000 --> 0:13:15,000
through the use of social networks.

209
0:13:16.072,000 --> 0:13:19,000
He did not know each and every one of them,

210
0:13:19.185,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but with an admirable ingenuity,

211
0:13:23.055,000 --> 0:13:26,000
he managed to transform them into activists

212
0:13:26.435,000 --> 0:13:3,000
by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands

213
0:13:30.564,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the arguments and the instruments that each would need

214
0:13:34.158,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to campaign in his name by making his own campaign.

215
0:13:38.951,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I tweet. I love it.

216
0:13:41.006,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I love it because it lets me get the message out,

217
0:13:46.375,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but it also lets people get their messages to me.

218
0:13:50.642,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This is politics, not from top down,

219
0:13:53.634,000 --> 0:13:56,000
but from the bottom up, and sideways,

220
0:13:56.858,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and allowing everybody's voice to be heard

221
0:13:59.85,000 --> 0:14:,000
is exactly what we need.

222
0:14:01.81,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Politics is not just about leaders.

223
0:14:03.864,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's not just about politicians and laws.

224
0:14:06.625,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It is about how people think,

225
0:14:08.593,000 --> 0:14:1,000
how they view the world around them,

226
0:14:10.928,000 --> 0:14:12,000
how they use their time and their energy.

227
0:14:13.454,000 --> 0:14:15,000
When people say all politicians are the same,

228
0:14:15.97,000 --> 0:14:18,000
ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush,

229
0:14:19.25,000 --> 0:14:22,000
if François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.

230
0:14:22.825,000 --> 0:14:26,000
They are not. They are human beings with different views

231
0:14:27.529,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and different visions for the world.

232
0:14:30.111,000 --> 0:14:32,000
When people say nothing can change,

233
0:14:33.009,000 --> 0:14:37,000
just stop and think what the world was like

234
0:14:37.073,000 --> 0:14:41,000
10, 20, 50, 100 years ago.

235
0:14:41.705,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Our world is defined by the pace of change.

236
0:14:44.821,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We can all change the world.

237
0:14:47.625,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I gave you a very small example

238
0:14:50.501,000 --> 0:14:53,000
of how one thing, the use of color,

239
0:14:54.002,000 --> 0:14:56,000
can make change happen.

240
0:14:56.513,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I want to make more change

241
0:14:57.876,000 --> 0:14:59,000
as Prime Minister of my country,

242
0:15:00.664,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but every single one of you can make change happen

243
0:15:04.986,000 --> 0:15:05,000
if you want to.

244
0:15:06.579,000 --> 0:15:09,000
President Roosevelt, he said,

245
0:15:09.704,000 --> 0:15:12,000
"Believe you can, and you are halfway there."

246
0:15:13.377,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Efharisto and kalinihta.

247
0:15:16.444,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Applause)

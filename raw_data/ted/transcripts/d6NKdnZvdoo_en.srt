1
0:00:12.629,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So here's the most important economic fact of our time.

2
0:00:17.917,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We are living in an age of surging income inequality,

3
0:00:21.947,000 --> 0:00:23,000
particularly between those at the very top

4
0:00:24.872,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and everyone else.

5
0:00:26.708,000 --> 0:00:3,000
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,

6
0:00:30.73,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but it's a global phenomenon.

7
0:00:32.928,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's happening in communist China,

8
0:00:35.251,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in formerly communist Russia,

9
0:00:36.974,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.

10
0:00:40.268,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies

11
0:00:43.235,000 --> 0:00:46,000
like Sweden, Finland and Germany.

12
0:00:46.86,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.

13
0:00:50.771,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In the 1970s, the One Percent

14
0:00:53.48,000 --> 0:00:57,000
accounted for about 10 percent of the national income

15
0:00:57.757,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in the United States.

16
0:00:59.521,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Today, their share has more than doubled

17
0:01:02.83,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to above 20 percent.

18
0:01:05.269,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But what's even more striking

19
0:01:07.369,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is what's happening at the very tippy top

20
0:01:10.055,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of the income distribution.

21
0:01:12.297,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.

22
0:01:15.301,000 --> 0:01:18,000
today account for more than eight percent

23
0:01:18.53,000 --> 0:01:19,000
of the national income.

24
0:01:20.42,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.

25
0:01:24.913,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Let me give you another number to put that in perspective,

26
0:01:27.681,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005

27
0:01:31.199,000 --> 0:01:32,000
by Robert Reich,

28
0:01:32.658,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

29
0:01:35.397,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,

30
0:01:40.701,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,

31
0:01:43.421,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth

32
0:01:46.37,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,

33
0:01:51.123,000 --> 0:01:53,000
120 million people.

34
0:01:53.965,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now, as it happens,

35
0:01:56.329,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,

36
0:01:59.133,000 --> 0:02:02,000
he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,

37
0:02:02.86,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and he has his own favorite number.

38
0:02:06.162,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Buffett likes to point out that in 1992,

39
0:02:10.105,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the combined wealth of the people

40
0:02:12.267,000 --> 0:02:14,000
on the Forbes 400 list --

41
0:02:14.596,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans --

42
0:02:17.993,000 --> 0:02:19,000
was 300 billion dollars.

43
0:02:20.765,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Just think about it.

44
0:02:21.966,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You didn't even need to be a billionaire

45
0:02:23.993,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to get on that list in 1992.

46
0:02:26.966,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled

47
0:02:30.979,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to 1.7 trillion,

48
0:02:33.865,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I probably don't need to tell you

49
0:02:36.043,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that we haven't seen anything similar happen

50
0:02:38.504,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to the middle class,

51
0:02:39.889,000 --> 0:02:43,000
whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.

52
0:02:44.59,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,

53
0:02:48.65,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but we've been slow to notice it.

54
0:02:50.691,000 --> 0:02:51,000
One of the reasons, I think,

55
0:02:52.374,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.

56
0:02:55.352,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Changes which are slow and gradual

57
0:02:57.915,000 --> 0:02:58,000
can be hard to notice

58
0:02:59.455,000 --> 0:03:01,000
even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.

59
0:03:02.359,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.

60
0:03:05.591,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But I think there's something else going on.

61
0:03:08.406,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Talking about income inequality,

62
0:03:10.516,000 --> 0:03:12,000
even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,

63
0:03:13.047,000 --> 0:03:15,000
can make us feel uncomfortable.

64
0:03:15.188,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It feels less positive, less optimistic,

65
0:03:18.633,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to talk about how the pie is sliced

66
0:03:21.162,000 --> 0:03:24,000
than to think about how to make the pie bigger.

67
0:03:24.214,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,

68
0:03:26.942,000 --> 0:03:28,000
talking about income distribution,

69
0:03:29.74,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,

70
0:03:33.427,000 --> 0:03:35,000
can be downright threatening.

71
0:03:35.967,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So we're living in the age of surging income inequality,

72
0:03:40.243,000 --> 0:03:42,000
especially at the top.

73
0:03:42.356,000 --> 0:03:45,000
What's driving it, and what can we do about it?

74
0:03:45.944,000 --> 0:03:48,000
One set of causes is political:

75
0:03:49.61,000 --> 0:03:54,000
lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,

76
0:03:55.205,000 --> 0:04:,000
privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,

77
0:04:00.335,000 --> 0:04:02,000
all of these have contributed

78
0:04:02.775,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to more and more income going to the very, very top.

79
0:04:06.892,000 --> 0:04:09,000
A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped

80
0:04:10.315,000 --> 0:04:13,000
under the category of "crony capitalism,"

81
0:04:13.644,000 --> 0:04:15,000
political changes that benefit a group

82
0:04:15.821,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of well-connected insiders

83
0:04:17.983,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but don't actually do much good for the rest of us.

84
0:04:21.521,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism

85
0:04:24.91,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is incredibly difficult.

86
0:04:26.951,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes

87
0:04:30.444,000 --> 0:04:33,000
have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,

88
0:04:33.838,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks

89
0:04:36.867,000 --> 0:04:39,000
even after the most profound financial crisis

90
0:04:40.024,000 --> 0:04:41,000
since the Great Depression,

91
0:04:41.646,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,

92
0:04:46.242,000 --> 0:04:5,000
including those whose motto might be "don't do evil,"

93
0:04:50.253,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that

94
0:04:53.027,000 --> 0:04:55,000
paid by the middle class.

95
0:04:55.135,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice

96
0:04:58.171,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is really, really hard,

97
0:05:00.167,000 --> 0:05:03,000
at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.

98
0:05:03.635,000 --> 0:05:08,000
After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.

99
0:05:09.284,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Indeed, this is one of those rare issues

100
0:05:11.931,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that unites the left and the right.

101
0:05:15.166,000 --> 0:05:17,000
A critique of crony capitalism is as central

102
0:05:17.986,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.

103
0:05:22.283,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,

104
0:05:26.621,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the easy part of the problem,

105
0:05:28.656,000 --> 0:05:31,000
things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers

106
0:05:31.931,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of surging income inequality.

107
0:05:34.684,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.

108
0:05:38.423,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Globalization and the technology revolution,

109
0:05:41.47,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the twin economic transformations

110
0:05:44.01,000 --> 0:05:45,000
which are changing our lives

111
0:05:45.708,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and transforming the global economy,

112
0:05:47.805,000 --> 0:05:5,000
are also powering the rise of the super-rich.

113
0:05:51.272,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Just think about it.

114
0:05:52.852,000 --> 0:05:53,000
For the first time in history,

115
0:05:54.84,000 --> 0:05:56,000
if you are an energetic entrepreneur

116
0:05:57.579,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with a brilliant new idea

117
0:05:59.278,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or a fantastic new product,

118
0:06:01.693,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you have almost instant, almost frictionless access

119
0:06:05.372,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to a global market of more than a billion people.

120
0:06:09.352,000 --> 0:06:12,000
As a result, if you are very, very smart

121
0:06:13.186,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and very, very lucky,

122
0:06:14.981,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you can get very, very rich

123
0:06:17.832,000 --> 0:06:19,000
very, very quickly.

124
0:06:20.362,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The latest poster boy for this phenomenon

125
0:06:23.204,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is David Karp.

126
0:06:25.184,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr

127
0:06:28.039,000 --> 0:06:3,000
recently sold his company to Yahoo

128
0:06:30.821,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for 1.1 billion dollars.

129
0:06:33.854,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Think about that for a minute:

130
0:06:35.392,000 --> 0:06:39,000
1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.

131
0:06:39.806,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's easiest to see how the technology revolution

132
0:06:43.253,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect

133
0:06:46.874,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in highly visible fields,

134
0:06:48.817,000 --> 0:06:5,000
like sports and entertainment.

135
0:06:51.12,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We can all watch how a fantastic athlete

136
0:06:54.495,000 --> 0:06:58,000
or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills

137
0:06:58.839,000 --> 0:07:01,000
across the global economy as never before.

138
0:07:02.507,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But today, that superstar effect

139
0:07:04.587,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is happening across the entire economy.

140
0:07:07.569,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We have superstar technologists.

141
0:07:09.746,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We have superstar bankers.

142
0:07:11.467,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.

143
0:07:14.803,000 --> 0:07:15,000
There are superstar cooks

144
0:07:16.232,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and superstar farmers.

145
0:07:17.744,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There are even, and this is my personal favorite example,

146
0:07:20.527,000 --> 0:07:21,000
superstar dentists,

147
0:07:22.518,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the most dazzling exemplar of whom

148
0:07:24.622,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers

149
0:07:27.984,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to the smiles of fellow superstars

150
0:07:30.303,000 --> 0:07:32,000
like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich

151
0:07:32.984,000 --> 0:07:34,000
or European-born American fashion designer

152
0:07:35.845,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Diane von Furstenberg.

153
0:07:37.89,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization

154
0:07:40.973,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and the technology revolution

155
0:07:42.885,000 --> 0:07:44,000
are creating this global plutocracy,

156
0:07:45.356,000 --> 0:07:49,000
what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.

157
0:07:49.523,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And that's because,

158
0:07:51.049,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in contrast with crony capitalism,

159
0:07:53.426,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so much of what globalization and the technology revolution

160
0:07:57.336,000 --> 0:07:59,000
have done is highly positive.

161
0:07:59.699,000 --> 0:08:,000
Let's start with technology.

162
0:08:01.434,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.

163
0:08:05.044,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I love the fact that they mean that

164
0:08:06.878,000 --> 0:08:09,000
whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk

165
0:08:10.564,000 --> 0:08:12,000
far beyond this auditorium.

166
0:08:12.611,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I'm even more of a fan of globalization.

167
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This is the transformation

168
0:08:17.707,000 --> 0:08:19,000
which has lifted hundreds of millions

169
0:08:20.131,000 --> 0:08:23,000
of the world's poorest people out of poverty

170
0:08:23.18,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and into the middle class,

171
0:08:24.622,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,

172
0:08:27.664,000 --> 0:08:3,000
it's made many new products affordable --

173
0:08:31.171,000 --> 0:08:33,000
who do you think built your iPhone? —

174
0:08:33.697,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.

175
0:08:37.519,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.

176
0:08:40.143,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So what's not to like?

177
0:08:42.679,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Well, a few things.

178
0:08:44.571,000 --> 0:08:46,000
One of the things that worries me

179
0:08:46.675,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy

180
0:08:50.838,000 --> 0:08:52,000
can become crony plutocracy.

181
0:08:53.534,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur

182
0:08:56.193,000 --> 0:08:59,000
who has successfully sold that idea or that product

183
0:08:59.57,000 --> 0:09:,000
to the global billions

184
0:09:00.949,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and become a billionaire in the process.

185
0:09:03.515,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It gets tempting at that point

186
0:09:05.884,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to use your economic nous

187
0:09:08.859,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to manipulate the rules of the global political economy

188
0:09:13.131,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in your own favor.

189
0:09:15.217,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And that's no mere hypothetical example.

190
0:09:17.966,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.

191
0:09:22.395,000 --> 0:09:24,000
These are among the world's most admired,

192
0:09:24.499,000 --> 0:09:26,000
most beloved, most innovative companies.

193
0:09:27.045,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They also happen to be particularly adept

194
0:09:29.969,000 --> 0:09:31,000
at working the international tax system

195
0:09:32.207,000 --> 0:09:36,000
so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.

196
0:09:36.765,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And why stop at just playing the global political

197
0:09:41.08,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and economic system as it exists

198
0:09:43.168,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to your own maximum advantage?

199
0:09:45.313,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Once you have the tremendous economic power

200
0:09:49.63,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution

201
0:09:52.703,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and the political power that inevitably entails,

202
0:09:55.953,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it becomes tempting as well

203
0:09:58.466,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to start trying to change the rules of the game

204
0:10:02.054,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in your own favor.

205
0:10:04.156,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Again, this is no mere hypothetical.

206
0:10:06.89,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's what the Russian oligarchs did

207
0:10:08.825,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization

208
0:10:12.087,000 --> 0:10:13,000
of Russia's natural resources.

209
0:10:14.057,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It's one way of describing what happened

210
0:10:15.831,000 --> 0:10:17,000
with deregulation of the financial services

211
0:10:17.866,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in the U.S. and the U.K.

212
0:10:20.101,000 --> 0:10:21,000
A second thing that worries me

213
0:10:22.027,000 --> 0:10:24,000
is how easily meritocratic plutocracy

214
0:10:24.758,000 --> 0:10:26,000
can become aristocracy.

215
0:10:27.504,000 --> 0:10:29,000
One way of describing the plutocrats

216
0:10:29.579,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is as alpha geeks,

217
0:10:31.386,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and they are people who are acutely aware

218
0:10:33.9,000 --> 0:10:35,000
of how important highly sophisticated

219
0:10:36.308,000 --> 0:10:4,000
analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.

220
0:10:40.49,000 --> 0:10:42,000
That's why they are spending

221
0:10:42.909,000 --> 0:10:44,000
unprecedented time and resources

222
0:10:45.686,000 --> 0:10:46,000
educating their own children.

223
0:10:47.583,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The middle class is spending more on schooling too,

224
0:10:50.85,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but in the global educational arms race

225
0:10:53.211,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that starts at nursery school

226
0:10:54.995,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,

227
0:10:58.733,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned

228
0:11:02.211,000 --> 0:11:03,000
by the One Percent.

229
0:11:03.75,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The result is something that economists Alan Krueger

230
0:11:06.456,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.

231
0:11:10.161,000 --> 0:11:12,000
As income inequality increases,

232
0:11:12.964,000 --> 0:11:14,000
social mobility decreases.

233
0:11:15.737,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The plutocracy may be a meritocracy,

234
0:11:18.495,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but increasingly you have to be born

235
0:11:20.711,000 --> 0:11:24,000
on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.

236
0:11:25.595,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The third thing, and this is what worries me the most,

237
0:11:28.619,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is the extent to which those same largely positive forces

238
0:11:32.97,000 --> 0:11:35,000
which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy

239
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
also happen to be hollowing out the middle class

240
0:11:39.592,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in Western industrialized economies.

241
0:11:42.546,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Let's start with technology.

242
0:11:44.633,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Those same forces that are creating billionaires

243
0:11:47.706,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.

244
0:11:51.729,000 --> 0:11:53,000
When's the last time you used a travel agent?

245
0:11:54.668,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And in contrast with the industrial revolution,

246
0:11:57.749,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the titans of our new economy

247
0:11:59.905,000 --> 0:12:01,000
aren't creating that many new jobs.

248
0:12:02.707,000 --> 0:12:05,000
At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,

249
0:12:06.526,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Facebook fewer than 10,000.

250
0:12:09.549,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The same is true of globalization.

251
0:12:12.219,000 --> 0:12:15,000
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people

252
0:12:15.462,000 --> 0:12:17,000
out of poverty in the emerging markets,

253
0:12:17.802,000 --> 0:12:19,000
it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs

254
0:12:20.668,000 --> 0:12:22,000
from the developed Western economies.

255
0:12:22.969,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The terrifying reality is

256
0:12:25.736,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that there is no economic rule

257
0:12:27.993,000 --> 0:12:29,000
which automatically translates

258
0:12:30.93,000 --> 0:12:31,000
increased economic growth

259
0:12:32.633,000 --> 0:12:34,000
into widely shared prosperity.

260
0:12:34.943,000 --> 0:12:36,000
That's shown in what I consider to be

261
0:12:37.617,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the most scary economic statistic of our time.

262
0:12:41.3,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity

263
0:12:45.358,000 --> 0:12:47,000
have been decoupled from increases

264
0:12:48.036,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in wages and employment.

265
0:12:49.97,000 --> 0:12:51,000
That means that our countries are getting richer,

266
0:12:52.914,000 --> 0:12:54,000
our companies are getting more efficient,

267
0:12:55.538,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but we're not creating more jobs

268
0:12:57.479,000 --> 0:13:,000
and we're not paying people, as a whole, more.

269
0:13:01.35,000 --> 0:13:05,000
One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this

270
0:13:05.559,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is to worry about structural unemployment.

271
0:13:09.27,000 --> 0:13:12,000
What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.

272
0:13:13.057,000 --> 0:13:15,000
After all, in a totally free labor market,

273
0:13:15.649,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.

274
0:13:18.851,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The dystopia that worries me

275
0:13:20.879,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is a universe in which a few geniuses

276
0:13:24.525,000 --> 0:13:26,000
invent Google and its ilk

277
0:13:26.605,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and the rest of us are employed giving them massages.

278
0:13:31.8,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So when I get really depressed about all of this,

279
0:13:34.433,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.

280
0:13:38.262,000 --> 0:13:41,000
After all, for all its grim, satanic mills,

281
0:13:42.157,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it worked out pretty well, didn't it?

282
0:13:44.657,000 --> 0:13:51,000
After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller --

283
0:13:51.68,000 --> 0:13:53,000
well, there are a few exceptions —

284
0:13:53.706,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.

285
0:13:58.697,000 --> 0:14:,000
But it's important to remember

286
0:14:01.281,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that before we learned how to share the fruits

287
0:14:04.103,000 --> 0:14:05,000
of the Industrial Revolution

288
0:14:05.782,000 --> 0:14:07,000
with the broad swathes of society,

289
0:14:08.345,000 --> 0:14:11,000
we had to go through two depressions,

290
0:14:11.74,000 --> 0:14:12,000
the Great Depression of the 1930s,

291
0:14:13.599,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the Long Depression of the 1870s,

292
0:14:16.453,000 --> 0:14:19,000
two world wars, communist revolutions

293
0:14:19.62,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in Russia and in China,

294
0:14:21.699,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and an era of tremendous social

295
0:14:24.024,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and political upheaval in the West.

296
0:14:26.78,000 --> 0:14:28,000
We also, not coincidentally,

297
0:14:29.5,000 --> 0:14:31,000
went through an era of tremendous

298
0:14:32.038,000 --> 0:14:34,000
social and political inventions.

299
0:14:34.617,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We created the modern welfare state.

300
0:14:36.961,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We created public education.

301
0:14:38.703,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We created public health care.

302
0:14:40.407,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We created public pensions.

303
0:14:42.182,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We created unions.

304
0:14:44.207,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Today, we are living through an era

305
0:14:46.723,000 --> 0:14:47,000
of economic transformation

306
0:14:48.684,000 --> 0:14:51,000
comparable in its scale and its scope

307
0:14:51.99,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to the Industrial Revolution.

308
0:14:54.258,000 --> 0:14:57,000
To be sure that this new economy benefits us all

309
0:14:57.449,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and not just the plutocrats,

310
0:14:59.567,000 --> 0:15:,000
we need to embark on an era

311
0:15:01.231,000 --> 0:15:04,000
of comparably ambitious social and political change.

312
0:15:05.15,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We need a new New Deal.

313
0:15:07.808,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Applause)

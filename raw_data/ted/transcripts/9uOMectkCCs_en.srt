1
0:00:13.136,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the great 1980s movie "The Blues Brothers,"

2
0:00:16.389,000 --> 0:00:2,000
there's a scene where John Belushi goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment

3
0:00:21.183,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in Chicago for the very first time.

4
0:00:24.106,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a cramped, tiny space

5
0:00:26.637,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and it's just three feet away from the train tracks.

6
0:00:30.628,000 --> 0:00:31,000
As John sits on Dan's bed,

7
0:00:32.466,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a train goes rushing by,

8
0:00:34.929,000 --> 0:00:36,000
rattling everything in the room.

9
0:00:37.153,000 --> 0:00:4,000
John asks, "How often does that train go by?"

10
0:00:40.982,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Dan replies, "So often, you won't even notice it."

11
0:00:45.542,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And then, something falls off the wall.

12
0:00:49.248,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We all know what he's talking about.

13
0:00:51.042,000 --> 0:00:53,000
As human beings, we get used to everyday things

14
0:00:53.883,000 --> 0:00:54,000
really fast.

15
0:00:55.6,000 --> 0:00:58,000
As a product designer, it's my job to see those everyday things,

16
0:00:58.984,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to feel them, and try to improve upon them.

17
0:01:03.365,000 --> 0:01:06,000
For example, see this piece of fruit?

18
0:01:08.211,000 --> 0:01:09,000
See this little sticker?

19
0:01:11.211,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That sticker wasn't there when I was a kid.

20
0:01:14.776,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But somewhere as the years passed,

21
0:01:16.694,000 --> 0:01:18,000
someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit.

22
0:01:19.575,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Why?

23
0:01:20.292,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So it could be easier for us

24
0:01:21.821,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to check out at the grocery counter.

25
0:01:23.558,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Well that's great,

26
0:01:24.651,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we can get in and out of the store quickly.

27
0:01:26.706,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But now, there's a new problem.

28
0:01:29.414,000 --> 0:01:31,000
When we get home and we're hungry

29
0:01:31.443,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we see this ripe, juicy piece of fruit on the counter,

30
0:01:34.874,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we just want to pick it up and eat it.

31
0:01:37.719,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Except now, we have to look for this little sticker.

32
0:01:42.587,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And dig at it with our nails, damaging the flesh.

33
0:01:46.962,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Then rolling up that sticker --

34
0:01:48.601,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you know what I mean.

35
0:01:49.636,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And then trying to flick it off your fingers.

36
0:01:51.775,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Applause)

37
0:01:56.276,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's not fun,

38
0:01:57.776,000 --> 0:01:58,000
not at all.

39
0:01:59.777,000 --> 0:02:,000
But something interesting happened.

40
0:02:01.992,000 --> 0:02:04,000
See the first time you did it, you probably felt those feelings.

41
0:02:05.075,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.

42
0:02:07.28,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You felt upset.

43
0:02:08.287,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You just wanted to dive in.

44
0:02:10.541,000 --> 0:02:11,000
By the 10th time,

45
0:02:12.165,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you started to become less upset

46
0:02:14.641,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and you just started peeling the label off.

47
0:02:18.071,000 --> 0:02:2,000
By the 100th time, at least for me,

48
0:02:20.48,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I became numb to it.

49
0:02:22.212,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I simply picked up the piece of fruit,

50
0:02:25.103,000 --> 0:02:29,000
dug at it with my nails, tried to flick it off,

51
0:02:29.215,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and then wondered,

52
0:02:30.771,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"Was there another sticker?"

53
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So why is that?

54
0:02:36.974,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Why do we get used to everyday things?

55
0:02:39.126,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Well as human beings, we have limited brain power.

56
0:02:42.274,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so our brains encode the everyday things we do into habits

57
0:02:47.043,000 --> 0:02:5,000
so we can free up space to learn new things.

58
0:02:50.62,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It's a process called habituation

59
0:02:52.662,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and it's one of the most basic ways, as humans, we learn.

60
0:02:57.596,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now, habituation isn't always bad.

61
0:03:00.975,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Remember learning to drive?

62
0:03:03.101,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I sure do.

63
0:03:04.939,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Your hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel,

64
0:03:08.227,000 --> 0:03:1,000
looking at every single object out there --

65
0:03:10.445,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the cars, the lights, the pedestrians.

66
0:03:13.695,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's a nerve-wracking experience.

67
0:03:16.936,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So much so, that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car

68
0:03:20.52,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and I couldn't even listen to music.

69
0:03:22.84,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But then something interesting happened.

70
0:03:24.949,000 --> 0:03:28,000
As the weeks went by, driving became easier and easier.

71
0:03:30.339,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You habituated it.

72
0:03:32.647,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It started to become fun and second nature.

73
0:03:35.324,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And then, you could talk to your friends again

74
0:03:37.531,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and listen to music.

75
0:03:38.49,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So there's a good reason why our brains habituate things.

76
0:03:41.189,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If we didn't, we'd notice every little detail,

77
0:03:44.552,000 --> 0:03:45,000
all the time.

78
0:03:46.717,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It would be exhausting,

79
0:03:48.295,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we'd have no time to learn about new things.

80
0:03:52.317,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But sometimes, habituation isn't good.

81
0:03:56.477,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us,

82
0:03:59.812,000 --> 0:04:,000
well, that's bad.

83
0:04:01.413,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems,

84
0:04:04.816,000 --> 0:04:06,000
well, then that's really bad.

85
0:04:07.923,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Comedians know all about this.

86
0:04:09.906,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built on noticing those little details,

87
0:04:14.791,000 --> 0:04:17,000
those idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember.

88
0:04:20.238,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He tells us about the time he visited his friends

89
0:04:22.615,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower.

90
0:04:25.001,000 --> 0:04:28,000
He'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way,

91
0:04:28.9,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it was 100 degrees too hot.

92
0:04:31.483,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And then he'd turn it the other way, and it was 100 degrees too cold.

93
0:04:35.415,000 --> 0:04:37,000
He just wanted a comfortable shower.

94
0:04:37.778,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, we've all been there,

95
0:04:39.941,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we just don't remember it.

96
0:04:41.726,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But Jerry did,

97
0:04:43.048,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and that's a comedian's job.

98
0:04:45.062,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But designers, innovators and entrepreneurs,

99
0:04:48.182,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it's our job to not just notice those things,

100
0:04:50.589,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but to go one step further and try to fix them.

101
0:04:55.276,000 --> 0:04:56,000
See this, this person,

102
0:04:56.842,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this is Mary Anderson.

103
0:04:58.581,000 --> 0:05:,000
In 1902 in New York City,

104
0:05:00.778,000 --> 0:05:01,000
she was visiting.

105
0:05:03.016,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It was a cold, wet, snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar.

106
0:05:09.226,000 --> 0:05:14,000
As she was going to her destination, she noticed the driver opening the window

107
0:05:14.323,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely.

108
0:05:20.258,000 --> 0:05:23,000
When he opened the window, though, he let all this cold, wet air inside,

109
0:05:23.834,000 --> 0:05:24,000
making all the passengers miserable.

110
0:05:27.189,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now probably, most of those passengers just thought,

111
0:05:30.122,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"It's a fact of life, he's got to open the window to clean it.

112
0:05:33.373,000 --> 0:05:34,000
That's just how it is."

113
0:05:35.176,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But Mary didn't.

114
0:05:36.711,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Mary thought,

115
0:05:38.01,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"What if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside

116
0:05:41.844,000 --> 0:05:44,000
so that he could stay safe and drive

117
0:05:45.122,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the passengers could actually stay warm?"

118
0:05:48.603,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So she picked up her sketchbook right then and there,

119
0:05:51.355,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and began drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper.

120
0:05:56.924,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now as a product designer, I try to learn from people like Mary

121
0:06:01.198,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to try to see the world the way it really is,

122
0:06:03.973,000 --> 0:06:05,000
not the way we think it is.

123
0:06:06.587,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Why?

124
0:06:07.534,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees.

125
0:06:11.894,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But it's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees.

126
0:06:16.441,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now some people think you're born with this ability

127
0:06:19.169,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or you're not,

128
0:06:20.75,000 --> 0:06:24,000
as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly.

129
0:06:26.883,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That wasn't the case for me.

130
0:06:28.813,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I had to work at it.

131
0:06:31.766,000 --> 0:06:33,000
During my years at Apple,

132
0:06:34.395,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Steve Jobs challenged us to come into work every day,

133
0:06:39.142,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to see our products through the eyes of the customer,

134
0:06:43.056,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the new customer,

135
0:06:44.503,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the one that has fears and possible frustrations

136
0:06:47.689,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product

137
0:06:50.83,000 --> 0:06:52,000
could work straightaway for them.

138
0:06:53.471,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He called it staying beginners,

139
0:06:55.705,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details

140
0:06:59.687,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to make them faster, easier and seamless for the new customers.

141
0:07:04.558,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So I remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the iPod.

142
0:07:09.028,000 --> 0:07:1,000
See, back in the '90s,

143
0:07:10.698,000 --> 0:07:12,000
being a gadget freak like I am,

144
0:07:15.107,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I would rush out to the store for the very, very latest gadget.

145
0:07:21.291,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I'd take all the time to get to the store,

146
0:07:23.353,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I'd check out, I'd come back home, I'd start to unbox it.

147
0:07:26.964,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And then, there was another little sticker:

148
0:07:30.89,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the one that said, "Charge before use."

149
0:07:34.005,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What!

150
0:07:35.553,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I can't believe it!

151
0:07:36.558,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I just spent all this time buying this product

152
0:07:38.734,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and now I have to charge before use.

153
0:07:40.768,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy.

154
0:07:45.158,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It was crazy.

155
0:07:46.85,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But you know what?

156
0:07:47.755,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Almost every product back then did that.

157
0:07:49.838,000 --> 0:07:5,000
When it had batteries in it,

158
0:07:51.613,000 --> 0:07:53,000
you had to charge it before you used it.

159
0:07:54.69,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Well, Steve noticed that

160
0:07:57.136,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and he said,

161
0:07:57.967,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"We're not going to let that happen to our product."

162
0:08:00.565,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So what did we do?

163
0:08:02.413,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Typically, when you have a product that has a hard drive in it,

164
0:08:05.499,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you run it for about 30 minutes in the factory

165
0:08:08.162,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to make sure that hard drive's going to be working years later

166
0:08:11.311,000 --> 0:08:14,000
for the customer after they pull it out of the box.

167
0:08:14.385,000 --> 0:08:17,000
What did we do instead?

168
0:08:17.451,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We ran that product for over two hours.

169
0:08:19.541,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Why?

170
0:08:21.129,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Well, first off, we could make a higher quality product,

171
0:08:24.254,000 --> 0:08:26,000
be easy to test,

172
0:08:26.404,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and make sure it was great for the customer.

173
0:08:29.906,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But most importantly,

174
0:08:31.159,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the battery came fully charged right out of the box,

175
0:08:34.178,000 --> 0:08:34,000
ready to use.

176
0:08:35.124,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So that customer, with all that exhilaration,

177
0:08:38.956,000 --> 0:08:39,000
could just start using the product.

178
0:08:40.684,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It was great, and it worked.

179
0:08:43.074,000 --> 0:08:44,000
People liked it.

180
0:08:44.338,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Today, almost every product that you get that's battery powered

181
0:08:47.445,000 --> 0:08:49,000
comes out of the box fully charged,

182
0:08:49.508,000 --> 0:08:51,000
even if it doesn't have a hard drive.

183
0:08:52.131,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But back then, we noticed that detail and we fixed it,

184
0:08:56.905,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and now everyone else does that as well.

185
0:08:59.253,000 --> 0:09:01,000
No more, "Charge before use."

186
0:09:02.644,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So why am I telling you this?

187
0:09:04.701,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Well, it's seeing the invisible problem,

188
0:09:06.809,000 --> 0:09:1,000
not just the obvious problem, that's important,

189
0:09:11.32,000 --> 0:09:13,000
not just for product design, but for everything we do.

190
0:09:14.682,000 --> 0:09:17,000
You see, there are invisible problems all around us,

191
0:09:18.206,000 --> 0:09:2,000
ones we can solve.

192
0:09:20.462,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But first we need to see them, to feel them.

193
0:09:24.996,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So, I'm hesitant to give you any tips

194
0:09:26.964,000 --> 0:09:28,000
about neuroscience or psychology.

195
0:09:29.695,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There's far too many experienced people in the TED community

196
0:09:32.689,000 --> 0:09:35,000
who would know much more about that than I ever will.

197
0:09:36.083,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But let me leave you with a few tips that I do,

198
0:09:38.71,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that we all can do, to fight habituation.

199
0:09:42.383,000 --> 0:09:45,000
My first tip is to look broader.

200
0:09:45.777,000 --> 0:09:47,000
You see, when you're tackling a problem,

201
0:09:47.889,000 --> 0:09:5,000
sometimes, there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem.

202
0:09:51.281,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And sometimes, a lot of steps after it.

203
0:09:54.351,000 --> 0:09:57,000
If you can take a step back and look broader,

204
0:09:57.7,000 --> 0:09:59,000
maybe you can change some of those boxes

205
0:09:59.971,000 --> 0:10:,000
before the problem.

206
0:10:00.977,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Maybe you can combine them.

207
0:10:02.337,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better.

208
0:10:06.258,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Take thermostats, for instance.

209
0:10:08.249,000 --> 0:10:11,000
In the 1900s when they first came out, they were really simple to use.

210
0:10:11.627,000 --> 0:10:12,000
You could turn them up or turn them down.

211
0:10:13.579,000 --> 0:10:14,000
People understood them.

212
0:10:16.019,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But in the 1970s,

213
0:10:17.772,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the energy crisis struck,

214
0:10:19.846,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and customers started thinking about how to save energy.

215
0:10:23.416,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So what happened?

216
0:10:24.703,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Thermostat designers decided to add a new step.

217
0:10:27.731,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Instead of just turning up and down,

218
0:10:29.581,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you now had to program it.

219
0:10:31.572,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time.

220
0:10:34.79,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Now that seemed great.

221
0:10:36.586,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Every thermostat had started adding that feature.

222
0:10:40.064,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But it turned out that no one saved any energy.

223
0:10:44.34,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Now, why is that?

224
0:10:45.853,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Well, people couldn't predict the future.

225
0:10:48.588,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season,

226
0:10:52.136,000 --> 0:10:53,000
year to year.

227
0:10:54.414,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So no one was saving energy,

228
0:10:56.745,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and what happened?

229
0:10:57.727,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Thermostat designers went back to the drawing board

230
0:11:00.35,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and they focused on that programming step.

231
0:11:02.942,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They made better U.I.s,

232
0:11:05.409,000 --> 0:11:07,000
they made better documentation.

233
0:11:07.575,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But still, years later, people were not saving any energy

234
0:11:12.305,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because they just couldn't predict the future.

235
0:11:15.431,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So what did we do?

236
0:11:16.909,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We put a machine-learning algorithm in instead of the programming

237
0:11:20.978,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that would simply watch when you turned it up and down,

238
0:11:23.676,000 --> 0:11:25,000
when you liked a certain temperature when you got up,

239
0:11:26.27,000 --> 0:11:27,000
or when you went away.

240
0:11:27.977,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And you know what?

241
0:11:29.245,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It worked.

242
0:11:30.422,000 --> 0:11:33,000
People are saving energy without any programming.

243
0:11:35.239,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So, it doesn't matter what you're doing.

244
0:11:37.246,000 --> 0:11:4,000
If you take a step back and look at all the boxes,

245
0:11:40.512,000 --> 0:11:43,000
maybe there's a way to remove one or combine them

246
0:11:43.533,000 --> 0:11:45,000
so that you can make that process much simpler.

247
0:11:47.007,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So that's my first tip: look broader.

248
0:11:50.084,000 --> 0:11:53,000
For my second tip, it's to look closer.

249
0:11:54.065,000 --> 0:11:57,000
One of my greatest teachers was my grandfather.

250
0:11:59.006,000 --> 0:12:,000
He taught me all about the world.

251
0:12:01.557,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He taught me how things were built and how they were repaired,

252
0:12:05.049,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project.

253
0:12:09.671,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I remember one story he told me about screws,

254
0:12:14.048,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job.

255
0:12:17.678,000 --> 0:12:18,000
There are many different screws:

256
0:12:19.617,000 --> 0:12:23,000
wood screws, metal screws, anchors, concrete screws,

257
0:12:24.487,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the list went on and on.

258
0:12:27.212,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Our job is to make products that are easy to install

259
0:12:30.485,000 --> 0:12:33,000
for all of our customs themselves without professionals.

260
0:12:34.789,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So what did we do?

261
0:12:36.72,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I remembered that story that my grandfather told me,

262
0:12:39.655,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and so we thought,

263
0:12:40.928,000 --> 0:12:42,000
"How many different screws can we put in the box?

264
0:12:43.428,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Was it going to be two, three, four, five?

265
0:12:46.278,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Because there's so many different wall types."

266
0:12:48.574,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So we thought about it, we optimized it,

267
0:12:51.304,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and we came up with three different screws to put in the box.

268
0:12:55.845,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We thought that was going to solve the problem.

269
0:12:58.122,000 --> 0:13:,000
But it turned out, it didn't.

270
0:13:01.527,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So we shipped the product,

271
0:13:03.158,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and people weren't having a great experience.

272
0:13:06.128,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So what did we do?

273
0:13:07.336,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We went back to the drawing board

274
0:13:09.081,000 --> 0:13:12,000
just instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right.

275
0:13:12.545,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And we designed a special screw, a custom screw,

276
0:13:16.269,000 --> 0:13:18,000
much to the chagrin of our investors.

277
0:13:18.44,000 --> 0:13:21,000
They were like, "Why are you spending so much time on a little screw?

278
0:13:21.862,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Get out there and sell more!"

279
0:13:23.861,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And we said, "We will sell more if we get this right."

280
0:13:27.904,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And it turned out, we did.

281
0:13:29.594,000 --> 0:13:32,000
With that custom little screw, there was just one screw in the box,

282
0:13:32.888,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that was easy to mount and put on the wall.

283
0:13:37.525,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So if we focus on those tiny details, the ones we may not see

284
0:13:44.404,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and we look at them as we say,

285
0:13:46.228,000 --> 0:13:47,000
"Are those important

286
0:13:47.636,000 --> 0:13:49,000
or is that the way we've always done it?

287
0:13:50.436,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Maybe there's a way to get rid of those."

288
0:13:54.22,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So my last piece of advice is to think younger.

289
0:14:00.389,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Every day, I'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids.

290
0:14:04.545,000 --> 0:14:05,000
They come up with questions like,

291
0:14:06.316,000 --> 0:14:08,000
"Why can't cars fly around traffic?"

292
0:14:09.644,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Or, "Why don't my shoelaces have Velcro instead?"

293
0:14:14.49,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Sometimes, those questions are smart.

294
0:14:17.409,000 --> 0:14:19,000
My son came to me the other day and I asked him,

295
0:14:19.947,000 --> 0:14:22,000
"Go run out to the mailbox and check it."

296
0:14:23.123,000 --> 0:14:26,000
He looked at me, puzzled, and said,

297
0:14:27.311,000 --> 0:14:31,000
"Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail?" (Laughter)

298
0:14:32.225,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I was like, "That's a pretty good question."

299
0:14:36.878,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So, they can ask tons of questions

300
0:14:39.492,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers.

301
0:14:44.21,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We say, "Son, that's just the way the world works."

302
0:14:50.017,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So the more we're exposed to something,

303
0:14:52.567,000 --> 0:14:54,000
the more we get used to it.

304
0:14:54.764,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But kids haven't been around long enough

305
0:14:56.894,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to get used to those things.

306
0:14:58.794,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And so when they run into problems,

307
0:15:00.611,000 --> 0:15:02,000
they immediately try to solve them,

308
0:15:02.834,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and sometimes they find a better way,

309
0:15:05.576,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and that way really is better.

310
0:15:08.28,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team,

311
0:15:14.119,000 --> 0:15:16,000
or people with young minds.

312
0:15:16.225,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Because if you have those young minds,

313
0:15:18.576,000 --> 0:15:21,000
they cause everyone in the room to think younger.

314
0:15:21.736,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Picasso once said, "Every child is an artist.

315
0:15:27.09,000 --> 0:15:32,000
The problem is when he or she grows up, is how to remain an artist."

316
0:15:33.785,000 --> 0:15:36,000
We all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time,

317
0:15:37.734,000 --> 0:15:39,000
before a lifetime of habits got in the way.

318
0:15:40.998,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Our challenge is to get back there,

319
0:15:43.341,000 --> 0:15:45,000
to feel that frustration,

320
0:15:45.586,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to see those little details,

321
0:15:47.926,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to look broader,

322
0:15:49.666,000 --> 0:15:5,000
look closer,

323
0:15:51.422,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and to think younger

324
0:15:53.792,000 --> 0:15:54,000
so we can stay beginners.

325
0:15:56.15,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's not easy.

326
0:15:57.373,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It requires us pushing back

327
0:15:58.908,000 --> 0:16:01,000
against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world.

328
0:16:03.689,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But if we do,

329
0:16:04.732,000 --> 0:16:06,000
we could do some pretty amazing things.

330
0:16:07.243,000 --> 0:16:09,000
For me, hopefully, that's better product design.

331
0:16:10.94,000 --> 0:16:14,000
For you, that could mean something else, something powerful.

332
0:16:18.105,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Our challenge is to wake up each day and say,

333
0:16:21.169,000 --> 0:16:24,000
"How can I experience the world better?"

334
0:16:24.344,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And if we do, maybe, just maybe,

335
0:16:29.193,000 --> 0:16:33,000
we can get rid of these dumb little stickers.

336
0:16:34.248,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Thank you very much.

337
0:16:35.797,000 --> 0:16:37,000

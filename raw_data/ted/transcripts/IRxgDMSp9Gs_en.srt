1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and this was the cover of Fortune magazine

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
sitting in the window of the pharmacy.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and you get a little bit downhearted.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But when you start to read the article by Cliff,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who himself is a cancer survivor,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
who was saved by a clinical trial

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to get an experimental therapy for --

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
at the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
he makes remarkable points here.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And the point of the article was that we have gotten

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
reductionist in our view of biology,

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in our view of cancer.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
For the last 50 years, we have focused on treating

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the individual gene

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So, this is an astounding table.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
on cardiovascular disease,

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in over 50 years hasn't changed.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer.

29
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, what I'm going to tell you today,

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is a little bit of why I think that's the case,

31
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and then go out of my comfort zone

32
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and tell you where I think it's going,

33
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
where a new approach -- that we hope to push forward

34
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in terms of treating cancer.

35
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Because this is wrong.

36
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So, what is cancer, first of all?

37
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Well, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,

38
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they stick a needle in.

39
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:

40
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Does it look normal? Does it look abnormal?

41
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.

42
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.

43
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.

44
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
There's no molecular test,

45
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,

46
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes.

47
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.

48
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer.

49
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.

50
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.

51
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We can prevent most cancers.

52
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.

53
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We could do the same in cancer.

54
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I co-founded a company called Navigenics,

55
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
where, if you spit into a tube --

56
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,

57
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
all of which are delayable in many of the cancers --

58
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you start to identify what you could get,

59
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and then we can start to work to prevent them.

60
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Because the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,

61
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.

62
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged.

63
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Why is it a disease of the aged?

64
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.

65
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
See, evolution protected us during our childbearing years

66
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,

67
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny."

68
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So if you look at cancers, it is very rare -- extremely rare --

69
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
to have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.

70
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
As one gets older? Very, very common.

71
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Why is it hard to treat?

72
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Because it's heterogeneous,

73
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.

74
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,

75
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
what we call clonal selection.

76
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But, if we start to understand

77
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more,

78
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.

79
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer

80
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:

81
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc."

82
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You then have some anatomic descriptions,

83
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you get that CT scan: "There's a three centimeter mass in the liver."

84
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You then have some body part descriptions:

85
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate."

86
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And that's about it.

87
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
So, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.

88
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's basically symptoms.

89
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's manifestations of a disease.

90
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years,

91
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the government has spent 400 million dollars,

92
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and they've allocated another billion dollars,

93
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.

94
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,

95
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.

96
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You know, in the mid-1850's in France,

97
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
they started to describe cancer by body part.

98
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
That hasn't changed in over 150 years.

99
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer

100
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
by prostate, by breast, by muscle.

101
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It makes no sense, if you think about it.

102
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So, obviously, the technology is here today,

103
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and, over the next several years, that will change.

104
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.

105
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,

106
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions

107
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that were involved in causing this individual cancer.

108
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine

109
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
more to the science of medicine,

110
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and be able to do what they do in infectious disease,

111
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
which is look at that organism, that bacteria,

112
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and then say, "This antibiotic makes sense,

113
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it."

114
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
When one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,

115
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms

116
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.

117
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it --

118
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
although we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.

119
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now.

120
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The first cancer was done, which was brain cancer.

121
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer,

122
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then lung cancer will come several months after.

123
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes,

124
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which I think is going to be the next level

125
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in terms of understanding and classifying disease.

126
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But remember, I'm not pushing genomics,

127
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
proteomics, to be a reductionist.

128
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against.

129
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to.

130
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In health care today, we spend most of the dollars --

131
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in terms of treating disease --

132
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life.

133
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against.

134
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
If you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against,

135
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
you're going to do things a hell of a lot better.

136
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease,

137
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we can take it enormously the other direction,

138
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward.

139
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute.

140
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.

141
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So, the website of the National Cancer Institute

142
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
says that cancer is a genetic disease.

143
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The website says, "If you look, there's an individual mutation,

144
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and maybe a second, and maybe a third,

145
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and that is cancer."

146
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.

147
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This isn't a genetic disease.

148
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it,

149
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and you see into the microscope a lymph node

150
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
where cancer has invaded.

151
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.

152
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Cancer is an interaction of a cell

153
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that no longer is under growth control with the environment.

154
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment.

155
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's what we call a system.

156
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer.

157
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades,

158
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is that we have strived to understand cancer.

159
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The goal is to control cancer.

160
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And that is a very different optimization scheme,

161
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
a very different strategy for all of us.

162
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research,

163
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
one of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there,

164
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and I said, "We've made a mistake.

165
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We've all made a mistake, myself included,

166
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
by focusing down, by being a reductionist.

167
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We need to take a step back."

168
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.

169
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
People got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.

170
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago.

171
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other.

172
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I said, "Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?"

173
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor?

174
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But people prevailed on us, and we got together,

175
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative.

176
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We have designed, and we have worked on the modeling --

177
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team --

178
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system.

179
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And I'll show you some data there

180
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.

181
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data,

182
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
you have to understand the data inputs.

183
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days,

184
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and I asked, "What was the average temperature?"

185
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and it came back at 98.7, I would say, "Great."

186
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But if during one of those days

187
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
your temperature spiked to 102 for six hours,

188
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and you took Tylenol and got better, etc.,

189
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I would totally miss it.

190
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine

191
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is that you and I, and all of us,

192
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
we go to our doctor once a year.

193
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.

194
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Earlier it was referred to this direct life device.

195
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You know, I've been using it for two and a half months.

196
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's a staggering device, not because it tells me

197
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
how many kilocalories I do every day,

198
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.

199
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk,

200
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and I'm not moving at all.

201
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here

202
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
are really different than we understand them,

203
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because we're not measuring them dynamically.

204
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And so, if you think of cancer as a system,

205
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
there's an input and an output and a state in the middle.

206
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So, the states, are equivalent classes of history,

207
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,

208
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.

209
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The output are our symptoms:

210
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Do we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?

211
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Most of that state is hidden.

212
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So what we do in our field is we change and input,

213
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we give aggressive chemotherapy,

214
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and we say, "Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?"

215
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And so, the problem is that it's not just one system,

216
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it's multiple systems on multiple scales.

217
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
It's a system of systems.

218
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And so, when you start to look at emergent systems,

219
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
you can look at a neuron under a microscope.

220
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
A neuron under the microscope is very elegant

221
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with little things sticking out and little things over here,

222
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but when you start to put them together in a complex system,

223
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and you start to see that it becomes a brain,

224
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and that brain can create intelligence,

225
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
what we're talking about in the body,

226
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.

227
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Well, the bad news is that these robust --

228
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and robust is a key word --

229
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail.

230
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The good news is you can manipulate them.

231
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
You can try to control them

232
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
without that fundamental understanding of every component.

233
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer

234
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine,

235
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.

236
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.

237
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They had gotten their chemotherapy,

238
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and then they randomized them,

239
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
where half got placebo,

240
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.

241
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It's used to treat osteoporosis,

242
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and they got that twice a year.

243
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
They looked and, in these 1,800 women,

244
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
given twice a year a drug that builds bone,

245
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.

246
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug

247
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that doesn't even touch the cancer.

248
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well.

249
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
You change that system,

250
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and you could have a marked effect on the cancer.

251
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking --

252
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy

253
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
actually touches a cancer cell.

254
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's never been shown.

255
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes,

256
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell,

257
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near

258
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
the doses that happen in the body.

259
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol

260
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
every three weeks, which is the standard,

261
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
about 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer

262
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
have a great response to that drug.

263
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And a response is 50 percent shrinkage.

264
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Well, remember that's not even an order of magnitude,

265
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but that's a different story.

266
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
They then recur, I give them that same drug every week.

267
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Another 30 percent will respond.

268
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
They then recur, I give them that same drug

269
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
over 96 hours by continuous infusion,

270
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
another 20 or 30 percent will respond.

271
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size.

272
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It's not. We have no idea the mechanism.

273
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting

274
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that complex system,

275
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence,

276
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
chemotherapy may work by that same exact way.

277
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
The wild thing about that trial also,

278
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
was that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also.

279
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing.

280
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
They're dynamic.

281
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside,

282
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
but it looks at obesity in the world.

283
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small.

284
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there,

285
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
more than 75 percent of the population

286
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
of those countries are obese.

287
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Look a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different.

288
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So, our systems today are dramatically different

289
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
than our systems a decade or two ago.

290
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So the diseases we have today,

291
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades,

292
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so

293
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
based on things like this.

294
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture

295
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
of the whole proteome.

296
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet,

297
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and we're able to get resolution

298
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body.

299
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We can start to see that system.

300
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.

301
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
The power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here,

302
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology.

303
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis

304
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and a group called Applied Proteomics,

305
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
where we can start to see individual neutron differences,

306
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and we can start to look at that system like we never have before.

307
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back.

308
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So this is a woman, 46 years old,

309
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
who had recurrent lung cancer.

310
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
It was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver.

311
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere,

312
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Gemcitabine, Navelbine:

313
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Every drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.

314
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
She had three kids under the age of 12,

315
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and this is her CT scan.

316
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here,

317
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and you can see in the middle there is her heart,

318
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor

319
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.

320
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway,

321
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer,

322
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.

323
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Six months later it's still gone.

324
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
That cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer,

325
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
but she got three years from a drug

326
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
whose symptoms predominately were acne.

327
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
That's about it.

328
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So, the problem is that the clinical trial was done,

329
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and we were a part of it,

330
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and in the fundamental clinical trial --

331
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three,

332
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
we refused to use a placebo.

333
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Would you want your mother, your brother, your sister

334
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live?

335
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And the answer, obviously, is not.

336
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
So, it was done on this group of patients.

337
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here,

338
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and the drug went to the FDA,

339
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
and the FDA said, "Without a placebo,

340
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?"

341
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
So the morning the FDA was going to meet,

342
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.

343
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
(Laughter)

344
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And so, what do you know, that drug was approved.

345
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial,

346
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
where they gave half placebo and half the drug.

347
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And we learned something important there.

348
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada,

349
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
where it's "more ethical to give placebos."

350
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval,

351
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
so I think there were three U.S. patients

352
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
in upstate New York who were part of the trial.

353
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
But they did that, and what they found

354
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
is that 70 percent of the non-responders

355
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.

356
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
So it challenged everything we knew in cancer,

357
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
is that you don't need to get a response.

358
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
You don't need to shrink the disease.

359
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
If we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit

360
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
on patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel,

361
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
than if we shrink the disease.

362
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
The problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today

363
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver,

364
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters,

365
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
did that drug help you or not?

366
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
How do I know?

367
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
Would it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug

368
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
with no benefit and significant cost?

369
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
So, it's a fundamental problem.

370
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
And, again, that's where these new technologies can come in.

371
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
And so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office --

372
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
well, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right?

373
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening.

374
0:20:15.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
That is the most effective, cost-effective,

375
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
best way we can do things today.

376
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
But if one is unfortunate to get a disease,

377
0:20:23.26,000 --> 0:20:26,000
you'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood,

378
0:20:26.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
and we will start to know how to treat your disease.

379
0:20:31.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics,

380
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
again, this looking at the system.

381
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
It's taking a big picture.

382
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
The problem with technologies like this is

383
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:43,000
that if one looks at proteins in the body,

384
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:46,000
there are 11 orders of magnitude difference

385
0:20:46.26,000 --> 0:20:49,000
between the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins.

386
0:20:49.26,000 --> 0:20:54,000
So, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.

387
0:20:54.26,000 --> 0:20:59,000
And so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others

388
0:20:59.26,000 --> 0:21:03,000
is to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software.

389
0:21:03.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
We can start to look at different components along this spectrum.

390
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:13,000
And so, earlier was talked about cross-discipline, about collaboration.

391
0:21:13.26,000 --> 0:21:16,000
And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now

392
0:21:16.26,000 --> 0:21:19,000
is that people from those fields are coming in.

393
0:21:19.26,000 --> 0:21:22,000
Yesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program

394
0:21:22.26,000 --> 0:21:25,000
called the Physical Sciences and Oncology,

395
0:21:25.26,000 --> 0:21:29,000
where physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer,

396
0:21:29.26,000 --> 0:21:32,000
people who never approached it before.

397
0:21:32.26,000 --> 0:21:35,000
Danny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday,

398
0:21:35.26,000 --> 0:21:37,000
to try to attach this problem.

399
0:21:37.26,000 --> 0:21:41,000
A whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy

400
0:21:41.26,000 --> 0:21:43,000
by different mechanisms,

401
0:21:43.26,000 --> 0:21:49,000
to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body.

402
0:21:49.26,000 --> 0:21:53,000
So, just for two seconds, how these technologies work --

403
0:21:53.26,000 --> 0:21:56,000
because I think it's important to understand it.

404
0:21:56.26,000 --> 0:21:59,000
What happens is every protein in your body is charged,

405
0:21:59.26,000 --> 0:22:03,000
so the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,

406
0:22:03.26,000 --> 0:22:05,000
and then there's a detector at the end.

407
0:22:05.26,000 --> 0:22:1,000
When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.

408
0:22:10.26,000 --> 0:22:13,000
And so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough,

409
0:22:13.26,000 --> 0:22:15,000
and your resolution is high enough --

410
0:22:15.26,000 --> 0:22:18,000
you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body

411
0:22:18.26,000 --> 0:22:22,000
and start to get an understanding of the individual system.

412
0:22:22.26,000 --> 0:22:24,000
And so, as a cancer doctor,

413
0:22:24.26,000 --> 0:22:29,000
instead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick,

414
0:22:29.26,000 --> 0:22:33,000
this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices,

415
0:22:33.26,000 --> 0:22:36,000
where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.

416
0:22:36.26,000 --> 0:22:4,000
Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease.

417
0:22:40.26,000 --> 0:22:44,000
And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter

418
0:22:44.26,000 --> 0:22:49,000
and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter,

419
0:22:49.26,000 --> 0:22:51,000
without fundamental learning.

420
0:22:51.26,000 --> 0:22:57,000
So, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking.

421
0:22:57.26,000 --> 0:23:01,000
We need to start to think differently and radically.

422
0:23:01.26,000 --> 0:23:05,000
And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.

423
0:23:05.26,000 --> 0:23:08,000
Tell them to me or anyone else in our field,

424
0:23:08.26,000 --> 0:23:11,000
because over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.

425
0:23:11.26,000 --> 0:23:14,000
We need a radically different approach.

426
0:23:14.26,000 --> 0:23:17,000
You know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel --

427
0:23:17.26,000 --> 0:23:2,000
and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.

428
0:23:20.26,000 --> 0:23:22,000
When Andy stepped down, he said,

429
0:23:22.26,000 --> 0:23:25,000
"No technology will win. Technology itself will win."

430
0:23:25.26,000 --> 0:23:29,000
And I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,

431
0:23:29.26,000 --> 0:23:32,000
that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies

432
0:23:32.26,000 --> 0:23:34,000
that will help us move forward

433
0:23:34.26,000 --> 0:23:36,000
and hopefully help patients in the near-term.

434
0:23:36.26,000 --> 0:23:38,000
Thank you very much.

2
0:00:12.697,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was invited to give this talk a couple of months ago,

3
0:00:17.383,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we discussed a number of titles with the organizers,

4
0:00:20.893,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and a lot of different items were kicked around and were discussed.

5
0:00:24.308,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But nobody suggested this one,

6
0:00:26.349,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and the reason for that was two months ago,

7
0:00:29.278,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Ebola was escalating exponentially

8
0:00:32.19,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen,

9
0:00:36.553,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the world was terrified, concerned and alarmed

10
0:00:39.822,000 --> 0:00:43,000
by this disease, in a way we've not seen in recent history.

11
0:00:44.79,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But today, I can stand here and I can talk to you about beating Ebola

12
0:00:50.96,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because of people whom you've never heard of,

13
0:00:54.656,000 --> 0:01:01,000
people like Peter Clement, a Liberian doctor who's working in Lofa County,

14
0:01:01.815,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a place that many of you have never heard of, probably, in Liberia.

15
0:01:07.294,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The reason that Lofa County is so important

16
0:01:09.684,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is because about five months ago,

17
0:01:12.115,000 --> 0:01:16,000
when the epidemic was just starting to escalate,

18
0:01:16.533,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Lofa County was right at the center, the epicenter of this epidemic.

19
0:01:21.477,000 --> 0:01:24,000
At that time, MSF and the treatment center there,

20
0:01:25.222,000 --> 0:01:27,000
they were seeing dozens of patients every single day,

21
0:01:28.097,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and these patients, these communities were becoming more and more terrified

22
0:01:32.345,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as time went by, with this disease and what it was doing to their families,

23
0:01:36.713,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to their communities, to their children, to their relatives.

24
0:01:40.329,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And so Peter Clement was charged with driving that 12-hour-long rough road

25
0:01:45.092,000 --> 0:01:49,000
from Monrovia, the capital, up to Lofa County,

26
0:01:49.339,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there.

27
0:01:53.701,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you.

28
0:01:59.063,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So he sat down with the local chiefs, and he listened.

29
0:02:03.304,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And what he heard was heartbreaking.

30
0:02:06.945,000 --> 0:02:1,000
He heard about the devastation and the desperation

31
0:02:11.279,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of people affected by this disease.

32
0:02:14.578,000 --> 0:02:16,000
He heard the heartbreaking stories

33
0:02:16.656,000 --> 0:02:19,000
about not just the damage that Ebola did to people,

34
0:02:20.103,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but what it did to families and what it did to communities.

35
0:02:24.589,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him --

36
0:02:28.999,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They said, "When our children are sick, when our children are dying,

37
0:02:32.443,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we can't hold them at a time when we want to be closest to them.

38
0:02:36.247,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When our relatives die, we can't take care of them as our tradition demands.

39
0:02:40.937,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We are not allowed to wash the bodies to bury them

40
0:02:43.617,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the way our communities and our rituals demand.

41
0:02:46.801,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And for this reason, they were deeply disturbed, deeply alarmed

42
0:02:50.208,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them.

43
0:02:53.995,000 --> 0:02:55,000
People were turning on the healthcare workers who had come,

44
0:02:56.911,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the heroes who had come to try and help save the community,

45
0:03:00.265,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to help work with the community, and they were unable to access them.

46
0:03:05.184,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And what happened then was Peter explained to the leaders.

47
0:03:10.402,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The leaders listened. They turned the tables.

48
0:03:13.137,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And Peter explained what Ebola was. He explained what the disease was.

49
0:03:16.744,000 --> 0:03:18,000
He explained what it did to their communities.

50
0:03:19.019,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And he explained that Ebola threatened everything that made us human.

51
0:03:24.177,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Ebola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation.

52
0:03:28.563,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You can't bury your dead the way that you would.

53
0:03:30.873,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You have to trust these people in these space suits to do that for you.

54
0:03:35.516,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And ladies and gentlemen, what happened then was rather extraordinary:

55
0:03:38.865,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The community and the health workers, Peter, they sat down together

56
0:03:42.111,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they put together a new plan for controlling Ebola in Lofa County.

57
0:03:47.168,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And the reason that this is such an important story, ladies and gentlemen,

58
0:03:51.642,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is because today, this county, which is right at the center of this epidemic

59
0:03:56.736,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you've been watching, you've been seeing in the newspapers,

60
0:03:59.563,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you've been seeing on the television screens,

61
0:04:03.306,000 --> 0:04:09,000
today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola.

62
0:04:09.393,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Applause)

63
0:04:16.449,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now, this doesn't mean that the job is done, obviously.

64
0:04:19.872,000 --> 0:04:22,000
There's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there.

65
0:04:23.128,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But what it does teach us is that Ebola can be beaten.

66
0:04:26.392,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That's the key thing.

67
0:04:28.049,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Even on this scale,

68
0:04:29.216,000 --> 0:04:32,000
even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here,

69
0:04:33.113,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we now know Ebola can be beaten.

70
0:04:36.571,000 --> 0:04:39,000
When communities come together with health care workers, work together,

71
0:04:40.562,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that's when this disease can be stopped.

72
0:04:43.235,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place?

73
0:04:46.885,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Well, for that, we have to go back 12 months, to the start of this epidemic.

74
0:04:51.577,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And as many of you know, this virus went undetected,

75
0:04:54.828,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it evaded detection for three or four months when it began.

76
0:04:58.803,000 --> 0:05:,000
That's because this is not a disease of West Africa,

77
0:05:01.466,000 --> 0:05:04,000
it's a disease of Central Africa, half a continent away.

78
0:05:04.611,000 --> 0:05:05,000
People hadn't seen the disease before;

79
0:05:06.547,000 --> 0:05:08,000
health workers hadn't seen the disease before.

80
0:05:09.156,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They didn't know what they were dealing with,

81
0:05:11.324,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and to make it even more complicated,

82
0:05:13.383,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the virus itself was causing a symptom, a type of a presentation

83
0:05:17.951,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that wasn't classical of the disease.

84
0:05:20.216,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So people didn't even recognize the disease, people who knew Ebola.

85
0:05:24.631,000 --> 0:05:27,000
For that reason it evaded detection for some time,

86
0:05:28.49,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But contrary to public belief sometimes these days,

87
0:05:31.66,000 --> 0:05:36,000
once the virus was detected, there was a rapid surge in of support.

88
0:05:37.175,000 --> 0:05:42,000
MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment center, as many of you know, in the area.

89
0:05:42.236,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The World Health Organization and the partners that it works with

90
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
deployed eventually hundreds of people over the next two months

91
0:05:49.005,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to be able to help track the virus.

92
0:05:51.393,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is by then, this virus,

93
0:05:55.424,000 --> 0:05:58,000
well known now as Ebola, had spread too far.

94
0:05:58.977,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It had already outstripped what was one of the largest responses

95
0:06:02.186,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak.

96
0:06:05.995,000 --> 0:06:07,000
By the middle of the year, not just Guinea

97
0:06:08.403,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected.

98
0:06:12.366,000 --> 0:06:16,000
As the virus was spreading geographically, the numbers were increasing

99
0:06:17.233,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and at this time, not only were hundreds of people infected

100
0:06:22.289,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and dying of the disease,

101
0:06:24.168,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but as importantly, the front line responders,

102
0:06:26.907,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the people who had gone to try and help,

103
0:06:29.75,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the health care workers, the other responders

104
0:06:32.892,000 --> 0:06:34,000
were also sick and dying by the dozens.

105
0:06:35.934,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The presidents of these countries recognized the emergencies.

106
0:06:38.882,000 --> 0:06:41,000
They met right around that time, they agreed on common action

107
0:06:42.422,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and they put together an emergency joint operation center in Conakry

108
0:06:46.64,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped,

109
0:06:50.96,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to implement the strategies we talked about.

110
0:06:54.242,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But what happened then was something we had never seen before with Ebola.

111
0:06:58.199,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What happened then was the virus, or someone sick with the virus,

112
0:07:01.785,000 --> 0:07:04,000
boarded an airplane, flew to another country,

113
0:07:05.181,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and for the first time, we saw in another distant country

114
0:07:09.323,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the virus pop up again.

115
0:07:11.879,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This time it was in Nigeria, in the teeming metropolis of Lagos,

116
0:07:16.286,000 --> 0:07:17,000
21 million people.

117
0:07:18.245,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Now the virus was in that environment.

118
0:07:21.228,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And as you can anticipate, there was international alarm,

119
0:07:24.768,000 --> 0:07:27,000
international concern on a scale that we hadn't seen in recent years

120
0:07:28.536,000 --> 0:07:3,000
caused by a disease like this.

121
0:07:30.99,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The World Health Organization immediately called together an expert panel,

122
0:07:35.63,000 --> 0:07:38,000
looked at the situation, declared an international emergency.

123
0:07:39.256,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And in doing so, the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring

124
0:07:44.346,000 --> 0:07:46,000
of international assistance to help these countries

125
0:07:47.316,000 --> 0:07:5,000
which were in so much trouble and concern at that time.

126
0:07:51.364,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But what we saw was something very different.

127
0:07:54.341,000 --> 0:07:57,000
There was some great response.

128
0:07:57.869,000 --> 0:08:01,000
A number of countries came to assist -- many, many NGOs and others, as you know,

129
0:08:02.63,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but at the same time, the opposite happened in many places.

130
0:08:06.046,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Alarm escalated, and very soon these countries found themselves

131
0:08:10.161,000 --> 0:08:14,000
not receiving the support they needed, but increasingly isolated.

132
0:08:14.556,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What we saw was commercial airlines [stopped] flying into these countries

133
0:08:19.29,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus

134
0:08:21.881,000 --> 0:08:23,000
were no longer allowed to travel.

135
0:08:24.043,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This caused not only problems, obviously, for the countries themselves,

136
0:08:27.971,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but also for the response.

137
0:08:30.093,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Those organizations that were trying to bring people in,

138
0:08:33.055,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to try and help them respond to the outbreak,

139
0:08:35.261,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they could not get people on airplanes,

140
0:08:37.193,000 --> 0:08:4,000
they could not get them into the countries to be able to respond.

141
0:08:40.392,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In that situation, ladies and gentleman,

142
0:08:42.404,000 --> 0:08:45,000
a virus like Ebola takes advantage.

143
0:08:45.639,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And what we saw then was something also we hadn't seen before.

144
0:08:50.577,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Not only did this virus continue in the places

145
0:08:53.733,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where they'd already become infected, but then it started to escalate

146
0:08:57.324,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and we saw the case numbers that you see here,

147
0:08:59.692,000 --> 0:09:02,000
something we'd never seen before on such a scale,

148
0:09:02.746,000 --> 0:09:05,000
an exponential increase of Ebola cases

149
0:09:05.783,000 --> 0:09:09,000
not just in these countries or the areas already infected in these countries

150
0:09:10.024,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but also spreading further and deeper into these countries.

151
0:09:13.883,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Ladies and gentleman, this was one of the most concerning

152
0:09:16.947,000 --> 0:09:2,000
international emergencies in public health we've ever seen.

153
0:09:22.502,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And what happened in these countries then,

154
0:09:24.553,000 --> 0:09:28,000
many of you saw, again, on the television, read about in the newspapers,

155
0:09:28.742,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic.

156
0:09:34.102,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We saw the schools begin to close, markets no longer started,

157
0:09:38.722,000 --> 0:09:41,000
no longer functioned the way that they should in these countries.

158
0:09:42.042,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We saw that misinformation and misperceptions started to spread

159
0:09:46.161,000 --> 0:09:49,000
even faster through the communities, which became even more alarmed

160
0:09:49.645,000 --> 0:09:5,000
about the situation.

161
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
They started to recoil from those people that you saw in those space suits,

162
0:09:54.844,000 --> 0:09:56,000
as they call them, who had come to help them.

163
0:09:57.091,000 --> 0:10:,000
And then the situation deteriorated even further.

164
0:10:00.118,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The countries had to declare a state of emergency.

165
0:10:02.8,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas, and then riots broke out.

166
0:10:08.205,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It was a very, very terrifying situation.

167
0:10:11.975,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Around the world, many people began to ask,

168
0:10:14.834,000 --> 0:10:17,000
can we ever stop Ebola when it starts to spread like this?

169
0:10:18.803,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And they started to ask, how well do we really know this virus?

170
0:10:23.585,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The reality is we don't know Ebola extremely well.

171
0:10:26.74,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it.

172
0:10:30.735,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We've known the disease only for 40 years,

173
0:10:33.02,000 --> 0:10:36,000
since it first popped up in Central Africa in 1976.

174
0:10:36.502,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But despite that, we do know many things:

175
0:10:39.582,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat.

176
0:10:43.805,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We know that it probably enters a human population

177
0:10:46.921,000 --> 0:10:48,000
when we come in contact with a wild animal

178
0:10:49.528,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that has been infected with the virus and probably sickened by it.

179
0:10:53.086,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Then we know that the virus spreads from person to person

180
0:10:56.307,000 --> 0:10:58,000
through contaminated body fluids.

181
0:10:58.58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And as you've all seen,

182
0:11:00.071,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans,

183
0:11:03.553,000 --> 0:11:07,000
where we see this disease cause severe fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,

184
0:11:08.071,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and then unfortunately, in 70 percent of the cases or often more, death.

185
0:11:14.541,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is a very dangerous, debilitating, and deadly disease.

186
0:11:20.344,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time,

187
0:11:24.517,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and we don't know everything about it, we do know how to stop this disease.

188
0:11:29.394,000 --> 0:11:32,000
There are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola.

189
0:11:32.608,000 --> 0:11:36,000
First and foremost, the communities have got to understand this disease,

190
0:11:36.922,000 --> 0:11:39,000
they've got to understand how it spreads and how to stop it.

191
0:11:40.443,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And then we've got to be able to have systems that can find every single case,

192
0:11:44.519,000 --> 0:11:46,000
every contact of those cases,

193
0:11:46.525,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission.

194
0:11:50.682,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We have to have treatment centers, specialized Ebola treatment centers,

195
0:11:54.304,000 --> 0:11:56,000
where the workers can be protected

196
0:11:56.817,000 --> 0:12:,000
as they try to provide support to the people who are infected,

197
0:12:01.689,000 --> 0:12:03,000
so that they might survive the disease.

198
0:12:04.134,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And then for those who do die,

199
0:12:06.334,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we have to ensure there is a safe, but at the same time dignified, burial process,

200
0:12:12.192,000 --> 0:12:15,000
so that there is no spread at that time as well.

201
0:12:16.798,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So we do know how to stop Ebola, and these strategies work, ladies and gentlemen.

202
0:12:21.299,000 --> 0:12:25,000
The virus was stopped in Nigeria by these four strategies

203
0:12:25.458,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and the people implementing them, obviously.

204
0:12:27.562,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It was stopped in Senegal, where it had spread, and also in the other countries

205
0:12:31.584,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that were affected by this virus, in this outbreak.

206
0:12:35.177,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So there's no question that these strategies actually work.

207
0:12:39.018,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The big question, ladies and gentlemen, was whether these strategies could work

208
0:12:44.326,000 --> 0:12:48,000
on this scale, in this situation, with so many countries affected

209
0:12:48.6,000 --> 0:12:51,000
with the kind of exponential growth that you saw.

210
0:12:52.206,000 --> 0:12:56,000
That was the big question that we were facing just two or three months ago.

211
0:12:56.757,000 --> 0:13:,000
Today we know the answer to that question.

212
0:13:00.801,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And we know that answer because of the extraordinary work

213
0:13:03.779,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of an incredible group of NGOs, of governments, of local leaders,

214
0:13:08.546,000 --> 0:13:12,000
of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian and other organizations

215
0:13:12.932,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa.

216
0:13:16.85,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But what had to be done there was slightly different.

217
0:13:20.293,000 --> 0:13:22,000
These countries took those strategies I just showed you;

218
0:13:23.218,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the community engagement, the case finding, contact tracing, etc.,

219
0:13:28.624,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and they turned them on their head.

220
0:13:30.548,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There was so much disease, they approached it differently.

221
0:13:33.481,000 --> 0:13:38,000
What they decided to do was they would first try and slow down this epidemic

222
0:13:38.912,000 --> 0:13:42,000
by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers

223
0:13:43.899,000 --> 0:13:48,000
so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected.

224
0:13:49.203,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They would rapidly build out many, many burial teams

225
0:13:51.652,000 --> 0:13:53,000
so that they could safely deal with the dead,

226
0:13:53.827,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and with that, they would try and slow this outbreak

227
0:13:56.394,000 --> 0:14:,000
to see if it could actually then be controlled using the classic approach

228
0:14:00.613,000 --> 0:14:02,000
of case finding and contact tracing.

229
0:14:03.364,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And when I went to West Africa about three months ago,

230
0:14:06.657,000 --> 0:14:09,000
when I was there what I saw was extraordinary.

231
0:14:09.669,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola

232
0:14:14.595,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so that they could personally coordinate and oversee and champion

233
0:14:18.363,000 --> 0:14:22,000
this surge of international support to try and stop this disease.

234
0:14:22.45,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We saw militaries from within those countries and from far beyond

235
0:14:26.001,000 --> 0:14:28,000
coming in to help build Ebola treatment centers

236
0:14:28.741,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that could be used to isolate those who were sick.

237
0:14:31.991,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there

238
0:14:36.417,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead

239
0:14:41.574,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in a dignified manner themselves.

240
0:14:44.132,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And we saw the U.N. agencies, the World Food Program,

241
0:14:46.933,000 --> 0:14:47,000
build a tremendous air bridge

242
0:14:48.834,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly

243
0:14:52.736,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about.

244
0:14:56.089,000 --> 0:14:59,000
What we saw, ladies and gentlemen, which was probably most impressive,

245
0:14:59.434,000 --> 0:15:02,000
was this incredible work by the governments,

246
0:15:02.451,000 --> 0:15:05,000
by the leaders in these countries, with the communities,

247
0:15:05.468,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to try to ensure people understood this disease,

248
0:15:08.486,000 --> 0:15:13,000
understood the extraordinary things they would have to do to try and stop Ebola.

249
0:15:14.169,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And as a result, ladies and gentlemen,

250
0:15:16.462,000 --> 0:15:2,000
we saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier,

251
0:15:20.905,000 --> 0:15:22,000
whether or not it would be possible.

252
0:15:23.179,000 --> 0:15:26,000
What we saw was what you see now in this graph,

253
0:15:26.309,000 --> 0:15:28,000
when we took stock on December 1.

254
0:15:29.118,000 --> 0:15:32,000
What we saw was we could bend that curve, so to speak,

255
0:15:32.56,000 --> 0:15:34,000
change this exponential growth,

256
0:15:34.934,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak.

257
0:15:39.163,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And for this reason, ladies and gentlemen, there's absolutely no question now

258
0:15:43.217,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that we can catch up with this outbreak in West Africa and we can beat Ebola.

259
0:15:49.785,000 --> 0:15:52,000
The big question, though, that many people are asking,

260
0:15:52.958,000 --> 0:15:53,000
even when they saw this curve, they said,

261
0:15:54.941,000 --> 0:15:56,000
"Well, hang on a minute -- that's great you can slow it down,

262
0:15:57.845,000 --> 0:15:59,000
but can you actually drive it down to zero?"

263
0:15:59.896,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We already answered that question back at the beginning of this talk,

264
0:16:03.437,000 --> 0:16:07,000
when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.

265
0:16:07.59,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation

266
0:16:11.016,000 --> 0:16:13,000
where they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks.

267
0:16:13.829,000 --> 0:16:16,000
But there are similar stories from the other countries as well.

268
0:16:17.205,000 --> 0:16:19,000
From Gueckedou in Guinea,

269
0:16:19.451,000 --> 0:16:23,000
the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed.

270
0:16:23.959,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We've seen very, very few cases in the last couple of months,

271
0:16:27.373,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and here in Kenema, in Sierra Leone, another area in the epicenter,

272
0:16:31.8,000 --> 0:16:34,000
we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks --

273
0:16:35.061,000 --> 0:16:38,000
way too early to declare victory, obviously,

274
0:16:38.156,000 --> 0:16:39,000
but evidence, ladies and gentlemen,

275
0:16:39.931,000 --> 0:16:42,000
not only can the response catch up to the disease,

276
0:16:43.556,000 --> 0:16:46,000
but this disease can be driven to zero.

277
0:16:46.722,000 --> 0:16:5,000
The challenge now, of course, is doing this on the scale needed

278
0:16:50.878,000 --> 0:16:55,000
right across these three countries, and that is a huge challenge.

279
0:16:56.244,000 --> 0:17:,000
Because when you've been at something for this long, on this scale,

280
0:17:00.949,000 --> 0:17:04,000
two other big threats come in to join the virus.

281
0:17:04.949,000 --> 0:17:07,000
The first of those is complacency,

282
0:17:08.052,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the risk that as this disease curve starts to bend,

283
0:17:11.475,000 --> 0:17:14,000
the media look elsewhere, the world looks elsewhere.

284
0:17:14.739,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Complacency always a risk.

285
0:17:16.371,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And the other risk, of course, is when you've been working so hard for so long,

286
0:17:20.714,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and slept so few hours over the past months,

287
0:17:24.352,000 --> 0:17:26,000
people are tired, people become fatigued,

288
0:17:26.59,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and these new risks start to creep into the response.

289
0:17:30.66,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa.

290
0:17:34.94,000 --> 0:17:37,000
The people of these countries, the leaders of these countries,

291
0:17:38.64,000 --> 0:17:39,000
they are not complacent.

292
0:17:40.136,000 --> 0:17:43,000
They want to drive Ebola to zero in their countries.

293
0:17:43.879,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And these people, yes, they're tired, but they are not fatigued.

294
0:17:47.664,000 --> 0:17:49,000
They have an energy, they have a courage,

295
0:17:49.869,000 --> 0:17:51,000
they have the strength to get this finished.

296
0:17:52.399,000 --> 0:17:54,000
What they need, ladies and gentlemen, at this point,

297
0:17:55.153,000 --> 0:17:58,000
is the unwavering support of the international community,

298
0:17:58.781,000 --> 0:17:59,000
to stand with them,

299
0:18:00.189,000 --> 0:18:04,000
to bolster and bring even more support at this time, to get the job finished.

300
0:18:05.047,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Because finishing Ebola right now means turning the tables on this virus,

301
0:18:10.082,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and beginning to hunt it.

302
0:18:11.817,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Remember, this virus, this whole crisis, rather, started with one case,

303
0:18:17.004,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and is going to finish with one case.

304
0:18:19.703,000 --> 0:18:23,000
But it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists,

305
0:18:24.027,000 --> 0:18:28,000
enough health workers, enough logisticians and enough other people working with them

306
0:18:28.644,000 --> 0:18:31,000
to be able to find every one of those cases, track their contacts

307
0:18:32.126,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and make sure that this disease stops once and for all.

308
0:18:36.22,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Ladies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.

309
0:18:39.557,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen

310
0:18:44.245,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and educate them on what it means to beat Ebola,

311
0:18:47.457,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and more importantly, we need you to advocate with the people

312
0:18:51.189,000 --> 0:18:54,000
who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries,

313
0:18:54.743,000 --> 0:18:55,000
to beat this disease.

314
0:18:56.517,000 --> 0:19:,000
There are a lot of people out there who will survive and will thrive,

315
0:19:00.699,000 --> 0:19:03,000
in part because of what you do to help us beat Ebola.

316
0:19:04.101,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Thank you.

317
0:19:05.587,000 --> 0:19:08,000
(Applause)

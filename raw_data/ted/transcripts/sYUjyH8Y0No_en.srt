0:00:15.992,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.

3
0:00:21.161,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It was run by the great and powerful parents,

4
0:00:24.592,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and the people were helpless

5
0:00:26.927,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and hopeless naughty children.

6
0:00:29.423,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If any of the more rowdier children questioned

7
0:00:31.926,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the authority of the parents, they were scolded.

8
0:00:35.503,000 --> 0:00:38,000
If they went exploring into the parents' rooms,

9
0:00:38.536,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished,

10
0:00:42.319,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and told that for their own good

11
0:00:45.072,000 --> 0:00:48,000
they must never go in there again.

12
0:00:48.703,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Then one day, a man came to town

13
0:00:51.199,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with boxes and boxes of secret documents

14
0:00:53.997,000 --> 0:00:54,000
stolen from the parents' rooms.

15
0:00:55.861,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"Look what they've been hiding from you," he said.

16
0:00:59.887,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The children looked and were amazed.

17
0:01:02.929,000 --> 0:01:04,000
There were maps and minutes from meetings

18
0:01:05.773,000 --> 0:01:08,000
where the parents were slagging each other off.

19
0:01:09.038,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They behaved just like the children.

20
0:01:11.586,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And they made mistakes, too, just like the children.

21
0:01:15.544,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The only difference was, their mistakes

22
0:01:18.255,000 --> 0:01:2,000
were in the secret filing cabinets.

23
0:01:21.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think

24
0:01:23.885,000 --> 0:01:25,000
they should be in the secret filing cabinets,

25
0:01:26.752,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or if they were, there ought to be a law

26
0:01:28.652,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to allow the children access.

27
0:01:30.769,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And so she set about to make it so.

28
0:01:34.576,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents

29
0:01:38.422,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that I was interested in were located in this building,

30
0:01:41.576,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the British Parliament, and the data that I wanted

31
0:01:45.938,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to get my hands on were the expense receipts

32
0:01:48.599,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of members of Parliament.

33
0:01:52.488,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy. (Applause)

34
0:01:58.727,000 --> 0:02:,000
It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker,

35
0:02:01.634,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got

36
0:02:04.487,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from this Freedom of Information request,

37
0:02:07.01,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you would have thought I'd asked something like this.

38
0:02:10.254,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So I fought for about five years doing this,

39
0:02:14.479,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made,

40
0:02:17.951,000 --> 0:02:19,000
not -- I didn't -- Hey, look, I didn't set out, honestly,

41
0:02:20.904,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to revolutionize the British Parliament.

42
0:02:22.553,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests

43
0:02:25.984,000 --> 0:02:28,000
as part of research for my first book.

44
0:02:29.135,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle

45
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament

46
0:02:36.375,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges

47
0:02:39.415,000 --> 0:02:43,000
waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.

48
0:02:43.567,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful,

49
0:02:45.675,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because I'd seen the establishment. I thought,

50
0:02:48.4,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it always sticks together. I am out of luck.

51
0:02:51.756,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Well, guess what? I won. Hooray. (Applause)

52
0:02:56.342,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Well, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was

53
0:02:59.765,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data,

54
0:03:03.119,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and then they tried to retrospectively change the law

55
0:03:06.279,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so that it would no longer apply to them.

56
0:03:08.952,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else,

57
0:03:11.874,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them.

58
0:03:14.67,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What they hadn't counted on was digitization,

59
0:03:18.165,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because that meant that all those paper receipts

60
0:03:20.551,000 --> 0:03:23,000
had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy

61
0:03:23.791,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for somebody to just copy that entire database,

62
0:03:26.99,000 --> 0:03:29,000
put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament,

63
0:03:30.924,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which they did, and then they shopped that disk

64
0:03:33.409,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph,

65
0:03:36.367,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks

66
0:03:39.574,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of revelations, everything from porn movies

67
0:03:42.599,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and bath plugs and new kitchens

68
0:03:45.755,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and mortgages that had never been paid off.

69
0:03:49.216,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The end result was six ministers resigned,

70
0:03:53.903,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign,

71
0:03:57.954,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency,

72
0:04:01.973,000 --> 0:04:04,000
120 MPs stepped down at that election,

73
0:04:05.756,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and so far, four MPs and two lords

74
0:04:10.247,000 --> 0:04:13,000
have done jail time for fraud.

75
0:04:13.277,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So, thank you. (Applause)

76
0:04:19.655,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.

77
0:04:23.93,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It was an example of a culture clash that's happening

78
0:04:27.271,000 --> 0:04:3,000
all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged

79
0:04:30.591,000 --> 0:04:34,000
officials who think that they can rule over us

80
0:04:34.695,000 --> 0:04:35,000
without very much prying from the public,

81
0:04:36.603,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and then suddenly confronted with a public

82
0:04:39.056,000 --> 0:04:42,000
who is no longer content with that arrangement,

83
0:04:42.494,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and not only not content with it, now, more often,

84
0:04:45.732,000 --> 0:04:49,000
armed with official data itself.

85
0:04:50.106,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So we are moving to this democratization of information,

86
0:04:55.244,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I've been in this field for quite a while.

87
0:04:57.891,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid,

88
0:05:00.532,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like,

89
0:05:02.467,000 --> 0:05:04,000
see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.

90
0:05:05.093,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I think that was a pretty good indication

91
0:05:07.299,000 --> 0:05:1,000
about my future career as an investigative journalist,

92
0:05:10.38,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long

93
0:05:14.9,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is that it used to be quite a niche interest,

94
0:05:17.676,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world,

95
0:05:20.827,000 --> 0:05:23,000
wants to know about what people in power are doing.

96
0:05:23.995,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They want a say in decisions that are made in their name

97
0:05:27.403,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and with their money. It's this democratization of information

98
0:05:30.426,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that I think is an information enlightenment,

99
0:05:33.132,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.

100
0:05:36.595,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's about searching for the truth,

101
0:05:39.59,000 --> 0:05:43,000
not because somebody says it's true, "because I say so."

102
0:05:43.787,000 --> 0:05:45,000
No, it's about trying to find the truth based on

103
0:05:46.261,000 --> 0:05:48,000
what you can see and what can be tested.

104
0:05:48.89,000 --> 0:05:5,000
That, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about

105
0:05:51.558,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people,

106
0:05:55.067,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or that women should be subordinate to men,

107
0:05:57.244,000 --> 0:05:59,000
or that the Church was the official word of God.

108
0:05:59.947,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this,

109
0:06:02.383,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and they tried to suppress it,

110
0:06:04.484,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but what they hadn't counted on was technology,

111
0:06:07.555,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and then they had the printing press, which suddenly

112
0:06:09.98,000 --> 0:06:12,000
enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast,

113
0:06:13.372,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and people would come together in coffee houses,

114
0:06:16.212,000 --> 0:06:18,000
discuss the ideas, plot revolution.

115
0:06:19.028,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information,

116
0:06:23.619,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information.

117
0:06:27.024,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.

118
0:06:31.261,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system,

119
0:06:36.363,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and we have global decisions to make in this system,

120
0:06:39.236,000 --> 0:06:42,000
decisions about climate, about finance systems,

121
0:06:42.922,000 --> 0:06:45,000
about resources. And think about it --

122
0:06:46.263,000 --> 0:06:48,000
if we want to make an important decision about buying a house,

123
0:06:48.725,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you,

124
0:06:51.239,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.

125
0:06:54.583,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And if we're thinking about a finance system,

126
0:06:56.938,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible

127
0:07:00.582,000 --> 0:07:03,000
for one person to take in the amount, the volume

128
0:07:04.543,000 --> 0:07:07,000
of information, and analyze it to make good decisions.

129
0:07:08.309,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand

130
0:07:11.335,000 --> 0:07:13,000
for access to information.

131
0:07:13.72,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws

132
0:07:16.029,000 --> 0:07:17,000
come out, so for example, on the environment,

133
0:07:18.005,000 --> 0:07:19,000
there's the Aarhus Convention,

134
0:07:19.721,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which is a European directive that gives people

135
0:07:21.749,000 --> 0:07:23,000
a very strong right to know, so if your water company

136
0:07:24.497,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is dumping water into your river, sewage water

137
0:07:27.867,000 --> 0:07:3,000
into your river, you have a right to know about it.

138
0:07:30.915,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In the finance industry, you now have more of a right

139
0:07:34.794,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to know about what's going on, so we have

140
0:07:37.347,000 --> 0:07:39,000
different anti-bribery laws, money regulations,

141
0:07:40.3,000 --> 0:07:44,000
increased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.

142
0:07:44.373,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance,

143
0:07:49.617,000 --> 0:07:52,000
pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out

144
0:07:52.752,000 --> 0:07:54,000
more and more about these systems.

145
0:07:55.471,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And they're all moving to this central system,

146
0:07:58.263,000 --> 0:08:,000
this fully connected system,

147
0:08:00.63,000 --> 0:08:03,000
all of them except one. Can you guess which one?

148
0:08:03.837,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's the system which underpins all these other systems.

149
0:08:06.508,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's the system by which we organize and exercise power,

150
0:08:10.666,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and there I'm talking about politics, because in politics,

151
0:08:13.596,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we're back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.

152
0:08:17.723,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And how is it possible that the volume of information

153
0:08:20.804,000 --> 0:08:22,000
can be processed that needs to in this system?

154
0:08:23.615,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Well, it just can't. That's it.

155
0:08:26.231,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis

156
0:08:28.938,000 --> 0:08:32,000
of legitimacy in our different governments right now.

157
0:08:33.261,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So I've told you a bit about what I did

158
0:08:35.444,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming,

159
0:08:38.129,000 --> 0:08:4,000
into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you

160
0:08:40.644,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a couple of examples of what a few other people I know

161
0:08:43.308,000 --> 0:08:44,000
are doing.

162
0:08:44.528,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer

163
0:08:47.747,000 --> 0:08:5,000
programmer, and he built a site called Alaveteli,

164
0:08:51.705,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.

165
0:08:56.475,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you

166
0:08:59.45,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to make a Freedom of Information request,

167
0:09:02.553,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to ask your public body a question, so

168
0:09:05.522,000 --> 0:09:08,000
it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you

169
0:09:08.642,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that there is a lot of hassle making these requests,

170
0:09:10.73,000 --> 0:09:13,000
so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question,

171
0:09:14.274,000 --> 0:09:18,000
for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?

172
0:09:18.745,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you

173
0:09:22.586,000 --> 0:09:25,000
when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all

174
0:09:26.074,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the correspondence, it posts it up there,

175
0:09:27.726,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.

176
0:09:31.381,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So that's open-source and it can be used in any country

177
0:09:34.954,000 --> 0:09:36,000
where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.

178
0:09:37.865,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So there's a list there of the different countries that have it,

179
0:09:41.075,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and then there's a few more coming on board.

180
0:09:42.87,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So if any of you out there like the sound of that

181
0:09:45.43,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and have a law like that in your country,

182
0:09:48.163,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I know that Seb would love to hear from you

183
0:09:50.202,000 --> 0:09:54,000
about collaborating and getting that into your country.

184
0:09:54.274,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP.

185
0:09:58.569,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was

186
0:10:02.403,000 --> 0:10:05,000
one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament

187
0:10:05.72,000 --> 0:10:08,000
when the country's economy collapsed,

188
0:10:09.466,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and then she was elected on a reform mandate,

189
0:10:13.36,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and she's now spearheading this project.

190
0:10:15.727,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,

191
0:10:18.614,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and they've just got funding to make it an international

192
0:10:20.879,000 --> 0:10:23,000
modern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws

193
0:10:24.318,000 --> 0:10:26,000
around the world about freedom of expression,

194
0:10:27.254,000 --> 0:10:29,000
protection of whistleblowers, protection from libel,

195
0:10:30.049,000 --> 0:10:34,000
source protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.

196
0:10:34.523,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's a place where your data can be free, so when we think

197
0:10:36.944,000 --> 0:10:39,000
about, increasingly, how governments want to access user data,

198
0:10:40.359,000 --> 0:10:42,000
what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven

199
0:10:43.131,000 --> 0:10:45,000
where it can happen.

200
0:10:45.868,000 --> 0:10:48,000
In my own field of investigative journalism, we're also

201
0:10:49.006,000 --> 0:10:51,000
having to start thinking globally, so this is a site called

202
0:10:51.836,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track

203
0:10:54.959,000 --> 0:10:56,000
a dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak,

204
0:10:57.942,000 --> 0:11:,000
you know, he's just funneling out cash from his country

205
0:11:01.387,000 --> 0:11:03,000
when he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do

206
0:11:03.926,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to investigate that is, you need to have access to

207
0:11:06.322,000 --> 0:11:08,000
all of the world's, as many as you can,

208
0:11:08.621,000 --> 0:11:1,000
companies' house registrations databases.

209
0:11:11.404,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those

210
0:11:15.842,000 --> 0:11:18,000
databases into one place so you can start searching for,

211
0:11:19.097,000 --> 0:11:22,000
you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.

212
0:11:22.765,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You can try and find out how he's moving out assets

213
0:11:25.516,000 --> 0:11:27,000
from that country.

214
0:11:28.242,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But again, when it comes to the decisions which are

215
0:11:31.875,000 --> 0:11:34,000
impacting us the most, perhaps, the most important

216
0:11:34.875,000 --> 0:11:37,000
decisions that are being made about war and so forth,

217
0:11:38.164,000 --> 0:11:4,000
again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request.

218
0:11:41.093,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on

219
0:11:44.201,000 --> 0:11:48,000
illegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.

220
0:11:48.283,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So when the Guardian did this investigation about

221
0:11:51.325,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into

222
0:11:54.475,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the Department of Defense and ask for all the information.

223
0:11:57.939,000 --> 0:11:58,000
You know, they're just not going to get it.

224
0:11:59.881,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches

225
0:12:03.421,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that were written by American soldiers

226
0:12:05.827,000 --> 0:12:07,000
about the Afghan War, and leaked,

227
0:12:08.386,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and then they're able to do this investigation.

228
0:12:12.037,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.

229
0:12:17.605,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Again, this is all based around leaks,

230
0:12:20.105,000 --> 0:12:25,000
251,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and I was involved

231
0:12:25.356,000 --> 0:12:28,000
in this investigation because I got this leak

232
0:12:29.297,000 --> 0:12:32,000
through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker

233
0:12:32.666,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and ended up going to work at the Guardian.

234
0:12:35.435,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access

235
0:12:37.859,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.

236
0:12:39.826,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It reminded me of that scene in "The Wizard of Oz."

237
0:12:43.476,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto

238
0:12:45.964,000 --> 0:12:47,000
runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back,

239
0:12:48.815,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the dog's pulling back the curtain, and --

240
0:12:50.277,000 --> 0:12:53,000
"Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."

241
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It was just like that, because what you started to see

242
0:12:56.396,000 --> 0:12:58,000
is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous

243
0:12:59.347,000 --> 0:13:02,000
politicians, they were just like us.

244
0:13:02.445,000 --> 0:13:04,000
They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy,

245
0:13:05.005,000 --> 0:13:07,000
those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important

246
0:13:07.676,000 --> 0:13:09,000
point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings

247
0:13:10.277,000 --> 0:13:11,000
just like us. They don't have special powers.

248
0:13:12.228,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They're not magic. They are not our parents.

249
0:13:16.051,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Beyond that, what I found most fascinating

250
0:13:20.9,000 --> 0:13:22,000
was the level of endemic corruption that I saw

251
0:13:23.524,000 --> 0:13:26,000
across all different countries, and particularly centered

252
0:13:26.679,000 --> 0:13:28,000
around the heart of power, around public officials

253
0:13:29.507,000 --> 0:13:31,000
who were embezzling the public's money

254
0:13:32.123,000 --> 0:13:35,000
for their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that

255
0:13:35.141,000 --> 0:13:38,000
because of official secrecy.

256
0:13:38.524,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So I've mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be

257
0:13:42.151,000 --> 0:13:44,000
more open than publishing all the material?

258
0:13:44.982,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Because that is what Julian Assange did.

259
0:13:48.053,000 --> 0:13:5,000
He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it

260
0:13:50.621,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.

261
0:13:54.418,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan

262
0:13:58.133,000 --> 0:14:01,000
being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator

263
0:14:01.549,000 --> 0:14:04,000
was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners

264
0:14:05.319,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.

265
0:14:08.805,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Is that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me,

266
0:14:13.277,000 --> 0:14:16,000
what it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power,

267
0:14:16.779,000 --> 0:14:19,000
responsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner

268
0:14:20.533,000 --> 0:14:23,000
with power. It's about sharing responsibility,

269
0:14:23.549,000 --> 0:14:25,000
sharing accountability. Also, the fact that

270
0:14:26.461,000 --> 0:14:28,000
he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks,

271
0:14:28.598,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency

272
0:14:31.283,000 --> 0:14:36,000
in ideology, to be honest, as well. (Laughs)

273
0:14:37.124,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive,

274
0:14:40.458,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and you must have two real qualities, I think,

275
0:14:43.126,000 --> 0:14:45,000
when you come to the table, when you're dealing

276
0:14:45.539,000 --> 0:14:46,000
with power, talking about power,

277
0:14:47.273,000 --> 0:14:49,000
because of its seductive capacity.

278
0:14:49.646,000 --> 0:14:52,000
You've got to have skepticism and humility.

279
0:14:52.665,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Skepticism, because you must always be challenging.

280
0:14:55.258,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I want to see why do you -- you just say so? That's not good enough.

281
0:14:58.29,000 --> 0:15:,000
I want to see the evidence behind why that's so.

282
0:15:01.005,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.

283
0:15:05.498,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And if you don't have skepticism and humility,

284
0:15:08.29,000 --> 0:15:11,000
then it's a really short journey to go from reformer

285
0:15:11.385,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to autocrat, and I think you only have to read "Animal Farm"

286
0:15:15.994,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to get that message about how power corrupts people.

287
0:15:21.937,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody

288
0:15:27.405,000 --> 0:15:3,000
within the rule of law rights to information.

289
0:15:30.872,000 --> 0:15:32,000
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.

290
0:15:33.507,000 --> 0:15:35,000
In a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts,

291
0:15:36.489,000 --> 0:15:38,000
including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act

292
0:15:38.652,000 --> 0:15:41,000
with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime,

293
0:15:41.768,000 --> 0:15:45,000
people are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases,

294
0:15:45.934,000 --> 0:15:49,000
for publishing or giving away official information.

295
0:15:50.137,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Now wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want

296
0:15:53.615,000 --> 0:15:56,000
all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act

297
0:15:57.177,000 --> 0:16:,000
where officials were punished if they were found

298
0:16:00.553,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to have suppressed or hidden information

299
0:16:03.513,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that was in the public interest?

300
0:16:05.698,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So that -- yes. Yes! My power pose. (Applause) (Laughs)

301
0:16:12.598,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I would like us to work towards that.

302
0:16:15.143,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is

303
0:16:19.063,000 --> 0:16:21,000
progress on the line, but I think what we find is that

304
0:16:22.018,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the closer that we get right into the heart of power,

305
0:16:25.194,000 --> 0:16:29,000
the more opaque, closed it becomes.

306
0:16:29.618,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So it was only just the other week that I heard London's

307
0:16:32.698,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why

308
0:16:36.195,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the police need access to all of our communications,

309
0:16:40.787,000 --> 0:16:43,000
spying on us without any judicial oversight,

310
0:16:43.85,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and he said it was a matter of life and death.

311
0:16:45.516,000 --> 0:16:48,000
He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.

312
0:16:48.763,000 --> 0:16:52,000
There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.

313
0:16:52.985,000 --> 0:16:55,000
It was just, "Because I say so.

314
0:16:56.107,000 --> 0:16:59,000
You have to trust me. Take it on faith."

315
0:16:59.355,000 --> 0:17:,000
Well, I'm sorry, people, but we are back

316
0:17:01.354,000 --> 0:17:04,000
to the pre-Enlightenment Church,

317
0:17:05.059,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and we need to fight against that.

318
0:17:08.835,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So he was talking about the law in Britain which is

319
0:17:12.123,000 --> 0:17:16,000
the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.

320
0:17:16.349,000 --> 0:17:19,000
In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.

321
0:17:19.955,000 --> 0:17:22,000
You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.

322
0:17:23.595,000 --> 0:17:25,000
You have the National Security Agency building

323
0:17:26.355,000 --> 0:17:29,000
the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal --

324
0:17:29.883,000 --> 0:17:31,000
it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol,

325
0:17:32.355,000 --> 0:17:33,000
in which they're going to intercept and analyze

326
0:17:34.157,000 --> 0:17:36,000
communications, traffic and personal data

327
0:17:37.106,000 --> 0:17:4,000
to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society.

328
0:17:40.419,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Well, to go back to our original story, the parents

329
0:17:45.219,000 --> 0:17:48,000
have panicked. They've locked all the doors.

330
0:17:49.069,000 --> 0:17:52,000
They've kitted out the house with CCTV cameras.

331
0:17:52.155,000 --> 0:17:54,000
They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement,

332
0:17:54.907,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms

333
0:17:57.571,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and figure out which ones of us are troublesome,

334
0:18:00.243,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and if any of us complain about that, we're arrested for terrorism.

335
0:18:04.477,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?

336
0:18:08.051,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.

337
0:18:11.71,000 --> 0:18:13,000
I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are,

338
0:18:14.457,000 --> 0:18:16,000
indeed, very grim.

339
0:18:16.955,000 --> 0:18:21,000
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal

340
0:18:22.177,000 --> 0:18:24,000
than we want to acknowledge.

341
0:18:24.981,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Equally, it could be better than we've been led to believe,

342
0:18:27.27,000 --> 0:18:3,000
but either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is,

343
0:18:30.981,000 --> 0:18:33,000
with all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it

344
0:18:34.83,000 --> 0:18:36,000
with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them

345
0:18:37.323,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and live in a world in which we can all be

346
0:18:41.394,000 --> 0:18:44,000
happily ever after. (Laughs) Thank you very much.

347
0:18:45.08,000 --> 0:18:48,000
(Applause)

348
0:18:48.315,000 --> 0:18:52,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:13.289,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Let's start with silence.

2
0:00:23.028,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Silence is one of the most precious conditions for humans,

3
0:00:27.537,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because it allows us to feel the depth of our presence.

4
0:00:32.072,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is one of the reasons why the advent of electric cars

5
0:00:35.334,000 --> 0:00:37,000
has generated lots of enthusiasm among people.

6
0:00:38.679,000 --> 0:00:42,000
For the first time, we could associate the concept of cars

7
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
with the experience of silence.

8
0:00:45.824,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Cars can finally be quiet:

9
0:00:48.77,000 --> 0:00:49,000
peace in the streets,

10
0:00:50.247,000 --> 0:00:52,000
a silent revolution in the cities.

11
0:00:56.762,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Hum)

12
0:01:05.659,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But silence can also be a problem.

13
0:01:08.801,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The absence of sound, in fact, when it comes to cars,

14
0:01:12.803,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it can be quite dangerous.

15
0:01:14.907,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Think of blind people,

16
0:01:16.97,000 --> 0:01:18,000
who can't see a car which is approaching.

17
0:01:20.666,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And now, if it's electric, they can't even hear it.

18
0:01:24.038,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Or think of every one of us as we are walking around the city,

19
0:01:27.422,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we are absorbed in our thoughts, and we detach from the surroundings.

20
0:01:32.63,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In these situations, sound can become our precious companion.

21
0:01:38.552,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Sound is one of the most wonderful gifts of our universe.

22
0:01:43.108,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Sound is emotion

23
0:01:45.259,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and sound is sublime,

24
0:01:48.329,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and when it comes to cars, sound is also information.

25
0:01:53.606,000 --> 0:01:54,000
In order to protect pedestrians

26
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and to give acoustic feedback to the drivers,

27
0:01:58.559,000 --> 0:02:02,000
governments around the world have introduced several regulations

28
0:02:02.795,000 --> 0:02:05,000
which prescribe the presence of a sound for electric vehicles.

29
0:02:07.454,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In particular, they require minimum sound levels

30
0:02:11.272,000 --> 0:02:13,000
at specific frequency bands

31
0:02:13.465,000 --> 0:02:15,000
up to the speed of 30 kilometers per hour.

32
0:02:17.798,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Besides this speed,

33
0:02:19.053,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the natural noise of the car is considered as sufficient.

34
0:02:24.999,000 --> 0:02:27,000
These regulations have generated different reactions

35
0:02:28.61,000 --> 0:02:31,000
among those who favor sounds and those who fear the presence

36
0:02:32.611,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of too much noise in the city.

37
0:02:35.739,000 --> 0:02:39,000
However, I don't see it as the noise of the car.

38
0:02:41.792,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I rather see it as the voice of the car.

39
0:02:46.422,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And this is one of my biggest challenges, and privileges, at the same time.

40
0:02:50.954,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I design the voice of electric cars.

41
0:02:55.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We all know how a combustion engine sounds like,

42
0:02:59.303,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and we do actually also know how an electric engine sounds like.

43
0:03:03.276,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Think of the electric tramway.

44
0:03:05.459,000 --> 0:03:06,000
As soon as it moves,

45
0:03:06.697,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it creates this ascending high-frequency pitch sound,

46
0:03:10.52,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which we called "whistling" sound.

47
0:03:13.907,000 --> 0:03:16,000
However, if we would just amplify this sound,

48
0:03:17.273,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we would still not be able to fulfill the legal requirements.

49
0:03:21.083,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That's also why we need to compose new sound.

50
0:03:25.481,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So how do we go after it?

51
0:03:29.178,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In many cities, the traffic is already very chaotic,

52
0:03:32.74,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and we don't need more chaos.

53
0:03:35.221,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But the streets of the 21st century are a great case study

54
0:03:40.322,000 --> 0:03:43,000
teeming with transience, cross purposes and disarray.

55
0:03:45.337,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And this landscape offers a great opportunity

56
0:03:48.616,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for developing new solutions on how to reduce this chaos.

57
0:03:54.663,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I have conceived a new approach that tries to reduce the chaos

58
0:03:59.157,000 --> 0:04:,000
by introducing harmony.

59
0:04:02.898,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Since many people don't know how an electric car could sound like,

60
0:04:07.065,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I have to define, first of all, a new sound world,

61
0:04:11.378,000 --> 0:04:14,000
something that doesn't belong to our previous experience

62
0:04:15.055,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but creates a reference for the future.

63
0:04:19.072,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Together with a small team, we create lots of sonic textures

64
0:04:23.421,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that are able to transmit emotion.

65
0:04:28.064,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Just like a painter with colors,

66
0:04:30.261,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we are able to connect feelings and frequencies

67
0:04:34.758,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so that whenever one is approaching a car,

68
0:04:37.262,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we can feel an emotion

69
0:04:39.101,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which, besides fulfilling the legal requirements,

70
0:04:43.031,000 --> 0:04:46,000
speaks also about the character and the identity of the car.

71
0:04:49.837,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I call this paradigm "sound genetics."

72
0:04:54.433,000 --> 0:04:59,000
With sound genetics, I define, first of all, an aesthetic space of sound,

73
0:05:00.101,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and at the same time, I search for new, innovative methods

74
0:05:04.327,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for generating soundscapes that we don't know,

75
0:05:08.533,000 --> 0:05:12,000
soundscapes that allow us to envision abstract worlds,

76
0:05:14.083,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to make them tangible and audible.

77
0:05:18.42,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Sound genetics is based on three steps.

78
0:05:22.266,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The first one is the definition of a sonic organism,

79
0:05:27.313,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the second one is a description of sonic variations,

80
0:05:31.884,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and the third one is the composition of sound genes.

81
0:05:38.732,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The description of a sonic organism is based on a cluster of properties

82
0:05:44.451,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that every sound that I compose should have.

83
0:05:50.804,000 --> 0:05:51,000
[Sound is moving.]

84
0:05:52.341,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I transfer to a small sound entity, such as the sound of a car,

85
0:05:58.41,000 --> 0:06:,000
the power of the motion of music,

86
0:06:01.363,000 --> 0:06:02,000
so that sound can move so.

87
0:06:04.313,000 --> 0:06:05,000
[Sound is acting.]

88
0:06:05.722,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And just like a dancer on a stage,

89
0:06:07.665,000 --> 0:06:11,000
sound will project trajectories of sound in the air.

90
0:06:14.287,000 --> 0:06:15,000
[Sound is memory.]

91
0:06:15.462,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And it's not just about the sound of a car.

92
0:06:18.448,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's the memory of my father coming back home.

93
0:06:23.737,000 --> 0:06:24,000
[Sound is hypnotizing.]

94
0:06:25.298,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And sound has the power to create an unexpected sense of wonder,

95
0:06:30.973,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which hypnotizes.

96
0:06:34.004,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And ultimately,

97
0:06:35.195,000 --> 0:06:36,000
[Sound is superhuman.]

98
0:06:36.694,000 --> 0:06:38,000
sound goes beyond the human condition,

99
0:06:38.718,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because it allows us to transcend.

100
0:06:44.544,000 --> 0:06:48,000
As a second step, we define the sonic variations.

101
0:06:49.297,000 --> 0:06:5,000
[Identity prism]

102
0:06:50.495,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Just like humans, where different bodies generate different voices,

103
0:06:54.618,000 --> 0:06:59,000
also different car shapes have a different acoustic behavior

104
0:06:59.896,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which depends on the geometry and the materials.

105
0:07:03.849,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So we have to know, first of all, how this car propagates the sound outside

106
0:07:10.087,000 --> 0:07:11,000
by means of acoustic measurements.

107
0:07:13.65,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And just like a single voice is able to produce different tones and timbres,

108
0:07:19.467,000 --> 0:07:22,000
at the same time, we produce different sonic variations

109
0:07:22.936,000 --> 0:07:26,000
within a space of eight words that I defined.

110
0:07:28.074,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And some of them are, to me, really important,

111
0:07:30.945,000 --> 0:07:32,000
such as the concept of "visionary,"

112
0:07:33.233,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of "elegance," of "dynamic," of "embracing."

113
0:07:39.757,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And once we have defined these two aspects,

114
0:07:42.955,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we have what I call the identity prism,

115
0:07:46.035,000 --> 0:07:5,000
which is something like the sonic identity card of a car.

116
0:07:53.056,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And as a third step, we enter the world of the sound design,

117
0:07:59.046,000 --> 0:08:01,000
where the sound genes are composed

118
0:08:01.855,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and a new archetype is conceived.

119
0:08:05.61,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Now let me show you another example

120
0:08:08.097,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of how I transform a sound field into a melody.

121
0:08:13.847,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Think that I am a violin player on stage.

122
0:08:16.586,000 --> 0:08:17,000
If I would start to play the violin,

123
0:08:18.356,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I would generate a sound field which would propagate in this hall,

124
0:08:22.356,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and at some point, the sound field would hit the side walls

125
0:08:26.119,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and would be scattered all over the place.

126
0:08:29.712,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And this is how it looked like.

127
0:08:31.317,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Some time ago, I captured several ways of sound to hit side walls.

128
0:08:38.321,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And last year, I was asked by the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra

129
0:08:42.448,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to compose ringtones that they were going to play.

130
0:08:46.82,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So one of them, I had the idea to start from this sound field.

131
0:08:51.728,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I took a section,

132
0:08:53.646,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I superimposed the section over the distribution

133
0:08:56.432,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of the musicians onstage,

134
0:08:58.73,000 --> 0:09:,000
and then I followed the blooming of the sound field

135
0:09:01.584,000 --> 0:09:02,000
by means of three parameters:

136
0:09:04.146,000 --> 0:09:05,000
time, intensity and frequency.

137
0:09:06.996,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Then I wrote down all the gradients for each instrument,

138
0:09:11.882,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and as you can see, for instance,

139
0:09:13.497,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the piece will start with the string section playing very softly,

140
0:09:17.983,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and then it's going to have a crescendo as the brasses, the woods will jump in,

141
0:09:23.97,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and the melody will end with a harp and a piano

142
0:09:27.951,000 --> 0:09:29,000
playing on the highest range.

143
0:09:34.457,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Let's listen how it sounded like.

144
0:09:39.495,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Ethereal music)

145
0:09:56.24,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Music ends)

146
0:09:59.895,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So this is the sound of my alarm clock, actually, in the morning.

147
0:10:03.146,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

148
0:10:05.707,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And now let's go back to electric cars.

149
0:10:09.338,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And let's listen to the first example that I showed you.

150
0:10:20.089,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Hum)

151
0:10:28.6,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And now I would like to show you how a potential sound,

152
0:10:33.704,000 --> 0:10:37,000
based on the sound genetics for electric cars, could sound like.

153
0:10:39.926,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Ethereal music)

154
0:10:43.537,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Pitch rises with acceleration)

155
0:10:52.365,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Cars are a metaphor of time, distance and journey,

156
0:10:59.159,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of setting out and returning,

157
0:11:02.304,000 --> 0:11:04,000
of anticipation and adventure,

158
0:11:05.109,000 --> 0:11:1,000
but, at the same time, of intelligence and complexity,

159
0:11:10.268,000 --> 0:11:12,000
of human intuition and accomplishment.

160
0:11:13.258,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And the sound has to glorify all that.

161
0:11:17.69,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I see cars both as living creatures

162
0:11:21.91,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and as highly complex performative art installations.

163
0:11:27.984,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The sounds that we envision through sound genetics

164
0:11:31.609,000 --> 0:11:34,000
allow us not only to celebrate this complexity

165
0:11:36.735,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but also to make the world a more elegant and safe space.

166
0:11:42.07,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Thank you.

167
0:11:43.246,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old,

2
0:00:18.834,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we were playing on top of a bunk bed.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was two years older than my sister at the time --

4
0:00:24.31,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I mean, I'm two years older than her now --

5
0:00:26.566,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do,

6
0:00:29.915,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I wanted to play war.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So we were up on top of our bunk beds.

8
0:00:33.34,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And on one side of the bunk bed,

9
0:00:35.459,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry.

10
0:00:38.093,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies

11
0:00:41.005,000 --> 0:00:42,000
ready for a cavalry charge.

12
0:00:42.474,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon,

13
0:00:45.791,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but since my sister is not here with us today,

14
0:00:48.103,000 --> 0:00:49,000
let me tell you the true story --

15
0:00:50.023,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
which is my sister's a little on the clumsy side.

17
0:00:53.719,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Somehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all,

18
0:00:56.765,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed

19
0:00:59.259,000 --> 0:01:,000
and landed with this crash on the floor.

20
0:01:01.213,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I nervously peered over the side of the bed

21
0:01:03.251,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to see what had befallen my fallen sister

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees

23
0:01:08.138,000 --> 0:01:09,000
on all fours on the ground.

24
0:01:09.513,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was nervous because my parents had charged me

25
0:01:12.013,000 --> 0:01:13,000
with making sure that my sister and I

26
0:01:13.899,000 --> 0:01:15,000
played as safely and as quietly as possible.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm

28
0:01:19.936,000 --> 0:01:2,000
just one week before --

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:25.359,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter ends)

31
0:01:26.384,000 --> 0:01:3,000
heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,

32
0:01:31.068,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:33.126,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could --

34
0:01:37.233,000 --> 0:01:38,000
she didn't even see it coming --

35
0:01:38.853,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I was trying hard to be on my best behavior.

36
0:01:41.218,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And I saw my sister's face,

37
0:01:42.592,000 --> 0:01:44,000
this wail of pain and suffering and surprise

38
0:01:44.852,000 --> 0:01:46,000
threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents

39
0:01:47.56,000 --> 0:01:49,000
from the long winter's nap for which they had settled.

40
0:01:50.18,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So I did the only thing

41
0:01:51.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
my frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy.

42
0:01:54.822,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times.

43
0:01:57.709,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry. Did you see how you landed?

44
0:02:00.46,000 --> 0:02:02,000
No human lands on all fours like that.

45
0:02:03.851,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:09.653,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, that was cheating,

48
0:02:10.786,000 --> 0:02:12,000
because there was nothing she would want more

49
0:02:12.939,000 --> 0:02:14,000
than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister,

50
0:02:15.604,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but Amy the special unicorn.

51
0:02:17.06,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Of course, this option was open to her brain

52
0:02:19.208,000 --> 0:02:2,000
at no point in the past.

53
0:02:20.416,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict,

54
0:02:23.537,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as her little brain attempted to devote resources

55
0:02:25.938,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced,

56
0:02:29.261,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn.

57
0:02:31.83,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And the latter won.

58
0:02:32.96,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Instead of crying or ceasing our play,

59
0:02:34.823,000 --> 0:02:35,000
instead of waking my parents,

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
with all the negative consequences for me,

61
0:02:38.591,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a smile spread across her face

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed

63
0:02:42.376,000 --> 0:02:43,000
with all the grace of a baby unicorn --

64
0:02:44.286,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:46.839,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with one broken leg.

66
0:02:48.253,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What we stumbled across

67
0:02:49.879,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at this tender age of just five and seven --

68
0:02:51.983,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we had no idea at the time --

69
0:02:53.679,000 --> 0:02:56,000
was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution

70
0:02:56.804,000 --> 0:02:59,000
occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain.

71
0:03:00.282,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We had stumbled across something called positive psychology,

72
0:03:03.221,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which is the reason I'm here today

73
0:03:04.89,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and the reason that I wake up every morning.

74
0:03:07.002,000 --> 0:03:09,000
When I started talking about this research

75
0:03:09.06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
outside of academia, with companies and schools,

76
0:03:11.36,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph.

77
0:03:14.46,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The first thing I want to do is start with a graph.

78
0:03:16.938,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This graph looks boring,

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.

80
0:03:21.235,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this graph doesn't even mean anything; it's fake data.

81
0:03:24.024,000 --> 0:03:25,000
What we found is --

82
0:03:25.319,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
If I got this data studying you, I would be thrilled,

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because there's a trend there,

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and that means that I can get published,

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which is all that really matters.

87
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There is one weird red dot above the curve,

88
0:03:39.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
there's one weirdo in the room --

89
0:03:41.885,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I know who you are, I saw you earlier --

90
0:03:44.934,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that's no problem.

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
That's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot.

92
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.

93
0:03:53.388,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data.

94
0:03:56.778,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

95
0:03:57.841,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So one of the first things we teach people

96
0:04:00.028,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in economics, statistics, business and psychology courses

97
0:04:02.868,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos.

98
0:04:06.057,000 --> 0:04:09,000
How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit?

99
0:04:09.46,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out

100
0:04:11.58,000 --> 0:04:13,000
how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two.

101
0:04:14.36,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But if I'm interested in your potential,

102
0:04:17.195,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we're creating the cult of the average with science.

104
0:04:22.855,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If I asked a question like,

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?"

106
0:04:26.981,000 --> 0:04:27,000
scientists change the answer to

107
0:04:28.49,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?"

108
0:04:31.853,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we tailor the class towards the average.

109
0:04:34.023,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If you fall below the average,

110
0:04:35.57,000 --> 0:04:36,000
then psychologists get thrilled,

111
0:04:37.187,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because that means you're depressed or have a disorder,

112
0:04:40.027,000 --> 0:04:41,000
or hopefully both.

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We're hoping for both because our business model is,

114
0:04:43.76,000 --> 0:04:45,000
if you come into a therapy session with one problem,

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten,

116
0:04:48.76,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so you keep coming back.

117
0:04:49.96,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We'll go back into your childhood if necessary,

118
0:04:52.199,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but eventually we want to make you normal again.

119
0:04:54.499,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But normal is merely average.

120
0:04:55.96,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average,

121
0:04:59.332,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we will remain merely average.

122
0:05:01.688,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Then instead of deleting those positive outliers,

123
0:05:04.006,000 --> 0:05:07,000
what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one

124
0:05:07.072,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and say, why?

125
0:05:08.112,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Why are some of you high above the curve

126
0:05:10.06,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in terms of intellectual, athletic, musical ability,

127
0:05:12.669,000 --> 0:05:13,000
creativity, energy levels,

128
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:15,000
resiliency in the face of challenge, sense of humor?

129
0:05:16.46,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Whatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you.

130
0:05:20.027,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Because maybe we can glean information,

131
0:05:21.96,000 --> 0:05:23,000
not just how to move people up to the average,

132
0:05:24.138,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide.

133
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The reason this graph is important to me

134
0:05:29.56,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is, on the news, the majority of the information is not positive.

135
0:05:32.66,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in fact it's negative.

136
0:05:33.76,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Most of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters.

137
0:05:36.96,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And very quickly, my brain starts to think

138
0:05:39.06,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world.

139
0:05:42.079,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This creates "the medical school syndrome."

140
0:05:44.307,000 --> 0:05:46,000
During the first year of medical training,

141
0:05:46.887,000 --> 0:05:49,000
as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases,

142
0:05:50.299,000 --> 0:05:52,000
suddenly you realize you have all of them.

143
0:05:52.554,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

144
0:05:53.579,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I have a brother in-law named Bobo, which is a whole other story.

145
0:05:56.675,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Bobo married Amy the unicorn.

146
0:05:58.261,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Bobo called me on the phone --

147
0:06:00.017,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:02.186,000 --> 0:06:04,000
from Yale Medical School,

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."

150
0:06:06.565,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Which, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare.

152
0:06:10.871,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo

153
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.

154
0:06:16.142,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us,

156
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.

157
0:06:24.06,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness,

158
0:06:27.361,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time.

159
0:06:31.033,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I applied to Harvard on a dare.

160
0:06:32.56,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college.

161
0:06:35.76,000 --> 0:06:38,000
When I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they let me go.

162
0:06:38.96,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality.

163
0:06:41.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well,

164
0:06:44.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that they'd be excited to be there.

165
0:06:46.46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you,

166
0:06:48.96,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom.

167
0:06:51.46,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But what I found is, while some people experience that,

168
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
when I graduated after my four years

169
0:06:55.96,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students --

170
0:06:59.561,000 --> 0:07:,000
Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.

171
0:07:01.464,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years.

173
0:07:06.66,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And in my research and my teaching,

174
0:07:08.451,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I found that these students, no matter how happy they were

175
0:07:11.251,000 --> 0:07:13,000
with their original success of getting into the school,

176
0:07:13.96,000 --> 0:07:16,000
two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there,

177
0:07:17.76,000 --> 0:07:18,000
nor on their philosophy or physics,

178
0:07:19.46,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but on the competition, the workload,

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the hassles, stresses, complaints.

180
0:07:22.96,000 --> 0:07:25,000
When I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall,

181
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up --

182
0:07:29.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I know some of you know this.

183
0:07:31.06,000 --> 0:07:32,000
When they'd visit, they'd look around,

184
0:07:32.96,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and say, "This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's."

185
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It does, because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard.

186
0:07:38.76,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And when they see this,

187
0:07:39.96,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they say, "Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard?

188
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?"

189
0:07:46.36,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Embedded within that question

190
0:07:47.86,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is the key to understanding the science of happiness.

191
0:07:50.46,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Because what that question assumes

192
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels,

193
0:07:55.256,000 --> 0:07:58,000
when in reality, if I know everything about your external world,

194
0:07:58.356,000 --> 0:08:,000
I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness.

195
0:08:00.86,000 --> 0:08:03,000
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world,

196
0:08:04.66,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but by the way your brain processes the world.

197
0:08:06.875,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And if we change it,

198
0:08:07.96,000 --> 0:08:09,000
if we change our formula for happiness and success,

199
0:08:10.413,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we can change the way that we can then affect reality.

200
0:08:13.259,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ,

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
75 percent of job successes

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.

204
0:08:25.56,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I talked to a New England boarding school, probably the most prestigious one,

205
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and they said, "We already know that.

206
0:08:31.06,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week.

207
0:08:34.76,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And we're so excited. Monday night we have the world's leading expert

208
0:08:38.06,000 --> 0:08:39,000
will speak about adolescent depression.

209
0:08:39.96,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Tuesday night it's school violence and bullying.

210
0:08:42.223,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Wednesday night is eating disorders.

211
0:08:44.06,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Thursday night is illicit drug use.

212
0:08:45.76,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness."

213
0:08:49.213,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

214
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I said, "That's most people's Friday nights."

215
0:08:52.427,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

216
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Applause)

217
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Which I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all.

218
0:09:01.142,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Silence on the phone.

219
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school,

220
0:09:05.56,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week.

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You've outlined all the negative things that can happen,

222
0:09:10.96,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but not talked about the positive."

223
0:09:12.66,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The absence of disease is not health.

224
0:09:14.46,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Here's how we get to health:

225
0:09:15.86,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success.

226
0:09:18.66,000 --> 0:09:2,000
In the last three years, I've traveled to 45 countries,

227
0:09:21.36,000 --> 0:09:24,000
working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn.

228
0:09:24.86,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And I found that most companies and schools

229
0:09:26.96,000 --> 0:09:28,000
follow a formula for success, which is this:

230
0:09:29.056,000 --> 0:09:31,000
If I work harder, I'll be more successful.

231
0:09:31.156,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier.

232
0:09:33.56,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles,

233
0:09:36.36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the way that we motivate our behavior.

234
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons.

235
0:09:41.904,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Every time your brain has a success,

236
0:09:43.66,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like.

237
0:09:46.46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You got good grades, now you have to get better grades,

238
0:09:49.161,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you got into a good school and after you get into a better one,

239
0:09:52.156,000 --> 0:09:54,000
you got a good job, now you have to get a better job,

240
0:09:54.757,000 --> 0:09:56,000
you hit your sales target, we're going to change it.

241
0:09:57.258,000 --> 0:10:,000
And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.

242
0:10:01.159,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon, as a society.

243
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And that's because we think we have to be successful,

244
0:10:06.808,000 --> 0:10:07,000
then we'll be happier.

245
0:10:07.956,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But our brains work in the opposite order.

246
0:10:10.055,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present,

247
0:10:13.056,000 --> 0:10:16,000
then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage,

248
0:10:16.32,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which is your brain at positive performs significantly better

249
0:10:19.258,000 --> 0:10:2,000
than at negative, neutral or stressed.

250
0:10:21.15,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.

251
0:10:24.604,000 --> 0:10:27,000
In fact, we've found that every single business outcome improves.

252
0:10:27.799,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Your brain at positive is 31% more productive

253
0:10:29.952,000 --> 0:10:31,000
than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed.

254
0:10:32.286,000 --> 0:10:33,000
You're 37% better at sales.

255
0:10:33.686,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate

256
0:10:35.806,000 --> 0:10:36,000
at coming up with the correct diagnosis

257
0:10:37.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.

258
0:10:40.46,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Which means we can reverse the formula.

259
0:10:42.36,000 --> 0:10:44,000
If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present,

260
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
then our brains work even more successfully

261
0:10:47.232,000 --> 0:10:49,000
as we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently.

262
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We need to be able to reverse this formula

263
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of.

264
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Because dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive,

265
0:10:58.56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
has two functions.

266
0:10:59.648,000 --> 0:11:,000
Not only does it make you happier,

267
0:11:01.649,000 --> 0:11:03,000
it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain

268
0:11:04.25,000 --> 0:11:06,000
allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way.

269
0:11:06.851,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We've found there are ways that you can train your brain

270
0:11:09.552,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to be able to become more positive.

271
0:11:11.253,000 --> 0:11:13,000
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row,

272
0:11:14.247,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we can actually rewire your brain,

273
0:11:15.948,000 --> 0:11:18,000
allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully.

274
0:11:19.849,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We've done these things in research now

275
0:11:21.75,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in every company that I've worked with,

276
0:11:23.751,000 --> 0:11:26,000
getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for

277
0:11:27.052,000 --> 0:11:29,000
for 21 days in a row, three new things each day.

278
0:11:29.363,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And at the end of that,

279
0:11:30.554,000 --> 0:11:31,000
their brain starts to retain a pattern

280
0:11:32.455,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first.

281
0:11:35.956,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours

282
0:11:39.557,000 --> 0:11:4,000
allows your brain to relive it.

283
0:11:41.14,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters.

284
0:11:43.821,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We find that meditation allows your brain

285
0:11:45.822,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating

286
0:11:48.423,000 --> 0:11:49,000
by trying to do multiple tasks at once

287
0:11:50.324,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.

288
0:11:52.825,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness.

289
0:11:56.126,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We get people, when they open up their inbox,

290
0:11:58.294,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to write one positive email

291
0:11:59.628,000 --> 0:12:01,000
praising or thanking somebody in their support network.

292
0:12:02.329,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And by doing these activities

293
0:12:03.83,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and by training your brain just like we train our bodies,

294
0:12:06.531,000 --> 0:12:09,000
what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success,

295
0:12:10.032,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity,

296
0:12:12.759,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but a real revolution.

297
0:12:13.86,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thank you very much.

298
0:12:14.96,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

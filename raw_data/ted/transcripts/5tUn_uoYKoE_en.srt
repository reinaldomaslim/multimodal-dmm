A few weeks ago, I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia.

2
0:00:20.744,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim

3
0:00:23.377,000 --> 0:00:25,000
was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,

4
0:00:25.802,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the holiest shrine of Islam.

5
0:00:27.595,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I did that; I put on my ritualistic dress,

6
0:00:30.299,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I went to the holy mosque,

7
0:00:31.831,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I did my prayers,

8
0:00:33.534,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I observed all the rituals.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And meanwhile, besides all the spirituality,

10
0:00:39.661,000 --> 0:00:41,000
there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba

11
0:00:41.982,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that was pretty interesting for me:

12
0:00:43.704,000 --> 0:00:44,000
there was no separation of sexes.

13
0:00:45.949,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In other words, men and women were worshiping all together.

14
0:00:50.085,000 --> 0:00:54,000

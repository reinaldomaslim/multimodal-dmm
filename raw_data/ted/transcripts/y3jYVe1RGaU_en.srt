2
0:00:16.534,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What is going to be the future of learning?

3
0:00:21.95,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I do have a plan,

4
0:00:24.23,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but in order for me to tell you what that plan is,

5
0:00:27.31,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I need to tell you a little story,

6
0:00:30.28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which kind of sets the stage.

7
0:00:33.126,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I tried to look at

8
0:00:34.913,000 --> 0:00:37,000
where did the kind of learning we do in schools,

9
0:00:38.32,000 --> 0:00:4,000
where did it come from?

10
0:00:40.59,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And you can look far back into the past,

11
0:00:43.022,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,

12
0:00:46.835,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.

13
0:00:50.537,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It came from about 300 years ago,

14
0:00:54.485,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and it came from the last

15
0:00:56.702,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"]

16
0:00:59.67,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Imagine trying to run the show,

17
0:01:02.015,000 --> 0:01:04,000
trying to run the entire planet,

18
0:01:04.423,000 --> 0:01:07,000
without computers, without telephones,

19
0:01:08.247,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with data handwritten on pieces of paper,

20
0:01:12.379,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and traveling by ships.

21
0:01:15.929,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But the Victorians actually did it.

22
0:01:18.083,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What they did was amazing.

23
0:01:21.251,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They created a global computer

24
0:01:24.563,000 --> 0:01:27,000
made up of people.

25
0:01:27.619,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's still with us today.

26
0:01:29.412,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.

27
0:01:35.391,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In order to have that machine running,

28
0:01:38.718,000 --> 0:01:41,000
you need lots and lots of people.

29
0:01:41.919,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They made another machine to produce those people:

30
0:01:46.278,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the school.

31
0:01:49.174,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The schools would produce the people

32
0:01:51.951,000 --> 0:01:54,000
who would then become parts of the

33
0:01:55.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
bureaucratic administrative machine.

34
0:01:59.185,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They must be identical to each other.

35
0:02:03.575,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They must know three things:

36
0:02:05.732,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;

37
0:02:08.772,000 --> 0:02:1,000
they must be able to read;

38
0:02:10.927,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and they must be able to do multiplication,

39
0:02:13.206,000 --> 0:02:16,000
division, addition and subtraction in their head.

40
0:02:16.869,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand

41
0:02:20.396,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and ship them to Canada

42
0:02:22.731,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and he would be instantly functional.

43
0:02:26.812,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The Victorians were great engineers.

44
0:02:29.681,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They engineered a system that was so robust

45
0:02:33.17,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that it's still with us today,

46
0:02:35.625,000 --> 0:02:38,000
continuously producing identical people

47
0:02:39.601,000 --> 0:02:43,000
for a machine that no longer exists.

48
0:02:44.417,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The empire is gone,

49
0:02:47.345,000 --> 0:02:49,000
so what are we doing with that design

50
0:02:50.249,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that produces these identical people,

51
0:02:52.618,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and what are we going to do next

52
0:02:55.521,000 --> 0:02:58,000
if we ever are going to do anything else with it?

53
0:02:59.441,000 --> 0:03:,000
["Schools as we know them are obsolete"]

54
0:03:01.131,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So that's a pretty strong comment there.

55
0:03:03.023,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.

56
0:03:06.817,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm not saying they're broken.

57
0:03:08.551,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.

58
0:03:11.548,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.

59
0:03:15.199,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.

60
0:03:21.425,000 --> 0:03:23,000
What are the kind of jobs that we have today?

61
0:03:23.832,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Well, the clerks are the computers.

62
0:03:25.966,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They're there in thousands in every office.

63
0:03:28.497,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And you have people who guide those computers

64
0:03:31.702,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to do their clerical jobs.

65
0:03:34.179,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.

66
0:03:37.443,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.

67
0:03:40.475,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They do need to be able to read.

68
0:03:42.747,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.

69
0:03:46.897,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Well, that's today, but we don't even know

70
0:03:50.004,000 --> 0:03:52,000
what the jobs of the future are going to look like.

71
0:03:52.563,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We know that people will work from wherever they want,

72
0:03:55.207,000 --> 0:03:58,000
whenever they want, in whatever way they want.

73
0:03:58.405,000 --> 0:04:02,000
How is present-day schooling going to prepare them

74
0:04:02.593,000 --> 0:04:04,000
for that world?

75
0:04:05.136,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.

76
0:04:10.184,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I used to teach people how to write computer programs

77
0:04:12.816,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in New Delhi, 14 years ago.

78
0:04:15.28,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.

79
0:04:19.037,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids

80
0:04:21.624,000 --> 0:04:23,000
ever going to learn to write computer programs?

81
0:04:24.144,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Or should they not?

82
0:04:27.224,000 --> 0:04:29,000
At the same time, we also had lots of parents,

83
0:04:29.841,000 --> 0:04:31,000
rich people, who had computers,

84
0:04:32.272,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and who used to tell me, "You know, my son,

85
0:04:35.403,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I think he's gifted,

86
0:04:37.592,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because he does wonderful things with computers.

87
0:04:40.466,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And my daughter -- oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."

88
0:04:44.442,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And so on. So I suddenly figured that,

89
0:04:46.55,000 --> 0:04:47,000
how come all the rich people are having

90
0:04:48.346,000 --> 0:04:5,000
these extraordinarily gifted children?

91
0:04:50.487,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:52.402,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What did the poor do wrong?

93
0:04:55.226,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I made a hole in the boundary wall

94
0:04:58.229,000 --> 0:05:,000
of the slum next to my office,

95
0:05:00.261,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen

96
0:05:03.005,000 --> 0:05:05,000
if I gave a computer to children who never would have one,

97
0:05:05.989,000 --> 0:05:08,000
didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.

98
0:05:09.325,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The children came running in.

99
0:05:10.277,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"

100
0:05:12.447,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I said, "Yeah, it's, I don't know."

101
0:05:15.431,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:17.647,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They said, "Why have you put it there?"

103
0:05:20.203,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I said, "Just like that."

104
0:05:21.418,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And they said, "Can we touch it?"I said, "If you wish to."

105
0:05:24.427,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And I went away.

106
0:05:26.804,000 --> 0:05:27,000
About eight hours later,

107
0:05:28.548,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.

108
0:05:31.503,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So I said, "Well that's impossible, because --

109
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
How is it possible? They don't know anything."

110
0:05:37.541,000 --> 0:05:39,000
My colleagues said, "No, it's a simple solution.

111
0:05:40.405,000 --> 0:05:42,000
One of your students must have been passing by,

112
0:05:43.228,000 --> 0:05:45,000
showed them how to use the mouse."

113
0:05:45.323,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I said, "Yeah, that's possible."

114
0:05:46.846,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi

115
0:05:49.905,000 --> 0:05:5,000
into a really remote village

116
0:05:51.896,000 --> 0:05:54,000
where the chances of a passing software development engineer

117
0:05:55.688,000 --> 0:05:59,000
was very little. (Laughter)

118
0:06:00.104,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I repeated the experiment there.

119
0:06:02.767,000 --> 0:06:04,000
There was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,

120
0:06:05.054,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I went away, came back after a couple of months,

121
0:06:07.254,000 --> 0:06:08,000
found kids playing games on it.

122
0:06:08.949,000 --> 0:06:08,000
When they saw me, they said,

123
0:06:09.9,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"We want a faster processor and a better mouse."

124
0:06:12.382,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:16.676,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So I said, "How on Earth do you know all this?"

126
0:06:20.085,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And they said something very interesting to me.

127
0:06:22.54,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In an irritated voice, they said,

128
0:06:24.205,000 --> 0:06:26,000
"You've given us a machine that works only in English,

129
0:06:26.758,000 --> 0:06:32,000
so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it." (Laughter)

130
0:06:32.843,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That's the first time, as a teacher,

131
0:06:34.82,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that I had heard the word "teach ourselves" said so casually.

132
0:06:39.911,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Here's a short glimpse from those years.

133
0:06:43.513,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.

134
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
On your right is an eight-year-old.

135
0:06:48.398,000 --> 0:06:53,000
To his left is his student. She's six.

136
0:06:54.118,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And he's teaching her how to browse.

137
0:06:57.715,000 --> 0:07:,000
Then onto other parts of the country,

138
0:07:01.001,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I repeated this over and over again,

139
0:07:03.284,000 --> 0:07:06,000
getting exactly the same results that we were.

140
0:07:06.729,000 --> 0:07:09,000
["Hole in the wall film - 1999"]

141
0:07:10.656,000 --> 0:07:14,000
An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.

142
0:07:19.72,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,

143
0:07:25.277,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and said, "There's a processor inside."

144
0:07:29.526,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So I started publishing.

145
0:07:32.019,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,

146
0:07:34.574,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and I said, in nine months, a group of children

147
0:07:36.776,000 --> 0:07:38,000
left alone with a computer in any language

148
0:07:39.474,000 --> 0:07:43,000
will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.

149
0:07:43.989,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I'd seen it happen over and over and over again.

150
0:07:48.749,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But I was curious to know, what else would they do

151
0:07:51.481,000 --> 0:07:53,000
if they could do this much?

152
0:07:53.721,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I started experimenting with other subjects,

153
0:07:56.249,000 --> 0:07:58,000
among them, for example, pronunciation.

154
0:07:59.217,000 --> 0:08:01,000
There's one community of children in southern India

155
0:08:01.665,000 --> 0:08:03,000
whose English pronunciation is really bad,

156
0:08:04.433,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.

157
0:08:07.953,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,

158
0:08:12.031,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and I said, "Keep talking into it until it types what you say."

159
0:08:15.305,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

160
0:08:19.937,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They did that, and watch a little bit of this.

161
0:08:25.121,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Computer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.

162
0:08:30.633,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face

163
0:08:32.904,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.

164
0:08:36.721,000 --> 0:08:39,000
She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad

165
0:08:40.217,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and may have tortured you about your credit card bills

166
0:08:44.939,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in a very clear English accent.

167
0:08:49.712,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So then people said, well, how far will it go?

168
0:08:54.089,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Where does it stop?

169
0:08:55.659,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I decided I would destroy my own argument

170
0:08:59.022,000 --> 0:09:01,000
by creating an absurd proposition.

171
0:09:01.526,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.

172
0:09:05.414,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said,

173
0:09:07.218,000 --> 0:09:09,000
can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village

174
0:09:09.863,000 --> 0:09:12,000
learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English

175
0:09:13.368,000 --> 0:09:15,000
from a streetside computer?

176
0:09:15.615,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.

177
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,

178
0:09:20.854,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'll go back, they'll get another zero.

179
0:09:23.158,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.

180
0:09:27.514,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.

181
0:09:31.577,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I put in Hole in the Wall computers there,

182
0:09:34.254,000 --> 0:09:37,000
downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,

183
0:09:37.941,000 --> 0:09:4,000
most of which I didn't understand.

184
0:09:41.246,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The children came rushing, said, "What's all this?"

185
0:09:44.223,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So I said, "It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."

186
0:09:49.231,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So they said, "How can we understand such big English words

187
0:09:52.585,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and diagrams and chemistry?"

188
0:09:54.663,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,

189
0:09:57.487,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so I applied that. I said, "I haven't the foggiest idea."

190
0:10:00.371,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

191
0:10:03.566,000 --> 0:10:05,000
"And anyway, I am going away."

192
0:10:06.516,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

193
0:10:10.884,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So I left them for a couple of months.

194
0:10:14.473,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.

195
0:10:17.108,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I came back after two months

196
0:10:18.032,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and the children trooped in and said, "We've understood nothing."

197
0:10:21.692,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So I said, "Well, what did I expect?"

198
0:10:23.767,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So I said, "Okay, but how long did it take you

199
0:10:27.852,000 --> 0:10:29,000
before you decided that you can't understand anything?"

200
0:10:30.613,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So they said, "We haven't given up.

201
0:10:32.561,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We look at it every single day."

202
0:10:34.537,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So I said, "What? You don't understand these screens

203
0:10:37.002,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"

204
0:10:39.706,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So a little girl who you see just now,

205
0:10:42.219,000 --> 0:10:44,000
she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,

206
0:10:44.951,000 --> 0:10:46,000
she said, "Well, apart from the fact that

207
0:10:47.148,000 --> 0:10:5,000
improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,

208
0:10:50.299,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we haven't understood anything else."

209
0:10:52.82,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

210
0:10:58.532,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So I tested them.

211
0:11:02.652,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent

212
0:11:05.924,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in two months in the tropical heat

213
0:11:08.228,000 --> 0:11:11,000
with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know

214
0:11:11.668,000 --> 0:11:14,000
doing something that's a decade ahead of their time.

215
0:11:14.74,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.

216
0:11:20.117,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Thirty percent is a fail.

217
0:11:23.517,000 --> 0:11:25,000
How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.

218
0:11:26.453,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,

219
0:11:31.29,000 --> 0:11:33,000
a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant

220
0:11:33.676,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and she played with them all the time.

221
0:11:36.124,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So I asked this girl, "Can you help them?"

222
0:11:38.245,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So she says, "Absolutely not.

223
0:11:40.516,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I didn't have science in school. I have no idea

224
0:11:43.593,000 --> 0:11:47,000
what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."

225
0:11:48.122,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I said, "I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."

226
0:11:52.653,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So she says, "What's that?"

227
0:11:53.983,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I said, "Stand behind them.

228
0:11:55.37,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Whenever they do anything, you just say,

229
0:11:56.992,000 --> 0:11:58,000
'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?

230
0:11:59.789,000 --> 0:12:02,000
What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'

231
0:12:02.885,000 --> 0:12:04,000
You know what grannies do."

232
0:12:05.807,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So she did that for two more months.

233
0:12:07.981,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The scores jumped to 50 percent.

234
0:12:10.895,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Kallikuppam had caught up

235
0:12:12.549,000 --> 0:12:13,000
with my control school in New Delhi,

236
0:12:14.427,000 --> 0:12:18,000
a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.

237
0:12:18.563,000 --> 0:12:22,000
When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.

238
0:12:23.4,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Here's Kallikuppam.

239
0:12:25.496,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.

240
0:12:33.691,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,

241
0:12:37.382,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but what she was saying, as you could make out,

242
0:12:39.878,000 --> 0:12:41,000
was about neurons, with her hands were like that,

243
0:12:42.285,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and she was saying neurons communicate.

244
0:12:45.841,000 --> 0:12:48,000
At 12.

245
0:12:49.185,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So what are jobs going to be like?

246
0:12:52.395,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Well, we know what they're like today.

247
0:12:54.686,000 --> 0:12:56,000
What's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,

248
0:12:57.024,000 --> 0:13:,000
children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand

249
0:13:00.077,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.

250
0:13:03.85,000 --> 0:13:06,000
What will it be tomorrow?

251
0:13:07.809,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?

252
0:13:12.709,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,

253
0:13:16.249,000 --> 0:13:19,000
you can find out in two minutes?

254
0:13:19.569,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Could it be -- a devastating question,

255
0:13:23.674,000 --> 0:13:25,000
a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte --

256
0:13:26.466,000 --> 0:13:29,000
could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in

257
0:13:29.505,000 --> 0:13:32,000
a future where knowing is obsolete?

258
0:13:32.865,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.

259
0:13:35.398,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.

260
0:13:39.315,000 --> 0:13:4,000
But look at it this way.

261
0:13:41.092,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It took nature 100 million years

262
0:13:43.638,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to make the ape stand up

263
0:13:45.774,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and become Homo sapiens.

264
0:13:47.958,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.

265
0:13:51.654,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What an achievement that is.

266
0:13:53.836,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But we have to integrate that into our own future.

267
0:13:57.863,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Encouragement seems to be the key.

268
0:14:00.822,000 --> 0:14:01,000
If you look at Kuppam,

269
0:14:02.032,000 --> 0:14:04,000
if you look at all of the experiments that I did,

270
0:14:04.846,000 --> 0:14:11,000
it was simply saying, "Wow," saluting learning.

271
0:14:11.981,000 --> 0:14:13,000
There is evidence from neuroscience.

272
0:14:14.375,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,

273
0:14:17.577,000 --> 0:14:2,000
when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,

274
0:14:21.313,000 --> 0:14:24,000
it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,

275
0:14:24.991,000 --> 0:14:26,000
it shuts all of that down.

276
0:14:27.735,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.

277
0:14:31.883,000 --> 0:14:34,000
We take our children, we make them shut their brains down,

278
0:14:35.508,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and then we say, "Perform."

279
0:14:38.204,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Why did they create a system like that?

280
0:14:41.685,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Because it was needed.

281
0:14:43.331,000 --> 0:14:45,000
There was an age in the Age of Empires

282
0:14:45.916,000 --> 0:14:49,000
when you needed those people who can survive under threat.

283
0:14:50.186,000 --> 0:14:52,000
When you're standing in a trench all alone,

284
0:14:52.453,000 --> 0:14:56,000
if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.

285
0:14:56.484,000 --> 0:14:58,000
If you didn't, you failed.

286
0:14:59.457,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But the Age of Empires is gone.

287
0:15:02.113,000 --> 0:15:05,000
What happens to creativity in our age?

288
0:15:05.751,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We need to shift that balance back

289
0:15:08.766,000 --> 0:15:11,000
from threat to pleasure.

290
0:15:12.175,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I came back to England looking for British grandmothers.

291
0:15:16.127,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I put out notices in papers saying,

292
0:15:19.144,000 --> 0:15:22,000
if you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,

293
0:15:22.564,000 --> 0:15:25,000
can you give me one hour of your time per week for free?

294
0:15:25.791,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I got 200 in the first two weeks.

295
0:15:27.903,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)

296
0:15:32.811,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They're called the Granny Cloud.

297
0:15:36.626,000 --> 0:15:37,000
The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.

298
0:15:38.356,000 --> 0:15:42,000
If there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.

299
0:15:42.73,000 --> 0:15:45,000
She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.

300
0:15:46.299,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles

301
0:15:49.918,000 --> 0:15:51,000
in northwestern England,

302
0:15:51.963,000 --> 0:15:54,000
deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,

303
0:15:55.267,000 --> 0:15:57,000
6,000 miles away.

304
0:15:57.507,000 --> 0:16:,000
She does it with only one age-old gesture.

305
0:16:01.083,000 --> 0:16:02,000
"Shhh."

306
0:16:02.798,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Okay?

307
0:16:05.523,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Watch this.

308
0:16:07.059,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.

309
0:16:11.315,000 --> 0:16:14,000
You can't catch me.

310
0:16:15.083,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Children: You can't catch me.

311
0:16:18.051,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.

312
0:16:23.633,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Grandmother: Well done! Very good.

313
0:16:28.223,000 --> 0:16:3,000
SM: So what's happening here?

314
0:16:30.681,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I think what we need to look at is

315
0:16:32.525,000 --> 0:16:34,000
we need to look at learning

316
0:16:34.906,000 --> 0:16:38,000
as the product of educational self-organization.

317
0:16:39.494,000 --> 0:16:41,000
If you allow the educational process to self-organize,

318
0:16:42.339,000 --> 0:16:44,000
then learning emerges.

319
0:16:44.83,000 --> 0:16:46,000
It's not about making learning happen.

320
0:16:47.223,000 --> 0:16:49,000
It's about letting it happen.

321
0:16:49.439,000 --> 0:16:52,000
The teacher sets the process in motion

322
0:16:52.712,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and then she stands back in awe

323
0:16:55.431,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and watches as learning happens.

324
0:16:57.799,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I think that's what all this is pointing at.

325
0:17:00.752,000 --> 0:17:02,000
But how will we know? How will we come to know?

326
0:17:03.504,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Well, I intend to build

327
0:17:05.179,000 --> 0:17:08,000
these Self-Organized Learning Environments.

328
0:17:08.48,000 --> 0:17:11,000
They are basically broadband, collaboration

329
0:17:12.165,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and encouragement put together.

330
0:17:14.558,000 --> 0:17:15,000
I've tried this in many, many schools.

331
0:17:16.264,000 --> 0:17:18,000
It's been tried all over the world, and teachers

332
0:17:18.799,000 --> 0:17:21,000
sort of stand back and say, "It just happens by itself?"

333
0:17:22.425,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And I said, "Yeah, it happens by itself.""How did you know that?"

334
0:17:25.542,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I said, "You won't believe the children who told me

335
0:17:29.035,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and where they're from."

336
0:17:31.963,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Here's a SOLE in action.

337
0:17:34.707,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Children talking)

338
0:17:40.816,000 --> 0:17:46,000
This one is in England.

339
0:17:47.105,000 --> 0:17:5,000
He maintains law and order,

340
0:17:50.871,000 --> 0:17:58,000
because remember, there's no teacher around.

341
0:18:01.356,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia

342
0:18:05.259,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.

343
0:18:11.994,000 --> 0:18:14,000
The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons

344
0:18:15.578,000 --> 0:18:18,000
in the ion minus the number of electrons.

345
0:18:18.871,000 --> 0:18:21,000
SM: A decade ahead of her time.

346
0:18:21.92,000 --> 0:18:24,000
So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.

347
0:18:25.523,000 --> 0:18:27,000
You already heard about that. You know what that means.

348
0:18:27.729,000 --> 0:18:3,000
There was a time when Stone Age men and women

349
0:18:31.13,000 --> 0:18:33,000
used to sit and look up at the sky and say,

350
0:18:33.234,000 --> 0:18:35,000
"What are those twinkling lights?"

351
0:18:35.713,000 --> 0:18:39,000
They built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.

352
0:18:40.507,000 --> 0:18:44,000
We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.

353
0:18:44.637,000 --> 0:18:47,000
But that's not sexy enough.

354
0:18:48.345,000 --> 0:18:5,000
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,

355
0:18:51.306,000 --> 0:18:54,000
"If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,

356
0:18:54.459,000 --> 0:18:57,000
how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"

357
0:18:57.857,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"

358
0:19:00.417,000 --> 0:19:02,000
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"

359
0:19:03.402,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.

360
0:19:06.273,000 --> 0:19:1,000
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.

361
0:19:10.731,000 --> 0:19:15,000
I've tried incredible, incredible questions --

362
0:19:16.32,000 --> 0:19:2,000
"When did the world begin? How will it end?" —

363
0:19:20.608,000 --> 0:19:21,000
to nine-year-olds.

364
0:19:22.553,000 --> 0:19:24,000
This one is about what happens to the air we breathe.

365
0:19:25.529,000 --> 0:19:29,000
This is done by children without the help of any teacher.

366
0:19:30.487,000 --> 0:19:32,000
The teacher only raises the question,

367
0:19:32.871,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and then stands back and admires the answer.

368
0:19:36.535,000 --> 0:19:39,000
So what's my wish?

369
0:19:40.271,000 --> 0:19:42,000
My wish is

370
0:19:42.487,000 --> 0:19:46,000
that we design the future of learning.

371
0:19:46.801,000 --> 0:19:47,000
We don't want to be spare parts

372
0:19:48.767,000 --> 0:19:5,000
for a great human computer, do we?

373
0:19:51.159,000 --> 0:19:54,000
So we need to design a future for learning.

374
0:19:54.815,000 --> 0:19:55,000
And I've got to -- hang on,

375
0:19:56.451,000 --> 0:19:58,000
I've got to get this wording exactly right,

376
0:19:59.151,000 --> 0:20:01,000
because, you know, it's very important.

377
0:20:01.795,000 --> 0:20:03,000
My wish is to help design a future of learning

378
0:20:04.111,000 --> 0:20:06,000
by supporting children all over the world

379
0:20:06.345,000 --> 0:20:09,000
to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.

380
0:20:09.391,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Help me build this school.

381
0:20:11.623,000 --> 0:20:14,000
It will be called the School in the Cloud.

382
0:20:14.959,000 --> 0:20:19,000
It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures

383
0:20:20.032,000 --> 0:20:23,000
driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.

384
0:20:23.889,000 --> 0:20:25,000
The way I want to do this

385
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:3,000
is to build a facility where I can study this.

386
0:20:30.52,000 --> 0:20:32,000
It's a facility which is practically unmanned.

387
0:20:33.32,000 --> 0:20:34,000
There's only one granny

388
0:20:35.087,000 --> 0:20:37,000
who manages health and safety.

389
0:20:37.528,000 --> 0:20:38,000
The rest of it's from the cloud.

390
0:20:38.961,000 --> 0:20:39,000
The lights are turned on and off by the cloud,

391
0:20:40.876,000 --> 0:20:42,000
etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud.

392
0:20:42.904,000 --> 0:20:45,000
But I want you for another purpose.

393
0:20:46.129,000 --> 0:20:48,000
You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments

394
0:20:48.888,000 --> 0:20:53,000
at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs.

395
0:20:53.904,000 --> 0:20:55,000
It's very easy to do. There's a great document

396
0:20:56.032,000 --> 0:20:57,000
produced by TED which tells you how to do it.

397
0:20:57.92,000 --> 0:21:,000
If you would please, please do it

398
0:21:01.296,000 --> 0:21:03,000
across all five continents

399
0:21:03.661,000 --> 0:21:05,000
and send me the data,

400
0:21:05.872,000 --> 0:21:08,000
then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds,

401
0:21:09.376,000 --> 0:21:12,000
and create the future of learning.

402
0:21:12.64,000 --> 0:21:13,000
That's my wish.

403
0:21:14.432,000 --> 0:21:15,000
And just one last thing.

404
0:21:15.855,000 --> 0:21:17,000
I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.

405
0:21:18.448,000 --> 0:21:21,000
At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin,

406
0:21:21.751,000 --> 0:21:23,000
I once built two Hole in the Wall computers,

407
0:21:24.736,000 --> 0:21:25,000
and the children flocked there.

408
0:21:26.191,000 --> 0:21:28,000
And there was this little girl who was following me around.

409
0:21:29.088,000 --> 0:21:33,000
And I said to her, "You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child.

410
0:21:33.804,000 --> 0:21:35,000
I don't know, what should I do?"

411
0:21:36.205,000 --> 0:21:4,000
And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly.

412
0:21:40.236,000 --> 0:21:44,000
She suddenly raised her hand like this, and said to me,

413
0:21:44.292,000 --> 0:21:45,000
"Get on with it."

414
0:21:46.181,000 --> 0:21:57,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

415
0:21:58.045,000 --> 0:21:59,000
I think it was good advice.

416
0:21:59.906,000 --> 0:22:01,000
I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.

417
0:22:01.974,000 --> 0:22:04,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

418
0:22:05.964,000 --> 0:22:08,000
(Applause)

419
0:22:09.715,000 --> 0:22:17,000
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

420
0:22:18.039,000 --> 0:22:24,000
Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause)

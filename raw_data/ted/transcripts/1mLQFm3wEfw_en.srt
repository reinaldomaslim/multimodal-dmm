1
0:00:13.407,000 --> 0:00:14,000
If there's one city in the world

2
0:00:15.012,000 --> 0:00:17,000
where it's hard to find a place to buy or rent,

3
0:00:17.369,000 --> 0:00:18,000
it's Sydney.

4
0:00:19.043,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And if you've tried to find a home here recently,

5
0:00:21.434,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you're familiar with the problem.

6
0:00:23.298,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Every time you walk into an open house,

7
0:00:25.336,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you get some information about what's out there

8
0:00:27.551,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and what's on the market,

9
0:00:28.968,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but every time you walk out,

10
0:00:30.422,000 --> 0:00:33,000
you're running the risk of the very best place passing you by.

11
0:00:33.66,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So how do you know when to switch from looking

12
0:00:36.504,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to being ready to make an offer?

13
0:00:39.663,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is such a cruel and familiar problem

14
0:00:42.088,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that it might come as a surprise that it has a simple solution.

15
0:00:45.588,000 --> 0:00:46,000
37 percent.

16
0:00:46.815,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:48.667,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If you want to maximize the probability that you find the very best place,

18
0:00:52.627,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you should look at 37 percent of what's on the market,

19
0:00:55.476,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and then make an offer on the next place you see,

20
0:00:57.81,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which is better than anything that you've seen so far.

21
0:01:00.358,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Or if you're looking for a month, take 37 percent of that time --

22
0:01:04.187,000 --> 0:01:06,000
11 days, to set a standard --

23
0:01:07.126,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and then you're ready to act.

24
0:01:09.829,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We know this because trying to find a place to live

25
0:01:12.562,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is an example of an optimal stopping problem.

26
0:01:14.911,000 --> 0:01:16,000
A class of problems that has been studied extensively

27
0:01:17.418,000 --> 0:01:19,000
by mathematicians and computer scientists.

28
0:01:21.502,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I'm a computational cognitive scientist.

29
0:01:24.045,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I spend my time trying to understand

30
0:01:26.029,000 --> 0:01:27,000
how it is that human minds work,

31
0:01:27.851,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from our amazing successes to our dismal failures.

32
0:01:32.552,000 --> 0:01:34,000
To do that, I think about the computational structure

33
0:01:35.069,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of the problems that arise in everyday life,

34
0:01:37.752,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and compare the ideal solutions to those problems

35
0:01:40.151,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to the way that we actually behave.

36
0:01:42.725,000 --> 0:01:43,000
As a side effect,

37
0:01:43.934,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I get to see how applying a little bit of computer science

38
0:01:46.673,000 --> 0:01:47,000
can make human decision-making easier.

39
0:01:49.828,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I have a personal motivation for this.

40
0:01:52.153,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Growing up in Perth as an overly cerebral kid ...

41
0:01:55.343,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:00.098,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I would always try and act in the way that I thought was rational,

43
0:02:03.269,000 --> 0:02:04,000
reasoning through every decision,

44
0:02:04.89,000 --> 0:02:06,000
trying to figure out the very best action to take.

45
0:02:07.972,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But this is an approach that doesn't scale up

46
0:02:10.186,000 --> 0:02:12,000
when you start to run into the sorts of problems

47
0:02:12.452,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that arise in adult life.

48
0:02:13.976,000 --> 0:02:15,000
At one point, I even tried to break up with my girlfriend

49
0:02:16.728,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because trying to take into account her preferences as well as my own

50
0:02:20.102,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and then find perfect solutions --

51
0:02:21.809,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:24.092,000 --> 0:02:25,000
was just leaving me exhausted.

53
0:02:25.868,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:28.425,000 --> 0:02:3,000
She pointed out that I was taking the wrong approach

55
0:02:30.878,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to solving this problem --

56
0:02:32.511,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and she later became my wife.

57
0:02:33.917,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:36.003,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Applause)

59
0:02:40.998,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Whether it's as basic as trying to decide what restaurant to go to

60
0:02:44.483,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or as important as trying to decide who to spend the rest of your life with,

61
0:02:48.562,000 --> 0:02:5,000
human lives are filled with computational problems

62
0:02:50.961,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that are just too hard to solve by applying sheer effort.

63
0:02:55.65,000 --> 0:02:56,000
For those problems,

64
0:02:56.84,000 --> 0:02:57,000
it's worth consulting the experts:

65
0:02:58.825,000 --> 0:02:59,000
computer scientists.

66
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:01.808,000 --> 0:03:02,000
When you're looking for life advice,

68
0:03:03.651,000 --> 0:03:06,000
computer scientists probably aren't the first people you think to talk to.

69
0:03:07.315,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Living life like a computer --

70
0:03:09.214,000 --> 0:03:11,000
stereotypically deterministic, exhaustive and exact --

71
0:03:11.816,000 --> 0:03:12,000
doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

72
0:03:14.153,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But thinking about the computer science of human decisions

73
0:03:17.104,000 --> 0:03:19,000
reveals that in fact, we've got this backwards.

74
0:03:19.536,000 --> 0:03:21,000
When applied to the sorts of difficult problems

75
0:03:21.758,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that arise in human lives,

76
0:03:23.021,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the way that computers actually solve those problems

77
0:03:25.772,000 --> 0:03:27,000
looks a lot more like the way that people really act.

78
0:03:29.267,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Take the example of trying to decide what restaurant to go to.

79
0:03:33.09,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is a problem that has a particular computational structure.

80
0:03:36.202,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You've got a set of options,

81
0:03:37.75,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you're going to choose one of those options,

82
0:03:39.823,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and you're going to face exactly the same decision tomorrow.

83
0:03:42.658,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In that situation,

84
0:03:43.833,000 --> 0:03:45,000
you run up against what computer scientists call

85
0:03:46.152,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the "explore-exploit trade-off."

86
0:03:49.115,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You have to make a decision

87
0:03:50.473,000 --> 0:03:52,000
about whether you're going to try something new --

88
0:03:52.831,000 --> 0:03:54,000
exploring, gathering some information

89
0:03:55.038,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that you might be able to use in the future --

90
0:03:57.347,000 --> 0:04:,000
or whether you're going to go to a place that you already know is pretty good --

91
0:04:01.164,000 --> 0:04:04,000
exploiting the information that you've already gathered so far.

92
0:04:05.488,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The explore/exploit trade-off shows up any time you have to choose

93
0:04:08.608,000 --> 0:04:09,000
between trying something new

94
0:04:09.982,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and going with something that you already know is pretty good,

95
0:04:12.986,000 --> 0:04:13,000
whether it's listening to music

96
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or trying to decide who you're going to spend time with.

97
0:04:17.218,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It's also the problem that technology companies face

98
0:04:19.736,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when they're trying to do something like decide what ad to show on a web page.

99
0:04:23.417,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Should they show a new ad and learn something about it,

100
0:04:26.003,000 --> 0:04:27,000
or should they show you an ad

101
0:04:27.42,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that they already know there's a good chance you're going to click on?

102
0:04:30.75,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Over the last 60 years,

103
0:04:31.925,000 --> 0:04:33,000
computer scientists have made a lot of progress understanding

104
0:04:34.841,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the explore/exploit trade-off,

105
0:04:36.317,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and their results offer some surprising insights.

106
0:04:39.291,000 --> 0:04:41,000
When you're trying to decide what restaurant to go to,

107
0:04:41.913,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the first question you should ask yourself

108
0:04:43.937,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is how much longer you're going to be in town.

109
0:04:46.505,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If you're just going to be there for a short time,

110
0:04:48.871,000 --> 0:04:49,000
then you should exploit.

111
0:04:50.41,000 --> 0:04:51,000
There's no point gathering information.

112
0:04:52.339,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Just go to a place you already know is good.

113
0:04:54.411,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But if you're going to be there for a longer time, explore.

114
0:04:57.364,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Try something new, because the information you get

115
0:04:59.775,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is something that can improve your choices in the future.

116
0:05:02.773,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The value of information increases

117
0:05:04.776,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the more opportunities you're going to have to use it.

118
0:05:08.193,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This principle can give us insight

119
0:05:09.971,000 --> 0:05:11,000
into the structure of a human life as well.

120
0:05:13.104,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Babies don't have a reputation for being particularly rational.

121
0:05:17.098,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They're always trying new things,

122
0:05:18.947,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and you know, trying to stick them in their mouths.

123
0:05:22.621,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But in fact, this is exactly what they should be doing.

124
0:05:25.597,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They're in the explore phase of their lives,

125
0:05:28.051,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and some of those things could turn out to be delicious.

126
0:05:32.04,000 --> 0:05:33,000
At the other end of the spectrum,

127
0:05:33.636,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the old guy who always goes to the same restaurant

128
0:05:36.166,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and always eats the same thing

129
0:05:37.825,000 --> 0:05:38,000
isn't boring --

130
0:05:39.177,000 --> 0:05:4,000
he's optimal.

131
0:05:40.71,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:44.564,000 --> 0:05:46,000
He's exploiting the knowledge that he's earned

133
0:05:46.816,000 --> 0:05:47,000
through a lifetime's experience.

134
0:05:50.406,000 --> 0:05:51,000
More generally,

135
0:05:51.581,000 --> 0:05:53,000
knowing about the explore/exploit trade-off

136
0:05:53.636,000 --> 0:05:56,000
can make it a little easier for you to sort of relax and go easier on yourself

137
0:05:57.327,000 --> 0:05:58,000
when you're trying to make a decision.

138
0:05:59.161,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You don't have to go to the best restaurant every night.

139
0:06:01.913,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Take a chance, try something new, explore.

140
0:06:04.916,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You might learn something.

141
0:06:06.567,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And the information that you gain

142
0:06:08.18,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is going to be worth more than one pretty good dinner.

143
0:06:12.178,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Computer science can also help to make it easier on us

144
0:06:14.901,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in other places at home and in the office.

145
0:06:17.86,000 --> 0:06:19,000
If you've ever had to tidy up your wardrobe,

146
0:06:20.337,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you've run into a particularly agonizing decision:

147
0:06:23.032,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you have to decide what things you're going to keep

148
0:06:25.438,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and what things you're going to give away.

149
0:06:27.974,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Martha Stewart turns out to have thought very hard about this --

150
0:06:30.998,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:32.227,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and she has some good advice.

152
0:06:33.929,000 --> 0:06:35,000
She says, "Ask yourself four questions:

153
0:06:36.248,000 --> 0:06:37,000
How long have I had it?

154
0:06:37.798,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Does it still function?

155
0:06:39.272,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Is it a duplicate of something that I already own?

156
0:06:42.495,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And when was the last time I wore it or used it?"

157
0:06:46.648,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But there's another group of experts

158
0:06:48.387,000 --> 0:06:51,000
who perhaps thought even harder about this problem,

159
0:06:51.541,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and they would say one of these questions is more important than the others.

160
0:06:55.819,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Those experts?

161
0:06:57.281,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The people who design the memory systems of computers.

162
0:07:00.153,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Most computers have two kinds of memory systems:

163
0:07:02.431,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a fast memory system,

164
0:07:03.842,000 --> 0:07:06,000
like a set of memory chips that has limited capacity,

165
0:07:07.035,000 --> 0:07:09,000
because those chips are expensive,

166
0:07:09.111,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and a slow memory system, which is much larger.

167
0:07:13.239,000 --> 0:07:16,000
In order for the computer to operate as efficiently as possible,

168
0:07:16.263,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you want to make sure

169
0:07:17.438,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that the pieces of information you want to access

170
0:07:19.814,000 --> 0:07:2,000
are in the fast memory system,

171
0:07:21.315,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so that you can get to them quickly.

172
0:07:23.093,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Each time you access a piece of information,

173
0:07:25.178,000 --> 0:07:26,000
it's loaded into the fast memory

174
0:07:26.727,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and the computer has to decide which item it has to remove from that memory,

175
0:07:30.628,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because it has limited capacity.

176
0:07:33.794,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Over the years,

177
0:07:34.969,000 --> 0:07:36,000
computer scientists have tried a few different strategies

178
0:07:37.732,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for deciding what to remove from the fast memory.

179
0:07:40.048,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They've tried things like choosing something at random

180
0:07:43.248,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or applying what's called the "first-in, first-out principle,"

181
0:07:46.178,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which means removing the item

182
0:07:47.601,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which has been in the memory for the longest.

183
0:07:50.091,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But the strategy that's most effective

184
0:07:52.828,000 --> 0:07:55,000
focuses on the items which have been least recently used.

185
0:07:56.972,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This says if you're going to decide to remove something from memory,

186
0:08:00.187,000 --> 0:08:04,000
you should take out the thing which was last accessed the furthest in the past.

187
0:08:05.179,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And there's a certain kind of logic to this.

188
0:08:07.362,000 --> 0:08:1,000
If it's been a long time since you last accessed that piece of information,

189
0:08:10.984,000 --> 0:08:11,000
it's probably going to be a long time

190
0:08:12.77,000 --> 0:08:14,000
before you're going to need to access it again.

191
0:08:15.787,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Your wardrobe is just like the computer's memory.

192
0:08:18.585,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You have limited capacity,

193
0:08:20.639,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and you need to try and get in there the things that you're most likely to need

194
0:08:25.99,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so that you can get to them as quickly as possible.

195
0:08:29.016,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Recognizing that,

196
0:08:30.191,000 --> 0:08:32,000
maybe it's worth applying the least recently used principle

197
0:08:33.028,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to organizing your wardrobe as well.

198
0:08:35.001,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So if we go back to Martha's four questions,

199
0:08:37.107,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the computer scientists would say that of these,

200
0:08:39.992,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the last one is the most important.

201
0:08:43.473,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This idea of organizing things

202
0:08:45.552,000 --> 0:08:48,000
so that the things you are most likely to need are most accessible

203
0:08:48.705,000 --> 0:08:49,000
can also be applied in your office.

204
0:08:51.091,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The Japanese economist Yukio Noguchi

205
0:08:53.045,000 --> 0:08:56,000
actually invented a filing system that has exactly this property.

206
0:08:57.161,000 --> 0:08:58,000
He started with a cardboard box,

207
0:08:58.794,000 --> 0:09:,000
and he put his documents into the box from the left-hand side.

208
0:09:02.067,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Each time he'd add a document,

209
0:09:03.525,000 --> 0:09:04,000
he'd move what was in there along

210
0:09:05.17,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and he'd add that document to the left-hand side of the box.

211
0:09:08.004,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And each time he accessed a document, he'd take it out,

212
0:09:10.695,000 --> 0:09:12,000
consult it and put it back in on the left-hand side.

213
0:09:13.327,000 --> 0:09:16,000
As a result, the documents would be ordered from left to right

214
0:09:16.632,000 --> 0:09:17,000
by how recently they had been used.

215
0:09:18.417,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And he found he could quickly find what he was looking for

216
0:09:21.215,000 --> 0:09:23,000
by starting at the left-hand side of the box

217
0:09:23.293,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and working his way to the right.

218
0:09:25.215,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Before you dash home and implement this filing system --

219
0:09:27.86,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

220
0:09:29.615,000 --> 0:09:31,000
it's worth recognizing that you probably already have.

221
0:09:32.891,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

222
0:09:36.225,000 --> 0:09:38,000
That pile of papers on your desk ...

223
0:09:39.115,000 --> 0:09:41,000
typically maligned as messy and disorganized,

224
0:09:41.613,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a pile of papers is, in fact, perfectly organized --

225
0:09:44.202,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

226
0:09:45.226,000 --> 0:09:47,000
as long as you, when you take a paper out,

227
0:09:47.264,000 --> 0:09:49,000
put it back on the top of the pile,

228
0:09:49.72,000 --> 0:09:51,000
then those papers are going to be ordered from top to bottom

229
0:09:52.57,000 --> 0:09:53,000
by how recently they were used,

230
0:09:54.146,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and you can probably quickly find what you're looking for

231
0:09:56.871,000 --> 0:09:57,000
by starting at the top of the pile.

232
0:09:59.988,000 --> 0:10:,000
Organizing your wardrobe or your desk

233
0:10:01.86,000 --> 0:10:03,000
are probably not the most pressing problems in your life.

234
0:10:05.588,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Sometimes the problems we have to solve are simply very, very hard.

235
0:10:09.716,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But even in those cases,

236
0:10:10.89,000 --> 0:10:12,000
computer science can offer some strategies

237
0:10:12.935,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and perhaps some solace.

238
0:10:16.048,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The best algorithms are about doing what makes the most sense

239
0:10:19.147,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in the least amount of time.

240
0:10:22.627,000 --> 0:10:23,000
When computers face hard problems,

241
0:10:24.609,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they deal with them by making them into simpler problems --

242
0:10:27.395,000 --> 0:10:28,000
by making use of randomness,

243
0:10:28.765,000 --> 0:10:31,000
by removing constraints or by allowing approximations.

244
0:10:32.606,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Solving those simpler problems

245
0:10:34.124,000 --> 0:10:36,000
can give you insight into the harder problems,

246
0:10:37.068,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and sometimes produces pretty good solutions in their own right.

247
0:10:41.658,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Knowing all of this has helped me to relax when I have to make decisions.

248
0:10:45.251,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You could take the 37 percent rule for finding a home as an example.

249
0:10:49.015,000 --> 0:10:51,000
There's no way that you can consider all of the options,

250
0:10:51.741,000 --> 0:10:52,000
so you have to take a chance.

251
0:10:53.888,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And even if you follow the optimal strategy,

252
0:10:56.772,000 --> 0:10:57,000
you're not guaranteed a perfect outcome.

253
0:10:59.198,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If you follow the 37 percent rule,

254
0:11:01.376,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the probability that you find the very best place is --

255
0:11:04.679,000 --> 0:11:05,000
funnily enough ...

256
0:11:06.211,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

257
0:11:07.249,000 --> 0:11:08,000
37 percent.

258
0:11:09.966,000 --> 0:11:1,000
You fail most of the time.

259
0:11:12.522,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But that's the best that you can do.

260
0:11:14.846,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Ultimately, computer science can help to make us more forgiving

261
0:11:17.922,000 --> 0:11:18,000
of our own limitations.

262
0:11:20.333,000 --> 0:11:22,000
You can't control outcomes, just processes.

263
0:11:22.896,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And as long as you've used the best process,

264
0:11:25.039,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you've done the best that you can.

265
0:11:26.826,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Sometimes those best processes involve taking a chance --

266
0:11:30.538,000 --> 0:11:32,000
not considering all of your options,

267
0:11:32.677,000 --> 0:11:34,000
or being willing to settle for a pretty good solution.

268
0:11:35.43,000 --> 0:11:38,000
These aren't the concessions that we make when we can't be rational --

269
0:11:38.804,000 --> 0:11:39,000
they're what being rational means.

270
0:11:40.833,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Thank you.

271
0:11:42.008,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:25.012,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment

3
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.

4
0:00:35.719,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And the object that was levitating here

5
0:00:39.608,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is called a superconductor.

6
0:00:41.609,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter,

7
0:00:47.201,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.

8
0:00:51.458,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, it's quite an old phenomenon;

9
0:00:53.804,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it was discovered 100 years ago.

10
0:00:55.57,000 --> 0:00:57,000
However, only recently,

11
0:00:57.696,000 --> 0:00:59,000
due to several technological advancements,

12
0:01:00.058,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we are now able to demonstrate to you

13
0:01:02.73,000 --> 0:01:05,000
quantum levitation and quantum locking.

14
0:01:06.476,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So, a superconductor is defined by two properties.

15
0:01:12.321,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The first is zero electrical resistance,

16
0:01:15.777,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.

17
0:01:22.666,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That sounds complicated, right?

18
0:01:25.561,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But what is electrical resistance?

19
0:01:28.433,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material.

20
0:01:34.682,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And these electrons, while flowing,

21
0:01:38.031,000 --> 0:01:4,000
they collide with the atoms, and in these collisions

22
0:01:40.719,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they lose a certain amount of energy.

23
0:01:42.935,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect.

24
0:01:48.536,000 --> 0:01:53,000
However, inside a superconductor there are no collisions,

25
0:01:54.455,000 --> 0:01:58,000
so there is no energy dissipation.

26
0:01:59.147,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's quite remarkable. Think about it.

27
0:02:02.128,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss.

28
0:02:07.207,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But not here, because it is a quantum effect.

29
0:02:11.276,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.

30
0:02:19.962,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside,

31
0:02:24.279,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and it has the means to do that by circulating currents.

32
0:02:30.402,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, the combination of both effects --

33
0:02:33.392,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance --

34
0:02:39.392,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is exactly a superconductor.

35
0:02:42.56,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know,

36
0:02:46.776,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.

37
0:02:54.161,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, under proper conditions, which we have here,

38
0:02:57.815,000 --> 0:03:02,000
these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.

39
0:03:02.905,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor,

40
0:03:09.162,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they come in discrete quantities.

41
0:03:12.007,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Why? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.

42
0:03:15.653,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.

43
0:03:19.503,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.

44
0:03:25.082,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles,

45
0:03:28.975,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but they behave like particles.

46
0:03:33.27,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.

47
0:03:37.464,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?

48
0:03:43.527,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside,

49
0:03:48.112,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around,

50
0:03:52.232,000 --> 0:03:55,000
because their movements dissipate energy,

51
0:03:55.68,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which breaks the superconductivity state.

52
0:03:58.626,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So what it actually does, it locks these strands,

53
0:04:02.984,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.

54
0:04:08.736,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And by doing that, what it actually does is locking itself in place.

55
0:04:15.024,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Why? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place,

56
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
will change their configuration.

57
0:04:26.047,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.

58
0:04:31.344,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.

59
0:04:37.104,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And when I place it on top of a regular magnet,

60
0:04:41.568,000 --> 0:04:44,000
it just stays locked in midair.

61
0:04:45.44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause)

62
0:04:49.505,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion.

63
0:04:53.551,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration.

64
0:04:58.672,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Like this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.

65
0:05:02.696,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So, this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.

66
0:05:10.447,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Of course, I can turn it upside down,

67
0:05:12.607,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and it will remain locked.

68
0:05:15.513,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking,

69
0:05:24.735,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Yeah, we understand that.

70
0:05:29.049,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet,

71
0:05:33.311,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in which the magnetic field is the same all around,

72
0:05:37.279,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.

73
0:05:43.215,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.

74
0:05:49.239,000 --> 0:05:55,000
You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.

75
0:05:55.265,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.

76
0:06:01.927,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.

77
0:06:11.207,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?

78
0:06:17.703,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot.

79
0:06:20.584,000 --> 0:06:27,000
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.

80
0:06:27.952,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.

81
0:06:32.056,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here

82
0:06:37.672,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin.

83
0:06:45.197,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.

84
0:06:54.759,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.

85
0:07:00.592,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, I can extend this circular magnet,

86
0:07:04.169,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and make whatever track I want.

87
0:07:08.95,000 --> 0:07:11,000
For example, I can make a large circular rail here.

88
0:07:12.879,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,

89
0:07:19.762,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it moves freely.

90
0:07:23.871,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Applause)

91
0:07:33.252,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate,

92
0:07:37.993,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it freely moves in this new position.

93
0:07:44.434,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.

94
0:07:48.872,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I can take this disk and put it here,

95
0:07:54.816,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and while it stays here -- don't move --

96
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I will try to rotate the track,

97
0:08:04.358,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and hopefully, if I did it correctly,

98
0:08:06.657,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it stays suspended.

99
0:08:08.8,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

100
0:08:18.249,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.

101
0:08:25.09,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now, while I'll let it circulate for a little more,

102
0:08:29.225,000 --> 0:08:32,000
let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.

103
0:08:32.928,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now -- (Laughter) --

104
0:08:38.474,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors,

105
0:08:45.497,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields,

106
0:08:50.72,000 --> 0:08:55,000
such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on.

107
0:08:55.906,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But we can also store energy using superconductors,

108
0:09:00.466,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because we have no dissipation.

109
0:09:02.355,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And we could also produce power cables, to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations.

110
0:09:09.537,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable.

111
0:09:18.543,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?

112
0:09:23.019,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.

113
0:09:30.158,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand,

114
0:09:36.571,000 --> 0:09:39,000
three-inch diameter, with a single difference.

115
0:09:40.45,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The superconducting layer, instead of being half a micron thin,

116
0:09:45.635,000 --> 0:09:48,000
being two millimeters thin, quite thin.

117
0:09:48.723,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.

118
0:09:59.458,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Amazing. Thank you.

119
0:10:02.754,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Applause)

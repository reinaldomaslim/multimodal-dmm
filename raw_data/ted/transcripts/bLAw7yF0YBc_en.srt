1
0:00:13.333,000 --> 0:00:16,000
For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter

2
0:00:17.175,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in Huntington, West Virginia.

3
0:00:19.619,000 --> 0:00:24,000
As firefighters, my team and I are tasked with saving lives

4
0:00:26.085,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and property

5
0:00:27.49,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from such disasters as car wrecks, house fires

6
0:00:33.03,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and also life-threatening medical emergencies.

7
0:00:37.72,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession.

8
0:00:42.393,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And 10 years ago,

9
0:00:43.98,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I decided to increase my medical knowledge and I received a nursing degree.

10
0:00:49.718,000 --> 0:00:51,000
That was because it became clear

11
0:00:52.236,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that the next big threat facing not only my city,

12
0:00:55.593,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but other cities around the country,

13
0:00:57.768,000 --> 0:00:59,000
was not the one-and-done disaster,

14
0:01:00.141,000 --> 0:01:03,000
where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter,

15
0:01:04.918,000 --> 0:01:07,000
put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference

16
0:01:08.659,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and everything is OK.

17
0:01:10.675,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The next big disaster in my city was and is the long, debilitating

18
0:01:17.294,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and lethal disaster known as opioid addiction.

19
0:01:22.146,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We now call this a health epidemic,

20
0:01:24.4,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and we have replaced the name "addiction" with "substance use disorder."

21
0:01:29.688,000 --> 0:01:3,000
To give you some perspective

22
0:01:31.411,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of how significant this epidemic has become,

23
0:01:35.292,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in 2017, in my county of 95,000 people,

24
0:01:41.419,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we saw 1,831 overdoses

25
0:01:46.117,000 --> 0:01:49,000
[and] 183 deaths from overdose.

26
0:01:51.338,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This is the job of my firefighters, as well as other agencies,

27
0:01:55.79,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to respond to that.

28
0:01:58.29,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Coughs)

29
0:01:59.465,000 --> 0:02:,000
Excuse me.

30
0:02:02.239,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So, watching this epidemic unfold for several years,

31
0:02:07.54,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I developed some insight.

32
0:02:10.342,000 --> 0:02:14,000
For this disaster, we need to redefine our job as a first responder.

33
0:02:15.682,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We need to be more than just the cavalry.

34
0:02:18.452,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We need to do more than just save a life.

35
0:02:21.315,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We need to find ways to rebuild that life.

36
0:02:25.505,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And it's going to take a lot of people to do that.

37
0:02:28.53,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And that is exactly what we are trying to do

38
0:02:31.037,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in Huntington, West Virginia.

39
0:02:33.831,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, let me give you some insight as to what we do.

40
0:02:38.845,000 --> 0:02:42,000
First, this is what happens when somebody overdoses.

41
0:02:44.24,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Imagine you are somebody who is suffering from the brain disorder of addiction.

42
0:02:50.542,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You are fragile.

43
0:02:51.947,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You're embarrassed, you're ashamed.

44
0:02:56.003,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And you overdose.

45
0:02:58.728,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Maybe a friend or a family member calls 911.

46
0:03:02.593,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And then all of a sudden,

47
0:03:04.53,000 --> 0:03:1,000
you are awakened by five or six total strangers in uniform.

48
0:03:11.363,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And they're rubbing your sternum,

49
0:03:13.021,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and they're saying, "Wake up, wake up!

50
0:03:15.093,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You overdosed, you could've died."

51
0:03:17.807,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, would you not be defensive and angry?

52
0:03:20.514,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Because I know I would be.

53
0:03:22.858,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And on top of that,

54
0:03:24.326,000 --> 0:03:26,000
those strangers gave you a dose of naloxone,

55
0:03:26.993,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which has sent you into withdrawals,

56
0:03:29.501,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or what is better known as "dope sickness."

57
0:03:33.529,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Dope sickness makes you feel absolutely horrible.

58
0:03:37.085,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Some say it's like the flu, times ten.

59
0:03:40.625,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches.

60
0:03:45.42,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So not only did we, as strangers, wake you up,

61
0:03:50.586,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but we also made you feel really sick.

62
0:03:54.183,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So in turn, you, the patient, are not going to be very kind to us.

63
0:03:59.389,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And you're going to refuse further medical treatment.

64
0:04:03.863,000 --> 0:04:06,000
OK, well, then that's going to frustrate the heck out of us,

65
0:04:07.641,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and we're going to be mad,

66
0:04:09.046,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because you're ungrateful that we just saved your life.

67
0:04:14.062,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This is not a good dynamic here.

68
0:04:22.101,000 --> 0:04:25,000
What we are dealing with is a brain disorder

69
0:04:25.512,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that changes your thinking.

70
0:04:27.608,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It convinces you that you don't have a problem.

71
0:04:31.369,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So, this might have been not only the first time you've overdosed,

72
0:04:36.804,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it might have been the third, fourth or fifth time

73
0:04:40.514,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that we, personally, have revived you.

74
0:04:46.49,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is not a good situation.

75
0:04:48.903,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Second,

76
0:04:51.208,000 --> 0:04:54,000
first responders do not receive much education

77
0:04:54.775,000 --> 0:04:56,000
on what substance use disorder is.

78
0:04:57.665,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Neither does the medical community.

79
0:05:00.268,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We're not trained how to deal with those suffering from substance use disorder.

80
0:05:06.58,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I am trained to put out many different types of fires.

81
0:05:10.707,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I am trained to save a life in the moment.

82
0:05:13.569,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But I am not trained to deal with the intricate interaction

83
0:05:16.895,000 --> 0:05:19,000
between first responders, the health care community,

84
0:05:20.09,000 --> 0:05:21,000
social services

85
0:05:21.514,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the wider community that is necessary to save a life long-term.

86
0:05:27.538,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Thirdly,

87
0:05:30.228,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and this hits home.

88
0:05:33.173,000 --> 0:05:36,000
As a first responder, I consider myself the cavalry.

89
0:05:37.284,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We're knights in shining armor.

90
0:05:40.3,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We want to swoop in, do our job and leave feeling satisfied

91
0:05:44.506,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that we've made a difference in somebody's life.

92
0:05:47.498,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But that just doesn't happen

93
0:05:49.339,000 --> 0:05:52,000
when we're dealing with somebody with substance use disorder.

94
0:05:54.239,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We leave feeling frustrated and useless.

95
0:05:57.612,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We deal with the same people over and over again,

96
0:06:00.325,000 --> 0:06:01,000
with no positive outcome.

97
0:06:03.41,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And you know what?

98
0:06:04.626,000 --> 0:06:08,000
At some point, I realized that it is up to us as first responders

99
0:06:09.419,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and as a community

100
0:06:10.871,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to solve this problem,

101
0:06:12.519,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to find better ways to deal with those that are suffering.

102
0:06:17.185,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So what I did is I started observing more on overdoses.

103
0:06:24.006,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I started talking and listening to my patients.

104
0:06:27.609,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I wanted to know what led them to where they are.

105
0:06:32.244,000 --> 0:06:34,000
What exactly are they experiencing?

106
0:06:35.228,000 --> 0:06:37,000
What makes their situation worse?

107
0:06:37.553,000 --> 0:06:39,000
What makes their situation better?

108
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I began experimenting with my words

109
0:06:43.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and paying attention to my own actions

110
0:06:45.8,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and how it affected those of my patients.

111
0:06:49.871,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The education that I have received

112
0:06:53.475,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and continue to receive on a street level in Huntington

113
0:06:58.098,000 --> 0:07:,000
has been both eye-opening and life-changing for me.

114
0:07:02.951,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, in Huntington, West Virginia, we have come together as a community,

115
0:07:08.387,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and we are changing the way that we treat

116
0:07:10.83,000 --> 0:07:13,000
those that suffer from this horrible disease.

117
0:07:16.165,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We have started many programs, and it's making a difference.

118
0:07:20.95,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I'll tell you about just a few of those.

119
0:07:24.427,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Last year, we started a Quick Response Team,

120
0:07:28.982,000 --> 0:07:3,000
QRT for short.

121
0:07:31.551,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The team consists of a paramedic,

122
0:07:34.805,000 --> 0:07:35,000
a police officer,

123
0:07:36.408,000 --> 0:07:4,000
somebody in the recovery community and somebody in the faith community.

124
0:07:41.632,000 --> 0:07:44,000
As a team, they go out and visit people who have overdosed

125
0:07:45.212,000 --> 0:07:47,000
within 72 hours of that resuscitation.

126
0:07:48.427,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They talk.

127
0:07:49.619,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They listen.

128
0:07:50.808,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They build a rapport with that patient,

129
0:07:53.198,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and they offer them treatment options.

130
0:07:59.65,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Right now, about 30 percent or up to 30 percent

131
0:08:04.785,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of those that the Quick Response Team have reached out to

132
0:08:09.179,000 --> 0:08:11,000
have accepted some form of help.

133
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And the wonderful thing about this

134
0:08:14.776,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is the first responders who are involved in this team,

135
0:08:18.474,000 --> 0:08:21,000
they actually feel like they can make a difference.

136
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Positive change where there wasn't any.

137
0:08:26.679,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This year --

138
0:08:27.861,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Applause)

139
0:08:33.108,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This year, we opened a free-standing specialty clinic, called PROACT,

140
0:08:39.307,000 --> 0:08:42,000
for those suffering from substance use disorder.

141
0:08:43.165,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's a one-stop shop, if you will.

142
0:08:46.085,000 --> 0:08:47,000
A patient comes in,

143
0:08:47.482,000 --> 0:08:51,000
they're immediately assessed by somebody who's an addiction specialist.

144
0:08:52.538,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They work with them to provide treatment options

145
0:08:55.164,000 --> 0:08:58,000
based on their own needs, individual needs.

146
0:08:59.514,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This does several things for us.

147
0:09:01.569,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It gives first responders a place to either take or refer our patients

148
0:09:06.649,000 --> 0:09:08,000
who are no longer in a life-threatening situation,

149
0:09:09.466,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that have refused to go to the hospital.

150
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And it also clears up

151
0:09:15.942,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the overwhelmed emergency rooms in hospitals that we have.

152
0:09:21.204,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The third thing that I want to tell you about

153
0:09:23.371,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is very dear to me and very important to my team.

154
0:09:28.247,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We recently started a first responders self-care program.

155
0:09:34.437,000 --> 0:09:35,000
More and more ...

156
0:09:37.419,000 --> 0:09:42,000
first responders are experiencing compassion fatigue and PTSD.

157
0:09:44.728,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It is not uncommon for the average firefighter in Huntington

158
0:09:50.934,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to deal with or see up to five young deaths per month.

159
0:09:57.712,000 --> 0:10:,000
These are their friends, these are their classmates.

160
0:10:01.824,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So this much-needed program will not only recognize their hard work,

161
0:10:07.388,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it's going to give them a voice.

162
0:10:09.365,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's going to provide them with training

163
0:10:11.674,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that will help deal with the stress that they are under.

164
0:10:15.547,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And it will give them more mental-health options

165
0:10:18.497,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that they desperately need.

166
0:10:22.585,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We now have yoga classes in fire stations.

167
0:10:25.356,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Laughter)

168
0:10:27.299,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Applause)

169
0:10:30.855,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We've also provided on-duty massages, which is fabulous.

170
0:10:34.41,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

171
0:10:35.895,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And we have some off-duty programs that we've started,

172
0:10:38.592,000 --> 0:10:41,000
like cooking classes for first responders and their significant other

173
0:10:42.421,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and pottery classes.

174
0:10:44.771,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So a couple of months ago,

175
0:10:48.31,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I walked out on the apparatus floor, where I had some firefighters.

176
0:10:52.961,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And half of them had had a massage,

177
0:10:55.437,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and the other half were getting ready to have a massage.

178
0:10:58.818,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And I saw 10 firefighters who were bantering

179
0:11:03.155,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in a very positive, relaxed manner.

180
0:11:07.286,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And I hadn't seen that in years.

181
0:11:10.453,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And that relaxed state is trickling down to the community, to the citizens.

182
0:11:16.954,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So a couple of weeks ago, I had a neighbor overdose.

183
0:11:21.191,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Twenty-two years old.

184
0:11:22.914,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So of course, I hurried down to help my firefighters and my neighbor.

185
0:11:27.578,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And what I witnessed was my firefighters being supportive.

186
0:11:32.148,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Talking in a non-judgmental way.

187
0:11:34.768,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I watched as one of my firefighters

188
0:11:37.173,000 --> 0:11:39,000
showed the father and another family member

189
0:11:39.971,000 --> 0:11:42,000
how to provide rescue breaths, should this happen again.

190
0:11:43.244,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And left him with a bag valve mask.

191
0:11:46.236,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Positive change.

192
0:11:48.466,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Positive change.

193
0:11:50.585,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Did I happen to mention

194
0:11:52.759,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the two things that firefighters dislike the most?

195
0:11:56.965,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The way things are and change.

196
0:11:59.736,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

197
0:12:06.299,000 --> 0:12:09,000
You know, I recognize that there have been drug epidemics before.

198
0:12:09.97,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And I've seen what crack can do to a community.

199
0:12:14.081,000 --> 0:12:16,000
A lot of our critics think

200
0:12:16.448,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that this new compassionate response that we're doing in Huntington

201
0:12:21.768,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is because of race.

202
0:12:24.596,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That because the overdoses are happening so much to the white community.

203
0:12:30.392,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And I understand that criticism,

204
0:12:32.575,000 --> 0:12:34,000
because we as a country messed up.

205
0:12:36.115,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And we treated black people poorly during the crack epidemic.

206
0:12:40.98,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We can't forget that.

207
0:12:42.559,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And we must do better.

208
0:12:45.538,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But right now, what I know is people are dying.

209
0:12:50.49,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And we in Huntington deal with people suffering from substance use disorder

210
0:12:56.402,000 --> 0:13:01,000
of every color and every background, on the streets, every day.

211
0:13:02.696,000 --> 0:13:06,000
The job of a first responder: prevent unnecessary deaths.

212
0:13:08.252,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Period.

213
0:13:10.847,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So ...

214
0:13:13.715,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Obviously, I'm a stubborn firefighter and nurse.

215
0:13:18.096,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And I refuse to believe that there isn't a way around every barrier.

216
0:13:22.755,000 --> 0:13:24,000
One of the barriers that we have

217
0:13:24.815,000 --> 0:13:26,000
dealing with the opioid epidemic is stigma.

218
0:13:29.871,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So ...

219
0:13:32.783,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We in Huntington, West Virginia, are showing the rest of the country

220
0:13:37.506,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that change can happen.

221
0:13:40.776,000 --> 0:13:43,000
That there is hope dealing with this epidemic.

222
0:13:44.911,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Our current overdoses are down 40 percent.

223
0:13:49.8,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

224
0:13:57.878,000 --> 0:14:,000
Currently, our overdose deaths are down 50 percent.

225
0:14:01.529,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Applause)

226
0:14:06.199,000 --> 0:14:08,000
This epidemic is far from over.

227
0:14:08.786,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But each and every one of us has a part to play in this epidemic.

228
0:14:14.188,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Just by listening and being kind to somebody,

229
0:14:17.657,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you have the ability to make a difference in their lives.

230
0:14:22.397,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Thank you and God bless.

231
0:14:24.014,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

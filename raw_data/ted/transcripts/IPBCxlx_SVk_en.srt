1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
As a child,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was raised by native Hawaiian elders --

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
three old women

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
who took care of me while my parents worked.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The year is 1963.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We're at the ocean.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's twilight.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We're watching the rising of the stars

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and the shifting of the tides.

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's a stretch of beach we know so well.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The smooth stones on the sand

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
are familiar to us.

13
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
If you saw these women on the street

14
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in their faded clothes,

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
you might dismiss them

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
as poor and simple.

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
That would be a mistake.

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
These women are descendants

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of Polynesian navigators,

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
trained in the old ways

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
by their elders,

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and now they're passing it on to me.

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They teach me the names of the winds and the rains,

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There's a new moon on the horizon.

26
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They begin to chant.

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
[Hawaiian chant]

29
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
When they finish,

30
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they sit in a circle

31
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and ask me to come to join them.

32
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
They want to teach me about my destiny.

33
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I thought every seven-year-old went through this.

34
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Baby girl,

36
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
someday the world will be in trouble.

37
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
People will forget their wisdom.

38
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It will take elders' voices

39
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
from the far corners of the world

40
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to call the world into balance.

41
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You will go far away.

42
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It will sometimes be a lonely road.

43
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We will not be there.

44
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But you will look into the eyes

45
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of seeming strangers,

46
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and you will recognize your ohana,

47
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
your family.

48
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And it will take all of you.

49
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It will take all of you."

50
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
These words, I hold onto

51
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
all my life.

52
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Because the idea of doing it alone

53
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
terrifies me.

54
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The year is 2007.

55
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I'm on a remote island in Micronesia.

56
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Satawal is one half-mile long

57
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
by one mile wide.

58
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's the home of my mentor.

59
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
His name is Pius Mau Piailug.

60
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Mau is a palu,

61
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
a navigator priest.

62
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
He's also considered

63
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the greatest wave finder in the world.

64
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There are fewer than a handful

65
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of palu left on this island.

66
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Their tradition is so extraordinary

67
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that these mariners sailed

68
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
three million square miles across the Pacific

69
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
without the use of instruments.

70
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They could synthesize patterns in nature

71
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
using the rising and setting of stars,

72
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the sequence and direction of waves,

73
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the flight patterns of certain birds.

74
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Even the slightest hint of color

75
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
on the underbelly of a cloud

76
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
would inform them

77
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.

78
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe

79
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and watch him go into the hull,

80
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it appeared that an old man

81
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
was going to rest.

82
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In fact, the hull of the canoe

83
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is the womb of the vessel.

84
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It is the most accurate place

85
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to feel the rhythm and sequence

86
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and direction of waves.

87
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Mau was, in fact,

88
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
gathering explicit data

89
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
using his entire body.

90
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's what he had been trained to do

91
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
since he was five years old.

92
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now science may dismiss this methodology,

93
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but Polynesian navigators use it today

94
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because it provides them

95
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
an accurate determination

96
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of the angle and direction

97
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of their vessel.

98
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The palu also had

99
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
an uncanny ability

100
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to forecast weather conditions

101
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
days in advance.

102
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night

103
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island,

104
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and he would look out,

105
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and then he would say,

106
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"Okay, we go."

107
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He saw that first glint of light --

108
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.

109
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically,

110
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
are extraordinary,

111
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and they are so relevant

112
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for these times that we are in

113
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
when we are riding out storms.

114
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We are in such a critical moment

115
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of our collective history.

116
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They have been compared

117
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
to astronauts --

118
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
these elder navigators

119
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
who sail vast open oceans

120
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in double-hulled canoes

121
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
thousands of miles

122
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
from a small island.

123
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Their canoes, our rockets;

124
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
their sea, our space.

125
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The wisdom of these elders

126
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is not a mere collection

127
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of stories about old people

128
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in some remote spot.

129
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This is part of our collective narrative.

130
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's humanity's DNA.

131
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We cannot afford to lose it.

132
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The year is 2010.

133
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Just as the women in Hawaii

134
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that raised me predicted,

135
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the world is in trouble.

136
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We live in a society

137
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
bloated with data,

138
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
yet starved for wisdom.

139
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We're connected 24/7,

140
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
yet anxiety,

141
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
fear, depression and loneliness

142
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is at an all-time high.

143
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We must course-correct.

144
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
An African shaman said,

145
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Your society worships the jester

146
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
while the king stands

147
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in plain clothes."

148
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The link between the past and the future

149
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
is fragile.

150
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This I know intimately,

151
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because even as I travel

152
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
throughout the world

153
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to listen to these stories and record them,

154
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I struggle.

155
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I am haunted

156
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
by the fact that I no longer remember

157
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the names of the winds and the rains.

158
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Mau passed away

159
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
five months ago,

160
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but his legacy and lessons live on.

161
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I am reminded

162
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that throughout the world

163
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
there are cultures

164
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
with vast sums of knowledge in them,

165
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
as potent as the Micronesian navigators,

166
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that are going dismissed,

167
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that this is a testament

168
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to brilliant, brilliant

169
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
technology and science and wisdom

170
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that is vanishing rapidly.

171
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Because when an elder dies a library is burned,

172
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.

173
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I am grateful for the fact

174
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that I had a mentor like Mau

175
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
who taught me how to navigate.

176
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And I realize

177
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
through a lesson that he shared

178
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that we continue to find our way.

179
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And this is what he said:

180
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"The island is the canoe;

181
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the canoe, the island."

182
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And what he meant was,

183
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
if you are voyaging

184
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and far from home,

185
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
your very survival depends

186
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
on everyone aboard.

187
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
You cannot make the voyage alone,

188
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you were never meant to.

189
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This whole notion of every man for himself

190
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is completely unsustainable.

191
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It always was.

192
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So in closing I would offer you this:

193
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The planet is our canoe,

194
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and we are the voyagers.

195
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
True navigation

196
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
begins in the human heart.

197
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's the most important map of all.

198
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Together, may we journey well.

199
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000

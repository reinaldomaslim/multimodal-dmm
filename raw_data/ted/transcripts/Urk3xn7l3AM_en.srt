1
0:00:13.341,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Someday, we may have robots as smart as people,

2
0:00:17.809,000 --> 0:00:19,000
artificial intelligence, AI.

3
0:00:20.307,000 --> 0:00:21,000
How could that happen?

4
0:00:22.632,000 --> 0:00:25,000
One route is that we'll just keep accumulating better software,

5
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:26,000
like we've been doing for 70 years.

6
0:00:28.363,000 --> 0:00:3,000
At past rates of progress, that may take centuries.

7
0:00:31.958,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Some say it'll happen a lot faster

8
0:00:34.332,000 --> 0:00:37,000
as we discover grand new powerful theories of intelligence.

9
0:00:38.227,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm skeptical.

10
0:00:40.428,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But a third scenario

11
0:00:43.513,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is what I'm going to talk about today.

12
0:00:45.364,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The idea is to port the software from the human brain.

13
0:00:48.792,000 --> 0:00:51,000
To do this, we're going to need three technologies to be good enough,

14
0:00:52.117,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and none of them are there yet.

15
0:00:54.237,000 --> 0:00:58,000
First, we're going to need lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.

16
0:01:00.675,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Second, we're going to need to scan individual human brains

17
0:01:04.906,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in fine spatial and chemical detail,

18
0:01:07.168,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to see exactly what cells are where, connected to what, of what type.

19
0:01:11.22,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And third, we're going to need computer models

20
0:01:15.6,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of how each kind of brain cell works --

21
0:01:18.822,000 --> 0:01:2,000
taking input signals, changing interval state

22
0:01:21.426,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and sending output signals.

23
0:01:22.744,000 --> 0:01:25,000
If we have good enough models of all the kinds of brain cells

24
0:01:26.586,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and a good enough model of the brain,

25
0:01:28.373,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we can put it together to make a good enough model of an entire brain,

26
0:01:31.831,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and that model would have the same input-output behavior as the original.

27
0:01:35.858,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So if you talk to it, it might talk back.

28
0:01:38.367,000 --> 0:01:4,000
If you ask it to do things, it might do them.

29
0:01:40.488,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And if we could do that, everything would change.

30
0:01:43.334,000 --> 0:01:45,000
People have been talking about this idea for decades,

31
0:01:45.926,000 --> 0:01:46,000
under the name of "uploads."

32
0:01:47.739,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I'm going to call them "ems."

33
0:01:50.175,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When they talk about it, they say,

34
0:01:52.803,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"Is this even possible?

35
0:01:54.658,000 --> 0:01:57,000
If you made one, would it be conscious? Or is it just an empty machine?

36
0:01:58.033,000 --> 0:02:,000
If you made one of me, is that me or someone else?"

37
0:02:00.856,000 --> 0:02:03,000
These are all fascinating questions that I'm going to ignore ...

38
0:02:03.982,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:06.861,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because I see a neglected question:

40
0:02:08.974,000 --> 0:02:09,000
What would actually happen?

41
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I became obsessed with this question.

42
0:02:15.813,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I spent four years trying to analyze it,

43
0:02:18.79,000 --> 0:02:21,000
using standard academic tools, to guess what would happen,

44
0:02:22.361,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I'm here to tell you what I found.

45
0:02:24.748,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But be warned --

46
0:02:26.542,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I'm not offering inspiration, I'm offering analysis.

47
0:02:29.973,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I see my job as telling you what's most likely to happen

48
0:02:32.791,000 --> 0:02:33,000
if we did the least to avoid it.

49
0:02:35.952,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If you aren't at least a bit disturbed by something I tell you here,

50
0:02:39.278,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you're just not paying attention.

51
0:02:40.896,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:42.271,000 --> 0:02:44,000
OK, the first thing I can tell you

53
0:02:44.891,000 --> 0:02:47,000
is that ems spend most of their life in virtual reality.

54
0:02:48.639,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This is what you might look like if you were using virtual reality.

55
0:02:53.894,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And this is what you might see:

56
0:02:57.064,000 --> 0:03:,000
sunlight glinting off of water, you might hear gulls flying above,

57
0:03:00.684,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you might even feel the wind on your cheeks or smell seawater,

58
0:03:03.739,000 --> 0:03:04,000
with advanced hardware.

59
0:03:05.902,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, if you were to spend a lot of time here,

60
0:03:08.023,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you might want a dashboard

61
0:03:09.313,000 --> 0:03:11,000
where you could do things like make a phone call,

62
0:03:11.831,000 --> 0:03:12,000
move to a new virtual world,

63
0:03:13.405,000 --> 0:03:14,000
check your bank account.

64
0:03:15.78,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, while this is what you would look like in virtual reality,

65
0:03:19.461,000 --> 0:03:22,000
this is what an em would look like in virtual reality.

66
0:03:22.613,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere.

67
0:03:25.393,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But still, it could see and experience the same thing.

68
0:03:29.102,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But some things are different for ems.

69
0:03:31.51,000 --> 0:03:35,000
First, while you'll probably always notice that virtual reality isn't entirely real,

70
0:03:36.32,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to an em, it can feel as real to them as this room feels to you now

71
0:03:39.598,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or as anything ever feels.

72
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And ems also have some more action possibilities.

73
0:03:44.209,000 --> 0:03:46,000
For example, your mind just always runs at the same speed,

74
0:03:46.949,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but an em can add more or less computer hardware to run faster or slower,

75
0:03:50.814,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and therefore, if the world around them seems to be going too fast,

76
0:03:54.526,000 --> 0:03:55,000
they can just speed up their mind,

77
0:03:56.169,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and the world around them would seem to slow down.

78
0:03:58.543,000 --> 0:04:02,000
In addition, an em can make a copy of itself at that moment.

79
0:04:03.94,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This copy would remember everything the same,

80
0:04:06.061,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and if it starts out with the same speed, looking at the same speed,

81
0:04:09.401,000 --> 0:04:11,000
it might even need to be told, "You are the copy."

82
0:04:12.599,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And em could make archive copies,

83
0:04:14.196,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and with enough archives,

84
0:04:16.044,000 --> 0:04:18,000
an em can be immortal --

85
0:04:18.14,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in principle, though not usually in practice.

86
0:04:21.231,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And an em can move its brain, the computer that represents its brain,

87
0:04:24.787,000 --> 0:04:26,000
from one physical location to another.

88
0:04:27.857,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Ems can actually move around the world at the speed of light,

89
0:04:31.199,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and by moving to a new location,

90
0:04:32.755,000 --> 0:04:35,000
they can interact more quickly with ems near that new location.

91
0:04:36.043,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So far, I've been talking about what ems can do.

92
0:04:41.047,000 --> 0:04:42,000
What do ems choose to do?

93
0:04:44.225,000 --> 0:04:46,000
To understand that, we'll need to understand three key facts.

94
0:04:47.916,000 --> 0:04:53,000
First, ems by definition do what the human they emulate would do

95
0:04:54.091,000 --> 0:04:55,000
in the same situation.

96
0:04:56.125,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So their lives and behavior are very human.

97
0:04:58.792,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They're mainly different because they're living in a different world.

98
0:05:02.113,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Second, ems need real resources to survive.

99
0:05:05.435,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You need food and shelter or you'll die.

100
0:05:09.122,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Also, ems need computer hardware, energy, cooling, or they can't exist.

101
0:05:13.456,000 --> 0:05:15,000
For every subjective minute that an em experiences,

102
0:05:16.055,000 --> 0:05:19,000
someone, usually that em, had to work to pay for it.

103
0:05:19.956,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Third, ems are poor.

104
0:05:21.67,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:23.535,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The em population can grow quicker than the em economy,

106
0:05:26.194,000 --> 0:05:29,000
so that means wages fall down to em subsistence levels.

107
0:05:29.553,000 --> 0:05:31,000
That means ems have to be working most of the time.

108
0:05:32.181,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So that means this is what ems usually see:

109
0:05:35.504,000 --> 0:05:37,000
beautiful and luxurious, but desks --

110
0:05:38.076,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they're working most of the time.

111
0:05:40.103,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, a subsistence wage scenario, you might think, is exotic and strange,

112
0:05:44.096,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but it's actually the usual case in human history,

113
0:05:46.461,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it's how pretty much all wild animals have ever lived,

114
0:05:49.199,000 --> 0:05:51,000
so we know what humans do in this situation.

115
0:05:51.499,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Humans basically do what it takes to survive,

116
0:05:54.453,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and this is what lets me say so much about the em world.

117
0:05:58.572,000 --> 0:06:,000
When creatures are rich, like you,

118
0:06:00.985,000 --> 0:06:02,000
you have to know a lot about what they want

119
0:06:03.032,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to figure out what they do.

120
0:06:04.397,000 --> 0:06:05,000
When creatures are poor,

121
0:06:05.591,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you know that they mostly do what it takes to survive.

122
0:06:08.596,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So we've been talking about the em world from the point of view of the ems --

123
0:06:12.244,000 --> 0:06:14,000
now, let's step back and look at their whole world.

124
0:06:14.783,000 --> 0:06:17,000
First, the em world grows much faster than ours,

125
0:06:17.887,000 --> 0:06:19,000
roughly a hundred times faster.

126
0:06:20.375,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So the amount of change we would experience in a century or two,

127
0:06:23.562,000 --> 0:06:24,000
they would experience in a year or two.

128
0:06:25.444,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I'm not really willing to project this age much beyond that,

129
0:06:28.506,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because plausibly by then something else will happen, I don't know what.

130
0:06:31.967,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Second, the typical emulation runs even faster,

131
0:06:34.349,000 --> 0:06:36,000
roughly a thousand times human speed.

132
0:06:37.136,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So for them, they experience thousands of years in this year or two,

133
0:06:42.5,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and for them, the world around them is actually changing more slowly

134
0:06:45.716,000 --> 0:06:46,000
than your world seems to change for you.

135
0:06:48.097,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Third, ems are crammed together in a small number of very dense cities.

136
0:06:52.605,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is not only how they see themselves in virtual reality,

137
0:06:56.095,000 --> 0:06:58,000
it's also how they actually are physically crammed together.

138
0:06:59.294,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So at em speeds, physical travel feels really painfully slow,

139
0:07:03.204,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so most em cities are self-sufficient,

140
0:07:05.55,000 --> 0:07:06,000
most war is cyber war,

141
0:07:07.324,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and most of the rest of the earth away from the em cities

142
0:07:10.039,000 --> 0:07:13,000
is left to the humans, because the ems really aren't that interested in it.

143
0:07:14.072,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Speaking of humans,

144
0:07:15.604,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you were wanting to hear about that.

145
0:07:17.412,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Humans must retire, at once, for good.

146
0:07:22.707,000 --> 0:07:23,000
They just can't compete.

147
0:07:24.738,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now, humans start out owning all of the capital in this world.

148
0:07:27.834,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The economy grows very fast, their wealth grows very fast.

149
0:07:30.727,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Humans get rich, collectively.

150
0:07:34.048,000 --> 0:07:37,000
As you may know, most humans today don't actually own that much

151
0:07:37.311,000 --> 0:07:38,000
besides their ability to work,

152
0:07:39.176,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so between now and then, they need to acquire sufficient assets,

153
0:07:42.748,000 --> 0:07:43,000
insurance or sharing arrangements,

154
0:07:44.605,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or they may starve.

155
0:07:46.09,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I highly recommend avoiding this outcome.

156
0:07:48.129,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:50.285,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, you might wonder,

158
0:07:51.532,000 --> 0:07:52,000
why would ems let humans exist?

159
0:07:53.034,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Why not kill them, take their stuff?

160
0:07:55.521,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But notice we have many unproductive retirees around us today,

161
0:07:58.622,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we don't kill them and take their stuff.

162
0:08:00.751,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:02.409,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In part, that's because it would disrupt the institutions we share with them.

164
0:08:07.344,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Other groups would wonder who's next,

165
0:08:09.484,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so plausibly, ems may well let humans retire in peace during the age of em.

166
0:08:14.234,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You should worry more that the age of em only lasts a year or two

167
0:08:17.307,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and you don't know what happens next.

168
0:08:21.027,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Ems are very much like humans,

169
0:08:23.417,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but they are not like the typical human.

170
0:08:26.258,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The typical em is a copy of the few hundred most productive humans.

171
0:08:33.149,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So in fact, they are as elite, compared to the typical human,

172
0:08:36.753,000 --> 0:08:38,000
as the typical billionaire, Nobel Prize winner,

173
0:08:39.039,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Olympic gold medalist, head of state.

174
0:08:42.347,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Ems look on humans perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,

175
0:08:46.673,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but not so much respect,

176
0:08:48.205,000 --> 0:08:51,000
which is, if you think about it, how you think about your ancestors.

177
0:08:51.424,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We know many things about how humans differ in terms of productivity.

178
0:08:54.715,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We can just use those to predict features of ems --

179
0:08:57.158,000 --> 0:09:,000
for example, they tend to be smart, conscientious, hard-working,

180
0:09:00.278,000 --> 0:09:01,000
married, religious, middle-aged.

181
0:09:02.281,000 --> 0:09:03,000
These are features of ems.

182
0:09:03.917,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Em world also contains enormous variety.

183
0:09:06.53,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Not only does it continue on with most of the kinds of variety that humans do,

184
0:09:10.222,000 --> 0:09:12,000
including variety of industry and profession,

185
0:09:12.641,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they also have many new kinds of variety,

186
0:09:14.827,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and one of the most important is mind speed.

187
0:09:17.532,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Ems can plausibly go from human speed

188
0:09:21.39,000 --> 0:09:23,000
up to a million times faster than human speed,

189
0:09:24.294,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and down to a billion times slower than human speed.

190
0:09:28.046,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Faster ems tend to have markers of high status.

191
0:09:30.836,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They embody more wealth. They win arguments.

192
0:09:33.02,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They sit at premium locations.

193
0:09:34.707,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Slower ems are mostly retirees,

194
0:09:36.551,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and they are like the ghosts of our literature.

195
0:09:38.825,000 --> 0:09:4,000
If you recall, ghosts are all around us --

196
0:09:40.89,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you can interact with them if you pay the price.

197
0:09:43.184,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But they don't know much, they can't influence much,

198
0:09:45.637,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and they're obsessed with the past, so what's the point?

199
0:09:48.359,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:49.534,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Ems also have more variety in the structure of their lives.

201
0:09:52.515,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is your life: you start and you end, really simple.

202
0:09:55.221,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This is the life of an em,

203
0:09:56.858,000 --> 0:09:58,000
who every day splits off some short-term copies

204
0:09:59.175,000 --> 0:10:,000
to do short-term tasks and then end.

205
0:10:01.157,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We'll talk more about those short term versions in a moment,

206
0:10:05.308,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but they are much more efficient

207
0:10:06.942,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because they don't have to rest for the next day.

208
0:10:09.331,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This em is more opportunistic.

209
0:10:10.863,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They make more copies of themselves when there's more demand for that.

210
0:10:14.174,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They don't know which way the future's going.

211
0:10:16.295,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This is an em designer,

212
0:10:17.618,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who conceives of a large system

213
0:10:19.244,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and then breaks recursively into copies who elaborate that,

214
0:10:22.753,000 --> 0:10:25,000
so ems can implement larger, more coherent designs.

215
0:10:26.189,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This an emulation plumber

216
0:10:27.571,000 --> 0:10:29,000
who remembers that every day, for the last 20 years,

217
0:10:30.04,000 --> 0:10:32,000
they only ever worked two hours a day, a life of leisure.

218
0:10:32.845,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But what really happened is, every day they had a thousand copies,

219
0:10:35.966,000 --> 0:10:36,000
each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,

220
0:10:37.943,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and only one of them went on to the next day.

221
0:10:40.132,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Objectively, they're working well over 99 percent of the time.

222
0:10:43.155,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Subjectively, they remember a life of leisure.

223
0:10:45.369,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Laughter)

224
0:10:46.401,000 --> 0:10:48,000
This, again, is you. You start and you end.

225
0:10:48.513,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This could be you if at the start of party,

226
0:10:50.649,000 --> 0:10:52,000
you took a drug that meant you would not remember that party

227
0:10:53.484,000 --> 0:10:54,000
ever after that day.

228
0:10:55.126,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Some people do this, I'm told.

229
0:10:57.49,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Toward the end of the party,

230
0:10:59.149,000 --> 0:11:01,000
will you say to yourself, "I'm about to die, this is terrible.

231
0:11:02.099,000 --> 0:11:05,000
That person tomorrow isn't me, because they won't remember what I do."

232
0:11:05.426,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Or you could say, "I will go on tomorrow. I just won't remember what I did."

233
0:11:09.411,000 --> 0:11:11,000
This is an em who splits off a short-term copy

234
0:11:11.864,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to do a short-term task and then end.

235
0:11:13.752,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They have the same two attitude possibilities.

236
0:11:15.982,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They can say, "I'm a new short-term creature with a short life. I hate this."

237
0:11:19.685,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Or "I'm a part of a larger creature who won't remember this part."

238
0:11:22.843,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I predict they'll have that second attitude,

239
0:11:24.985,000 --> 0:11:27,000
not because it's philosophically correct, but because it helps them get along.

240
0:11:28.685,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Today, if the president says we must invade Iraq,

241
0:11:31.037,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and you say, "Why?"

242
0:11:32.212,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and they say, "State secret,"

243
0:11:33.618,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you're not sure if you can trust them,

244
0:11:35.492,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but for ems, a copy of the president and a copy of you can go inside a safe,

245
0:11:39.132,000 --> 0:11:4,000
explain all their secret reasons,

246
0:11:40.81,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and then one bit comes out from your copy to yourself,

247
0:11:43.365,000 --> 0:11:44,000
telling you if you were convinced.

248
0:11:45.245,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So now you can know there is a good reason.

249
0:11:47.796,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I know you guys are all eager to evaluate this world.

250
0:11:50.365,000 --> 0:11:52,000
You're eager to decide if you love it or hate it.

251
0:11:52.723,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But think: your ancestors from thousands of years ago

252
0:11:55.29,000 --> 0:11:56,000
would have loved or hated your world

253
0:11:57.067,000 --> 0:11:59,000
based on the first few things they heard about it,

254
0:11:59.512,000 --> 0:12:,000
because your world is really just weird.

255
0:12:01.399,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So before judging a strange future world, you should really learn a lot about it,

256
0:12:05.237,000 --> 0:12:06,000
maybe read a whole book about it,

257
0:12:06.851,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and then, if you don't like it, work to change it.

258
0:12:09.229,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Thank you.

259
0:12:10.272,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

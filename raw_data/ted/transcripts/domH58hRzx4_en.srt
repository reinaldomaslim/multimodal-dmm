1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, what I'd like to talk about is something

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
how do we discover what is really particular about a project?

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;

7
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place

8
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the uniqueness of a program in a building.

9
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas,

10
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum

11
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
on a site, right downtown by the river.

12
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.

13
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Unfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard

14
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,"

15
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.

16
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And it took six months to reroute it.

18
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The first image I showed the building committee was

19
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur

20
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
because I talked about what makes a building a building of science.

21
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And it seemed to me that this structure -- complex, rich and yet

22
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
totally rational: it's an instrument -- had something to do with science,

23
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.

24
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And so my first sketch after I left was to say,

25
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building."

26
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I got all excited and came back, and

27
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
they sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?

28
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island --

29
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs."

30
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

31
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And so the process began and they said,

32
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
"You can't put it all on an island;

33
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
some of it has to be on the mainland because

34
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we don't want to turn our back to the community."

35
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island

36
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and you could walk through them or on the roof.

37
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And there were all kinds of exciting features:

38
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
you could come in through the landside buildings,

39
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.

40
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,

41
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,

42
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
come back and pay the five dollars admission.

43
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy

45
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy.

46
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But I was still troubled, and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.

47
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.

48
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It was, what I would say, compositional complexity,

49
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about --

50
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea,

51
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
some kind of a generating geometry.

52
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,

53
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building

54
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.

55
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
A toroid, for those who don't know,

56
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.

57
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And out of this idea started spinning off many,

58
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,

59
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,

60
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.

61
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And finally the building -- this is the model.

62
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And when there were complaints about budget, I said,

63
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."

64
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And here's the building as it opened,

65
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.

66
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the bike route's going right through the building,

67
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.

68
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:

69
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.

70
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Every wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.

71
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Every piece of the building works.

72
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,

73
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and at night, and on opening day.

74
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Going back to 1976.

75
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Applause)

76
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum

77
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,

78
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
which you see here the campus.

79
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I was asked to do a building,

80
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.

81
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I felt very troubled.

82
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it

83
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum,

84
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they are totally saturated with information

85
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and to see yet another museum with information,

86
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it would make them just unable to digest.

87
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And so I made a counter-proposal:

88
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I said, "No building." There was a cave on the site; we tunnel into the hill,

89
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
descend through the rock into an underground chamber.

90
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished

91
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and then you come into a large space.

92
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
There is a single candle flickering in the center;

93
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.

94
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You walk through the space, a voice reads the names,

95
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
ages and place of birth of the children.

96
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This voice does not repeat for six months.

97
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life.

98
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Well, they said, "People won't understand,

99
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."

100
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,

101
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,

102
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,

103
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
came, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.

104
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So, many years after that in 1998,

105
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem

106
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,

107
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.

108
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,

109
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.

110
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?"

111
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,

112
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.

113
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I was very moved by what I saw today.

114
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;

115
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we're about to embark on that.

116
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I'd like you to come and design it."

117
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.

118
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,

119
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
outside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,

120
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and the temple and also next to it the fortress

121
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in

122
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
as he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.

123
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,

124
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
nine kilometers away from the town and the temple,

125
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and said, "That's where we have chosen the location."

126
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.

127
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands --

128
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.

129
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site."

130
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And I recommended they do it right there, on that hill

131
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.

132
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week

133
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and we were working.

134
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

135
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And my proposal was to split the museum into two --

136
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,

137
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and changing exhibitions on the other --

138
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to flood the valley into a series of water gardens

139
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.

140
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs --

141
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel --

142
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,

143
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.

144
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs

145
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.

146
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then I went away for four months

147
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and there was going to be groundbreaking.

148
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind

149
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
had been built ten times bigger for public display on site

150
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and ... the bridge was built!

151
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

152
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Within the working drawings!

153
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And half a million people gathered for the celebrations;

154
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.

155
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;

156
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
there are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years.

157
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Back to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began,

158
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum

159
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because now Washington was built -- the Holocaust Museum in Washington --

160
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.

161
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.

162
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
They said, "Let's rebuild the museum."

163
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter -- the Jews make it hard:

164
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
international competition, phase one, phase two, phase three.

165
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Laughter)

166
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And again, I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion

167
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that a building the size of the Washington building --

168
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill

169
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors

170
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the Holocaust.

171
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.

172
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Just cut the whole museum through the mountain --

173
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
enter from one side of the mountain,

174
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
come out on the other side of the mountain --

175
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.

176
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And here you see the model:

177
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
a reception building and some underground parking.

178
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,

179
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
which cuts right into the hill

180
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and extends right through as you go towards the north.

181
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,

182
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and you see the openings for the light.

183
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,

184
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
which is a skylight on top of that triangle.

185
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And all the galleries,

186
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
as you move through them and so on, are below grade.

187
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And there are chambers carved in the rock --

188
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
concrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts.

189
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
This is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired

190
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the kind of spaces that these galleries could be.

191
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And then, coming towards the north, it opens up:

192
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
it bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city

193
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and of the Jerusalem hills.

194
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months.

195
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,

196
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the U.S. Institute of Peace.

197
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;

198
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,

199
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.

200
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.

201
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.

202
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
If it were to be anywhere in Washington,

203
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
it would be an office building, a conference center,

204
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is --

205
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial,

206
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.

207
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.

208
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces --

209
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
spaces where research goes on, conference centers,

210
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking --

211
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,

212
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.

213
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
You see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,

214
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
very transparent and inviting and looking in.

215
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.

216
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building

217
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera --

218
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that it had to do with whiteness,

219
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.

220
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.

221
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Studies for the structure of the roof,

222
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
which demands maybe new materials:

223
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
how to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,

224
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
how to make it not capricious.

225
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And here studying, in three dimensions,

226
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;

227
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
not something you feel you could just change

228
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
because you stop the design of that particular process.

229
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And so it goes.

230
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I'd like to conclude by saying something ...

231
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
(Applause)

232
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty."

233
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And I know it is not a fashionable term these days,

234
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,

235
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
but it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.

236
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit.

237
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,

238
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Theodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity.

239
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We call a natural object beautiful because we see

240
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function."

241
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.

242
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Nevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us

243
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment

244
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that.

245
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Twenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together,

246
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.

247
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.

248
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
He who seeks order shall find gratification.

249
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.

250
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings

251
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
shall find the joy of self-expression. He who seeks self-expression

252
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
shall fall into the pit of arrogance.

253
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Arrogance is incompatible with nature.

254
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Through nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,

255
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
we shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty."

256
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

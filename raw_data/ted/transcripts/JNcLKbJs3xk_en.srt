1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So let's start talking about that.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
That's what I have behind myself.

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But of course what we have to remember is this.

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And what you have to think about is,

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is I'm going to talk first about the flames --

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
where we are in the economy --

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and then I'm going to take three trends

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that will take place in this conference

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I will try and bring them together.

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Those three trends are

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the ability to engineer cells,

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the ability to engineer tissues,

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and robots.

21
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And somehow it will all make sense.

22
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But anyway, let's start with the economy.

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.

24
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
One is leverage.

25
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And the problem with leverage is

26
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.

27
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.

29
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,

31
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's an investment bank;

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it has 15 to 20 times.

33
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.

34
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Oops.

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.

37
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And that, of course, is the reason why all of you

38
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
are making such generous and wonderful donations

39
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
to these nice folks.

40
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And as you think about that,

41
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?

42
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It ain't pretty.

44
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.

45
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We all love Santa Claus, right?

46
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But the problem with Santa Clause is,

47
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing

48
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and promising folks,

49
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending

50
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
on what we call "entitlements."

51
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.

52
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.

53
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,

54
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
that we've brought that date of reckoning forward

55
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to about 2017.

56
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,

57
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but, guess what?

58
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We're going to start to pay them.

59
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,

60
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.

61
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Right?

62
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.

64
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.

65
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.

66
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And he gave an interview in December.

67
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Here's his first bit of advice.

68
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And here's his second bit of advice.

69
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And, by the way,

70
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.

71
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This stuff is getting serious enough

72
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,

73
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we're going to end up losing the dollar.

74
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then all bets are off.

75
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Let me show you what it looks like.

76
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I think I can safely say

77
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.

78
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This is an actual bill.

79
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And it's 10 triliion dollars.

80
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.

81
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,

82
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
a buck next week.

83
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.

84
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,

85
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --

86
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
you've just got to say no.

87
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."

88
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the reason we have to do that in the short term

89
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is because we have just run out of cash.

90
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.

91
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The orange slice is what's discretionary.

92
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Everything else is mandated.

93
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.

94
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So what we have to start thinking about doing

95
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is capping our medical spending

96
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.

97
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We've got to start thinking about asking people

98
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to retire a little bit later.

99
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.

100
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Your 401(k) just got nailed.

101
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.

102
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.

103
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The reason why that's reasonable is,

104
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
when your grandparents were given Social Security,

105
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.

106
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Sixty-eight is young today.

107
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.

108
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We've got to limit other mandatory spending.

109
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We've got to quit borrowing as much,

110
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.

111
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we've got to end up with a smaller government.

112
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And if we don't start changing this trend line,

113
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we are going to lose the dollar

114
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and start to look like Iceland.

115
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I got what you're thinking.

116
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.

117
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.

118
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

119
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.

120
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis

121
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
back in the late '80s.

122
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And its 225 largest companies today

123
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.

124
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We don't fix this now,

125
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?

126
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.

127
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And unless you want this person

128
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,

129
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we'd better deal with this stuff.

130
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That's the short term. That's the flame part.

131
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That's the financial crisis.

132
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave

133
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that we need to talk about.

134
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
That wave is much larger, much more powerful,

135
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and that's of course the wave of technology.

136
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And what's really important in this stuff is,

137
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
as we cut, we also have to grow.

138
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Among other things, because startup companies

139
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm

140
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and they're about 17.8 percent of output.

141
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.

142
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And that's what we've got to keep growing.

143
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.

144
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.

145
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And that's where these three trends come together.

146
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That's where the ability to engineer microbes,

147
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the ability to engineer tissues,

148
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and the ability to engineer robots

149
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
begin to lead to a reboot.

150
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.

151
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Craig Venter showed up last year

152
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware

153
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.

154
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
In parallel, the folks at MIT

155
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
have been building a standard registry of biological parts.

156
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.

157
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.

158
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And start building stuff.

159
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students

160
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and started to build these little odd creatures.

161
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.

162
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Here was one of the first things they built.

163
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So, cells have this cycle.

164
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
First they don't grow.

165
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Then they grow exponentially.

166
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Then they stop growing.

167
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.

168
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So they engineered these cells

169
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so that when they're growing in the exponential phase,

170
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
they would smell like wintergreen.

171
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.

172
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working

173
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.

174
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This got a bit more complicated two years later.

175
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.

176
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
They started competing.

177
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine

178
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that makes red wine good for you

179
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
into beer.

180
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.

181
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,

182
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."

183
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.

185
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way

186
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that they would act as your kidneys.

187
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.

188
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And people oohed and ahhed,

189
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.

190
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And that was very cool stuff back then.

191
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,

192
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
let me show you what's happened in that period of time.

193
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Two years ago, you saw this creature.

194
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico

195
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
called an axolotl

196
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
that can re-generate its limbs.

197
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.

198
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.

199
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It's almost like leaving Congress.

200
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

201
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,

202
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.

203
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,

204
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.

205
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This should not surprise you, right?

206
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I mean, you're born with no teeth.

207
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.

208
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You re-grow a set of teeth.

209
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,

210
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
unless, if you're a lawyer.

211
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Laughter)

212
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But, of course, for most of us,

213
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,

214
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,

215
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and simply implant it.

216
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And we can do it with other things.

217
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,

218
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they took all the cells off the trachea,

219
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.

220
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
She regrew her own trachea,

221
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and 72 hours later it was implanted.

222
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
She's now running around with her kids.

223
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest

224
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,

225
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and he's also re-growing bladders.

226
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So there are now nine women walking around Boston

227
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
with re-grown bladders,

228
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags

229
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
for the rest of your life.

230
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
This is kind of getting boring, right?

231
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I mean, you understand where this story's going.

232
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
But, I mean it gets more interesting.

233
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,

234
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
leaving just the cartilage.

235
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.

236
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.

237
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Life happens.

238
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This may be one of the ultimate papers.

239
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,

240
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.

241
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
That meant that you can take the stuff right here,

242
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and turn it into almost anything in your body.

243
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,

244
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
it's moving in a whole series of places.

245
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Third trend: robots.

246
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now

247
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
we would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.

248
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And all we've got is a Roomba.

249
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

250
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.

251
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Didn't happen.

252
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?

253
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So, Rosie runs around on skates

254
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and the other one ran on flat threads.

255
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
If you don't have a flat world, that's not good,

256
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.

257
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."

258
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

259
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,

260
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,

261
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal --

262
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that's when computers have reached human intelligence.

263
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This is not an intelligence Turing rest,

264
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.

265
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And this stuff is moving very quickly,

266
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.

267
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
These are not the only interesting robots.

268
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You've also got flies, the size of flies,

269
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.

270
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.

271
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And as you bring these things together,

272
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,

273
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
you begin to get some really odd questions.

274
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
In the last Olympics, this gentleman,

275
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
who had several world records in the Special Olympics,

276
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
tried to run in the normal Olympics.

277
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The only issue with Oscar Pistorius

278
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.

279
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
He came within about a second of qualifying.

280
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
He sued to be allowed to run,

281
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and he won the suit,

282
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but didn't qualify by time.

283
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,

284
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
is going to make the time.

285
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.

286
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means

287
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --

288
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?

289
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,

290
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and then your parents had these odd boxes

291
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that would squawk at odd times during dinner,

292
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.

293
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And now you have cochlear implants

294
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.

295
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.

296
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,

297
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and these are machine generations, not human generations.

298
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,

299
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,

300
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.

301
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
They'll be able to focus their hearing,

302
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,

303
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
do a series of things that we can't do.

304
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And the same thing is happening in eyes.

305
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes

306
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.

307
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Very primitive.

308
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And then they'll be able to see shape.

309
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,

310
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.

311
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,

312
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,

313
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
they'll be able to come into a microfocus.

314
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
They'll do stuff you and I can't do.

315
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
All of these things are coming together,

316
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and it's a particularly important thing to understand,

317
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
as we worry about the flames of the present,

318
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to keep an eye on the future.

319
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,

320
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.

321
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."

322
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.

323
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.

324
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
There have actually been 22 species of hominids

325
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,

326
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
have gone extinct.

327
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
It is common for hominids to evolve.

328
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,

329
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,

330
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and Homo sapiens, all overlap.

331
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,

332
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
not one.

333
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And as you think of the implications of that,

334
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
here's a brief history of the universe.

335
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,

336
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,

337
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.

338
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,

339
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and then you got life about four billion years ago,

340
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,

341
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.

342
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Ta-dah!

343
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,

344
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,

345
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff

346
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
is to create what's in this room.

347
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Maybe not.

348
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.

349
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
(Laughter)

350
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?

351
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Laughter)

352
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.

353
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.

354
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.

355
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I think most of us are going to glance at it,

356
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.

357
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends

358
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control

359
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.

360
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.

361
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Thank you very much.

362
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
(Applause)

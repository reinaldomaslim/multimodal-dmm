1
0:00:12.877,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My research lab sits about a mile from where several bombs exploded

2
0:00:17.527,000 --> 0:00:19,000
during the Boston Marathon in 2013.

3
0:00:21.036,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The surviving bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of Chechnya,

4
0:00:24.997,000 --> 0:00:26,000
was tried, convicted and sentenced to death.

5
0:00:28.791,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, when a jury has to make the decision

6
0:00:31.101,000 --> 0:00:34,000
between life in prison and the death penalty,

7
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they base their decision largely on whether or not the defendant

8
0:00:39.459,000 --> 0:00:41,000
feels remorseful for his actions.

9
0:00:42.024,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Tsarnaev spoke words of apology,

10
0:00:44.773,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but when jurors looked at his face,

11
0:00:47.001,000 --> 0:00:5,000
all they saw was a stone-faced stare.

12
0:00:52.3,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, Tsarnaev is guilty, there's no doubt about that.

13
0:00:55.982,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He murdered and maimed innocent people,

14
0:00:59.424,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I'm not here to debate that.

15
0:01:01.417,000 --> 0:01:03,000
My heart goes out to all the people who suffered.

16
0:01:04.668,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But as a scientist, I have to tell you

17
0:01:07.398,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that jurors do not and cannot detect remorse

18
0:01:11.764,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or any other emotion in anybody ever.

19
0:01:16.572,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Neither can I, and neither can you,

20
0:01:19.644,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and that's because emotions are not what we think they are.

21
0:01:22.731,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They are not universally expressed and recognized.

22
0:01:26.485,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They are not hardwired brain reactions

23
0:01:30.152,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that are uncontrollable.

24
0:01:32.997,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We have misunderstood the nature of emotion

25
0:01:35.291,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for a very long time,

26
0:01:37.805,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and understanding what emotions really are has important consequences for all of us.

27
0:01:43.687,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I have studied emotions as a scientist for the past 25 years,

28
0:01:47.635,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and in my lab, we have probed human faces by measuring electrical signals

29
0:01:53.209,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that cause your facial muscles to contract to make facial expressions.

30
0:01:57.742,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We have scrutinized the human body in emotion.

31
0:02:01.881,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We have analyzed hundreds of physiology studies

32
0:02:05.5,000 --> 0:02:07,000
involving thousands of test subjects.

33
0:02:08.167,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We've scanned hundreds of brains,

34
0:02:09.898,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and examined every brain imaging study on emotion

35
0:02:13.032,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that has been published in the past 20 years.

36
0:02:15.929,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the results of all of this research are overwhelmingly consistent.

37
0:02:22.445,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It may feel to you like your emotions are hardwired

38
0:02:27.693,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and they just trigger and happen to you,

39
0:02:30.867,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but they don't.

40
0:02:32.984,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You might believe that your brain is prewired with emotion circuits,

41
0:02:38.183,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that you're born with emotion circuits, but you're not.

42
0:02:41.516,000 --> 0:02:45,000
In fact, none of us in this room have emotion circuits in our brain.

43
0:02:45.541,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In fact, no brain on this planet contains emotion circuits.

44
0:02:51.432,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So what are emotions, really?

45
0:02:55.185,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, strap on your seat belt, because ...

46
0:02:59.815,000 --> 0:03:01,000
emotions are guesses.

47
0:03:02.482,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They are guesses that your brain constructs in the moment

48
0:03:08.299,000 --> 0:03:12,000
where billions of brain cells are working together,

49
0:03:12.418,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and you have more control over those guesses

50
0:03:15.519,000 --> 0:03:16,000
than you might imagine that you do.

51
0:03:19.352,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Now, if that sounds preposterous to you, or, you know, kind of crazy,

52
0:03:23.002,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I'm right there with you, because frankly, if I hadn't seen the evidence for myself,

53
0:03:27.534,000 --> 0:03:29,000
decades of evidence for myself,

54
0:03:29.614,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I am fairly sure that I wouldn't believe it either.

55
0:03:32.675,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But the bottom line is that emotions are not built into your brain at birth.

56
0:03:39.655,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They are just built.

57
0:03:43.289,000 --> 0:03:45,000
To see what I mean, have a look at this.

58
0:03:46.648,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Right now, your brain is working like crazy.

59
0:03:51.355,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Your neurons are firing like mad trying to make meaning out of this

60
0:03:55.466,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so that you see something other than black and white blobs.

61
0:03:58.626,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Your brain is sifting through a lifetime of experience,

62
0:04:03.133,000 --> 0:04:05,000
making thousands of guesses at the same time,

63
0:04:05.992,000 --> 0:04:06,000
weighing the probabilities,

64
0:04:08.001,000 --> 0:04:09,000
trying to answer the question,

65
0:04:09.921,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"What is this most like?"

66
0:04:12.017,000 --> 0:04:13,000
not "What is it?"

67
0:04:13.27,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but "What is this most like in my past experience?"

68
0:04:16.951,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And this is all happening in the blink of an eye.

69
0:04:19.89,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now if your brain is still struggling to find a good match

70
0:04:24.454,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and you still see black and white blobs,

71
0:04:27.012,000 --> 0:04:31,000
then you are in a state called "experiential blindness,"

72
0:04:31.245,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and I am going to cure you of your blindness.

73
0:04:35.156,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This is my favorite part. Are you ready to be cured?

74
0:04:37.719,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Cheers)

75
0:04:39.538,000 --> 0:04:4,000
All right. Here we go.

76
0:04:43.849,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Gasps)

77
0:04:48.648,000 --> 0:04:49,000
All right.

78
0:04:49.965,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So now many of you see a snake,

79
0:04:54.224,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and why is that?

80
0:04:55.757,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Because as your brain is sifting through your past experience,

81
0:05:00.423,000 --> 0:05:01,000
there's new knowledge there,

82
0:05:01.876,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the knowledge that came from the photograph.

83
0:05:04.491,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And what's really cool is that

84
0:05:06.749,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that knowledge which you just acquired moments ago

85
0:05:09.535,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is changing how you experience these blobs right now.

86
0:05:15.134,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So your brain is constructing the image of a snake

87
0:05:18.382,000 --> 0:05:2,000
where there is no snake,

88
0:05:20.533,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and this kind of a hallucination

89
0:05:23.12,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is what neuroscientists like me call "predictions."

90
0:05:26.995,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Predictions are basically the way your brain works.

91
0:05:30.805,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's business as usual for your brain.

92
0:05:33.345,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Predictions are the basis of every experience that you have.

93
0:05:36.616,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They are the basis of every action that you take.

94
0:05:39.363,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In fact, predictions are what allow you to understand the words that I'm speaking

95
0:05:44.53,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as they come out of my --

96
0:05:47.024,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Audience: Mouth. Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mouth. Exactly.

97
0:05:49.644,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Predictions are primal.

98
0:05:53.063,000 --> 0:05:56,000
They help us to make sense of the world in a quick and efficient way.

99
0:05:56.5,000 --> 0:06:,000
So your brain does not react to the world.

100
0:06:02.809,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Using past experience,

101
0:06:04.74,000 --> 0:06:07,000
your brain predicts and constructs

102
0:06:07.926,000 --> 0:06:08,000
your experience of the world.

103
0:06:12.057,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The way that we see emotions in others are deeply rooted in predictions.

104
0:06:17.893,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So to us, it feels like we just look at someone's face,

105
0:06:20.916,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and we just read the emotion that's there in their facial expressions

106
0:06:24.725,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the way that we would read words on a page.

107
0:06:26.974,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But actually, under the hood, your brain is predicting.

108
0:06:31.228,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's using past experience based on similar situations

109
0:06:35.162,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to try to make meaning.

110
0:06:36.876,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This time, you're not making meaning of blobs,

111
0:06:39.401,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you're making meaning of facial movements

112
0:06:42.154,000 --> 0:06:45,000
like the curl of a lip or the raise of an eyebrow.

113
0:06:46.194,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that stone-faced stare?

114
0:06:48.341,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That might be someone who is a remorseless killer,

115
0:06:53.364,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but a stone-faced stare might also mean

116
0:06:55.3,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that someone is stoically accepting defeat,

117
0:06:58.613,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which is in fact what Chechen culture prescribes for someone

118
0:07:02.428,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's situation.

119
0:07:05.958,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So the lesson here

120
0:07:08.265,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is that emotions that you seem to detect in other people

121
0:07:12.719,000 --> 0:07:16,000
actually come in part from what's inside your own head.

122
0:07:17.466,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And this is true in the courtroom,

123
0:07:20.062,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but it's also true in the classroom,

124
0:07:23.045,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the bedroom,

125
0:07:25.112,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and in the boardroom.

126
0:07:28.366,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And so here's my concern:

127
0:07:30.248,000 --> 0:07:32,000
tech companies which shall remain nameless ...

128
0:07:34.047,000 --> 0:07:35,000
well, maybe not.

129
0:07:35.221,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You know, Google, Facebook --

130
0:07:36.697,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:40.133,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are spending millions of research dollars to build emotion-detection systems,

132
0:07:45.84,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and they are fundamentally asking the wrong question,

133
0:07:48.894,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because they're trying to detect emotions in the face and the body,

134
0:07:53.862,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but emotions aren't in your face and body.

135
0:07:57.137,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Physical movements have no intrinsic emotional meaning.

136
0:08:03.741,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We have to make them meaningful.

137
0:08:05.72,000 --> 0:08:08,000
A human or something else has to connect them to the context,

138
0:08:09.329,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and that makes them meaningful.

139
0:08:11.139,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That's how we know that a smile might mean sadness

140
0:08:16.949,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and a cry might mean happiness,

141
0:08:20.005,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and a stoic, still face might mean

142
0:08:23.591,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that you are angrily plotting the demise of your enemy.

143
0:08:29.873,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, if I haven't already gone out on a limb,

144
0:08:33.294,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I'll just edge out on that limb a little further and tell you

145
0:08:36.706,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that the way that you experience your own emotion

146
0:08:40.166,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is exactly the same process.

147
0:08:43.071,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Your brain is basically making predictions, guesses,

148
0:08:47.786,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that it's constructing in the moment

149
0:08:50.096,000 --> 0:08:54,000
with billions of neurons working together.

150
0:08:55.106,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now your brain does come prewired to make some feelings,

151
0:08:59.417,000 --> 0:09:03,000
simple feelings that come from the physiology of your body.

152
0:09:04.243,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So when you're born,

153
0:09:05.951,000 --> 0:09:09,000
you can make feelings like calmness and agitation,

154
0:09:10.369,000 --> 0:09:12,000
excitement, comfort, discomfort.

155
0:09:13.266,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But these simple feelings are not emotions.

156
0:09:16.313,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They're actually with you every waking moment of your life.

157
0:09:20.694,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They are simple summaries of what's going on inside your body,

158
0:09:25.299,000 --> 0:09:26,000
kind of like a barometer.

159
0:09:27.908,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But they have very little detail,

160
0:09:30.004,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and you need that detail to know what to do next.

161
0:09:32.931,000 --> 0:09:33,000
What do you about these feelings?

162
0:09:35.061,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And so how does your brain give you that detail?

163
0:09:37.339,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Well, that's what predictions are.

164
0:09:39.117,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Predictions link the sensations in your body

165
0:09:42.57,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that give you these simple feelings

166
0:09:44.404,000 --> 0:09:46,000
with what's going on around you in the world

167
0:09:46.483,000 --> 0:09:47,000
so that you know what to do.

168
0:09:47.856,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And sometimes,

169
0:09:49.357,000 --> 0:09:54,000
those constructions are emotions.

170
0:09:54.419,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So for example, if you were to walk into a bakery,

171
0:09:59.198,000 --> 0:10:02,000
your brain might predict that you will encounter

172
0:10:03.031,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the delicious aroma of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.

173
0:10:07.531,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I know my brain would predict

174
0:10:09.29,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the delicious aroma of freshly baked chocolate cookies.

175
0:10:11.921,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And our brains might cause our stomachs to churn a little bit,

176
0:10:14.936,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to prepare for eating those cookies.

177
0:10:17.921,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And if we are correct,

178
0:10:19.676,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if in fact some cookies have just come out of the oven,

179
0:10:22.723,000 --> 0:10:24,000
then our brains will have constructed hunger,

180
0:10:25.689,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and we are prepared to munch down those cookies

181
0:10:29.641,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and digest them in a very efficient way,

182
0:10:32.039,000 --> 0:10:33,000
meaning that we can eat a lot of them,

183
0:10:33.888,000 --> 0:10:34,000
which would be a really good thing.

184
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You guys are not laughing enough. I'm totally serious.

185
0:10:38.708,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

186
0:10:42.549,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But here's the thing.

187
0:10:43.723,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That churning stomach,

188
0:10:46.151,000 --> 0:10:48,000
if it occurs in a different situation,

189
0:10:48.325,000 --> 0:10:5,000
it can have a completely different meaning.

190
0:10:50.349,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So if your brain were to predict a churning stomach

191
0:10:53.928,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in, say, a hospital room while you're waiting for test results,

192
0:10:58.951,000 --> 0:11:,000
then your brain will be constructing dread

193
0:11:01.674,000 --> 0:11:03,000
or worry or anxiety,

194
0:11:04.197,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and it might cause you to, maybe,

195
0:11:07.919,000 --> 0:11:09,000
wring your hands

196
0:11:10.434,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or take a deep breath or even cry.

197
0:11:13.808,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Right? Same physical sensation, same churning stomach,

198
0:11:18.505,000 --> 0:11:19,000
different experience.

199
0:11:20.678,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And so the lesson here

200
0:11:22.401,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is that emotions which seem to happen to you

201
0:11:26.56,000 --> 0:11:28,000
are actually made by you.

202
0:11:32.115,000 --> 0:11:37,000
You are not at the mercy of mythical emotion circuits

203
0:11:37.163,000 --> 0:11:4,000
which are buried deep inside some ancient part of your brain.

204
0:11:42.006,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You have more control over your emotions

205
0:11:45.712,000 --> 0:11:46,000
than you think you do.

206
0:11:47.291,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I don't mean that you can just snap your fingers

207
0:11:49.594,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and change how you feel the way that you would change your clothes,

208
0:11:53.802,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but your brain is wired

209
0:11:56.333,000 --> 0:12:02,000
so that if you change the ingredients that your brain uses to make emotion,

210
0:12:02.389,000 --> 0:12:05,000
then you can transform your emotional life.

211
0:12:06.274,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So if you change those ingredients today,

212
0:12:09.13,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you're basically teaching your brain how to predict differently tomorrow,

213
0:12:14.042,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and this is what I call being the architect of your experience.

214
0:12:20.605,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So here's an example.

215
0:12:23.771,000 --> 0:12:26,000
All of us have had a nervous feeling before a test, right?

216
0:12:27.974,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But some people experience crippling anxiety before a test.

217
0:12:32.467,000 --> 0:12:33,000
They have test anxiety.

218
0:12:35.406,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Based on past experiences of taking tests,

219
0:12:40.12,000 --> 0:12:43,000
their brains predict a hammering heartbeat,

220
0:12:43.469,000 --> 0:12:44,000
sweaty hands,

221
0:12:44.912,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so much so that they are unable to actually take the test.

222
0:12:50.436,000 --> 0:12:51,000
They don't perform well,

223
0:12:51.722,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and sometimes they not only fail courses but they actually might fail college.

224
0:12:57.131,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But here's the thing:

225
0:12:59.036,000 --> 0:13:02,000
a hammering heartbeat is not necessarily anxiety.

226
0:13:02.872,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It could be that your body is preparing to do battle

227
0:13:08.031,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and ace that test ...

228
0:13:10.449,000 --> 0:13:12,000
or, you know, give a talk

229
0:13:12.648,000 --> 0:13:15,000
in front of hundreds of people on a stage where you're being filmed.

230
0:13:16.268,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Laughter)

231
0:13:17.887,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I'm serious.

232
0:13:19.158,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

233
0:13:21.529,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And research shows that when students learn

234
0:13:26.014,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to make this kind of energized determination

235
0:13:28.769,000 --> 0:13:29,000
instead of anxiety,

236
0:13:30.234,000 --> 0:13:32,000
they perform better on tests.

237
0:13:33.145,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And that determination seeds their brain to predict differently in the future

238
0:13:38.063,000 --> 0:13:41,000
so that they can get their butterflies flying in formation.

239
0:13:41.507,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And if they do that often enough,

240
0:13:43.683,000 --> 0:13:45,000
they not only can pass a test

241
0:13:46.255,000 --> 0:13:49,000
but it will be easier for them to pass their courses,

242
0:13:49.303,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and they might even finish college,

243
0:13:52.288,000 --> 0:13:56,000
which has a huge impact on their future earning potential.

244
0:13:57.458,000 --> 0:14:,000
So I call this emotional intelligence in action.

245
0:14:01.93,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Now you can cultivate this emotional intelligence yourself

246
0:14:05.538,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and use it in your everyday life.

247
0:14:07.828,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So just, you know,

248
0:14:09.737,000 --> 0:14:1,000
imagine waking up in the morning.

249
0:14:11.341,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I'm sure you've had this experience. I know I have.

250
0:14:13.8,000 --> 0:14:15,000
You wake up and as you're emerging into consciousness,

251
0:14:16.459,000 --> 0:14:19,000
you feel this horrible dread,

252
0:14:19.674,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you know, this real wretchedness,

253
0:14:21.699,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and immediately, your mind starts to race.

254
0:14:24.405,000 --> 0:14:27,000
You start to think about all the crap that you have to do at work

255
0:14:27.509,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and you have that mountain of email

256
0:14:29.241,000 --> 0:14:31,000
which you will never dig yourself out of ever,

257
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
the phone calls you have to return,

258
0:14:34.01,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and that important meeting across town,

259
0:14:35.906,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and you're going to have to fight traffic,

260
0:14:37.969,000 --> 0:14:38,000
you'll be late picking your kids up,

261
0:14:39.714,000 --> 0:14:41,000
your dog is sick, and what are you going to make for dinner?

262
0:14:42.562,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Oh my God.

263
0:14:43.769,000 --> 0:14:44,000
What is wrong with your life?

264
0:14:45.299,000 --> 0:14:46,000
What is wrong with my life?

265
0:14:46.909,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Laughter)

266
0:14:52.403,000 --> 0:14:54,000
That mind racing is prediction.

267
0:14:55.51,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Your brain is searching to find an explanation

268
0:15:00.256,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for those sensations in your body that you experience as wretchedness,

269
0:15:05.9,000 --> 0:15:08,000
just like you did with the blobby image.

270
0:15:10.95,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So your brain is trying to explain what caused those sensations

271
0:15:16.489,000 --> 0:15:18,000
so that you know what to do about them.

272
0:15:19.242,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But those sensations

273
0:15:20.878,000 --> 0:15:23,000
might not be an indication that anything is wrong with your life.

274
0:15:24.296,000 --> 0:15:26,000
They might have a purely physical cause.

275
0:15:27.132,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Maybe you're tired.

276
0:15:28.371,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Maybe you didn't sleep enough.

277
0:15:29.825,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Maybe you're hungry.

278
0:15:31.199,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Maybe you're dehydrated.

279
0:15:33.691,000 --> 0:15:38,000
The next time that you feel intense distress,

280
0:15:39.314,000 --> 0:15:4,000
ask yourself:

281
0:15:41.049,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Could this have a purely physical cause?

282
0:15:45.208,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Is it possible that you can transform

283
0:15:48.84,000 --> 0:15:51,000
emotional suffering into just mere physical discomfort?

284
0:15:54.182,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Now I am not suggesting to you

285
0:15:56.65,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that you can just perform a couple of Jedi mind tricks

286
0:15:59.595,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and talk yourself out of being depressed

287
0:16:02.611,000 --> 0:16:06,000
or anxious or any kind of serious condition.

288
0:16:07.15,000 --> 0:16:08,000
But I am telling you

289
0:16:08.809,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that you have more control over your emotions than you might imagine,

290
0:16:12.706,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and that you have the capacity

291
0:16:14.626,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to turn down the dial on emotional suffering

292
0:16:17.731,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and its consequences for your life

293
0:16:19.889,000 --> 0:16:21,000
by learning how to construct your experiences differently.

294
0:16:24.112,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And all of us can do this

295
0:16:25.89,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and with a little practice, we can get really good at it,

296
0:16:28.805,000 --> 0:16:29,000
like driving.

297
0:16:30.074,000 --> 0:16:31,000
At first, it takes a lot of effort,

298
0:16:31.858,000 --> 0:16:33,000
but eventually it becomes pretty automatic.

299
0:16:35.302,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Now I don't know about you,

300
0:16:36.634,000 --> 0:16:41,000
but I find this to be a really empowering and inspiring message,

301
0:16:41.978,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and the fact that it's backed up by decades of research

302
0:16:44.637,000 --> 0:16:46,000
makes me also happy as a scientist.

303
0:16:47.57,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But I have to also warn you that it does come with some fine print,

304
0:16:50.737,000 --> 0:16:54,000
because more control also means more responsibility.

305
0:16:57.225,000 --> 0:17:01,000
If you are not at the mercy of mythical emotion circuits

306
0:17:01.498,000 --> 0:17:03,000
which are buried deep inside your brain somewhere

307
0:17:03.819,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and which trigger automatically,

308
0:17:05.956,000 --> 0:17:07,000
then who's responsible,

309
0:17:08.637,000 --> 0:17:1,000
who is responsible when you behave badly?

310
0:17:12.422,000 --> 0:17:13,000
You are.

311
0:17:14.028,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Not because you're culpable for your emotions,

312
0:17:17.074,000 --> 0:17:21,000
but because the actions and the experiences that you make today

313
0:17:22.086,000 --> 0:17:24,000
become your brain's predictions for tomorrow.

314
0:17:25.775,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Sometimes we are responsible for something

315
0:17:28.665,000 --> 0:17:3,000
not because we're to blame

316
0:17:31.326,000 --> 0:17:34,000
but because we're the only ones who can change it.

317
0:17:35.75,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Now responsibility is a big word.

318
0:17:38.199,000 --> 0:17:39,000
It's so big, in fact,

319
0:17:39.945,000 --> 0:17:44,000
that sometimes people feel the need to resist the scientific evidence

320
0:17:45.508,000 --> 0:17:48,000
that emotions are built and not built in.

321
0:17:50.86,000 --> 0:17:54,000
The idea that we are responsible for our own emotions

322
0:17:55.156,000 --> 0:17:57,000
seems very hard to swallow.

323
0:17:59.027,000 --> 0:18:02,000
But what I'm suggesting to you is you don't have to choke on that idea.

324
0:18:02.853,000 --> 0:18:03,000
You just take a deep breath,

325
0:18:04.257,000 --> 0:18:06,000
maybe get yourself a glass of water if you need to,

326
0:18:07.219,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and embrace it.

327
0:18:08.399,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Embrace that responsibility,

328
0:18:10.074,000 --> 0:18:14,000
because it is the path to a healthier body,

329
0:18:14.526,000 --> 0:18:17,000
a more just and informed legal system,

330
0:18:18.467,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and a more flexible and potent emotional life.

331
0:18:21.935,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you.

332
0:18:23.11,000 --> 0:18:27,000
(Applause)

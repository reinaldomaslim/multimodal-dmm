1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So for the past year and a half,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
my team at Push Pop Press

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
have been working on creating

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the first feature-length interactive book.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's called "Our Choice"

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and the author is Al Gore.

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and it explores all the solutions

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that will solve the climate crisis.

11
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The book starts like this. This is the cover.

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
As the globe spins,

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we can see our location,

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and we can open the book

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and swipe through the chapters

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to browse the book.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And if we wanted to zoom into a page,

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we can just open it up.

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And anything you see in the book,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
you can pick up with two fingers

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and lift off the page

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and open up.

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And if you want to go back

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and read the book again,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
among the majority

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who look at windmills and feel

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And throughout the book,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
there's over an hour of documentary footage

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and interactive animations.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So you can open this one.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
MM: It starts playing immediately.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and the movie keeps playing.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and the video keeps playing.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But one of the coolest things in this book

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are the interactive infographics.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This one shows the wind potential

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
all around the United States.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But instead of just showing us the information,

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we can take our finger and explore,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and see, state by state,

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
exactly how much wind potential there is.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We can do the same for geothermal energy

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and solar power.

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is one of my favorites.

57
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So this shows ...

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Applause)

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
When the wind is blowing,

61
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
any excess energy coming from the windmill

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is diverted into the battery.

63
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And as the wind starts dying down,

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
any excess energy will be diverted back into the house --

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the lights never go out.

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It also runs on the iPhone.

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.

70
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And it works the exact same way.

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You can pinch into any page.

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Open it up.

73
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So that's Push Pop Press' first title,

74
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Al Gore's "Our Choice."

75
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Thank you.

76
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Applause)

77
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.

78
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Do you want to be a publisher,

79
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
a technology licenser?

80
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What is the business here?

81
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Is this something that other people can do?

82
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool

83
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.

84
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast --

85
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and we're on the West coast, building the software --

86
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
takes our tool

87
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and, every day, drags in images and text.

88
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
CA: So you want to license this software to publishers

89
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.)

90
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
All right. Mike, thanks so much.

91
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.)

92
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Applause)

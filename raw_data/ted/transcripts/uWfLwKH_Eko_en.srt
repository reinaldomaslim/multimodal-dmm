1
0:00:12.761,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What has the War on Drugs done to the world?

2
0:00:16.975,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico,

3
0:00:19.152,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Central America, so many other parts of the planet,

4
0:00:22.999,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the global black market estimated

5
0:00:24.799,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at 300 billion dollars a year,

6
0:00:27.375,000 --> 0:00:3,000
prisons packed in the United States and elsewhere,

7
0:00:30.817,000 --> 0:00:32,000
police and military drawn into an unwinnable war

8
0:00:33.495,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that violates basic rights, and ordinary citizens

9
0:00:36.757,000 --> 0:00:38,000
just hope they don't get caught in the crossfire,

10
0:00:39.738,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and meanwhile, more people using

11
0:00:42.1,000 --> 0:00:44,000
more drugs than ever.

12
0:00:44.361,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's my country's history with alcohol prohibition

13
0:00:46.656,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and Al Capone, times 50.

14
0:00:49.783,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Which is why it's particularly galling to me

15
0:00:53.336,000 --> 0:00:56,000
as an American that we've been the driving force

16
0:00:56.465,000 --> 0:00:58,000
behind this global drug war.

17
0:00:58.501,000 --> 0:01:,000
Ask why so many countries criminalize

18
0:01:00.503,000 --> 0:01:01,000
drugs they'd never heard of,

19
0:01:02.292,000 --> 0:01:05,000
why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize

20
0:01:05.318,000 --> 0:01:07,000
criminalization over health,

21
0:01:07.54,000 --> 0:01:09,000
even why most of the money worldwide

22
0:01:09.884,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for dealing with drug abuse goes not

23
0:01:11.549,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to helping agencies but those that punish,

24
0:01:14.32,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and you'll find the good old U.S. of A.

25
0:01:17.639,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Why did we do this?

26
0:01:19.817,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Some people, especially in Latin America,

27
0:01:23.113,000 --> 0:01:24,000
think it's not really about drugs.

28
0:01:24.846,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's just a subterfuge for advancing

29
0:01:27.009,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the realpolitik interests of the U.S.

30
0:01:30.167,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But by and large, that's not it.

31
0:01:33.53,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We don't want gangsters and guerrillas

32
0:01:36.443,000 --> 0:01:38,000
funded with illegal drug money

33
0:01:38.513,000 --> 0:01:41,000
terrorizing and taking over other nations.

34
0:01:41.629,000 --> 0:01:45,000
No, the fact is, America really is crazy

35
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when it comes to drugs.

36
0:01:48.04,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I mean, don't forget, we're the ones who thought

37
0:01:50.2,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that we could prohibit alcohol.

38
0:01:51.866,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So think about our global drug war

39
0:01:54.149,000 --> 0:01:56,000
not as any sort of rational policy,

40
0:01:56.885,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but as the international projection

41
0:01:59.627,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of a domestic psychosis.

42
0:02:03.114,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But here's the good news.

44
0:02:07.827,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us.

45
0:02:11.12,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Most politicians in my country

46
0:02:12.7,000 --> 0:02:13,000
want to roll back the Drug War now,

47
0:02:14.021,000 --> 0:02:16,000
put fewer people behind bars, not more,

48
0:02:16.833,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I'm proud to say as an American

49
0:02:19.342,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that we now lead the world

50
0:02:20.926,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in reforming marijuana policies.

51
0:02:23.166,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's now legal for medical purposes

52
0:02:25.112,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in almost half our 50 states,

53
0:02:26.912,000 --> 0:02:28,000
millions of people can purchase their marijuana,

54
0:02:29.274,000 --> 0:02:31,000
their medicine, in government- licensed dispensaries,

55
0:02:32.19,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and over half my fellow citizens now say it's time

56
0:02:35.27,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to legally regulate and tax marijuana

57
0:02:37.643,000 --> 0:02:38,000
more or less like alcohol.

58
0:02:39.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
That's what Colorado and Washington are doing,

59
0:02:41.287,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and Uruguay, and others are sure to follow.

60
0:02:45.673,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So that's what I do:

61
0:02:48.161,000 --> 0:02:51,000
work to end the Drug War.

62
0:02:51.967,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I think it all started growing up

63
0:02:54.626,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in a fairly religious, moral family,

64
0:02:57.205,000 --> 0:02:59,000
eldest son of a rabbi,

65
0:02:59.241,000 --> 0:03:01,000
going off to university where I

66
0:03:01.412,000 --> 0:03:04,000
smoked some marijuana

67
0:03:04.762,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and I liked it. (Laughter)

68
0:03:06.98,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And I liked drinking too, but it was obvious

69
0:03:09.455,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two,

70
0:03:11.93,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but my friends and I could get busted

71
0:03:13.617,000 --> 0:03:14,000
for smoking a joint.

72
0:03:15.19,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,

73
0:03:17.749,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on international drug control.

74
0:03:20.69,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I talked my way into the State Department.

75
0:03:23.18,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I got a security clearance.

76
0:03:24.409,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I interviewed hundreds of DEA and other law enforcement agents

77
0:03:27.373,000 --> 0:03:29,000
all around Europe and the Americas,

78
0:03:29.53,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and I'd ask them,

79
0:03:30.761,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"What do you think the answer is?"

80
0:03:33.385,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Well, in Latin America, they'd say to me,

81
0:03:36.165,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"You can't really cut off the supply.

82
0:03:38.98,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The answer lies back in the U.S.,

83
0:03:40.534,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in cutting off the demand."

84
0:03:42.337,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So then I go back home and I talk to people

85
0:03:44.853,000 --> 0:03:46,000
involved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,

86
0:03:47.453,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"You know, Ethan, you can't really cut off the demand.

87
0:03:50.681,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The answer lies over there. You've got to cut off the supply."

88
0:03:53.628,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Then I'd go and talk to the guys in customs

89
0:03:56.238,000 --> 0:03:58,000
trying to stop drugs at the borders,

90
0:03:58.6,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and they'd say, "You're not going to stop it here.

91
0:04:01.817,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The answer lies over there,

92
0:04:03.786,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in cutting off supply and demand."

93
0:04:06.778,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And it hit me:

94
0:04:08.408,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Everybody involved in this

95
0:04:10.693,000 --> 0:04:12,000
thought the answer lay in that area

96
0:04:13.133,000 --> 0:04:16,000
about which they knew the least.

97
0:04:16.141,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So that's when I started reading everything I could

98
0:04:18.645,000 --> 0:04:2,000
about psychoactive drugs: the history, the science,

99
0:04:21.525,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the politics, all of it,

100
0:04:23.63,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and the more one read,

101
0:04:25.946,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the more it hit you how a thoughtful,

102
0:04:28.488,000 --> 0:04:31,000
enlightened, intelligent approach took you over here,

103
0:04:31.852,000 --> 0:04:33,000
whereas the politics and laws of my country

104
0:04:34.36,000 --> 0:04:36,000
were taking you over here.

105
0:04:36.396,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And that disparity struck me as this incredible

106
0:04:40.187,000 --> 0:04:44,000
intellectual and moral puzzle.

107
0:04:46.385,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There's probably never been

108
0:04:48.411,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a drug-free society.

109
0:04:51.02,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Virtually every society

110
0:04:52.77,000 --> 0:04:54,000
has ingested psychoactive substances

111
0:04:55.171,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to deal with pain, increase our energy, socialize,

112
0:04:58.786,000 --> 0:05:,000
even commune with God.

113
0:05:00.819,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Our desire to alter our consciousness

114
0:05:03.507,000 --> 0:05:05,000
may be as fundamental as our desires

115
0:05:05.937,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for food, companionship and sex.

116
0:05:09.854,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So our true challenge

117
0:05:11.991,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is to learn how to live with drugs

118
0:05:14.871,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so they cause the least possible harm

119
0:05:17.627,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and in some cases the greatest possible benefit.

120
0:05:21.84,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I'll tell you something else I learned,

121
0:05:23.91,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that the reason some drugs are legal and others not

122
0:05:26.998,000 --> 0:05:28,000
has almost nothing to do with science or health

123
0:05:29.956,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or the relative risk of drugs,

124
0:05:31.789,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and almost everything to do with who uses

125
0:05:34.185,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and who is perceived to use particular drugs.

126
0:05:37.313,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In the late 19th century,

127
0:05:39.383,000 --> 0:05:42,000
when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal,

128
0:05:42.723,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the principal consumers of opiates in my country

129
0:05:45.435,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and others were middle-aged white women,

130
0:05:49.239,000 --> 0:05:51,000
using them to alleviate aches and pains

131
0:05:51.598,000 --> 0:05:53,000
when few other analgesics were available.

132
0:05:54.32,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And nobody thought about criminalizing it back then

133
0:05:56.481,000 --> 0:05:58,000
because nobody wanted to put Grandma behind bars.

134
0:05:59.478,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese

135
0:06:01.936,000 --> 0:06:02,000
started showing up in my country,

136
0:06:03.725,000 --> 0:06:05,000
working hard on the railroads and the mines

137
0:06:06.323,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and then kicking back in the evening

138
0:06:07.802,000 --> 0:06:08,000
just like they had in the old country

139
0:06:09.506,000 --> 0:06:11,000
with a few puffs on that opium pipe,

140
0:06:12.163,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that's when you saw the first drug prohibition laws

141
0:06:14.48,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in California and Nevada,

142
0:06:16.28,000 --> 0:06:17,000
driven by racist fears of Chinese

143
0:06:18.158,000 --> 0:06:19,000
transforming white women

144
0:06:19.994,000 --> 0:06:22,000
into opium-addicted sex slaves.

145
0:06:23.378,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The first cocaine prohibition laws, similarly prompted

146
0:06:26.213,000 --> 0:06:29,000
by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder

147
0:06:29.98,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and forgetting their proper place

148
0:06:31.859,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in Southern society.

149
0:06:33.813,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And the first marijuana prohibition laws,

150
0:06:35.796,000 --> 0:06:37,000
all about fears of Mexican migrants

151
0:06:37.869,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in the West and the Southwest.

152
0:06:41.645,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And what was true in my country,

153
0:06:44.379,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is true in so many others as well,

154
0:06:46.876,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with both the origins of these laws

155
0:06:49.12,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and their implementation.

156
0:06:52.543,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Put it this way,

157
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and I exaggerate only slightly:

158
0:06:56.841,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If the principal smokers of cocaine

159
0:06:59.923,000 --> 0:07:,000
were affluent older white men

160
0:07:01.917,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and the principal consumers of Viagra

161
0:07:04.906,000 --> 0:07:05,000
were poor young black men,

162
0:07:06.8,000 --> 0:07:09,000
then smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor

163
0:07:09.912,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and selling Viagra would get you five to 10 years behind bars.

164
0:07:13.197,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Applause)

165
0:07:16.981,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I used to be a professor teaching about this.

166
0:07:20.835,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now I'm an activist, a human rights activist,

167
0:07:24.49,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and what drives me is my shame

168
0:07:27.251,000 --> 0:07:29,000
at living in an otherwise great nation

169
0:07:29.429,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that has less than five percent of the world's population

170
0:07:32.212,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but almost 25 percent of the world's incarcerated population.

171
0:07:35.84,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's the people I meet who have lost someone

172
0:07:38.241,000 --> 0:07:4,000
they love to drug-related violence or prison

173
0:07:40.795,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or overdose or AIDS

174
0:07:42.257,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because our drug policies emphasize

175
0:07:44.237,000 --> 0:07:46,000
criminalization over health.

176
0:07:46.261,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's good people who have lost their jobs,

177
0:07:49.49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
their homes, their freedom, even their children

178
0:07:53.12,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to the state, not because they hurt anyone

179
0:07:56.588,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but solely because they chose to use one drug

180
0:07:59.813,000 --> 0:08:02,000
instead of another.

181
0:08:02.827,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So is legalization the answer?

182
0:08:07.176,000 --> 0:08:09,000
On that, I'm torn:

183
0:08:09.213,000 --> 0:08:12,000
three days a week I think yes, three days a week I think no,

184
0:08:12.396,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and on Sundays I'm agnostic.

185
0:08:14.616,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But since today is Tuesday,

186
0:08:17.142,000 --> 0:08:21,000
let me just say that legally regulating and taxing

187
0:08:21.844,000 --> 0:08:23,000
most of the drugs that are now criminalized

188
0:08:24.262,000 --> 0:08:26,000
would radically reduce the crime, violence,

189
0:08:26.636,000 --> 0:08:27,000
corruption and black markets,

190
0:08:28.368,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs,

191
0:08:31.405,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and improve public safety,

192
0:08:33.352,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and allow taxpayer resources to be developed

193
0:08:35.556,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to more useful purposes.

194
0:08:37.772,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I mean, look, the markets in marijuana, cocaine,

195
0:08:41.552,000 --> 0:08:43,000
heroin and methamphetamine

196
0:08:43.565,000 --> 0:08:45,000
are global commodities markets

197
0:08:46.13,000 --> 0:08:49,000
just like the global markets in alcohol, tobacco,

198
0:08:49.325,000 --> 0:08:51,000
coffee, sugar, and so many other things.

199
0:08:52.205,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Where there is a demand,

200
0:08:54.601,000 --> 0:08:56,000
there will be a supply.

201
0:08:57.124,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Knock out one source and another

202
0:08:59.28,000 --> 0:09:,000
inevitably emerges.

203
0:09:00.99,000 --> 0:09:02,000
People tend to think of prohibition

204
0:09:03.37,000 --> 0:09:05,000
as the ultimate form of regulation

205
0:09:05.868,000 --> 0:09:09,000
when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation

206
0:09:09.887,000 --> 0:09:13,000
with criminals filling the void.

207
0:09:13.904,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Which is why putting criminal laws and police

208
0:09:16.164,000 --> 0:09:19,000
front and center in trying to control

209
0:09:19.382,000 --> 0:09:22,000
a dynamic global commodities market

210
0:09:22.486,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is a recipe for disaster.

211
0:09:25.355,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And what we really need to do

212
0:09:27.526,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is to bring the underground drug markets

213
0:09:29.9,000 --> 0:09:31,000
as much as possible aboveground

214
0:09:32.813,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and regulate them as intelligently as we can

215
0:09:36.885,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to minimize both the harms of drugs

216
0:09:39.674,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and the harms of prohibitionist policies.

217
0:09:43.162,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now, with marijuana, that obviously means

218
0:09:46.727,000 --> 0:09:48,000
legally regulating and taxing it like alcohol.

219
0:09:49.393,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The benefits of doing so are enormous, the risks minimal.

220
0:09:52.723,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Will more people use marijuana?

221
0:09:55.434,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Maybe, but it's not going to be young people,

222
0:09:59.405,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because it's not going to be legalized for them,

223
0:10:01.407,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and quite frankly, they already have

224
0:10:03.218,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the best access to marijuana.

225
0:10:05.254,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I think it's going to be older people.

226
0:10:07.403,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s

227
0:10:09.562,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana

228
0:10:13.208,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill

229
0:10:16.498,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or that it helps with their arthritis or diabetes

230
0:10:20.138,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or maybe helps spice up a long-term marriage. (Laughter)

231
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And that just might be a net public health benefit.

232
0:10:28.484,000 --> 0:10:3,000
As for the other drugs,

233
0:10:30.846,000 --> 0:10:32,000
look at Portugal, where nobody goes to jail

234
0:10:33.467,000 --> 0:10:34,000
for possessing drugs,

235
0:10:35.23,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the government's made a serious commitment

236
0:10:36.6,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to treating addiction as a health issue.

237
0:10:38.81,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Look at Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands,

238
0:10:40.711,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Denmark, England, where people who have

239
0:10:42.657,000 --> 0:10:43,000
been addicted to heroin for many years

240
0:10:44.558,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and repeatedly tried to quit and failed

241
0:10:46.864,000 --> 0:10:48,000
can get pharmaceutical heroin and helping services

242
0:10:49.722,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in medical clinics, and the results are in:

243
0:10:53.163,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Illegal drug abuse and disease

244
0:10:56.227,000 --> 0:11:,000
and overdoses and crime and arrests all go down,

245
0:11:00.374,000 --> 0:11:02,000
health and well-being improve,

246
0:11:02.523,000 --> 0:11:03,000
taxpayers benefit,

247
0:11:04.255,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and many drug users even put their addictions behind them.

248
0:11:08.405,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Look at New Zealand, which recently enacted a law

249
0:11:11.207,000 --> 0:11:13,000
allowing certain recreational drugs to be sold legally

250
0:11:14.142,000 --> 0:11:16,000
provided their safety had been established.

251
0:11:16.843,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Look here in Brazil, and some other countries,

252
0:11:19.542,000 --> 0:11:22,000
where a remarkable psychoactive substance,

253
0:11:22.605,000 --> 0:11:25,000
ayahuasca, can be legally bought and consumed

254
0:11:25.83,000 --> 0:11:28,000
provided it's done so within a religious context.

255
0:11:28.958,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Look in Bolivia and Peru,

256
0:11:30.96,000 --> 0:11:32,000
where all sorts of products made from the coca leaf,

257
0:11:33.749,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the source of cocaine,

258
0:11:35.65,000 --> 0:11:36,000
are sold legally over the counter

259
0:11:37.27,000 --> 0:11:4,000
with no apparent harm to people's public health.

260
0:11:40.403,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola had cocaine in it until 1900,

261
0:11:44.439,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and so far as we know was no more addictive

262
0:11:46.407,000 --> 0:11:5,000
than Coca-Cola is today.

263
0:11:50.46,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Conversely, think about cigarettes:

264
0:11:53.537,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Nothing can both hook you and kill you like cigarettes.

265
0:11:58.523,000 --> 0:12:01,000
When researchers ask heroin addicts

266
0:12:01.587,000 --> 0:12:04,000
what's the toughest drug to quit, most say cigarettes.

267
0:12:04.793,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Yet in my country and many others,

268
0:12:07.167,000 --> 0:12:09,000
half of all the people who were ever addicted

269
0:12:09.709,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to cigarettes have quit

270
0:12:11.644,000 --> 0:12:14,000
without anyone being arrested or put in jail

271
0:12:14.652,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or sent to a "treatment program"

272
0:12:16.908,000 --> 0:12:17,000
by a prosecutor or a judge.

273
0:12:18.641,000 --> 0:12:21,000
What did it were higher taxes

274
0:12:21.937,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and time and place restrictions on sale and use

275
0:12:25.48,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and effective anti-smoking campaigns.

276
0:12:28.552,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now, could we reduce smoking even more

277
0:12:32.492,000 --> 0:12:36,000
by making it totally illegal? Probably.

278
0:12:36.831,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But just imagine the drug war nightmare

279
0:12:40.442,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that would result.

280
0:12:43.48,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So the challenges we face today

281
0:12:45.763,000 --> 0:12:46,000
are twofold.

282
0:12:47.63,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The first is the policy challenge

283
0:12:50.645,000 --> 0:12:53,000
of designing and implementing alternatives

284
0:12:54.323,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to ineffective prohibitionist policies,

285
0:12:56.741,000 --> 0:12:59,000
even as we need to get better at regulating

286
0:13:00.161,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and living with the drugs that are now legal.

287
0:13:03.83,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But the second challenge is tougher,

288
0:13:07.191,000 --> 0:13:1,000
because it's about us.

289
0:13:10.802,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The obstacles to reform lie not just out there

290
0:13:14.29,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in the power of the prison industrial complex

291
0:13:16.45,000 --> 0:13:18,000
or other vested interests that want to keep things

292
0:13:18.654,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the way they are,

293
0:13:20.08,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but within each and every one of us.

294
0:13:23.92,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It's our fears and our lack of knowledge

295
0:13:27.97,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and imagination that stands in the way of real reform.

296
0:13:34.67,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And ultimately, I think that boils down to the kids,

297
0:13:39.24,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble,

298
0:13:42.985,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble

299
0:13:46.315,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and put our young ones at risk.

300
0:13:48.244,000 --> 0:13:5,000
In fact, sometimes it seems like the entire

301
0:13:50.314,000 --> 0:13:51,000
War on Drugs gets justified

302
0:13:52.29,000 --> 0:13:55,000
as one great big child protection act,

303
0:13:56.216,000 --> 0:13:59,000
which any young person can tell you it's not.

304
0:13:59.823,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So here's what I say to teenagers.

305
0:14:03.929,000 --> 0:14:06,000
First, don't do drugs.

306
0:14:07.615,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Second, don't do drugs.

307
0:14:11.405,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Third, if you do do drugs,

308
0:14:14.825,000 --> 0:14:16,000
there's some things I want you to know,

309
0:14:17.367,000 --> 0:14:21,000
because my bottom line as your parent is,

310
0:14:21.41,000 --> 0:14:23,000
come home safely at the end of the night

311
0:14:24.391,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and grow up and lead a healthy and good adulthood.

312
0:14:27.924,000 --> 0:14:32,000
That's my drug education mantra: Safety first.

313
0:14:33.537,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So this is what I've dedicated my life to,

314
0:14:37.193,000 --> 0:14:39,000
to building an organization and a movement

315
0:14:39.701,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of people who believe we need to turn our backs

316
0:14:42.561,000 --> 0:14:44,000
on the failed prohibitions of the past

317
0:14:44.606,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and embrace new drug policies grounded in science,

318
0:14:47.305,000 --> 0:14:49,000
compassion, health and human rights,

319
0:14:50.246,000 --> 0:14:52,000
where people who come from across the political spectrum

320
0:14:52.884,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and every other spectrum as well,

321
0:14:54.865,000 --> 0:14:55,000
where people who love our drugs,

322
0:14:56.599,000 --> 0:14:57,000
people who hate drugs,

323
0:14:57.938,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and people who don't give a damn about drugs,

324
0:15:00.25,000 --> 0:15:03,000
but every one of us believes that this War on Drugs,

325
0:15:03.684,000 --> 0:15:07,000
this backward, heartless, disastrous War on Drugs,

326
0:15:07.931,000 --> 0:15:1,000
has got to end.

327
0:15:11.03,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Thank you.

328
0:15:12.873,000 --> 0:15:17,000
(Applause)

329
0:15:27.042,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you. Thank you.

330
0:15:29.722,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Chris Anderson: Ethan,

331
0:15:31.943,000 --> 0:15:34,000
congrats — quite the reaction.

332
0:15:35.182,000 --> 0:15:37,000
That was a powerful talk.

333
0:15:37.926,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Not quite a complete standing O, though,

334
0:15:41.234,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and I'm guessing that some people here

335
0:15:42.921,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and maybe a few watching online,

336
0:15:45.187,000 --> 0:15:49,000
maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend

337
0:15:49.287,000 --> 0:15:51,000
or whatever who got sick,

338
0:15:51.504,000 --> 0:15:53,000
maybe died from some drug overdose.

339
0:15:54.5,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I'm sure you've had these people approach you before.

340
0:15:56.386,000 --> 0:15:58,000
What do you say to them?

341
0:15:58.557,000 --> 0:16:,000
Ethan Nadelmann: Chris, the most amazing thing that's happened of late

342
0:16:00.739,000 --> 0:16:02,000
is that I've met a growing number of people

343
0:16:02.98,000 --> 0:16:04,000
who have actually lost a sibling or a child

344
0:16:05.558,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to a drug overdose,

345
0:16:07.184,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and 10 years ago, those people just wanted to say,

346
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
let's line up all the drug dealers and shoot them

347
0:16:11.14,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and that will solve it.

348
0:16:12.481,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And what they've come to understand

349
0:16:13.776,000 --> 0:16:15,000
is that the Drug War did nothing to protect their kids.

350
0:16:16.659,000 --> 0:16:17,000
If anything, it made it more likely

351
0:16:18.108,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that those kids were put at risk.

352
0:16:20.21,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And so they're now becoming part of this

353
0:16:21.82,000 --> 0:16:22,000
drug policy reform movement.

354
0:16:23.695,000 --> 0:16:24,000
There's other people who have kids,

355
0:16:25.385,000 --> 0:16:28,000
one's addicted to alcohol, the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin,

356
0:16:28.85,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and they ask themselves the question:

357
0:16:30.278,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Why does this kid get to take one step at a time

358
0:16:32.595,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and try to get better

359
0:16:33.889,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and that one's got to deal with jail

360
0:16:35.453,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and police and criminals all the time?

361
0:16:37.478,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So everybody's understanding,

362
0:16:38.948,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the Drug War's not protecting anybody.

363
0:16:41.673,000 --> 0:16:43,000
CA: Certainly in the U.S., you've got political gridlock

364
0:16:43.754,000 --> 0:16:44,000
on most issues.

365
0:16:45.149,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Is there any realistic chance of anything

366
0:16:46.881,000 --> 0:16:49,000
actually shifting on this issue in the next five years?

367
0:16:50.227,000 --> 0:16:52,000
EN: I'd say it's quite remarkable. I'm getting all these calls

368
0:16:52.245,000 --> 0:16:53,000
from journalists now who are saying to me,

369
0:16:54.126,000 --> 0:16:56,000
"Ethan, it seems like the only two issues

370
0:16:56.13,000 --> 0:16:58,000
advancing politically in America right now

371
0:16:58.423,000 --> 0:17:,000
are marijuana law reform and gay marriage.

372
0:17:01.314,000 --> 0:17:02,000
What are you doing right?"

373
0:17:02.891,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And then you're looking at bipartisanship breaking out

374
0:17:05.479,000 --> 0:17:07,000
with, actually, Republicans in the Congress

375
0:17:07.771,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and state legislatures allowing bills to be enacted

376
0:17:10.84,000 --> 0:17:11,000
with majority Democratic support,

377
0:17:12.804,000 --> 0:17:14,000
so we've gone from being sort of the third rail,

378
0:17:15.32,000 --> 0:17:17,000
the most fearful issue of American politics,

379
0:17:17.411,000 --> 0:17:19,000
to becoming one of the most successful.

380
0:17:20.161,000 --> 0:17:22,000
CA: Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal. EN: Chris, thanks so much.

381
0:17:22.344,000 --> 0:17:24,000
CA: Thank you. EN: Thank you. (Applause)

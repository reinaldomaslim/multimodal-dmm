1
0:00:12.717,000 --> 0:00:15,000
An evolutionary biologist at Purdue University

2
0:00:16.014,000 --> 0:00:19,000
named William Muir studied chickens.

3
0:00:19.52,000 --> 0:00:2,000
He was interested in productivity --

4
0:00:21.249,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I think it's something that concerns all of us --

5
0:00:23.539,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs.

6
0:00:26.827,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.527,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He wanted to know what could make his chickens more productive,

8
0:00:31.944,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so he devised a beautiful experiment.

9
0:00:34.87,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Chickens live in groups, so first of all, he selected just an average flock,

10
0:00:39.328,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and he let it alone for six generations.

11
0:00:42.718,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But then he created a second group

12
0:00:44.807,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of the individually most productive chickens --

13
0:00:47.315,000 --> 0:00:49,000
you could call them superchickens --

14
0:00:50.27,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and he put them together in a superflock,

15
0:00:52.377,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and each generation, he selected only the most productive for breeding.

16
0:00:57.415,000 --> 0:00:59,000
After six generations had passed,

17
0:00:59.969,000 --> 0:01:,000
what did he find?

18
0:01:01.717,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Well, the first group, the average group, was doing just fine.

19
0:01:05.548,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They were all plump and fully feathered

20
0:01:08.074,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and egg production had increased dramatically.

21
0:01:10.702,000 --> 0:01:11,000
What about the second group?

22
0:01:13.419,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Well, all but three were dead.

23
0:01:16.253,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They'd pecked the rest to death.

24
0:01:18.413,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:19.99,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The individually productive chickens had only achieved their success

26
0:01:25.501,000 --> 0:01:29,000
by suppressing the productivity of the rest.

27
0:01:30.83,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, as I've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story

28
0:01:34.525,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in all sorts of organizations and companies,

29
0:01:36.777,000 --> 0:01:38,000
people have seen the relevance almost instantly,

30
0:01:39.353,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and they come up and they say things to me like,

31
0:01:41.659,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"That superflock, that's my company."

32
0:01:44.75,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:46.715,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Or, "That's my country."

34
0:01:50.226,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Or, "That's my life."

35
0:01:52.798,000 --> 0:01:55,000
All my life I've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete:

36
0:01:56.722,000 --> 0:02:,000
get into the right school, get into the right job, get to the top,

37
0:02:00.754,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I've really never found it very inspiring.

38
0:02:04.492,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I've started and run businesses because invention is a joy,

39
0:02:09.275,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and because working alongside brilliant, creative people

40
0:02:12.595,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is its own reward.

41
0:02:14.755,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And I've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens

42
0:02:20.397,000 --> 0:02:22,000
or by superstars.

43
0:02:23.276,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But for the past 50 years,

44
0:02:25.22,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we've run most organizations and some societies

45
0:02:29.452,000 --> 0:02:31,000
along the superchicken model.

46
0:02:31.96,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars,

47
0:02:35.582,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the brightest men, or occasionally women, in the room,

48
0:02:39.731,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and giving them all the resources and all the power.

49
0:02:43.43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And the result has been just the same as in William Muir's experiment:

50
0:02:47.493,000 --> 0:02:51,000
aggression, dysfunction and waste.

51
0:02:52.462,000 --> 0:02:56,000
If the only way the most productive can be successful

52
0:02:56.572,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is by suppressing the productivity of the rest,

53
0:02:59.753,000 --> 0:03:02,000
then we badly need to find a better way to work

54
0:03:03.236,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and a richer way to live.

55
0:03:06.51,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:10.921,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So what is it that makes some groups

57
0:03:14.915,000 --> 0:03:17,000
obviously more successful and more productive than others?

58
0:03:18.7,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Well, that's the question a team at MIT took to research.

59
0:03:21.974,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They brought in hundreds of volunteers,

60
0:03:24.4,000 --> 0:03:27,000
they put them into groups, and they gave them very hard problems to solve.

61
0:03:27.894,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And what happened was exactly what you'd expect,

62
0:03:30.625,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that some groups were very much more successful than others,

63
0:03:33.931,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but what was really interesting was that the high-achieving groups

64
0:03:37.461,000 --> 0:03:39,000
were not those where they had one or two people

65
0:03:40.108,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with spectacularly high I.Q.

66
0:03:43.149,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Nor were the most successful groups the ones that had the highest

67
0:03:46.748,000 --> 0:03:48,000
aggregate I.Q.

68
0:03:49.117,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Instead, they had three characteristics, the really successful teams.

69
0:03:54.991,000 --> 0:03:59,000
First of all, they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other.

70
0:04:00.633,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is measured by something called the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.

71
0:04:04.232,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's broadly considered a test for empathy,

72
0:04:06.717,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the groups that scored highly on this

73
0:04:08.914,000 --> 0:04:09,000
did better.

74
0:04:10.864,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Secondly, the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other,

75
0:04:15.972,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so that no one voice dominated,

76
0:04:18.317,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but neither were there any passengers.

77
0:04:21.103,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And thirdly, the more successful groups

78
0:04:23.82,000 --> 0:04:25,000
had more women in them.

79
0:04:26.165,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:28.162,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, was this because women typically score more highly on

81
0:04:32.437,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,

82
0:04:34.31,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so you're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient?

83
0:04:37.037,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective?

84
0:04:39.795,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We don't really know, but the striking thing about this experiment

85
0:04:43.951,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is that it showed what we know, which is some groups do better than others,

86
0:04:48.38,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but what's key to that

87
0:04:50.731,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is their social connectedness to each other.

88
0:04:55.543,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So how does this play out in the real world?

89
0:04:58.375,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Well, it means that what happens between people really counts,

90
0:05:03.716,000 --> 0:05:06,000
because in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other,

91
0:05:07.524,000 --> 0:05:1,000
ideas can flow and grow.

92
0:05:10.78,000 --> 0:05:13,000
People don't get stuck. They don't waste energy down dead ends.

93
0:05:14.768,000 --> 0:05:18,000
An example: Arup is one of the world's most successful engineering firms,

94
0:05:19.482,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and it was commissioned to build the equestrian center

95
0:05:22.134,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for the Beijing Olympics.

96
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Now, this building had to receive

97
0:05:25.826,000 --> 0:05:3,000
two and a half thousand really highly strung thoroughbred horses

98
0:05:31.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that were coming off long-haul flights,

99
0:05:33.209,000 --> 0:05:36,000
highly jet-lagged, not feeling their finest.

100
0:05:36.692,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And the problem the engineer confronted was,

101
0:05:40.104,000 --> 0:05:43,000
what quantity of waste to cater for?

102
0:05:44.54,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, you don't get taught this in engineering school -- (Laughter) --

103
0:05:49.184,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong,

104
0:05:52.388,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so he could have spent months talking to vets, doing the research,

105
0:05:55.853,000 --> 0:05:56,000
tweaking the spreadsheet.

106
0:05:57.654,000 --> 0:06:,000
Instead, he asked for help

107
0:06:00.799,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and he found someone who had designed the Jockey Club in New York.

108
0:06:05.285,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The problem was solved in less than a day.

109
0:06:09.404,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Arup believes that the culture of helpfulness

110
0:06:12.191,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is central to their success.

111
0:06:15.279,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now, helpfulness sounds really anemic,

112
0:06:19.4,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but it's absolutely core to successful teams,

113
0:06:23.498,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and it routinely outperforms individual intelligence.

114
0:06:29.117,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Helpfulness means I don't have to know everything,

115
0:06:32.322,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help.

116
0:06:37.6,000 --> 0:06:42,000
At SAP, they reckon that you can answer any question in 17 minutes.

117
0:06:44.131,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But there isn't a single high-tech company I've worked with

118
0:06:47.126,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue,

119
0:06:52.571,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other.

120
0:06:57.771,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now that sounds so obvious, and we think it'll just happen normally,

121
0:07:02.782,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but it doesn't.

122
0:07:04.41,000 --> 0:07:07,000
When I was running my first software company,

123
0:07:07.704,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I realized that we were getting stuck.

124
0:07:09.738,000 --> 0:07:12,000
There was a lot of friction, but not much else,

125
0:07:13.523,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and I gradually realized the brilliant, creative people that I'd hired

126
0:07:18.399,000 --> 0:07:19,000
didn't know each other.

127
0:07:20.364,000 --> 0:07:23,000
They were so focused on their own individual work,

128
0:07:24.241,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they didn't even know who they were sitting next to,

129
0:07:27.97,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and it was only when I insisted that we stop working

130
0:07:30.541,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and invest time in getting to know each other

131
0:07:33.125,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that we achieved real momentum.

132
0:07:36.813,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, that was 20 years ago, and now I visit companies

133
0:07:39.409,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that have banned coffee cups at desks

134
0:07:42.311,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines

135
0:07:46.305,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and talk to each other.

136
0:07:48.139,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The Swedes even have a special term for this.

137
0:07:50.647,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They call it fika, which means more than a coffee break.

138
0:07:54.007,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It means collective restoration.

139
0:07:57.613,000 --> 0:08:,000
At Idexx, a company up in Maine,

140
0:08:00.724,000 --> 0:08:02,000
they've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people

141
0:08:03.516,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from different parts of the business

142
0:08:05.768,000 --> 0:08:09,000
can work together and get to know the whole business that way.

143
0:08:10.644,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Have they all gone mad?

144
0:08:12.989,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Quite the opposite -- they've figured out that when the going gets tough,

145
0:08:16.542,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and it always will get tough

146
0:08:18.585,000 --> 0:08:2,000
if you're doing breakthrough work that really matters,

147
0:08:21.301,000 --> 0:08:23,000
what people need is social support,

148
0:08:23.972,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and they need to know who to ask for help.

149
0:08:27.199,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Companies don't have ideas; only people do.

150
0:08:31.936,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And what motivates people

151
0:08:34.536,000 --> 0:08:38,000
are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other.

152
0:08:39.566,000 --> 0:08:42,000
What matters is the mortar,

153
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
not just the bricks.

154
0:08:46.299,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now, when you put all of this together,

155
0:08:48.273,000 --> 0:08:51,000
what you get is something called social capital.

156
0:08:51.431,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust.

157
0:08:56.98,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The term comes from sociologists who were studying communities

158
0:09:00.471,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that proved particularly resilient in times of stress.

159
0:09:05.409,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Social capital is what gives companies momentum,

160
0:09:09.96,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and social capital is what makes companies robust.

161
0:09:16.182,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What does this mean in practical terms?

162
0:09:18.852,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It means that time is everything,

163
0:09:22.759,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because social capital compounds with time.

164
0:09:27.426,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So teams that work together longer get better, because it takes time

165
0:09:32.534,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to develop the trust you need for real candor and openness.

166
0:09:38.461,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And time is what builds value.

167
0:09:42.625,000 --> 0:09:44,000
When Alex Pentland suggested to one company

168
0:09:44.878,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that they synchronize coffee breaks

169
0:09:47.594,000 --> 0:09:5,000
so that people would have time to talk to each other,

170
0:09:51.495,000 --> 0:09:54,000
profits went up 15 million dollars,

171
0:09:54.978,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and employee satisfaction went up 10 percent.

172
0:09:58.832,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Not a bad return on social capital,

173
0:10:01.933,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which compounds even as you spend it.

174
0:10:05.96,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Now, this isn't about chumminess, and it's no charter for slackers,

175
0:10:12.022,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy,

176
0:10:16.656,000 --> 0:10:2,000
impatient, absolutely determined to think for themselves

177
0:10:20.69,000 --> 0:10:23,000
because that's what their contribution is.

178
0:10:24.68,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Conflict is frequent because candor is safe.

179
0:10:30.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And that's how good ideas turn into great ideas,

180
0:10:35.471,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because no idea is born fully formed.

181
0:10:38.571,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It emerges a little bit as a child is born,

182
0:10:41.9,000 --> 0:10:45,000
kind of messy and confused, but full of possibilities.

183
0:10:46.489,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And it's only through the generous contribution, faith and challenge

184
0:10:52.61,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that they achieve their potential.

185
0:10:55.892,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And that's what social capital supports.

186
0:11:01.455,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now, we aren't really used to talking about this,

187
0:11:04.228,000 --> 0:11:07,000
about talent, about creativity, in this way.

188
0:11:08.198,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We're used to talking about stars.

189
0:11:12.262,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So I started to wonder, well, if we start working this way,

190
0:11:16.371,000 --> 0:11:18,000
does that mean no more stars?

191
0:11:19.445,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So I went and I sat in on the auditions

192
0:11:21.805,000 --> 0:11:24,000
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

193
0:11:25.661,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And what I saw there really surprised me,

194
0:11:28.886,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because the teachers weren't looking for individual pyrotechnics.

195
0:11:33.786,000 --> 0:11:37,000
They were looking for what happened between the students,

196
0:11:38.476,000 --> 0:11:42,000
because that's where the drama is.

197
0:11:42.586,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And when I talked to producers of hit albums,

198
0:11:44.875,000 --> 0:11:47,000
they said, "Oh sure, we have lots of superstars in music.

199
0:11:48.103,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It's just, they don't last very long.

200
0:11:51.22,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers,

201
0:11:55.22,000 --> 0:11:59,000
because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best

202
0:11:59.432,000 --> 0:12:,000
in themselves."

203
0:12:01.686,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And when I went to visit companies that are renowned

204
0:12:04.115,000 --> 0:12:06,000
for their ingenuity and creativity,

205
0:12:06.182,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I couldn't even see any superstars,

206
0:12:09.107,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because everybody there really mattered.

207
0:12:13.445,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And when I reflected on my own career,

208
0:12:16.328,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and the extraordinary people I've had the privilege to work with,

209
0:12:20.252,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I realized how much more we could give each other

210
0:12:25.796,000 --> 0:12:3,000
if we just stopped trying to be superchickens.

211
0:12:31.815,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

212
0:12:36.97,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Once you appreciate truly how social work is,

213
0:12:43.346,000 --> 0:12:46,000
a lot of things have to change.

214
0:12:46.443,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Management by talent contest has routinely pitted

215
0:12:50.53,000 --> 0:12:52,000
employees against each other.

216
0:12:52.991,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now, rivalry has to be replaced by social capital.

217
0:12:58.355,000 --> 0:13:01,000
For decades, we've tried to motivate people with money,

218
0:13:01.48,000 --> 0:13:03,000
even though we've got a vast amount of research that shows

219
0:13:04.36,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that money erodes social connectedness.

220
0:13:08.851,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Now, we need to let people motivate each other.

221
0:13:14.646,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And for years, we've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected,

222
0:13:19.57,000 --> 0:13:22,000
all by themselves, to solve complex problems.

223
0:13:22.726,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Now, we need to redefine leadership

224
0:13:26.278,000 --> 0:13:3,000
as an activity in which conditions are created

225
0:13:30.342,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together.

226
0:13:36.3,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We know that this works.

227
0:13:40.21,000 --> 0:13:44,000
When the Montreal Protocol called for the phasing out of CFCs,

228
0:13:44.505,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer,

229
0:13:48.847,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the risks were immense.

230
0:13:51.332,000 --> 0:13:53,000
CFCs were everywhere,

231
0:13:54.231,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and nobody knew if a substitute could be found.

232
0:13:57.36,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles.

233
0:14:03.289,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The first was the head of engineering, Frank Maslen, said,

234
0:14:06.647,000 --> 0:14:09,000
there will be no stars in this team.

235
0:14:09.98,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We need everybody.

236
0:14:12.257,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Everybody has a valid perspective.

237
0:14:15.485,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Second, we work to one standard only:

238
0:14:19.711,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the best imaginable.

239
0:14:22.59,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And third, he told his boss, Geoff Tudhope,

240
0:14:25.632,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that he had to butt out,

241
0:14:27.605,000 --> 0:14:3,000
because he knew how disruptive power can be.

242
0:14:30.856,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Now, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.

243
0:14:33.689,000 --> 0:14:34,000
He gave the team air cover,

244
0:14:35.43,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and he listened to ensure that they honored their principles.

245
0:14:40.19,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And it worked: Ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem,

246
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
this group cracked it first.

247
0:14:49.738,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And to date, the Montreal Protocol

248
0:14:52.339,000 --> 0:14:57,000
is the most successful international environmental agreement

249
0:14:58.06,000 --> 0:14:59,000
ever implemented.

250
0:15:01.402,000 --> 0:15:03,000
There was a lot at stake then,

251
0:15:03.94,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and there's a lot at stake now,

252
0:15:06.679,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and we won't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved

253
0:15:11.207,000 --> 0:15:13,000
by a few supermen or superwomen.

254
0:15:13.808,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Now we need everybody,

255
0:15:17.314,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because it is only when we accept that everybody has value

256
0:15:23.54,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need

257
0:15:30.586,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to create the best beyond measure.

258
0:15:35.36,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Thank you.

259
0:15:38.1,000 --> 0:15:42,000
(Applause)

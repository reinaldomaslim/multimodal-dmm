1
0:00:12.931,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was around 10 when one day,

2
0:00:15.541,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I discovered a box of my father's old things.

3
0:00:18.985,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In it, under a bunch of his college textbooks,

4
0:00:21.839,000 --> 0:00:25,000
was a pair of black corduroy bell-bottom pants.

5
0:00:27.292,000 --> 0:00:28,000
These pants were awful --

6
0:00:29.179,000 --> 0:00:3,000
musty and moth-eaten.

7
0:00:31.2,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And of course, I fell in love with them.

8
0:00:33.77,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'd never seen anything like them.

9
0:00:36.154,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Until that day,

10
0:00:37.647,000 --> 0:00:41,000
all I'd ever known and worn was my school uniform,

11
0:00:42.161,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which, in fact, I was pretty grateful for,

12
0:00:45.402,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because from quite a young age,

13
0:00:47.548,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I'd realized I was somewhat different.

14
0:00:50.885,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'd never been one of the boys my age;

15
0:00:53.269,000 --> 0:00:54,000
terrible at sports,

16
0:00:54.795,000 --> 0:00:56,000
possibly the unmanliest little boy ever.

17
0:00:57.48,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:58.592,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was bullied quite a bit.

19
0:01:01.408,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And so, I figured that to survive I would be invisible,

20
0:01:06.164,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and the uniform helped me

21
0:01:08.532,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to seem no different from any other child.

22
0:01:11.173,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:12.374,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Well, almost.

24
0:01:16.253,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This became my daily prayer:

25
0:01:18.264,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"God, please make me just like everybody else."

26
0:01:23.342,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I think this went straight to God's voicemail, though.

27
0:01:25.951,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:27.027,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And eventually, it became pretty clear

29
0:01:29.553,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that I was not growing up to be the son that my father always wanted.

30
0:01:33.833,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Sorry, Dad.

31
0:01:37.523,000 --> 0:01:39,000
No, I was not going to magically change.

32
0:01:40.382,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And over time, I grew less and less sure that I actually wanted to.

33
0:01:46.74,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Therefore, the day those black corduroy bell-bottom pants came into my life,

34
0:01:51.368,000 --> 0:01:52,000
something happened.

35
0:01:53.227,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I didn't see pants;

36
0:01:55.063,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I saw opportunity.

37
0:01:57.087,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The very next day, I had to wear them to school,

38
0:01:59.812,000 --> 0:02:,000
come what may.

39
0:02:01.82,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And once I pulled on those god-awful pants and belted them tight,

40
0:02:05.844,000 --> 0:02:09,000
almost instantly, I developed what can only be called a swagger.

41
0:02:10.264,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:11.92,000 --> 0:02:12,000
All the way to school,

43
0:02:13.61,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and then all the way back because I was sent home at once --

44
0:02:16.55,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:17.882,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I transformed into a little brown rock star.

46
0:02:22.013,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:23.576,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I finally didn't care anymore that I could not conform.

48
0:02:26.982,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That day, I was suddenly celebrating it.

49
0:02:30.77,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That day, instead of being invisible,

50
0:02:33.524,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I chose to be looked at,

51
0:02:36.206,000 --> 0:02:38,000
just by wearing something different.

52
0:02:39.136,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That day, I discovered the power of what we wear.

53
0:02:43.723,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That day, I discovered the power of fashion,

54
0:02:46.956,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and I've been in love with it ever since.

55
0:02:50.073,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Fashion can communicate our differences to the world for us.

56
0:02:54.717,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And with this simple act of truth,

57
0:02:56.778,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I realized that these differences --

58
0:02:59.63,000 --> 0:03:,000
they stopped being our shame.

59
0:03:02.413,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They became our expressions,

60
0:03:05.068,000 --> 0:03:08,000
expressions of our very unique identities.

61
0:03:10.138,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And we should express ourselves,

62
0:03:12.339,000 --> 0:03:13,000
wear what we want.

63
0:03:14.285,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What's the worst that could happen?

64
0:03:16.184,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The fashion police are going to get you for being so last season?

65
0:03:21.038,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:24.667,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Yeah.

67
0:03:26.329,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Well, unless the fashion police meant something entirely different.

68
0:03:34.088,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Nobel Prize laureate Malala survived Taliban extremists

69
0:03:38.252,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in October 2012.

70
0:03:40.495,000 --> 0:03:44,000
However, in October 2017, she faced a different enemy,

71
0:03:45.906,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when online trolls viciously attacked the photograph

72
0:03:49.75,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that showed the 20-year-old wearing jeans that day.

73
0:03:53.984,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The comments,

74
0:03:55.464,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the hatred she received,

75
0:03:57.001,000 --> 0:03:59,000
ranged from "How long before the scarf comes off?"

76
0:04:00.915,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to, and I quote,

77
0:04:03.008,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"That's the reason the bullet directly targeted her head

78
0:04:06.129,000 --> 0:04:07,000
a long time ago."

79
0:04:08.43,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now, when most of us decide to wear a pair of jeans

80
0:04:11.112,000 --> 0:04:14,000
someplace like New York, London, Milan, Paris,

81
0:04:16.007,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we possibly don't stop to think that it's a privilege;

82
0:04:21.049,000 --> 0:04:24,000
something that somewhere else can have consequences,

83
0:04:25.429,000 --> 0:04:28,000
something that can one day be taken away from us.

84
0:04:30.447,000 --> 0:04:33,000
My grandmother was a woman who took extraordinary pleasure

85
0:04:33.565,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in dressing up.

86
0:04:34.886,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Her fashion was colorful.

87
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And the color she loved to wear so much was possibly the only thing

88
0:04:40.713,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that was truly about her,

89
0:04:42.641,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the one thing she had agency over,

90
0:04:45.139,000 --> 0:04:47,000
because like most other women of her generation in India,

91
0:04:47.972,000 --> 0:04:49,000
she'd never been allowed to exist

92
0:04:50.67,000 --> 0:04:52,000
beyond what was dictated by custom and tradition.

93
0:04:54.535,000 --> 0:04:55,000
She'd been married at 17,

94
0:04:57.094,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and after 65 years of marriage, when my grandfather died suddenly one day,

95
0:05:03.198,000 --> 0:05:04,000
her loss was unbearable.

96
0:05:07.122,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But that day, she was going to lose something else as well,

97
0:05:11.514,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the one joy she had:

98
0:05:13.433,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to wear color.

99
0:05:16.129,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In India, according to custom,

100
0:05:18.007,000 --> 0:05:2,000
when a Hindu woman becomes a widow,

101
0:05:20.307,000 --> 0:05:22,000
all she's allowed to wear is white

102
0:05:23.026,000 --> 0:05:25,000
from the day of the death of her husband.

103
0:05:25.634,000 --> 0:05:27,000
No one made my grandmother wear white.

104
0:05:28.424,000 --> 0:05:31,000
However, every woman she'd known who had outlived her husband,

105
0:05:32.283,000 --> 0:05:33,000
including her mother,

106
0:05:33.89,000 --> 0:05:34,000
had done it.

107
0:05:35.463,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This oppression was so internalized,

108
0:05:39.871,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so deep-rooted,

109
0:05:41.492,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that she herself refused a choice.

110
0:05:46.649,000 --> 0:05:47,000
She passed away this year,

111
0:05:48.565,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and until the day she died,

112
0:05:50.191,000 --> 0:05:52,000
she continued to wear only white.

113
0:05:56.275,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I have a photograph with her from earlier, happier times.

114
0:06:00.376,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In it, you can't really see what she's wearing --

115
0:06:03.415,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the photo is in black and white.

116
0:06:05.783,000 --> 0:06:07,000
However, from the way she's smiling in it,

117
0:06:08.639,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you just know she's wearing color.

118
0:06:12.382,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This is also what fashion can do.

119
0:06:15.259,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It has the power to fill us with joy,

120
0:06:17.836,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the joy of freedom to choose for ourselves how we want to look,

121
0:06:23.14,000 --> 0:06:24,000
how we want to live --

122
0:06:25.638,000 --> 0:06:27,000
a freedom worth fighting for.

123
0:06:28.608,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And fighting for freedom, protest, comes in many forms.

124
0:06:33.805,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Widows in India like my grandmother, thousands of them,

125
0:06:36.999,000 --> 0:06:37,000
live in a city called Vrindavan.

126
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And so, it's been a sea of white for centuries.

127
0:06:44.608,000 --> 0:06:47,000
However, only as recently as 2013,

128
0:06:47.726,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the widows of Vrindavan have started to celebrate Holi,

129
0:06:51.947,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the Indian festival of color,

130
0:06:54.665,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which they are prohibited from participating in.

131
0:06:58.615,000 --> 0:06:59,000
On this one day in March,

132
0:07:00.259,000 --> 0:07:03,000
these women take the traditional colored powder of the festival

133
0:07:04.705,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and color each other.

134
0:07:07.454,000 --> 0:07:1,000
With every handful of the powder they throw into the air,

135
0:07:11.407,000 --> 0:07:14,000
their white saris slowly start to suffuse with color.

136
0:07:16.423,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And they don't stop until they're completely covered

137
0:07:19.891,000 --> 0:07:22,000
in every hue of the rainbow that's forbidden to them.

138
0:07:24.889,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The color washes off the next day,

139
0:07:27.395,000 --> 0:07:3,000
however, for that moment in time,

140
0:07:30.482,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it's their beautiful disruption.

141
0:07:34.742,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This disruption,

142
0:07:37.082,000 --> 0:07:38,000
any kind of dissonance,

143
0:07:39.116,000 --> 0:07:42,000
can be the first gauntlet we throw down in a battle against oppression.

144
0:07:44.279,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And fashion --

145
0:07:45.926,000 --> 0:07:47,000
it can create visual disruption for us --

146
0:07:48.926,000 --> 0:07:49,000
on us, literally.

147
0:07:51.942,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Lessons of defiance have always been taught

148
0:07:54.545,000 --> 0:07:55,000
by fashion's great revolutionaries:

149
0:07:57.045,000 --> 0:07:58,000
its designers.

150
0:07:59.041,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Jean Paul Gaultier taught us that women can be kings.

151
0:08:04.718,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Thom Browne --

152
0:08:06.089,000 --> 0:08:08,000
he taught us that men can wear heels.

153
0:08:10.392,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And Alexander McQueen, in his spring 1999 show,

154
0:08:14.871,000 --> 0:08:17,000
had two giant robotic arms in the middle of his runway.

155
0:08:19.222,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And as the model, Shalom Harlow began to spin in between them,

156
0:08:24.139,000 --> 0:08:26,000
these two giant arms --

157
0:08:26.292,000 --> 0:08:28,000
furtively at first and then furiously,

158
0:08:28.796,000 --> 0:08:3,000
began to spray color onto her.

159
0:08:31.328,000 --> 0:08:32,000
McQueen, thus,

160
0:08:33.69,000 --> 0:08:34,000
before he took his own life,

161
0:08:35.438,000 --> 0:08:38,000
taught us that this body of ours is a canvas,

162
0:08:40.088,000 --> 0:08:43,000
a canvas we get to paint however we want.

163
0:08:45.467,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Somebody who loved this world of fashion

164
0:08:47.721,000 --> 0:08:48,000
was Karar Nushi.

165
0:08:49.548,000 --> 0:08:51,000
He was a student and actor from Iraq.

166
0:08:52.348,000 --> 0:08:54,000
He loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes.

167
0:08:55.164,000 --> 0:08:59,000
However, he soon started receiving death threats for how he looked.

168
0:09:00.764,000 --> 0:09:01,000
He remained unfazed.

169
0:09:02.754,000 --> 0:09:03,000
He remained fabulous,

170
0:09:04.626,000 --> 0:09:05,000
until July 2017,

171
0:09:06.618,000 --> 0:09:1,000
when Karar was discovered dead on a busy street in Baghdad.

172
0:09:13.91,000 --> 0:09:14,000
He'd been kidnapped.

173
0:09:16.48,000 --> 0:09:17,000
He'd been tortured.

174
0:09:18.701,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And eyewitnesses say that his body showed multiple wounds.

175
0:09:24.019,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Stab wounds.

176
0:09:27.838,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Two thousand miles away in Peshawar,

177
0:09:30.141,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Pakistani transgender activist Alisha was shot multiple times in May 2016.

178
0:09:37.339,000 --> 0:09:39,000
She was taken to the hospital,

179
0:09:39.399,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but because she dressed in women's clothing,

180
0:09:41.598,000 --> 0:09:45,000
she was refused access to either the men's or the women's wards.

181
0:09:48.27,000 --> 0:09:52,000
What we choose to wear can sometimes be literally life and death.

182
0:09:53.569,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And even in death, we sometimes don't get to choose.

183
0:09:57.387,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Alisha died that day

184
0:09:59.015,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and then was buried as a man.

185
0:10:02.753,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What kind of world is this?

186
0:10:05.142,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Well, it's one in which it's natural to be afraid,

187
0:10:09.856,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to be frightened of this surveillance,

188
0:10:12.412,000 --> 0:10:15,000
this violence against our bodies and what we wear on them.

189
0:10:16.928,000 --> 0:10:2,000
However, the greater fear is that once we surrender,

190
0:10:21.648,000 --> 0:10:22,000
blend in

191
0:10:22.845,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and begin to disappear one after the other,

192
0:10:25.907,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the more normal this false conformity will look,

193
0:10:29.693,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the less shocking this oppression will feel.

194
0:10:34.285,000 --> 0:10:35,000
For the children we are raising,

195
0:10:36.84,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the injustice of today could become the ordinary of tomorrow.

196
0:10:42.849,000 --> 0:10:43,000
They'll get used to this,

197
0:10:45.104,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and they, too, might begin to see anything different as dirty,

198
0:10:50.413,000 --> 0:10:51,000
something to be hated,

199
0:10:52.763,000 --> 0:10:53,000
something to be extinguished,

200
0:10:55.546,000 --> 0:10:56,000
like lights to be put out,

201
0:10:57.147,000 --> 0:10:58,000
one by one,

202
0:10:58.338,000 --> 0:11:,000
until darkness becomes a way of life.

203
0:11:02.738,000 --> 0:11:04,000
However, if I today,

204
0:11:04.948,000 --> 0:11:05,000
then you tomorrow,

205
0:11:06.429,000 --> 0:11:07,000
maybe even more of us someday,

206
0:11:08.298,000 --> 0:11:1,000
if we embrace our right to look like ourselves,

207
0:11:11.185,000 --> 0:11:13,000
then in the world that's been violently whitewashed,

208
0:11:14.099,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we will become the pinpricks of color pushing through,

209
0:11:17.286,000 --> 0:11:18,000
much like those widows of Vrindavan.

210
0:11:21.093,000 --> 0:11:24,000
How then, with so many of us,

211
0:11:24.561,000 --> 0:11:26,000
will the crosshairs of a gun

212
0:11:26.665,000 --> 0:11:27,000
be able to pick out Karar,

213
0:11:29.412,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Malala,

214
0:11:31.048,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Alisha?

215
0:11:34.223,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Can they kill us all?

216
0:11:38.533,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The time is now to stand up,

217
0:11:41.171,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to stand out.

218
0:11:43.407,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Where sameness is safeness,

219
0:11:45.806,000 --> 0:11:47,000
with something as simple as what we wear,

220
0:11:48.355,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we can draw every eye to ourselves

221
0:11:51.041,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to say that there are differences in this world, and there always will be.

222
0:11:56.183,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Get used to it.

223
0:11:58.511,000 --> 0:12:,000
And this we can say without a single word.

224
0:12:01.844,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Fashion can give us a language for dissent.

225
0:12:05.71,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It can give us courage.

226
0:12:07.971,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Fashion can let us literally wear our courage on our sleeves.

227
0:12:13.644,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So wear it.

228
0:12:16.327,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Wear it like armor.

229
0:12:18.771,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Wear it because it matters.

230
0:12:21.053,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And wear it because you matter.

231
0:12:23.817,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thank you.

232
0:12:24.991,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Applause)

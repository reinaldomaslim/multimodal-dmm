1
0:00:12.865,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Value creation.

2
0:00:14.682,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Wealth creation.

3
0:00:16.007,000 --> 0:00:17,000
These are really powerful words.

4
0:00:17.665,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Maybe you think of finance, you think of innovation,

5
0:00:20.38,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you think of creativity.

6
0:00:22.249,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But who are the value creators?

7
0:00:24.463,000 --> 0:00:27,000
If we use that word, we must be implying that some people aren't creating value.

8
0:00:28.423,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Who are they?

9
0:00:29.606,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The couch potatoes?

10
0:00:30.863,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The value extractors?

11
0:00:32.765,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The value destroyers?

12
0:00:34.564,000 --> 0:00:38,000
To answer this question, we actually have to have a proper theory of value.

13
0:00:39.306,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I'm here as an economist to break it to you

14
0:00:42.407,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that we've kind of lost our way on this question.

15
0:00:44.834,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, don't look so surprised.

16
0:00:46.881,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What I mean by that is, we've stopped contesting it.

17
0:00:50.497,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We've stopped actually asking really tough questions

18
0:00:53.306,000 --> 0:00:56,000
about what is the difference between value creation and value extraction,

19
0:00:57.035,000 --> 0:00:59,000
productive and unproductive activities.

20
0:00:59.095,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now, let me just give you some context here.

21
0:01:01.47,000 --> 0:01:04,000
2009 was just about a year and a half after

22
0:01:05.075,000 --> 0:01:07,000
one of the biggest financial crises of our time,

23
0:01:07.372,000 --> 0:01:1,000
second only to the 1929 Great Depression,

24
0:01:11.187,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the CEO of Goldman Sachs said

25
0:01:13.914,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Goldman Sachs workers are the most productive in the world.

26
0:01:17.767,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Productivity and productiveness, for an economist,

27
0:01:20.217,000 --> 0:01:21,000
actually has a lot to do with value.

28
0:01:21.991,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You're producing stuff,

29
0:01:23.208,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you're producing it dynamically and efficiently.

30
0:01:25.508,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You're also producing things that the world needs, wants and buys.

31
0:01:28.92,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, how this could have been said just one year after the crisis,

32
0:01:32.197,000 --> 0:01:35,000
which actually had this bank as well as many other banks --

33
0:01:35.354,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I'm just kind of picking on Goldman Sachs here --

34
0:01:37.668,000 --> 0:01:39,000
at the center of the crisis, because they had actually produced

35
0:01:40.64,000 --> 0:01:44,000
some pretty problematic financial products mainly but not only related to mortgages,

36
0:01:45.616,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which saw many thousands of people actually lose their homes.

37
0:01:49.38,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In 2010, in just one month, September,

38
0:01:52.238,000 --> 0:01:57,000
120,000 people lost their homes through the foreclosures of that crisis.

39
0:01:58.219,000 --> 0:02:,000
Between 2007 and 2010,

40
0:02:00.962,000 --> 0:02:02,000
8.8 million people lost their jobs.

41
0:02:03.998,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The bank also had to then be bailed out by the US taxpayer

42
0:02:08.419,000 --> 0:02:11,000
for the sum of 10 billion dollars.

43
0:02:11.498,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We didn't hear the taxpayers bragging that they were value creators,

44
0:02:14.822,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but obviously, having bailed out

45
0:02:16.435,000 --> 0:02:18,000
one of the biggest value-creating productive companies,

46
0:02:19.076,000 --> 0:02:2,000
perhaps they should have.

47
0:02:20.365,000 --> 0:02:23,000
What I want to do next is kind of ask ourselves

48
0:02:23.512,000 --> 0:02:24,000
how we lost our way,

49
0:02:25.327,000 --> 0:02:26,000
how it could be, actually,

50
0:02:26.71,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that a statement like that could almost go unnoticed,

51
0:02:29.248,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because it wasn't an after-dinner joke; it was said very seriously.

52
0:02:33.499,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So what I want to do is bring you back 300 years in economic thinking,

53
0:02:37.722,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when, actually, the term was contested.

54
0:02:40.4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It doesn't mean that they were right or wrong,

55
0:02:42.579,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but you couldn't just call yourself a value creator, a wealth creator.

56
0:02:45.945,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There was a lot of debate within the economics profession.

57
0:02:48.99,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And what I want to argue is, we've kind of lost our way,

58
0:02:51.667,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and that has actually allowed this term, "wealth creation" and "value,"

59
0:02:55.078,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to become quite weak and lazy

60
0:02:57.486,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and also easily captured.

61
0:02:59.614,000 --> 0:03:01,000
OK? So let's start -- I hate to break it to you --

62
0:03:02.188,000 --> 0:03:03,000
300 years ago.

63
0:03:03.564,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, what was interesting 300 years ago

64
0:03:05.947,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is the society was still an agricultural type of society.

65
0:03:09.878,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So it's not surprising that the economists of the time,

66
0:03:12.986,000 --> 0:03:13,000
who were called the Physiocrats,

67
0:03:14.631,000 --> 0:03:17,000
actually put the center of their attention to farm labor.

68
0:03:18.029,000 --> 0:03:2,000
When they said, "Where does value come from?"

69
0:03:20.343,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they looked at farming.

70
0:03:21.749,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And they produced what I think was probably the world's first spreadsheet,

71
0:03:25.268,000 --> 0:03:26,000
called the "Tableau Economique,"

72
0:03:27.128,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and this was done by François Quesnay, one of the leaders of this movement.

73
0:03:31.178,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And it was very interesting,

74
0:03:32.571,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because they didn't just say, "Farming is the source of value."

75
0:03:35.604,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They then really worried about what was happening to that value

76
0:03:38.666,000 --> 0:03:39,000
when it was produced.

77
0:03:39.858,000 --> 0:03:4,000
What the Tableau Economique does --

78
0:03:41.569,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and I've tried to make it a bit simpler here for you --

79
0:03:44.201,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is it broke down the classes in society into three.

80
0:03:46.643,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The farmers, creating value, were called the "productive class."

81
0:03:50.07,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Then others who were just moving some of this value around

82
0:03:52.834,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but it was useful, it was necessary,

83
0:03:54.584,000 --> 0:03:55,000
these were the merchants;

84
0:03:55.806,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they were called the "proprietors."

85
0:03:57.51,000 --> 0:04:,000
And then there was another class that was simply charging the farmers a fee

86
0:04:01.096,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for an existing asset, the land,

87
0:04:03.305,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and they called them the "sterile class."

88
0:04:05.857,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, this is a really heavy-hitting word if you think what it means:

89
0:04:09.746,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that if too much of the resources are going to the landlords,

90
0:04:13.598,000 --> 0:04:17,000
you're actually putting the reproduction potential of the system at risk.

91
0:04:18.44,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And so all these little arrows there were their way of simulating --

92
0:04:21.694,000 --> 0:04:24,000
again, spreadsheets and simulators, these guys were really using big data --

93
0:04:25.29,000 --> 0:04:28,000
they were simulating what would actually happen under different scenarios

94
0:04:28.81,000 --> 0:04:31,000
if the wealth actually wasn't reinvested back into production

95
0:04:32.301,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to make that land more productive

96
0:04:34.114,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and was actually being siphoned out in different ways,

97
0:04:36.699,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or even if the proprietors were getting too much.

98
0:04:39.849,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And what later happened in the 1800s,

99
0:04:41.897,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and this was no longer the Agricultural Revolution

100
0:04:44.252,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but the Industrial Revolution,

101
0:04:45.801,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is that the classical economists,

102
0:04:47.481,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and these were Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, the revolutionary,

103
0:04:51.356,000 --> 0:04:53,000
also asked the question "What is value?"

104
0:04:54.271,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But it's not surprising that because they were actually living

105
0:04:57.215,000 --> 0:05:,000
through an industrial era with the rise of machines and factories,

106
0:05:00.401,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they said it was industrial labor.

107
0:05:02.27,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So they had a labor theory of value.

108
0:05:05.107,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But again, their focus was reproduction,

109
0:05:07.215,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this real worry of what was happening to the value that was created

110
0:05:10.391,000 --> 0:05:11,000
if it was getting siphoned out.

111
0:05:12.004,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And in "The Wealth of Nations,"

112
0:05:13.556,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Adam Smith had this really great example of the pin factory where he said

113
0:05:17.355,000 --> 0:05:19,000
if you only have one person making every bit of the pin,

114
0:05:20.375,000 --> 0:05:22,000
at most you can make one pin a day.

115
0:05:22.947,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But if you actually invest in factory production and the division of labor,

116
0:05:26.698,000 --> 0:05:27,000
new thinking --

117
0:05:27.882,000 --> 0:05:3,000
today, we would use the word "organizational innovation" --

118
0:05:30.984,000 --> 0:05:31,000
then you could increase the productivity

119
0:05:32.981,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and the growth and the wealth of nations.

120
0:05:34.971,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So he showed that 10 specialized workers

121
0:05:37.454,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who had been invested in, in their human capital,

122
0:05:40.324,000 --> 0:05:42,000
could produce 4,800 pins a day,

123
0:05:42.684,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as opposed to just one by an unspecialized worker.

124
0:05:45.72,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And he and his fellow classical economists

125
0:05:48.348,000 --> 0:05:51,000
also broke down activities into productive and unproductive ones.

126
0:05:51.724,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:52.798,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And the unproductive ones weren't --

128
0:05:54.543,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I think you're laughing because most of you are on that list, aren't you?

129
0:05:58.009,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:59.532,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Lawyers! I think he was right about the lawyers.

131
0:06:02.169,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Definitely not the professors, the letters of all kind people.

132
0:06:05.549,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So lawyers, professors, shopkeepers, musicians.

133
0:06:09.598,000 --> 0:06:1,000
He obviously hated the opera.

134
0:06:11.003,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He must have seen the worst performance of his life

135
0:06:13.716,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the night before writing this book.

136
0:06:15.41,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There's at least three professions up there

137
0:06:17.451,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that have to do with the opera.

138
0:06:18.976,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But this wasn't an exercise of saying, "Don't do these things."

139
0:06:21.973,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It was just, "What's going to happen

140
0:06:23.723,000 --> 0:06:26,000
if we actually end up allowing some parts of the economy to get too large

141
0:06:27.345,000 --> 0:06:29,000
without really thinking about how to increase the productivity

142
0:06:30.274,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of the source of the value that they thought was key,

143
0:06:33.596,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which was industrial labor.

144
0:06:35.461,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And again, don't ask yourself is this right or is this wrong,

145
0:06:38.595,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it was just very contested.

146
0:06:39.938,000 --> 0:06:4,000
By making these lists,

147
0:06:41.43,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it actually forced them also to ask interesting questions.

148
0:06:44.823,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And their focus, as the focus of the Physiocrats,

149
0:06:48.382,000 --> 0:06:51,000
was, in fact, on these objective conditions of production.

150
0:06:51.786,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They also looked, for example, at the class struggle.

151
0:06:54.302,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Their understanding of wages

152
0:06:55.727,000 --> 0:06:58,000
had to do with the objective, if you want, power relationships,

153
0:06:59.104,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the bargaining power of capital and labor.

154
0:07:01.689,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But again, factories, machines, division of labor,

155
0:07:05.648,000 --> 0:07:07,000
agricultural land and what was happening to it.

156
0:07:07.998,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So the big revolution that then happened --

157
0:07:11.07,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and this, by the way, is not often taught in economics classes --

158
0:07:14.146,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the big revolution that happened with the current system

159
0:07:17.104,000 --> 0:07:18,000
of economic thinking that we have,

160
0:07:18.77,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which is called "neoclassical economics,"

161
0:07:21.372,000 --> 0:07:23,000
was that the logic completely changed.

162
0:07:23.922,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It changed in two ways.

163
0:07:25.255,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It changed from this focus on objective conditions to subjective ones.

164
0:07:29.708,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Let me explain what I mean by that.

165
0:07:31.473,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Objective, in the way I just said.

166
0:07:33.677,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Subjective, in the sense that all the attention went to

167
0:07:36.332,000 --> 0:07:39,000
how individuals of different sorts make their decisions.

168
0:07:39.511,000 --> 0:07:43,000
OK, so workers are maximizing their choices of leisure versus work.

169
0:07:43.892,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Consumers are maximizing their so-called utility,

170
0:07:46.977,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which is a proxy for happiness,

171
0:07:48.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and firms are maximizing their profits.

172
0:07:51.693,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And the idea behind this was that then we can aggregate this up,

173
0:07:55.022,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and we see what that turns into,

174
0:07:56.665,000 --> 0:07:58,000
which are these nice, fancy supply-and-demand curves

175
0:07:59.257,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which produce a price,

176
0:08:01.531,000 --> 0:08:02,000
an equilibrium price.

177
0:08:02.96,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's an equilibrium price, because we also added to it

178
0:08:05.511,000 --> 0:08:07,000
a lot of Newtonian physics equations

179
0:08:07.695,000 --> 0:08:1,000
where centers of gravity are very much part of the organizing principle.

180
0:08:11.661,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But the second point here is that that equilibrium price, or prices,

181
0:08:15.465,000 --> 0:08:16,000
reveal value.

182
0:08:17.305,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So the revolution here is a change from objective to subjective,

183
0:08:20.414,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but also the logic is no longer one of what is value,

184
0:08:24.181,000 --> 0:08:25,000
how is it being determined,

185
0:08:25.688,000 --> 0:08:27,000
what is the reproductive potential of the economy,

186
0:08:28.321,000 --> 0:08:3,000
which then leads to a theory of price

187
0:08:30.384,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but rather the reverse:

188
0:08:31.607,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a theory of price and exchange

189
0:08:33.769,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which reveals value.

190
0:08:35.123,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, this is a huge change.

191
0:08:37.17,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And it's not just an academic exercise, as fascinating as that might be.

192
0:08:41.101,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It affects how we measure growth.

193
0:08:43.038,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It affects how we steer economies to produce more of some activities,

194
0:08:46.873,000 --> 0:08:47,000
less of others,

195
0:08:48.065,000 --> 0:08:5,000
how we also remunerate some activities more than others.

196
0:08:50.792,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And it also just kind of makes you think,

197
0:08:53.046,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you know, are you happy to get out of bed if you're a value creator or not,

198
0:08:57.056,000 --> 0:09:,000
and how is the price system itself if you aren't determining that?

199
0:09:01.05,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I mentioned it affects how we think about output.

200
0:09:04.628,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If we only include, for example, in GDP,

201
0:09:07.38,000 --> 0:09:08,000
those activities that have prices,

202
0:09:09.131,000 --> 0:09:11,000
all sorts of really weird things happen.

203
0:09:11.422,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Feminist economists and environmental economists

204
0:09:13.748,000 --> 0:09:15,000
have actually written about this quite a bit.

205
0:09:15.895,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Let me give you some examples.

206
0:09:17.386,000 --> 0:09:22,000
If you marry your babysitter, GDP will go down, so do not do it.

207
0:09:22.844,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Do not be tempted to do this, OK?

208
0:09:24.506,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Because an activity that perhaps was before being paid for is still being done

209
0:09:28.326,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but is no longer paid.

210
0:09:29.502,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:30.621,000 --> 0:09:31,000
If you pollute, GDP goes up.

212
0:09:31.996,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Still don't do it, but if you do it, you'll help the economy.

213
0:09:34.902,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Why? Because we have to actually pay someone to clean it.

214
0:09:38.464,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, what's also really interesting is what happened to finance

215
0:09:41.464,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in the financial sector in GDP.

216
0:09:43.509,000 --> 0:09:45,000
This also, by the way, is something I'm always surprised

217
0:09:46.18,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that many economists don't know.

218
0:09:47.741,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Up until 1970,

219
0:09:49.266,000 --> 0:09:52,000
most of the financial sector was not even included in GDP.

220
0:09:53.005,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It was kind of indirectly, perhaps not knowingly,

221
0:09:55.526,000 --> 0:09:57,000
still being seen through the eyes of the Physiocrats

222
0:09:58.277,000 --> 0:10:02,000
as just kind of moving stuff around, not actually producing anything new.

223
0:10:02.358,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So only those activities that had an explicit price were included.

224
0:10:06.422,000 --> 0:10:09,000
For example, if you went to get a mortgage, you were charged a fee.

225
0:10:09.603,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That went into GDP and the national income and product accounting.

226
0:10:13.017,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But, for example, net interest payments didn't,

227
0:10:15.794,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the difference between what banks were earning in interest

228
0:10:19.777,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if they gave you a loan and what they were paying out for a deposit.

229
0:10:23.033,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That wasn't being included.

230
0:10:24.392,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And so the people doing the accounting started to look at some data,

231
0:10:27.625,000 --> 0:10:29,000
which started to show that the size of finance

232
0:10:30.38,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and these net interest payments

233
0:10:31.886,000 --> 0:10:32,000
were actually growing substantially.

234
0:10:33.71,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And they called this the "banking problem."

235
0:10:35.846,000 --> 0:10:38,000
These were some people working inside, actually, the United Nations

236
0:10:39.058,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in a group called the Systems of National [Accounts], SNA.

237
0:10:42.068,000 --> 0:10:43,000
They called it the "banking problem,"

238
0:10:43.881,000 --> 0:10:46,000
like, "Oh my God, this thing is huge, and we're not even including it."

239
0:10:47.275,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So instead of stopping and actually making that Tableau Economique

240
0:10:50.466,000 --> 0:10:52,000
or asking some of these fundamental questions

241
0:10:52.621,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that also the classicals were asking about what is actually happening,

242
0:10:55.963,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the division of labor between different types of activities in the economy,

243
0:10:59.556,000 --> 0:11:01,000
they simply gave these net interest payments a name.

244
0:11:02.029,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So the commercial banks, they called this "financial intermediation."

245
0:11:05.383,000 --> 0:11:06,000
That went into the NIPA accounts.

246
0:11:07.305,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And the investment banks were called the "risk-taking activities,"

247
0:11:10.969,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and that went in.

248
0:11:12.144,000 --> 0:11:14,000
In case I haven't explained this properly,

249
0:11:14.173,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that red line is showing how much quicker

250
0:11:16.166,000 --> 0:11:18,000
financial intermediation as a whole was growing

251
0:11:18.959,000 --> 0:11:21,000
compared to the rest of the economy, the blue line, industry.

252
0:11:22.679,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And so this was quite extraordinary,

253
0:11:24.749,000 --> 0:11:26,000
because what actually happened, and what we know today,

254
0:11:27.331,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and there's different people writing about this,

255
0:11:29.597,000 --> 0:11:31,000
this data here is from the Bank of England,

256
0:11:31.768,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is that lots of what finance was actually doing

257
0:11:34.052,000 --> 0:11:35,000
from the 1970s and '80s on

258
0:11:36.194,000 --> 0:11:38,000
was basically financing itself:

259
0:11:38.748,000 --> 0:11:39,000
finance financing finance.

260
0:11:40.625,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And what I mean by that is finance, insurance and real estate.

261
0:11:44.18,000 --> 0:11:45,000
In fact, in the UK,

262
0:11:45.807,000 --> 0:11:48,000
something like between 10 and 20 percent of finance

263
0:11:48.928,000 --> 0:11:5,000
finds its way into the real economy, into industry,

264
0:11:51.489,000 --> 0:11:53,000
say, into the energy sector, into pharmaceuticals,

265
0:11:54.181,000 --> 0:11:55,000
into the IT sector,

266
0:11:55.923,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but most of it goes back into that acronym, FIRE:

267
0:12:00.081,000 --> 0:12:01,000
finance, insurance and real estate.

268
0:12:01.839,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It's very conveniently called FIRE.

269
0:12:04.422,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Now, this is interesting because, in fact,

270
0:12:07.986,000 --> 0:12:1,000
it's not to say that finance is good or bad,

271
0:12:11.049,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but the degree to which,

272
0:12:12.483,000 --> 0:12:13,000
by just having to give it a name,

273
0:12:14.11,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because it actually had an income that was being generated,

274
0:12:16.997,000 --> 0:12:19,000
as opposed to pausing and asking, "What is it actually doing?" --

275
0:12:20.144,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that was a missed opportunity.

276
0:12:21.633,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Similarly, in the real economy, in industry itself, what was happening?

277
0:12:26.501,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And this real focus on prices and also share prices

278
0:12:33.409,000 --> 0:12:35,000
has created a huge problem of reinvestment,

279
0:12:35.953,000 --> 0:12:38,000
again, this real attention that both the Physiocrats and the classicals had

280
0:12:39.795,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to the degree to which the value that was being generated in the economy

281
0:12:43.42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
was in fact being reinvested back in.

282
0:12:45.61,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And so what we have today is an ultrafinancialized industrial sector

283
0:12:49.627,000 --> 0:12:52,000
where, increasingly, a share of the profits and the net income

284
0:12:53.322,000 --> 0:12:55,000
are not actually going back into production,

285
0:12:56.206,000 --> 0:12:59,000
into human capital training, into research and development

286
0:12:59.829,000 --> 0:13:02,000
but just being siphoned out in terms of buying back your own shares,

287
0:13:03.738,000 --> 0:13:05,000
which boosts stock options, which is, in fact, the way

288
0:13:06.542,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that many executives are getting paid.

289
0:13:08.544,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And, you know, some share buybacks is absolutely fine,

290
0:13:11.132,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but this system is completely out of whack.

291
0:13:13.193,000 --> 0:13:14,000
These numbers that I'm showing you here

292
0:13:15.086,000 --> 0:13:19,000
show that in the last 10 years, 466 of the S and P 500 companies

293
0:13:19.307,000 --> 0:13:22,000
have spent over four trillion on just buying back their shares.

294
0:13:23.056,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And what you see then if you aggregate this up at the macroeconomic level,

295
0:13:26.895,000 --> 0:13:28,000
so if we look at aggregate business investment,

296
0:13:29.465,000 --> 0:13:3,000
which is a percentage of GDP,

297
0:13:31.476,000 --> 0:13:34,000
you also see this falling level of business investment.

298
0:13:35.154,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And this is a problem.

299
0:13:36.357,000 --> 0:13:4,000
This, by the way, is a huge problem for skills and job creation.

300
0:13:40.691,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You might have heard there's lots of attention these days

301
0:13:43.421,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to, "Are the robots taking our jobs?"

302
0:13:45.224,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Well, mechanization has for centuries, actually, taken jobs,

303
0:13:48.204,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but as long as profits were being reinvested back into production,

304
0:13:51.554,000 --> 0:13:52,000
then it didn't matter: new jobs appeared.

305
0:13:53.576,000 --> 0:13:56,000
But this lack of reinvestment is, in fact, very dangerous.

306
0:13:57.39,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Similarly, in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, how prices are set,

307
0:14:01.556,000 --> 0:14:04,000
it's quite interesting how it doesn't look at these objective conditions

308
0:14:04.961,000 --> 0:14:08,000
of the collective way in which value is created in the economy.

309
0:14:09.344,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So in the sector where you have lots of different actors --

310
0:14:12.158,000 --> 0:14:15,000
public, private, of course, but also third-sector organizations --

311
0:14:15.747,000 --> 0:14:16,000
creating value,

312
0:14:16.923,000 --> 0:14:18,000
the way we actually measure value in this sector

313
0:14:19.335,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is through the price system itself.

314
0:14:21.564,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Prices reveal value.

315
0:14:23.101,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So when, recently,

316
0:14:24.456,000 --> 0:14:28,000
the price of an antibiotic went up by 400 percent overnight,

317
0:14:28.666,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and the CEO was asked, "How can you do this?

318
0:14:30.762,000 --> 0:14:31,000
People actually need that antibiotic.

319
0:14:32.584,000 --> 0:14:33,000
That's unfair."

320
0:14:33.768,000 --> 0:14:35,000
He said, "Well, we have a moral imperative

321
0:14:35.849,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to allow prices to go what the market will bear,"

322
0:14:38.617,000 --> 0:14:41,000
completely dismissing the fact that in the US, for example,

323
0:14:41.7,000 --> 0:14:45,000
the National Institutes of Health spent over 30 billion a year

324
0:14:46.036,000 --> 0:14:48,000
on the medical research that actually leads to these drugs.

325
0:14:48.84,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So, again, a lack of attention to those objective conditions

326
0:14:51.798,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and just allowing the price system itself to reveal the value.

327
0:14:55.068,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Now, this is not just an academic exercise,

328
0:14:57.64,000 --> 0:14:58,000
as interesting as it may be.

329
0:14:59.507,000 --> 0:15:02,000
All this really matters [for] how we measure output,

330
0:15:03.352,000 --> 0:15:04,000
to how we steer the economy,

331
0:15:04.95,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to whether you feel that you're productive,

332
0:15:07.089,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to which sectors we end up helping, supporting

333
0:15:10.455,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and also making people feel proud to be part of.

334
0:15:13.659,000 --> 0:15:14,000
In fact, going back to that quote,

335
0:15:15.578,000 --> 0:15:17,000
it's not surprising that Blankfein could say that.

336
0:15:17.913,000 --> 0:15:18,000
He was right.

337
0:15:18.983,000 --> 0:15:2,000
In the way that we actually measure production, productivity

338
0:15:21.9,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and value in the economy,

339
0:15:23.208,000 --> 0:15:25,000
of course Goldman Sachs workers are the most productive.

340
0:15:25.9,000 --> 0:15:26,000
They are in fact earning the most.

341
0:15:27.571,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The price of their labor is revealing their value.

342
0:15:30.023,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But this becomes tautological, of course.

343
0:15:32.528,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And so there's a real need to rethink.

344
0:15:35.609,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We need to rethink how we're measuring output,

345
0:15:37.807,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and in fact there's some amazing experiments worldwide.

346
0:15:40.426,000 --> 0:15:44,000
In New Zealand, for example, they now have a gross national happiness indicator.

347
0:15:44.984,000 --> 0:15:48,000
In Bhutan, also, they're thinking about happiness and well-being indicators.

348
0:15:49.299,000 --> 0:15:52,000
But the problem is that we can't just be adding things in.

349
0:15:52.588,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We do have to pause,

350
0:15:53.769,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and I think this should be a moment for pause,

351
0:15:55.968,000 --> 0:15:57,000
given that we see so little has actually changed

352
0:15:58.254,000 --> 0:15:59,000
since the financial crisis,

353
0:15:59.603,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to make sure that we are not also confusing

354
0:16:03.135,000 --> 0:16:04,000
value extraction with value creation,

355
0:16:05.156,000 --> 0:16:08,000
so looking at what's included, not just adding more,

356
0:16:08.487,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to make sure that we're not, for example, confusing rents with profits.

357
0:16:12.378,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Rents for the classicals was about unearned income.

358
0:16:15.38,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Today, rents, when they're talked about in economics,

359
0:16:17.906,000 --> 0:16:2,000
is just an imperfection towards a competitive price

360
0:16:21.136,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that could be competed away if you take away some asymmetries.

361
0:16:25.376,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Second, we of course can steer activities into what the classicals called

362
0:16:29.644,000 --> 0:16:3,000
the "production boundary."

363
0:16:30.944,000 --> 0:16:31,000
This should not be an us-versus-them,

364
0:16:32.915,000 --> 0:16:35,000
big, bad finance versus good, other sectors.

365
0:16:36.025,000 --> 0:16:37,000
We could reform finance.

366
0:16:37.461,000 --> 0:16:4,000
There was a real lost opportunity in some ways after the crisis.

367
0:16:40.551,000 --> 0:16:42,000
We could have had the financial transaction tax,

368
0:16:43.143,000 --> 0:16:46,000
which would have rewarded long-termism over short-termism,

369
0:16:46.653,000 --> 0:16:48,000
but we didn't decide to do that globally.

370
0:16:48.986,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We can. We can change our minds.

371
0:16:50.8,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We can also set up new types of institutions.

372
0:16:52.953,000 --> 0:16:56,000
There's different types of, for example, public financial institutions worldwide

373
0:16:57.127,000 --> 0:17:,000
that are actually providing that patient, long-term, committed finance

374
0:17:00.815,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that helps small firms grow, that help infrastructure and innovation happen.

375
0:17:04.931,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But this shouldn't just be about output.

376
0:17:07.212,000 --> 0:17:09,000
This shouldn't just be about the rate of output.

377
0:17:09.511,000 --> 0:17:1,000
We should also as a society pause

378
0:17:11.301,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and ask: What value are we even creating?

379
0:17:14.267,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And I just want to end with the fact that this week we are celebrating

380
0:17:18.022,000 --> 0:17:2,000
the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing.

381
0:17:20.667,000 --> 0:17:22,000
This required the public sector, the private sector,

382
0:17:23.479,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to invest and innovate in all sorts of ways,

383
0:17:26.428,000 --> 0:17:27,000
not just around aeronautics.

384
0:17:28.278,000 --> 0:17:32,000
It included investment in areas like nutrition and materials.

385
0:17:32.32,000 --> 0:17:35,000
There were lots of actual mistakes that were done along the way.

386
0:17:35.585,000 --> 0:17:38,000
In fact, what government did was it used its full power of procurement,

387
0:17:38.996,000 --> 0:17:41,000
for example, to fuel those bottom-up solutions,

388
0:17:42.045,000 --> 0:17:43,000
of which some failed.

389
0:17:43.696,000 --> 0:17:45,000
But are failures part of value creation?

390
0:17:46.536,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Or are they just mistakes?

391
0:17:47.884,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Or how do we actually also nurture the experimentation,

392
0:17:51.677,000 --> 0:17:53,000
the trial and error and error and error?

393
0:17:54.253,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Bell Labs, which was the R and D laboratory of AT and T,

394
0:17:57.472,000 --> 0:18:,000
actually came from an era where government was quite courageous.

395
0:18:01.223,000 --> 0:18:05,000
It actually asked AT and T that in order to maintain its monopoly status,

396
0:18:06.103,000 --> 0:18:09,000
it had to reinvest its profits back into the real economy,

397
0:18:09.774,000 --> 0:18:1,000
innovation

398
0:18:11.06,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and innovation beyond telecoms.

399
0:18:12.762,000 --> 0:18:14,000
That was the history, the early history of Bell Labs.

400
0:18:15.36,000 --> 0:18:18,000
So how we can get these new conditions around reinvestment

401
0:18:19.15,000 --> 0:18:21,000
to collectively invest in new types of value

402
0:18:22.026,000 --> 0:18:24,000
directed at some of the biggest challenges of our time,

403
0:18:24.958,000 --> 0:18:25,000
like climate change?

404
0:18:26.253,000 --> 0:18:27,000
This is a key question.

405
0:18:28.244,000 --> 0:18:29,000
But we should also ask ourselves,

406
0:18:29.996,000 --> 0:18:32,000
had there been a net present value calculation

407
0:18:33.707,000 --> 0:18:35,000
or a cost-benefit analysis done

408
0:18:36.451,000 --> 0:18:39,000
about whether or not to even try to go to the Moon and back again

409
0:18:40.09,000 --> 0:18:41,000
in a generation,

410
0:18:41.291,000 --> 0:18:43,000
we probably wouldn't have started.

411
0:18:43.803,000 --> 0:18:44,000
So thank God,

412
0:18:45.547,000 --> 0:18:47,000
because I'm an economist, and I can tell you,

413
0:18:47.711,000 --> 0:18:48,000
value is not just price.

414
0:18:50.057,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Thank you.

415
0:18:51.263,000 --> 0:18:53,000
(Applause)

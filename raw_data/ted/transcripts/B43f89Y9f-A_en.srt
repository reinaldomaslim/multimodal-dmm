1
0:00:12.69,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The one conversation that uplifted me more than any other in my life

2
0:00:18.505,000 --> 0:00:2,000
was with a woman who told me

3
0:00:20.949,000 --> 0:00:21,000
how, a few days earlier,

4
0:00:22.718,000 --> 0:00:26,000
she drove her Jeep Wrangler to the edge of the Grand Canyon

5
0:00:26.847,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and sat there, revving the engine,

6
0:00:29.628,000 --> 0:00:3,000
thinking about driving over.

7
0:00:32.655,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Even though I had severe social anxiety,

8
0:00:35.401,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in that conversation, I was totally at ease.

9
0:00:38.059,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.584,000 --> 0:00:41,000
She told me what was going on in her life

11
0:00:42.291,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in the days and months leading up,

12
0:00:44.617,000 --> 0:00:46,000
what her thoughts were at that exact moment,

13
0:00:46.873,000 --> 0:00:47,000
why she wanted to die,

14
0:00:48.386,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and why she didn't do it.

15
0:00:50.271,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We nodded and half-smiled,

16
0:00:53.077,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and then it was my turn to talk about my journey

17
0:00:55.725,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to a dining table in the hygienic community area

18
0:01:00.395,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of the mental health wing of a mountain-town hospital.

19
0:01:04.503,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I took too many sleeping pills,

20
0:01:06.044,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and after they treated me for that,

21
0:01:07.774,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they were like, "Hey, we would love it if you would be our guest

22
0:01:13.629,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in the psych ward."

23
0:01:15.147,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:20.597,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We joked that her suicide would have made a way better postcard.

25
0:01:25.668,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:26.75,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We talked shop.

27
0:01:28.448,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:29.894,000 --> 0:01:31,000
She allowed me to be deeply depressed

29
0:01:32.377,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and have a genuine connection to another person, simultaneously.

30
0:01:37.789,000 --> 0:01:38,000
For the first time,

31
0:01:38.971,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I identified as somebody living with depression,

32
0:01:42.169,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I felt good about it --

33
0:01:43.901,000 --> 0:01:45,000
like I wasn't a bad person for it.

34
0:01:46.918,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now imagine one of the people at that table was a member of your family

35
0:01:51.093,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or a close friend.

36
0:01:53.027,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Would you be comfortable talking to them?

37
0:01:55.447,000 --> 0:01:57,000
What if instead of the hospital,

38
0:01:57.55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they were at your kitchen table

39
0:01:59.101,000 --> 0:02:,000
and told you they were really depressed?

40
0:02:02.295,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The World Health Organization

41
0:02:04.646,000 --> 0:02:1,000
says that depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide,

42
0:02:11.044,000 --> 0:02:14,000
affecting 350 million people.

43
0:02:14.146,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The National Institute of Mental Health

44
0:02:16.066,000 --> 0:02:2,000
reports seven percent of Americans experiencing depression in a year.

45
0:02:21.084,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So depression is super common,

46
0:02:23.846,000 --> 0:02:25,000
yet in my experience,

47
0:02:26.547,000 --> 0:02:28,000
most folks don't want to talk to depressed people

48
0:02:29.537,000 --> 0:02:3,000
unless we pretend to be happy.

49
0:02:33.395,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A cheerful facade is appropriate for casual interactions.

50
0:02:37.055,000 --> 0:02:41,000
A depressed person can ask for extra syrup in their pumpkin spice latte

51
0:02:41.793,000 --> 0:02:43,000
without explaining that they need it

52
0:02:43.837,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because they're trapped in the infinite darkness of their soul

53
0:02:47.93,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and they've lost all hope of escape --

54
0:02:49.986,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:51.011,000 --> 0:02:52,000
again.

56
0:02:52.186,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:55.275,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Depression doesn't diminish a person's desire

58
0:02:58.429,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to connect with other people,

59
0:03:00.295,000 --> 0:03:01,000
just their ability.

60
0:03:02.46,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So in spite of what you might think,

61
0:03:05.296,000 --> 0:03:07,000
talking to friends and family living with depression

62
0:03:07.79,000 --> 0:03:1,000
can be really easy and maybe even fun.

63
0:03:11.281,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Not, like, Facebook-selfie-with-Lady-Gaga- at-an-underground-party fun --

64
0:03:17.174,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I'm talking about the kind of fun

65
0:03:19.214,000 --> 0:03:22,000
where people enjoy each other's company effortlessly.

66
0:03:23.205,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Nobody feels awkward,

67
0:03:24.611,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and no one accuses the sad person of ruining the holidays.

68
0:03:30.244,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Why does this chasm even exist?

69
0:03:33.995,000 --> 0:03:34,000
On the one side,

70
0:03:35.252,000 --> 0:03:37,000
you have people living with depression

71
0:03:37.284,000 --> 0:03:4,000
who may act in off-putting or confusing ways

72
0:03:40.569,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because they're fighting a war in their head

73
0:03:43.266,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that nobody else can see.

74
0:03:45.307,000 --> 0:03:46,000
On the other side,

75
0:03:48.074,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the vast majority of people look across the chasm

76
0:03:51.081,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and shake their heads,

77
0:03:52.256,000 --> 0:03:55,000
like, "Why you gotta be so depressed?"

78
0:03:56.817,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You may recognize a divide like this in your life.

79
0:04:01.066,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Do you want to build a bridge across it?

80
0:04:03.712,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You may not want to build a bridge --

81
0:04:05.88,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and that's a totally valid choice.

82
0:04:09.182,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Or maybe you'd like to build a stronger connection,

83
0:04:12.684,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but you have a lot of questions and concerns.

84
0:04:17.158,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You're what I might call "bridge curious."

85
0:04:20.381,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:24.689,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Here are some possible reasons

87
0:04:26.147,000 --> 0:04:28,000
why some of you may avoid depressed people.

88
0:04:29.807,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You might be afraid

89
0:04:31.03,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that if you talk to somebody while they're depressed,

90
0:04:33.748,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you're suddenly responsible for their well-being.

91
0:04:37.521,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You're not expected to be Dr. Phil.

92
0:04:40.965,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Just be friendly --

93
0:04:42.18,000 --> 0:04:43,000
more like Ellen.

94
0:04:43.737,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:47.519,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You may worry that you won't know what to say,

96
0:04:50.564,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and every attempt at conversation will be awkward,

97
0:04:55.008,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the only time you'll feel comfortable

98
0:04:57.428,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is when you both just give up on talking

99
0:04:59.357,000 --> 0:05:,000
and stare at your phones.

100
0:05:02.304,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Words are not the most important thing to focus on.

101
0:05:07.931,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You might fear seeing your shadow.

102
0:05:12.217,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Hey, if you have been successfully outrunning

103
0:05:15.607,000 --> 0:05:17,000
your personal emotional demons,

104
0:05:18.094,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that's awesome.

105
0:05:20.401,000 --> 0:05:21,000
May the wind be at your back.

106
0:05:22.417,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:23.456,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You can be the least woo-woo person in the world

108
0:05:27.193,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and still connect with depressed people.

109
0:05:30.477,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Maybe you've heard that depression is contagious,

110
0:05:33.342,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and you're afraid of catching it.

111
0:05:35.347,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Bring some hand sanitizer.

112
0:05:37.383,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:38.408,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You're much more likely to catch the joy of human bonding.

114
0:05:43.657,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Maybe you see depressed people differently.

115
0:05:45.687,000 --> 0:05:48,000
You think of them as flawed or defective.

116
0:05:50.299,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Multiple university studies have shown

117
0:05:53.331,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that A students are more likely to have bipolar condition.

118
0:05:58.705,000 --> 0:06:,000
Our brains aren't broken or damaged,

119
0:06:01.642,000 --> 0:06:02,000
they just work differently.

120
0:06:03.617,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I spent a lot of years thinking happy people just don't get it.

121
0:06:09.347,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:10.518,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I did eventually stop discriminating against happy people --

123
0:06:14.167,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:18.433,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I began battling depression when I was eight,

125
0:06:21.363,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and decades later, to my surprise,

126
0:06:23.534,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I started winning.

127
0:06:25.132,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I shifted from being miserable much of the time

128
0:06:29.121,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to enjoying life.

129
0:06:31.255,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I live pretty well with my bipolar condition,

130
0:06:34.449,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and I've overcome some other mental health conditions

131
0:06:36.952,000 --> 0:06:39,000
like overeating, addiction and social anxiety.

132
0:06:40.634,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So I live on both sides of this chasm.

133
0:06:44.974,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I'm offering some guidance

134
0:06:49.716,000 --> 0:06:51,000
based on my experience

135
0:06:52.449,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to help you build a bridge across it

136
0:06:54.782,000 --> 0:06:55,000
if you want to.

137
0:06:56.248,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's not hard science,

138
0:06:58.22,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but I worked with a lot people I know who've lived with depression

139
0:07:02.745,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to refine these suggestions.

140
0:07:06.086,000 --> 0:07:08,000
First up, some things you might want to avoid --

141
0:07:08.674,000 --> 0:07:09,000
some "don'ts."

142
0:07:11.213,000 --> 0:07:14,000
One of the most off-putting things you can say is,

143
0:07:14.738,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"Just get over it."

144
0:07:17.411,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Great idea -- love it,

145
0:07:19.404,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it's just we already thought of that.

146
0:07:21.745,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:28.178,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The absence of the ability to just get over it is depression.

148
0:07:32.479,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:36.316,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Applause)

150
0:07:41.186,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We feel it in our bodies --

151
0:07:44.949,000 --> 0:07:46,000
it's a physical thing for us.

152
0:07:47.378,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And medically it's no different

153
0:07:49.409,000 --> 0:07:51,000
from telling someone with a broken ankle or cancer,

154
0:07:51.815,000 --> 0:07:52,000
"just get over it."

155
0:07:56.477,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Don't be hell-bent on fixing us.

156
0:07:59.613,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Like, thank you, but ...

157
0:08:03.992,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the pressure can make us depressed people feel like we're disappointing you.

158
0:08:08.93,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Also, things that make some people feel better

159
0:08:11.815,000 --> 0:08:12,000
may not work for us.

160
0:08:13.566,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You can't cure clinical depression by getting ice cream ...

161
0:08:17.949,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which is unfortunate, because that would be living the dream.

162
0:08:21.595,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:25.698,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Don't take a negative response personally.

164
0:08:31.216,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So, I have a friend who, about a year ago,

165
0:08:34.923,000 --> 0:08:37,000
messaged me that he was really isolated and depressed.

166
0:08:38.603,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I suggested some things for him to do,

167
0:08:41.128,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and he was like, "No, no and no."

168
0:08:43.485,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And I got mad,

169
0:08:44.66,000 --> 0:08:47,000
like, how dare he not embrace my brilliant wisdom?

170
0:08:48.621,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:50.361,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And then I remembered times I've been depressed,

172
0:08:53.851,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and how I thought I was doomed in all possible futures,

173
0:08:58.491,000 --> 0:09:01,000
or everybody suddenly hated me, and things like that.

174
0:09:03.498,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It didn't matter how many people told me otherwise --

175
0:09:06.741,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I didn't believe them.

176
0:09:09.22,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So I let my friend know I cared,

177
0:09:12.332,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and I didn't take it personally.

178
0:09:15.956,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Don't let a lack of bubbly happiness freak you out.

179
0:09:21.594,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's not a shark attack.

180
0:09:23.648,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"Call the coast guard, my friend is sad!"

181
0:09:26.616,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:28.302,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We can be sad and OK at the same time.

183
0:09:32.835,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I'm going to say that again,

184
0:09:34.193,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because in our society, we're taught the opposite,

185
0:09:37.818,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and so it's counterintuitive.

186
0:09:40.556,000 --> 0:09:44,000
People can be sad and OK at the same time.

187
0:09:45.819,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So some of these things may apply to you personally, some may not.

188
0:09:48.963,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Take what's useful.

189
0:09:50.728,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And remember, you don't have to connect.

190
0:09:55.609,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If you want to,

191
0:09:57.143,000 --> 0:09:59,000
here are some suggestions that may help --

192
0:09:59.253,000 --> 0:10:,000
some "dos."

193
0:10:01.484,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Talk to us in your natural voice, right?

194
0:10:04.382,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:06.837,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You don't need to put on a sad voice because we're depressed --

196
0:10:12.115,000 --> 0:10:14,000
you don't sneeze when you're talking to somebody with a cold.

197
0:10:15.072,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:18.306,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's not rude to be upbeat.

199
0:10:20.872,000 --> 0:10:22,000
You can be you, OK?

200
0:10:23.48,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If you make an offer to be there for us,

201
0:10:26.401,000 --> 0:10:28,000
clearly state what you can and can't do.

202
0:10:29.907,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I have told people, "Hey, call or text any time,

203
0:10:32.405,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but I might not be able to get back to you that same day."

204
0:10:36.221,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's totally cool to not make an offer,

205
0:10:39.489,000 --> 0:10:43,000
or to make a narrow offer with really clear boundaries around it.

206
0:10:45.258,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Give us a sense of control.

207
0:10:50.052,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Like, get our consent.

208
0:10:52.434,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I have a friend who, a while back,

209
0:10:55.339,000 --> 0:10:57,000
when I was having a depressive episode,

210
0:10:57.451,000 --> 0:10:59,000
reached out and said, "Hey, I want to check in with you.

211
0:11:00.154,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Can I call you every day?

212
0:11:01.37,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Maybe text you every day and call later in the week?

213
0:11:03.824,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What works for you?"

214
0:11:06.409,000 --> 0:11:09,000
By getting my permission, she earned my complete confidence

215
0:11:09.616,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and remains one of my best friends today.

216
0:11:14.189,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And my last suggestion is:

217
0:11:17.562,000 --> 0:11:19,000
interact about not depression,

218
0:11:20.427,000 --> 0:11:22,000
aka, normal stuff.

219
0:11:22.577,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I have a friend who, when people were worried about him,

220
0:11:26.338,000 --> 0:11:28,000
they would call and ask if he wanted to go shopping

221
0:11:29.054,000 --> 0:11:31,000
or help them clean out their garage.

222
0:11:31.92,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Your depressed friends could be a good source of free labor --

223
0:11:34.904,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:44.132,000 --> 0:11:47,000
What I'm really getting at is,

225
0:11:47.489,000 --> 0:11:51,000
invite them to contribute to your life in some way,

226
0:11:52.076,000 --> 0:11:56,000
even if it's as small as asking you to go see a movie

227
0:11:56.631,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that you wanted to see in the theater.

228
0:11:59.588,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So that's a lot of dos and don'ts and maybes,

229
0:12:03.501,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and it's not by any means a definitive list.

230
0:12:08.146,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The thing to remember is that they're all grounded

231
0:12:10.961,000 --> 0:12:12,000
in one guiding principle.

232
0:12:13.709,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's what allowed the woman in the Jeep Wrangler

233
0:12:17.725,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to start me on the path to recovery without even trying.

234
0:12:21.674,000 --> 0:12:24,000
She talked to me like I belonged

235
0:12:25.066,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and contributed exactly as I was at that moment.

236
0:12:31.27,000 --> 0:12:35,000
If you talk to a depressed person as if their life is just as valuable,

237
0:12:35.902,000 --> 0:12:37,000
intense and beautiful as yours,

238
0:12:38.368,000 --> 0:12:41,000
then there's no need to build a bridge between you,

239
0:12:42.322,000 --> 0:12:43,000
because you've closed the chasm.

240
0:12:45.684,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Focus on that instead of your words,

241
0:12:51.021,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and it may be the most uplifting conversation of their life.

242
0:12:56.568,000 --> 0:12:58,000
What could that do for somebody you care about?

243
0:13:00.203,000 --> 0:13:02,000
What could it do for you?

244
0:13:03.181,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

245
0:13:04.356,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

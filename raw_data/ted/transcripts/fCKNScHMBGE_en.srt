1
0:00:13.346,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan. In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.

2
0:00:16.999,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(English) I was born in a middle class family.

3
0:00:20.642,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My father was five years old when he lost his father,

4
0:00:25.233,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but by the time I was born,

5
0:00:28.336,000 --> 0:00:29,000
he was already a businessman.

6
0:00:31.32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But it didn't make a difference to him

7
0:00:33.772,000 --> 0:00:35,000
if his children were going to be a boy or a girl:

8
0:00:36.704,000 --> 0:00:37,000
they were going to go to school.

9
0:00:38.879,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So I guess I was the lucky one.

10
0:00:42.482,000 --> 0:00:44,000
My mother had 16 pregnancies.

11
0:00:45.926,000 --> 0:00:49,000
From 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.

12
0:00:51.418,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You can imagine as a child what I went through.

13
0:00:56.008,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Day to day, I watched women

14
0:00:58.881,000 --> 0:01:,000
being carried to a graveyard,

15
0:01:02.151,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or watched children going to a graveyard.

16
0:01:07.555,000 --> 0:01:1,000
At that time, when I finished my high school,

17
0:01:10.603,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I really wanted to be a doctor.

18
0:01:13.371,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.

19
0:01:18.053,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So I completed my education,

20
0:01:20.522,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but I wanted to go to university.

21
0:01:23.29,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Unfortunately, in my country, there wasn't a dormitory for girls,

22
0:01:28.585,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so I was accepted in medical school, but I could not go there.

23
0:01:33.606,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So as a result, my father sent me to America.

24
0:01:38.999,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I came to America.

25
0:01:40.932,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I completed my education.

26
0:01:43.355,000 --> 0:01:45,000
While I was completing my education,

27
0:01:45.799,000 --> 0:01:48,000
my country was invaded by Russia.

28
0:01:50.299,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And do you know that at the time I was completing my education,

29
0:01:54.406,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country.

30
0:01:58.454,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There were months, years, I didn't know about it.

31
0:02:02.358,000 --> 0:02:05,000
My family was in a refugee camp.

32
0:02:06.789,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So as soon as I completed my education,

33
0:02:10.844,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I brought my family to America.

34
0:02:13.4,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I wanted them to be safe.

35
0:02:16.046,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But where was my heart?

36
0:02:18.11,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My heart was in Afghanistan.

37
0:02:20.522,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Day after day, when I listened to the news,

38
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:25,000
when I followed what was going on with my country,

39
0:02:26.498,000 --> 0:02:27,000
my heart was breaking up.

40
0:02:28.442,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I really wanted to go back to my country,

41
0:02:31.014,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but at the same time I knew I could not go there,

42
0:02:33.807,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because there was no place for me.

43
0:02:36.577,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I had a good job.

44
0:02:38.371,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was a professor at a university.

45
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I earned good money.

46
0:02:42.506,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I had a good life.

47
0:02:44.196,000 --> 0:02:45,000
My family was here.

48
0:02:46.007,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I could live with them.

49
0:02:48.022,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But I wasn't happy.

50
0:02:49.904,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I wanted to go back home.

51
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So I went to the refugee camp.

52
0:02:54.912,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan,

53
0:02:58.126,000 --> 0:03:,000
there were 7.5 million refugees.

54
0:03:01.745,000 --> 0:03:03,000
7.5 million refugees.

55
0:03:04.898,000 --> 0:03:08,000
About 90 percent of them were women and children.

56
0:03:09.811,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Most of the men have been killed or they were in war.

57
0:03:13.85,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And you know, in the refugee camp,

58
0:03:16.698,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when I went day-to-day to do a survey,

59
0:03:19.674,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I found things you never could imagine.

60
0:03:24.174,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I saw a widow with five to eight children

61
0:03:26.873,000 --> 0:03:28,000
sitting there and weeping

62
0:03:29.435,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and not knowing what to do.

63
0:03:31.396,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere,

64
0:03:35.07,000 --> 0:03:39,000
no education, no entertainment, no place to even live.

65
0:03:40.736,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I saw young men that had lost their father and their home,

66
0:03:45.538,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy --

67
0:03:50.455,000 --> 0:03:51,000
being the head of the household,

68
0:03:52.169,000 --> 0:03:55,000
trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children.

69
0:03:56.113,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So it was a very devastating situation.

70
0:03:59.176,000 --> 0:04:01,000
My heart was beating for my people,

71
0:04:02.128,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I didn't know what to do.

72
0:04:04.533,000 --> 0:04:06,000
At that moment, we talk about momentum.

73
0:04:07.636,000 --> 0:04:1,000
At that moment, I felt, what can I do for these people?

74
0:04:11.801,000 --> 0:04:12,000
How could I help these people?

75
0:04:13.628,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I am one individual. What can I do for them?

76
0:04:17.205,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But at that moment, I knew

77
0:04:19.872,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that education changed my life.

78
0:04:22.745,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It transformed me. It gave me status.

79
0:04:26.483,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It gave me confidence. It gave me a career.

80
0:04:30.138,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It helped me to support my family,

81
0:04:32.376,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to bring my family to another country,

82
0:04:34.855,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to be safe.

83
0:04:36.853,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I knew that at that moment

84
0:04:39.614,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that what I should give to my people is education and health,

85
0:04:43.932,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and that's what I went after.

86
0:04:45.942,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But do you think it was easy?

87
0:04:48.695,000 --> 0:04:54,000
No, because at that time, education was banned for girls, completely.

88
0:04:56.346,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,

89
0:05:00.058,000 --> 0:05:02,000
people were not trusting anyone.

90
0:05:03.058,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It was very hard to come and say, "I want to do this."

91
0:05:06.804,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Who am I?

92
0:05:08.249,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Somebody who comes from the United States.

93
0:05:10.399,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Somebody who got educated here.

94
0:05:12.321,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Did they trust me? Of course not.

95
0:05:15.622,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So I really needed to build the trust in this community.

96
0:05:19.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
How am I going to do that?

97
0:05:22.372,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I went and surveyed and looked and looked.

98
0:05:25.626,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I asked.

99
0:05:26.959,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Finally, I found one man.

100
0:05:29.674,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He was 80 years old.

101
0:05:31.412,000 --> 0:05:32,000
He was a mullah.

102
0:05:33.435,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I went to his tent in the camp,

103
0:05:36.451,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and I asked him,

104
0:05:38.07,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"I want to make you a teacher."

105
0:05:41.117,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And he looked at me,

106
0:05:42.792,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and he said, "Crazy woman,

107
0:05:45.157,000 --> 0:05:49,000
crazy woman, how do you think I can be a teacher?"

108
0:05:49.911,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I told him, "I will make you a teacher."

109
0:05:52.705,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Finally, he accepted my offer,

110
0:05:55.554,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and once I started a class in his compound,

111
0:05:58.935,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the word spread all over.

112
0:06:01.657,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In a matter of one year,

113
0:06:03.823,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we had 25 schools set up,

114
0:06:06.768,000 --> 0:06:08,000
15,000 children going to school,

115
0:06:09.736,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and it was amazing.

116
0:06:11.856,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

117
0:06:14.117,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Thank you.

118
0:06:16.236,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Thank you.

119
0:06:18.252,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But of course, we're doing all our work, we were giving teacher training.

120
0:06:23.818,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We were training women's rights, human rights, democracy, rule of law.

121
0:06:28.611,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We were giving all kinds of training.

122
0:06:31.064,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And one day, I tell you,

123
0:06:34.087,000 --> 0:06:37,000
one day I was in the office in Peshawar, Pakistan.

124
0:06:38.556,000 --> 0:06:42,000
All of a sudden, I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors

125
0:06:43.49,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and telling me, "Run away, hide!"

126
0:06:47.268,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And you know, as a leader, what do you do?

127
0:06:50.419,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You're scared. You know it's dangerous.

128
0:06:54.317,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You know your life is on the line.

129
0:06:56.111,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But as a leader, you have to hold it together.

130
0:06:59.309,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You have to hold it together and show strength.

131
0:07:02.412,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So I said, "What's going on?"

132
0:07:04.642,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And these people were pouring into my office.

133
0:07:07.88,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So I invited them to the office.

134
0:07:09.563,000 --> 0:07:13,000
They came, and there were nine of them -- nine Taliban.

135
0:07:14.753,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see.

136
0:07:17.499,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:19.564,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Very mean-looking people,

138
0:07:21.586,000 --> 0:07:23,000
black clothes, black turban,

139
0:07:23.857,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and they pour into my office.

140
0:07:26.046,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And I invited them to have a seat and have tea.

141
0:07:29.641,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They said no. They are not going to drink tea.

142
0:07:32.934,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And of course, with the tone of voice they were using,

143
0:07:36.41,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it was very scary,

144
0:07:37.83,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but I was really shaking up.

145
0:07:40.441,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But also I was strong, holding myself up.

146
0:07:44.424,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And, of course, by that time, you know how I dress --

147
0:07:47.378,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I dress from head to toe in a black hijab.

148
0:07:49.973,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The only thing you could see, my eyes.

149
0:07:53.464,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They asked me, "What are you doing?

150
0:07:55.942,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Don't you know that school is banned for girls?

151
0:07:59.776,000 --> 0:08:,000
What are you doing here?"

152
0:08:01.926,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And you know, I just looked at them,

153
0:08:04.547,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and I said, "What school? Where is the school?"

154
0:08:07.507,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:10.332,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Applause)

156
0:08:13.452,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And they look at my face, and they said, "You are teaching girls here."

157
0:08:17.237,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I said, "This is a house of somebody.

158
0:08:20.428,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We have some students coming,

159
0:08:22.356,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and they are all learning Koran, Holy Book.

160
0:08:25.792,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And you know, Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book, the woman,

161
0:08:30.086,000 --> 0:08:32,000
they can be a good wife,

162
0:08:32.363,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and they can obey their husband."

163
0:08:34.768,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:38.936,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And I tell you one thing:

165
0:08:40.777,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that's the way you work with those people, and you know --

166
0:08:43.524,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:44.999,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So by that time, they started speaking Pashto.

168
0:08:49.046,000 --> 0:08:5,000
They talked to each other,

169
0:08:50.999,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and they said, "Let's go, leave her alone, she's OK."

170
0:08:54.904,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And you know, this time, I offered them tea again,

171
0:08:58.832,000 --> 0:09:,000
and they took a sip and they left.

172
0:09:02.141,000 --> 0:09:06,000
By that time, my staff poured into my office.

173
0:09:06.292,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They were scared to death.

174
0:09:08.331,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They didn't know why they didn't kill me.

175
0:09:10.426,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They didn't know why they didn't take me away.

176
0:09:12.887,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But everybody was happy to see me.

177
0:09:16.164,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Very happy, and I was happy to be alive, of course.

178
0:09:19.181,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:20.356,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Of course, I was happy to be alive.

180
0:09:22.394,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But also, as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban --

181
0:09:28.294,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of course during the Taliban there is another story.

182
0:09:30.755,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls,

183
0:09:34.938,000 --> 0:09:37,000
3,000 students underground, and continuously we trained.

184
0:09:38.802,000 --> 0:09:4,000
With the fall of the Taliban, we went into the country,

185
0:09:41.743,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and we opened school after school.

186
0:09:44.227,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We opened women's learning center.

187
0:09:46.656,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We continuously opened clinics.

188
0:09:48.616,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We worked with mothers and children.

189
0:09:50.624,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We had reproductive health training.

190
0:09:52.371,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We had all kinds of training that you can imagine.

191
0:09:55.489,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I was very happy. I was delighted with the outcome of my work.

192
0:10:00.155,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And one day, with four trainers and one bodyguard,

193
0:10:03.771,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I was going up north of Kabul,

194
0:10:06.692,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and all of a sudden, again,

195
0:10:09.239,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I was stopped in the middle of the road

196
0:10:11.541,000 --> 0:10:12,000
by 19 young men.

197
0:10:13.836,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Rifles on their shoulders, they blocked the road.

198
0:10:17.646,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And I told my driver, "What's going on?"

199
0:10:20.575,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And the driver said, "I don't know."

200
0:10:22.322,000 --> 0:10:24,000
He asked them. They said, "We have nothing to do with you."

201
0:10:25.115,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They called my name. They said, "We want her."

202
0:10:28.828,000 --> 0:10:3,000
My bodyguard got out, said, "I can answer you.

203
0:10:31.755,000 --> 0:10:32,000
What do you want?"

204
0:10:33.073,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They said, "Nothing." They called my name.

205
0:10:35.104,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And by that time, the women are yelling and screaming inside the car.

206
0:10:39.999,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I am very shaken up, and I told myself, this is it.

207
0:10:42.578,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This time, we all are going to be killed.

208
0:10:45.119,000 --> 0:10:47,000
There is no doubt in my mind.

209
0:10:47.721,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But still, the moment comes, and you take strength

210
0:10:52.657,000 --> 0:10:54,000
from whatever you believe and whatever you do.

211
0:10:55.555,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's in your heart.

212
0:10:56.944,000 --> 0:10:58,000
You believe in your worth, and you can walk on it.

213
0:10:59.843,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So I just hold myself on the side of the car.

214
0:11:03.406,000 --> 0:11:06,000
My leg was shaking, and I got outside.

215
0:11:06.985,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And I asked them, "What can I do for you?"

216
0:11:09.509,000 --> 0:11:1,000
You know what they said to me?

217
0:11:11.12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They said, "We know who you are.

218
0:11:14.286,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We know where you are going.

219
0:11:16.232,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Every day you go up north here and there.

220
0:11:18.937,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You train women, you teach them

221
0:11:22.009,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and also you give them an opportunity to have a job.

222
0:11:25.08,000 --> 0:11:27,000
You build their skills. How about us?"

223
0:11:27.904,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:30.779,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Applause)

225
0:11:33.771,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"And you know, how about us?

226
0:11:38.159,000 --> 0:11:39,000
What are we going to do?"

227
0:11:39.769,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I looked at them, and I said, "I don't know."

228
0:11:42.165,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:45.007,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They said, "It's OK.

230
0:11:46.602,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The only thing we can do, what we know,

231
0:11:48.786,000 --> 0:11:51,000
from the time we're born, we just hold the gun and kill.

232
0:11:51.889,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That's all we know."

233
0:11:53.713,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And you know what that means.

234
0:11:55.206,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's a trap to me, of course.

235
0:11:57.522,000 --> 0:12:,000
So I walk out of there. They said, "We'll let you go, go."

236
0:12:01.435,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And so I walked into the car, I sit in the car,

237
0:12:04.363,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and I told the driver, "Turn around and go back to the office."

238
0:12:07.999,000 --> 0:12:1,000
At that time, we only were supporting girls.

239
0:12:11.436,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We only had money for women to train them,

240
0:12:14.921,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to send them to school, and nothing else.

241
0:12:17.881,000 --> 0:12:19,000
By the time I came to the office,

242
0:12:20.722,000 --> 0:12:22,000
of course my trainers were gone.

243
0:12:22.999,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They ran away home. Nobody stayed there.

244
0:12:26.414,000 --> 0:12:28,000
My bodyguard was the only one there,

245
0:12:29.39,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and my voice was completely gone.

246
0:12:32.12,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I was shaken up, and I sat on my table,

247
0:12:35.279,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and I said, "What am I going to do?"

248
0:12:37.827,000 --> 0:12:39,000
How am I going to solve this problem?

249
0:12:40.327,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Because we had training going on up north already.

250
0:12:44.08,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Hundreds of women were there coming to get training.

251
0:12:48.295,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So I was sitting there, all of a sudden, at this moment,

252
0:12:52.072,000 --> 0:12:53,000
talking about momentum, we are,

253
0:12:54.501,000 --> 0:12:55,000
at that moment,

254
0:12:56.406,000 --> 0:12:59,000
one of my wonderful donors called me about a report.

255
0:13:01.207,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And she asked me, "Sakena?" And I answered her.

256
0:13:04.764,000 --> 0:13:06,000
She said, "It's not you. What's wrong with you?"

257
0:13:07.136,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I said, "Nothing." I tried to cover.

258
0:13:10.461,000 --> 0:13:12,000
No matter what I tried to do, she didn't believe me,

259
0:13:13.341,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and she asked me again.

260
0:13:15.016,000 --> 0:13:16,000
"OK, tell me what's going on?"

261
0:13:16.882,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I told her the whole story.

262
0:13:18.944,000 --> 0:13:22,000
At that time, she said, "OK, you go next time, and you will help them.

263
0:13:24.222,000 --> 0:13:25,000
You will help them."

264
0:13:26.142,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And when, two days later, I went the same route,

265
0:13:30.364,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and do you know, they were not in here,

266
0:13:32.881,000 --> 0:13:34,000
they were a little back further,

267
0:13:35.078,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the same young men, standing up there and holding the rifle

268
0:13:39.651,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and pointing to us to stop the car.

269
0:13:41.981,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So we stopped the car.

270
0:13:43.729,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I got out. I said, "OK, let's go with me."

271
0:13:46.999,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And they said, "Yes."

272
0:13:48.301,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I said, "On one condition, that whatever I say, you accept it."

273
0:13:53.046,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And they said, yes, they do.

274
0:13:54.649,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So I took them to the mosque,

275
0:13:56.863,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and to make a long story short,

276
0:13:59.999,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I told them I'd give them teachers.

277
0:14:02.763,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Today, they are the best trainers.

278
0:14:06.739,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They learn English,

279
0:14:08.422,000 --> 0:14:1,000
they learn how to be teachers,

280
0:14:10.882,000 --> 0:14:11,000
they learn computers,

281
0:14:12.644,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and they are my guides.

282
0:14:14.518,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas,

283
0:14:18.379,000 --> 0:14:2,000
they go with me. They are ahead, and we go.

284
0:14:20.65,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And they protect us.

285
0:14:23.275,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And --

286
0:14:24.45,000 --> 0:14:25,000
(Applause)

287
0:14:25.625,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Thank you.

288
0:14:26.8,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

289
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
That tells you that education transforms people.

290
0:14:35.513,000 --> 0:14:37,000
When you educate people,

291
0:14:37.671,000 --> 0:14:38,000
they are going to be different,

292
0:14:39.663,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and today all over,

293
0:14:41.37,000 --> 0:14:43,000
we need to work for gender equality.

294
0:14:43.766,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We cannot only train women but forget about the men,

295
0:14:47.496,000 --> 0:14:52,000
because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time.

296
0:14:52.974,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Laughter)

297
0:14:54.577,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So we started training men because the men should know

298
0:14:58.362,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the potential of women,

299
0:14:59.853,000 --> 0:15:01,000
know how much these potential men has,

300
0:15:02.378,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and how much these women can do the same job they are doing.

301
0:15:06.997,000 --> 0:15:09,000
So we are continuously giving training to men,

302
0:15:10.401,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and I really believe strongly.

303
0:15:13.711,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I live in a country that was a beautiful country.

304
0:15:16.855,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I just want to share this with you.

305
0:15:19.006,000 --> 0:15:2,000
It was a beautiful country,

306
0:15:20.848,000 --> 0:15:22,000
beautiful, peaceful country.

307
0:15:23.276,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We were going everywhere.

308
0:15:25.252,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Women were getting education:

309
0:15:27.349,000 --> 0:15:29,000
lawyer, engineer, teacher,

310
0:15:30.205,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and we were going from house to house.

311
0:15:32.396,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We never locked our doors.

312
0:15:34.912,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But you know what happened to my country.

313
0:15:36.898,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Today, people cannot walk out of their door without security issues.

314
0:15:43.297,000 --> 0:15:47,000
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before.

315
0:15:48.254,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And I want to tell you the other side.

316
0:15:50.222,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Today, the women of Afghanistan are working very, very hard.

317
0:15:54.166,000 --> 0:15:58,000
They are earning degrees. They are training to be lawyers.

318
0:15:58.65,000 --> 0:16:,000
They are training to be doctors, back again.

319
0:16:00.904,000 --> 0:16:01,000
They are training to be teachers,

320
0:16:02.578,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and they are running businesses.

321
0:16:04.927,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So it is so wonderful

322
0:16:07.389,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to see people like that reach their complete potential,

323
0:16:12.109,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and all of this is going to happen.

324
0:16:14.712,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I want to share this with you,

325
0:16:16.578,000 --> 0:16:17,000
because of love,

326
0:16:18.292,000 --> 0:16:19,000
because of compassion,

327
0:16:20.109,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and because of trust and honesty.

328
0:16:23.22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
If you have these few things with you,

329
0:16:26.939,000 --> 0:16:27,000
you will accomplish.

330
0:16:29.019,000 --> 0:16:32,000

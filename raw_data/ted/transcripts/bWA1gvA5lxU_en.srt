1
0:00:12.809,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was talking to a guy at a party in California

2
0:00:16.389,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about tech platforms

3
0:00:17.865,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and the problems they're creating in society.

4
0:00:21.429,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And he said, "Man, if the CEOs just did more drugs

5
0:00:25.192,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and went to Burning Man,

6
0:00:26.399,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we wouldn't be in this mess."

7
0:00:28.065,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:29.462,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I said, "I'm not sure I agree with you."

9
0:00:33.129,000 --> 0:00:36,000
For one thing, most of the CEOs have already been to Burning Man.

10
0:00:36.247,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:37.285,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But also, I'm just not sure that watching a bunch of half-naked people

12
0:00:40.636,000 --> 0:00:41,000
run around and burn things

13
0:00:41.978,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is really the inspiration they need right now.

14
0:00:44.23,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:45.934,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But I do agree that things are a mess.

16
0:00:49.037,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And so, we're going to come back to this guy,

17
0:00:51.187,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but let's talk about the mess.

18
0:00:53.585,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Our climate's getting hotter and hotter.

19
0:00:55.982,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's getting harder and harder to tell truth from fiction.

20
0:00:58.736,000 --> 0:01:,000
And we've got this global migratory crisis.

21
0:01:01.625,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And just at the moment when we really need new tools

22
0:01:04.897,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and new ways of coming together as a society,

23
0:01:07.669,000 --> 0:01:11,000
it feels like social media is kind of tearing at our civic fabric

24
0:01:11.947,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and setting us against each other.

25
0:01:14.411,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We've got viral misinformation on WhatsApp,

26
0:01:17.427,000 --> 0:01:18,000
bullying on Instagram

27
0:01:19.427,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and Russian hackers on Facebook.

28
0:01:22.633,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I think this conversation that we're having right now

29
0:01:25.688,000 --> 0:01:27,000
about the harms that these platforms are creating

30
0:01:28.524,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is so important.

31
0:01:30.823,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But I also worry

32
0:01:32.641,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that we could be letting a kind of good existential crisis in Silicon Valley

33
0:01:37.061,000 --> 0:01:38,000
go to waste

34
0:01:38.624,000 --> 0:01:41,000
if the bar for success is just that it's a little harder

35
0:01:41.706,000 --> 0:01:44,000
for Macedonian teenagers to publish false news.

36
0:01:46.489,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The big question, I think, is not just

37
0:01:48.846,000 --> 0:01:5,000
what do we want platforms to stop doing,

38
0:01:51.759,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but now that they've effectively taken control of our online public square,

39
0:01:56.284,000 --> 0:01:58,000
what do we need from them for the greater good?

40
0:01:59.827,000 --> 0:02:03,000
To me, this is one of the most important questions of our time.

41
0:02:05.161,000 --> 0:02:08,000
What obligations do tech platforms have to us

42
0:02:08.463,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in exchange for the power we let them hold over our discourse?

43
0:02:13.022,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I think this question is so important,

44
0:02:15.061,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because even if today’s platforms go away,

45
0:02:17.498,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we need to answer this question

46
0:02:19.03,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in order to be able to ensure that the new platforms that come back

47
0:02:22.588,000 --> 0:02:23,000
are any better.

48
0:02:24.683,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So for the last year, I've been working with Dr. Talia Stroud

49
0:02:27.668,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at the University of Texas, Austin.

50
0:02:29.382,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We've talked to sociologists and political scientists

51
0:02:32.139,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and philosophers

52
0:02:33.379,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to try to answer this question.

53
0:02:35.641,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And at first we asked,

54
0:02:36.984,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"If you were Twitter or Facebook and trying to rank content for democracy

55
0:02:41.37,000 --> 0:02:43,000
rather than for ad clicks or engagement,

56
0:02:43.772,000 --> 0:02:44,000
what might that look like?"

57
0:02:46.089,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But then we realized,

58
0:02:47.598,000 --> 0:02:5,000
this sort of suggests that this is an information problem

59
0:02:51.157,000 --> 0:02:52,000
or a content problem.

60
0:02:53.585,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And for us, the platform crisis is a people problem.

61
0:02:58.721,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's a problem about the emergent weird things that happen

62
0:03:01.896,000 --> 0:03:03,000
when large groups of people get together.

63
0:03:04.698,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And so we turned to another, older idea.

64
0:03:08.307,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We asked,

65
0:03:09.482,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"What happens when we think about platforms as spaces?"

66
0:03:13.442,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We know from social psychology that spaces shape behavior.

67
0:03:17.969,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You put the same group of people in a room like this,

68
0:03:21.588,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and they're going to behave really differently

69
0:03:23.778,000 --> 0:03:24,000
than in a room like this.

70
0:03:25.802,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When researchers put softer furniture in classrooms,

71
0:03:28.712,000 --> 0:03:31,000
participation rates rose by 42 percent.

72
0:03:32.712,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And spaces even have political consequences.

73
0:03:36.157,000 --> 0:03:39,000
When researchers looked at neighborhoods with parks

74
0:03:39.823,000 --> 0:03:4,000
versus neighborhoods without,

75
0:03:41.331,000 --> 0:03:43,000
after adjusting for socioeconomic factors,

76
0:03:43.987,000 --> 0:03:46,000
they found that neighborhoods with parks had higher levels of social trust

77
0:03:47.755,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and were better able to advocate for themselves politically.

78
0:03:51.549,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So spaces shape behavior,

79
0:03:54.109,000 --> 0:03:56,000
partly by the way they're designed

80
0:03:56.879,000 --> 0:04:,000
and partly by the way that they encode certain norms about how to behave.

81
0:04:02.749,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We all know that there are some behaviors that are OK in a bar

82
0:04:06.419,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that are not OK in a library,

83
0:04:08.162,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and maybe vice versa.

84
0:04:10.13,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And this gives us a little bit of a clue,

85
0:04:12.177,000 --> 0:04:13,000
because there are online spaces

86
0:04:13.932,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that encode these same kinds of behavioral norms.

87
0:04:18.244,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, for example, behavior on LinkedIn

88
0:04:21.109,000 --> 0:04:22,000
seems pretty good.

89
0:04:23.419,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Why?

90
0:04:24.713,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Because it reads as a workplace.

91
0:04:26.871,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And so people follow workplace norms.

92
0:04:29.545,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You can even see it in the way they dress in their profile pictures.

93
0:04:33.19,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:34.379,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So if LinkedIn is a workplace,

95
0:04:37.549,000 --> 0:04:38,000
what is Twitter like?

96
0:04:39.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:40.458,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Well, it's like a vast, cavernous expanse,

98
0:04:43.696,000 --> 0:04:45,000
where there are people talking about sports,

99
0:04:45.784,000 --> 0:04:47,000
arguing about politics, yelling at each other, flirting,

100
0:04:48.489,000 --> 0:04:49,000
trying to get a job,

101
0:04:49.683,000 --> 0:04:51,000
all in the same place, with no walls, no divisions,

102
0:04:52.45,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and the owner gets paid more the louder the noise is.

103
0:04:55.323,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:56.387,000 --> 0:04:57,000
No wonder it's a mess.

105
0:04:58.744,000 --> 0:05:,000
And this raises another thing that become obvious

106
0:05:01.403,000 --> 0:05:03,000
when we think about platforms in terms of physical space.

107
0:05:04.997,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Good physical spaces are almost always structured.

108
0:05:08.64,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They have rules.

109
0:05:11.108,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Silicon Valley is built on this idea that unstructured space is conducive

110
0:05:17.753,000 --> 0:05:18,000
for human behavior.

111
0:05:19.196,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I actually think there's a reason for this myopia

112
0:05:21.871,000 --> 0:05:24,000
built into the location of Silicon Valley itself.

113
0:05:26.077,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So, Michele Gelfand is a sociologist

114
0:05:29.261,000 --> 0:05:31,000
who studies how norms vary across cultures.

115
0:05:31.719,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And she watches how cultures like Japan -- which she calls "tight" --

116
0:05:36.618,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is very conformist, very rule-following,

117
0:05:38.982,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and cultures like Brazil are very loose.

118
0:05:41.919,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You can see this even in things like

119
0:05:43.872,000 --> 0:05:45,000
how closely synchronized the clocks are on a city street.

120
0:05:47.244,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So as you can see, the United States is one of the looser countries.

121
0:05:51.947,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And the loosest state in the United States is,

122
0:05:55.336,000 --> 0:05:57,000
you got it, California.

123
0:05:58.709,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And Silicon Valley culture came out of the 1970s Californian counterculture.

124
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So, just to recap:

125
0:06:05.529,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the spaces that the world is living in

126
0:06:07.743,000 --> 0:06:09,000
came out of the loosest culture in the loosest state

127
0:06:10.27,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in one of the loosest countries in the world.

128
0:06:14.014,000 --> 0:06:16,000
No wonder they undervalue structure.

129
0:06:17.821,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I think this really matters, because people need structure.

130
0:06:22.749,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You may have heard this word "anomie."

131
0:06:24.94,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It literally means "a lack of norms" in French.

132
0:06:27.784,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It was coined by Émile Durkheim

133
0:06:29.612,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to describe the vast, overwhelming feeling

134
0:06:33.866,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that people have in spaces without norms.

135
0:06:37.278,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Anomie has political consequences.

136
0:06:40.317,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Because what Gelfand has found is that, when things are too loose,

137
0:06:45.311,000 --> 0:06:47,000
people crave order and structure.

138
0:06:48.182,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And that craving for order and structure correlates really strongly

139
0:06:52.966,000 --> 0:06:54,000
with support for people like these guys.

140
0:06:55.237,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:57.442,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I don't think it's crazy to ask

142
0:06:59.776,000 --> 0:07:04,000
if the structurelessness of online life is actually feeding anxiety

143
0:07:05.236,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that's increasing a responsiveness to authoritarianism.

144
0:07:10.561,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So how might platforms bring people together

145
0:07:14.093,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in a way that creates meaning

146
0:07:15.911,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and helps people understand each other?

147
0:07:18.68,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And this brings me back to our friend from Burning Man.

148
0:07:22.545,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Because listening to him, I realized:

149
0:07:24.72,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it's not just that Burning Man isn't the solution --

150
0:07:27.791,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it's actually a perfect metaphor for the problem.

151
0:07:31.077,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:32.45,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You know, it's a great place to visit for a week,

153
0:07:34.784,000 --> 0:07:37,000
this amazing art city, rising out of nowhere in the dust.

154
0:07:39.387,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But you wouldn't want to live there.

155
0:07:41.139,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:42.202,000 --> 0:07:43,000
There's no running water,

157
0:07:44.014,000 --> 0:07:45,000
there's no trash pickup.

158
0:07:45.68,000 --> 0:07:47,000
At some point, the hallucinogens run out,

159
0:07:48.288,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and you're stuck with a bunch of wealthy white guys

160
0:07:50.701,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in the dust in the desert.

161
0:07:52.027,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

162
0:07:53.233,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Which, to me, is sometimes how social media feels in 2019.

163
0:07:57.415,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:59.06,000 --> 0:08:03,000
A great, fun, hallucinatory place to visit has become our home.

165
0:08:05.147,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And so,

166
0:08:06.575,000 --> 0:08:08,000
if we look at platforms through the lens of spaces,

167
0:08:09.077,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we can then ask ourselves:

168
0:08:10.688,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Who knows how to structure spaces for the public good?

169
0:08:16.053,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And it turns out, this is a question

170
0:08:17.827,000 --> 0:08:19,000
people have been thinking about for a long time about cities.

171
0:08:21.855,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Cities were the original platforms.

172
0:08:24.474,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Two-sided marketplace?

173
0:08:25.984,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Check.

174
0:08:27.3,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Place to keep up with old friends and distant relatives?

175
0:08:30.533,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Check.

176
0:08:31.723,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Vector for viral sharing?

177
0:08:33.684,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Check.

178
0:08:35.073,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In fact, cities have encountered

179
0:08:37.271,000 --> 0:08:4,000
a lot of the same social and political challenges

180
0:08:40.934,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that platforms are now encountering.

181
0:08:43.871,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They've dealt with massive growth that overwhelmed existing communities

182
0:08:49.656,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and the rise of new business models.

183
0:08:53.799,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They've even had new, frictionless technologies

184
0:08:56.729,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that promised to connect everyone together

185
0:08:59.736,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and that instead deepened existing social and race divides.

186
0:09:05.371,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But because of this history of decay and renewal

187
0:09:08.39,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and segregation and integration,

188
0:09:10.585,000 --> 0:09:12,000
cities are the source of some of our best ideas

189
0:09:13.307,000 --> 0:09:16,000
about how to build functional, thriving communities.

190
0:09:18.053,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Faced with a top-down, car-driven vision of city life,

191
0:09:22.276,000 --> 0:09:24,000
pioneers like Jane Jacobs said,

192
0:09:24.982,000 --> 0:09:28,000
let’s instead put human relationships at the center of urban design.

193
0:09:30.053,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Jacobs and her fellow travelers like Holly Whyte, her editor,

194
0:09:33.555,000 --> 0:09:37,000
were these really great observers of what actually happened on the street.

195
0:09:38.274,000 --> 0:09:41,000
They watched: Where did people stop and talk?

196
0:09:42.005,000 --> 0:09:44,000
When did neighbors become friends?

197
0:09:44.339,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And they learned a lot.

198
0:09:46.53,000 --> 0:09:5,000
For example, they noticed that successful public places

199
0:09:51.101,000 --> 0:09:54,000
generally have three different ways that they structure behavior.

200
0:09:54.711,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There's the built environment,

201
0:09:57.188,000 --> 0:10:01,000
you know, that we're going to put a fountain here or a playground there.

202
0:10:01.972,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But then, there's programming,

203
0:10:03.909,000 --> 0:10:07,000
like, let's put a band at seven and get the kids out.

204
0:10:08.917,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And there's this idea of mayors,

205
0:10:11.138,000 --> 0:10:14,000
people who kind of take this informal ownership of a space

206
0:10:14.331,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to keep it welcoming and clean.

207
0:10:17.778,000 --> 0:10:19,000
All three of these things actually have analogues online.

208
0:10:21.331,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But platforms mostly focus on code,

209
0:10:23.365,000 --> 0:10:25,000
on what's physically possible in the space.

210
0:10:26.81,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And they focus much less on these other two softer, social areas.

211
0:10:31.549,000 --> 0:10:32,000
What are people doing there?

212
0:10:33.272,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Who's taking responsibility for it?

213
0:10:36.47,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So like Jane Jacobs did for cities,

214
0:10:39.173,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Talia and I think we need a new design movement

215
0:10:42.267,000 --> 0:10:43,000
for online space,

216
0:10:43.942,000 --> 0:10:44,000
one that considers

217
0:10:45.143,000 --> 0:10:5,000
not just "How do we build products that work for users or consumers?"

218
0:10:50.245,000 --> 0:10:52,000
"How do we make something user-friendly?"

219
0:10:53.18,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but "How do we make products that are public-friendly?"

220
0:10:58.093,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Because we need products that don't serve individuals

221
0:11:01.948,000 --> 0:11:04,000
at the expense of the social fabric on which we all depend.

222
0:11:06.877,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And we need it urgently,

223
0:11:08.06,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because political scientists tell us

224
0:11:10.282,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that healthy democracies need healthy public spaces.

225
0:11:17.416,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So, the public-friendly digital design movement that Talia and I imagine

226
0:11:21.599,000 --> 0:11:22,000
asks this question:

227
0:11:22.95,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What would this interaction be like if it was happening in physical space?

228
0:11:26.998,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And it asks the reverse question:

229
0:11:28.612,000 --> 0:11:3,000
What can we learn from good physical spaces

230
0:11:31.265,000 --> 0:11:33,000
about how to structure behavior in the online world?

231
0:11:34.138,000 --> 0:11:37,000
For example, I grew up in a small town in Maine,

232
0:11:37.257,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and I went to a lot of those town hall meetings that you hear about.

233
0:11:41.419,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And unlike the storybook version, they weren't always nice.

234
0:11:45.315,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Like, people had big conflicts, big feelings ...

235
0:11:48.419,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It was hard sometimes.

236
0:11:50.03,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But because of the way that that space was structured,

237
0:11:52.879,000 --> 0:11:54,000
we managed to land it OK.

238
0:11:55.897,000 --> 0:11:56,000
How?

239
0:11:57.333,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Well, here's one important piece.

240
0:12:00.349,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The downcast glance, the dirty look,

241
0:12:02.73,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the raised eyebrow, the cough ...

242
0:12:05.627,000 --> 0:12:09,000
When people went on too long or lost the crowd,

243
0:12:09.828,000 --> 0:12:12,000
they didn't get banned or blocked or hauled out by the police,

244
0:12:13.455,000 --> 0:12:15,000
they just got this soft, negative social feedback.

245
0:12:16.903,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And that was actually very powerful.

246
0:12:20.101,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I think Facebook and Twitter could build this,

247
0:12:22.786,000 --> 0:12:24,000
something like this.

248
0:12:27.097,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Laughter)

249
0:12:31.136,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I think there are some other things that online spaces can learn

250
0:12:34.225,000 --> 0:12:35,000
from offline spaces.

251
0:12:36.061,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Holly Whyte observed that in healthy public spaces,

252
0:12:39.331,000 --> 0:12:42,000
there are often many different places that afford different ways of relating.

253
0:12:43.006,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So the picnic table where you have lunch with your family

254
0:12:48.83,000 --> 0:12:51,000
may not be suited for the romantic walk with a partner

255
0:12:52.736,000 --> 0:12:54,000
or the talk with some business colleagues.

256
0:12:55.514,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And it's worth noting that in real space,

257
0:12:57.538,000 --> 0:13:01,000
in none of these places are there big, visible public signs of engagement.

258
0:13:02.919,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So digital designers could think about

259
0:13:05.79,000 --> 0:13:07,000
what kind of conversations do we actually want to invite,

260
0:13:08.794,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and how do we build specifically for those kinds of conversations.

261
0:13:13.056,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Remember the park that we talked about that built social trust?

262
0:13:16.969,000 --> 0:13:19,000
That didn't happen because people were having these big political arguments.

263
0:13:20.662,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Most strangers don't actually even talk to each other

264
0:13:23.187,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the first three or four or five times they see each other.

265
0:13:27.378,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But when people, even very different people,

266
0:13:29.835,000 --> 0:13:3,000
see each other a lot,

267
0:13:31.025,000 --> 0:13:32,000
they develop familiarity,

268
0:13:32.271,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and that creates the bedrock for relationships.

269
0:13:35.887,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And I think, actually, you know,

270
0:13:39.276,000 --> 0:13:44,000
maybe that early idea of cyberspace as kind of this bodiless meeting place

271
0:13:44.322,000 --> 0:13:45,000
of pure minds and pure ideas

272
0:13:46.248,000 --> 0:13:47,000
sent us off in the wrong direction.

273
0:13:48.913,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Maybe what we need instead is to find a way to be in proximity,

274
0:13:52.302,000 --> 0:13:54,000
mostly talking amongst ourselves,

275
0:13:54.5,000 --> 0:13:56,000
but all sharing the same warm sun.

276
0:13:58.391,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And finally:

277
0:13:59.577,000 --> 0:14:03,000
healthy public spaces create a sense of ownership and equity.

278
0:14:04.494,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And this is where the city metaphor becomes challenging.

279
0:14:07.629,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Because, if Twitter is a city,

280
0:14:09.126,000 --> 0:14:12,000
it's a city that's owned by just a few people

281
0:14:12.228,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and optimized for financial return.

282
0:14:16.014,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I think we really need digital environments

283
0:14:19.133,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that we all actually have some real ownership of,

284
0:14:21.879,000 --> 0:14:24,000
environments that respect the diversity of human existence

285
0:14:25.895,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and that give us some say and some input into the process.

286
0:14:28.864,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And I think we need this urgently.

287
0:14:30.808,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Because Facebook right now --

288
0:14:32.697,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I sort of think of, like, 1970s New York.

289
0:14:35.67,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Laughter)

290
0:14:36.94,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The public spaces are decaying, there's trash in the streets,

291
0:14:40.178,000 --> 0:14:42,000
people are kind of, like, mentally and emotionally

292
0:14:42.678,000 --> 0:14:44,000
warming themselves over burning garbage.

293
0:14:44.792,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

294
0:14:46.18,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And --

295
0:14:48.315,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Applause)

296
0:14:53.623,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And the natural response to this is to hole up in your apartment

297
0:14:56.99,000 --> 0:14:58,000
or consider fleeing for the suburbs.

298
0:15:00.044,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It doesn't surprise me

299
0:15:01.568,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that people are giving up on the idea of online public spaces

300
0:15:05.861,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the way that they've given up on cities over their history.

301
0:15:10.268,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And sometimes -- I'll be honest --

302
0:15:12.006,000 --> 0:15:16,000
it feels to me like this whole project of, like, wiring up a civilization

303
0:15:16.323,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and getting billions of people to come into contact with each other

304
0:15:19.506,000 --> 0:15:2,000
is just impossible.

305
0:15:22.204,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But modern cities tell us that it is possible

306
0:15:25.258,000 --> 0:15:27,000
for millions of people who are really different,

307
0:15:27.528,000 --> 0:15:29,000
sometimes living right on top of each other,

308
0:15:30.433,000 --> 0:15:31,000
not just to not kill each other,

309
0:15:32.131,000 --> 0:15:34,000
but to actually build things together,

310
0:15:34.895,000 --> 0:15:35,000
find new experiences,

311
0:15:36.252,000 --> 0:15:39,000
create beautiful, important infrastructure.

312
0:15:41.153,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And we cannot give up on that promise.

313
0:15:45.855,000 --> 0:15:49,000
If we want to solve the big, important problems in front of us,

314
0:15:50.609,000 --> 0:15:52,000
we need better online public spaces.

315
0:15:53.893,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We need digital urban planners,

316
0:15:56.418,000 --> 0:15:57,000
new Jane Jacobses,

317
0:15:57.593,000 --> 0:16:01,000
who are going to build the parks and park benches of the online world.

318
0:16:01.783,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And we need digital, public-friendly architects,

319
0:16:05.32,000 --> 0:16:07,000
who are going to build what Eric Klinenberg calls

320
0:16:07.874,000 --> 0:16:11,000
"palaces for the people" -- libraries and museums and town halls.

321
0:16:12.241,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And we need a transnational movement,

322
0:16:14.982,000 --> 0:16:16,000
where these spaces can learn from each other,

323
0:16:17.403,000 --> 0:16:18,000
just like cities have,

324
0:16:18.643,000 --> 0:16:23,000
about everything from urban farming to public art to rapid transit.

325
0:16:25.215,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Humanity moves forward

326
0:16:28.199,000 --> 0:16:33,000
when we find new ways to rely on and understand and trust each other.

327
0:16:34.207,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And we need this now more than ever.

328
0:16:38.232,000 --> 0:16:41,000
If online digital spaces are going to be our new home,

329
0:16:42.049,000 --> 0:16:45,000
let's make them a comfortable, beautiful place to live,

330
0:16:45.692,000 --> 0:16:47,000
a place we all feel not just included

331
0:16:48.018,000 --> 0:16:49,000
but actually some ownership of.

332
0:16:50.669,000 --> 0:16:51,000
A place we get to know each other.

333
0:16:53.29,000 --> 0:16:56,000
A place you'd actually want not just to visit

334
0:16:56.597,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but to bring your kids.

335
0:16:59.127,000 --> 0:17:,000
Thank you.

336
0:17:00.31,000 --> 0:17:04,000
(Applause)

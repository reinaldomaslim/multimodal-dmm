0:00:16.43,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax.

3
0:00:21.117,000 --> 0:00:25,000
My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.

4
0:00:25.665,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean,

5
0:00:28.655,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because it ain't about being heard, just being seen.

6
0:00:32.569,000 --> 0:00:34,000
My leather Adidas baseball cap matches

7
0:00:34.706,000 --> 0:00:37,000
my fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter)

8
0:00:38.325,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Ain't nobody who looks as good as me,

9
0:00:40.874,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but this costs money, it sure ain't free,

10
0:00:43.25,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I gots no job, no money at all,

11
0:00:45.103,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but it's easy to steal all this from the mall.

12
0:00:47.475,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Parents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should.

13
0:00:50.312,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Got to do what I can to make sure I look good,

14
0:00:53.003,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,

15
0:00:55.994,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.

16
0:01:00.983,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide,

17
0:01:03.867,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I really must get some new gear soon

18
0:01:05.798,000 --> 0:01:06,000
or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.

19
0:01:07.769,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.

20
0:01:11.674,000 --> 0:01:13,000
My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear.

21
0:01:14.197,000 --> 0:01:16,000
School's almost over. Summer is near.

22
0:01:17.05,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I'm sportin' torn Jordans.

23
0:01:19.543,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I need something new. Only one thing left to do.

24
0:01:24.843,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Cut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,

25
0:01:28.603,000 --> 0:01:3,000
check out my victims hangin' around.

26
0:01:30.986,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey.

27
0:01:33.026,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Got to get some new gear. There's no other way.

28
0:01:35.212,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.

29
0:01:37.57,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is serious business. This ain't no fun.

30
0:01:40.026,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And I can't have my posse laughin' at me.

31
0:01:42.594,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see.

32
0:01:46.349,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Come out of the station, West 4th near the park,

33
0:01:48.934,000 --> 0:01:5,000
brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,

34
0:01:51.171,000 --> 0:01:52,000
'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?'

35
0:01:52.633,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.'

36
0:01:57.027,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.

37
0:01:59.795,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.

38
0:02:02.475,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.

39
0:02:04.909,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Had my pistol and knew just what to do.

40
0:02:06.629,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Waited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.

41
0:02:09.816,000 --> 0:02:11,000
He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,

42
0:02:12.419,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!'

43
0:02:15.165,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the punk tried to run.

44
0:02:17.435,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Took off fast, didn't get far. I fired,'Pow!'

45
0:02:20.197,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Fool fell between two parked cars.

46
0:02:22.115,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.

47
0:02:25.234,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.

48
0:02:29.019,000 --> 0:02:31,000
While laying there dying, all he could say

49
0:02:31.132,000 --> 0:02:36,000
was, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away."

50
0:02:36.195,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive.

51
0:02:38.924,000 --> 0:02:41,000
As I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.

52
0:02:42.538,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Very next day, I bopped into school

53
0:02:45.436,000 --> 0:02:48,000
with my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.

54
0:02:48.842,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care,

55
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because now I needs a new jacket to wear."

56
0:02:55.499,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Thank you. (Applause)

57
0:03:04.308,000 --> 0:03:08,000
For the last 15 years that I have been performing,

58
0:03:09.239,000 --> 0:03:13,000
all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.

59
0:03:13.969,000 --> 0:03:15,000
See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.

60
0:03:16.425,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition,

61
0:03:19.025,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and while those things hold weight,

62
0:03:21.497,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.

63
0:03:25.185,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The hunger and thirst was, and still remains:

64
0:03:29.073,000 --> 0:03:31,000
How do I get people who hate poetry

65
0:03:32.001,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to love me?

66
0:03:34.889,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Because I'm an extension of my work,

67
0:03:37.188,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and if they love me, then they will love my work,

68
0:03:39.092,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and if they love my work, then they will love poetry,

69
0:03:42.359,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,

70
0:03:45.505,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which is to transcend it to the world.

71
0:03:48.612,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And in 1996, I found the answer in principles

72
0:03:53.467,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,

73
0:03:58.118,000 --> 0:04:02,000
who wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."

74
0:04:02.977,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,

75
0:04:07.022,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I read him one of my pieces,

76
0:04:09.364,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and you know what he told me?

77
0:04:11.61,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Yo' wack.

78
0:04:13.567,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You know what the problem is with you, homie?

79
0:04:16.601,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You don't read other people's poetry,

80
0:04:19.041,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures

81
0:04:22.171,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to tonal consideration." (Laughter)

82
0:04:27.896,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now he kept on rambling

83
0:04:31.093,000 --> 0:04:35,000
about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights.

84
0:04:35.898,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now I could have quit. I should have quit.

85
0:04:38.75,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.

86
0:04:42.23,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I didn't know you actually have to have creative control.

87
0:04:45.615,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.

88
0:04:49.598,000 --> 0:04:52,000
When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.

89
0:04:53.015,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning

90
0:04:56.395,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to ask him who's the best poet.

91
0:04:58.871,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea

92
0:05:03.111,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because he told me it was brain food.

93
0:05:05.639,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Then one day I told him,

94
0:05:08.495,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?" (Laughter)

95
0:05:15.831,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis

96
0:05:19.951,000 --> 0:05:21,000
on a poet named Etheridge Knight

97
0:05:22.879,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and the oral nature of poetry,

98
0:05:25.296,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and from that point,

99
0:05:26.835,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Reggie stopped becoming the best to me,

100
0:05:29.323,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because what Etheridge Knight taught me

101
0:05:32.351,000 --> 0:05:35,000
was that I could make my words sound like music,

102
0:05:36.257,000 --> 0:05:38,000
even my small ones, the monosyllables,

103
0:05:39.167,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the ifs, ands, buts, whats,

104
0:05:41.267,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,

105
0:05:45.789,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.

106
0:05:48.959,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I wanted to know which poet he read,

107
0:05:51.191,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"],

108
0:05:55.287,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage

109
0:05:59.927,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a poet could ever be:

110
0:06:02.511,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Broadway, baby.

111
0:06:05.103,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away

112
0:06:08.447,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and attack the poetry with my body.

113
0:06:12.283,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.

114
0:06:14.991,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The biggest lesson I learned was many years later

115
0:06:19.365,000 --> 0:06:23,000
when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent

116
0:06:24.183,000 --> 0:06:26,000
who looked at me up and down

117
0:06:26.634,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and said I don't look like I have any experience

118
0:06:29.631,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to be working in this business.

119
0:06:31.989,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I said to him, "Listen, punk fool,

120
0:06:36.058,000 --> 0:06:39,000
you're a failed actor who became an agent,

121
0:06:39.168,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and you know why you failed as an actor?

122
0:06:40.732,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Because people like me took your job.

123
0:06:43.942,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex

124
0:06:46.71,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point

125
0:06:50.101,000 --> 0:06:54,000
who were in my way on my way to master the art of space,

126
0:06:54.137,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child

127
0:06:56.452,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you can fit in there only so I can push them

128
0:06:58.63,000 --> 0:07:,000
to the back of the wall with my experience.

129
0:07:01.421,000 --> 0:07:03,000
People have bought tickets to my experience

130
0:07:03.5,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know

131
0:07:06.205,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that the revolution is near, so stock up.

132
0:07:08.385,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'm so experienced that when you went

133
0:07:10.765,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,

134
0:07:13.408,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.

135
0:07:15.973,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I can master shock of "The Crying Game" with the awe

136
0:07:18.773,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know

137
0:07:22.709,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that it was his father who gave it to my mother,

138
0:07:25.702,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and that's a double entendre.

139
0:07:27.554,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School

140
0:07:30.797,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child

141
0:07:33.168,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught

142
0:07:35.492,000 --> 0:07:38,000
teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans

143
0:07:39.168,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.

144
0:07:42.512,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,

145
0:07:45.566,000 --> 0:07:47,000
"Something's always wrong when nothing's always right."

146
0:07:47.864,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Method acting is nothing but a mixture

147
0:07:50.528,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,

148
0:07:53.464,000 --> 0:07:56,000
like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.

149
0:07:56.552,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Dude, you go to Riker's Island Academy.

150
0:07:58.648,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I could make David Mamet

151
0:08:00.115,000 --> 0:08:02,000
psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,

152
0:08:02.556,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee

153
0:08:06.155,000 --> 0:08:09,000
kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.

154
0:08:09.462,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?

155
0:08:12.451,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon

156
0:08:15.195,000 --> 0:08:17,000
kung fu secret.

157
0:08:17.659,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Boards don't hit back.

158
0:08:19.496,000 --> 0:08:21,000
You think black entertainers have it hard finding work

159
0:08:21.734,000 --> 0:08:23,000
in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto,

160
0:08:24.097,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.

161
0:08:27.163,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto,

162
0:08:30.059,000 --> 0:08:34,000
buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,

163
0:08:34.203,000 --> 0:08:36,000
so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack

164
0:08:36.618,000 --> 0:08:38,000
go-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,

165
0:08:39.283,000 --> 0:08:42,000
whatever slander you send my way,

166
0:08:42.987,000 --> 0:08:44,000
your mother.

167
0:08:45.107,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Thank you. (Applause)

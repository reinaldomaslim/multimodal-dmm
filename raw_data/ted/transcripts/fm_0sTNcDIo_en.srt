1
0:00:12.877,000 --> 0:00:15,000
As a scientist, and also as a human being,

2
0:00:16.12,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've been trying to make myself

3
0:00:18.124,000 --> 0:00:21,000
susceptible to wonder.

4
0:00:21.499,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I think Jason Webley last night called it

5
0:00:24.368,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"conspiring to be part of the magic."

6
0:00:28.395,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist

7
0:00:31.216,000 --> 0:00:33,000
lets me dive deeply into the lives

8
0:00:33.86,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of some truly wondrous creatures

9
0:00:36.378,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that share our planet:

10
0:00:38.757,000 --> 0:00:39,000
fireflies.

11
0:00:40.452,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now, for many of you, I know that fireflies

12
0:00:42.735,000 --> 0:00:44,000
might conjure up some really great memories:

13
0:00:45.478,000 --> 0:00:48,000
childhood, summertime,

14
0:00:48.532,000 --> 0:00:49,000
even other TED Talks.

15
0:00:50.302,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Maybe something like this.

16
0:00:57.36,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My seduction into the world of fireflies

17
0:00:59.815,000 --> 0:01:02,000
began when I was back in graduate school.

18
0:01:03.664,000 --> 0:01:05,000
One evening, I was sitting out in my backyard

19
0:01:06.488,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in North Carolina,

20
0:01:08.426,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and suddenly, these silent sparks

21
0:01:13.725,000 --> 0:01:14,000
rose up all around me,

22
0:01:15.579,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and I began to wonder:

23
0:01:16.961,000 --> 0:01:18,000
How do these creatures make light,

24
0:01:19.651,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and what's with all this flashing?

25
0:01:21.341,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Are they talking to one another?

26
0:01:23.18,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And what happens after the lights go out?

27
0:01:26.371,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I've been lucky enough to answer

28
0:01:27.662,000 --> 0:01:28,000
some of these questions

29
0:01:29.03,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as I've explored this nocturnal world.

30
0:01:33.121,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now if you've ever seen

31
0:01:35.46,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or even heard about fireflies,

32
0:01:37.561,000 --> 0:01:39,000
then you'll know how magically they can transform

33
0:01:40.207,000 --> 0:01:42,000
our everyday landscape into something

34
0:01:42.598,000 --> 0:01:43,000
ethereal and otherworldly,

35
0:01:44.501,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and this happens around the globe,

36
0:01:46.442,000 --> 0:01:48,000
like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains

37
0:01:48.532,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light

38
0:01:52.618,000 --> 0:01:56,000
by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,

39
0:01:56.978,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or a roadside river that I visited in Japan

40
0:01:59.998,000 --> 0:02:03,000
as it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes

41
0:02:04.104,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of these Genji fireflies,

42
0:02:06.735,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or in Malaysia, the mangrove trees

43
0:02:09.297,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that I watched blossom nightly

44
0:02:11.625,000 --> 0:02:12,000
not with flowers

45
0:02:13.055,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but with the lights of a thousand — (Bleep! Bleep!) — fireflies,

46
0:02:15.923,000 --> 0:02:16,000
all blinking together

47
0:02:17.253,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in stunning synchrony.

48
0:02:20.411,000 --> 0:02:22,000
These luminous landscapes

49
0:02:22.507,000 --> 0:02:24,000
still fill me with wonder,

50
0:02:24.899,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and they keep me connected to the magic

51
0:02:27.419,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of the natural world.

52
0:02:29.827,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I find it amazing that they're created

53
0:02:31.443,000 --> 0:02:34,000
by these tiny insects.

54
0:02:34.731,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In person, fireflies are charming.

55
0:02:37.622,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They're charismatic.

56
0:02:39.435,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They've been celebrated in art

57
0:02:41.119,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and in poetry for centuries.

58
0:02:43.594,000 --> 0:02:44,000
As I've traveled around the world,

59
0:02:44.992,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I've met many thoughtful people

60
0:02:47.01,000 --> 0:02:49,000
who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth

61
0:02:49.839,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for humans to enjoy.

62
0:02:51.99,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Other creatures can enjoy them too.

63
0:02:54.386,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous

64
0:02:58.715,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because they so beautifully illuminate

65
0:03:02.72,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the creative improvisation of evolution.

66
0:03:06.951,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They've been shaped by two powerful

67
0:03:08.761,000 --> 0:03:09,000
evolutionary forces:

68
0:03:10.292,000 --> 0:03:13,000
natural selection, the struggle for survival,

69
0:03:13.952,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and sexual selection,

70
0:03:16.101,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the struggle for reproductive opportunity.

71
0:03:20.162,000 --> 0:03:22,000
As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years

72
0:03:22.513,000 --> 0:03:24,000
have been quite an exciting ride.

73
0:03:24.999,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Together with my students at Tufts University

74
0:03:27.496,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and other colleagues,

75
0:03:28.512,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:

76
0:03:32.119,000 --> 0:03:34,000
their courtship and sex lives,

77
0:03:34.128,000 --> 0:03:36,000
their treachery and murder.

78
0:03:37.022,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So today I'd like to share with you

79
0:03:38.839,000 --> 0:03:4,000
just a couple of tales that we've brought back

80
0:03:41.31,000 --> 0:03:43,000
from our collective adventures

81
0:03:43.788,000 --> 0:03:46,000
into this hidden world.

82
0:03:47.498,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Fireflies belong to a very beautiful

83
0:03:50.66,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and diverse group of insects, the beetles.

84
0:03:54.898,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,

85
0:03:59.511,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and these have evolved remarkably diverse

86
0:04:01.671,000 --> 0:04:02,000
courtship signals,

87
0:04:03.026,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that is, different ways to find and attract mates.

88
0:04:06.66,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Around 150 million years ago,

89
0:04:08.916,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the very first fireflies probably looked like this.

90
0:04:12.045,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They flew during the daytime

91
0:04:13.402,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and they didn't light up.

92
0:04:15.665,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Instead, males used their fantastic antennae

93
0:04:18.838,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to sniff out perfumes given off by their females.

94
0:04:22.949,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.

95
0:04:26.555,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They are attractively plump and wingless,

96
0:04:30.897,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so every night, they climb up onto perches

97
0:04:32.821,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and they glow brightly for hours

98
0:04:34.789,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to attract their flying but unlit males.

99
0:04:39.98,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In still other fireflies, both sexes

100
0:04:41.83,000 --> 0:04:44,000
use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.

101
0:04:45.217,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Here in North America,

102
0:04:46.688,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we have more than 100 different kinds of firefly

103
0:04:49.829,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that have the remarkable ability to shine energy

104
0:04:53.406,000 --> 0:04:55,000
out from their bodies

105
0:04:55.644,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in the form of light.

106
0:04:57.97,000 --> 0:04:59,000
How do they do that?

107
0:05:00.42,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It seems totally magical,

108
0:05:02.453,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but these bioluminescent signals

109
0:05:03.736,000 --> 0:05:06,000
arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions

110
0:05:07.04,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that happen inside the firefly lantern.

111
0:05:09.934,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The main star is an enzyme called luciferase,

112
0:05:13.241,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which in the course of evolution

113
0:05:14.996,000 --> 0:05:17,000
has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms

114
0:05:18.19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
around an even smaller molecule called luciferin,

115
0:05:21.78,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in the process getting it so excited

116
0:05:24.457,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that it actually gives off light.

117
0:05:27.831,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Incredible.

118
0:05:29.506,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But how could these bright lights

119
0:05:31.334,000 --> 0:05:35,000
have benefited some proto-firefly?

120
0:05:35.479,000 --> 0:05:37,000
To answer this question, we need to flip back

121
0:05:37.589,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in the family album to some baby pictures.

122
0:05:41.953,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow.

123
0:05:45.665,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They spend the vast majority of their lifetime,

124
0:05:47.966,000 --> 0:05:48,000
up to two years,

125
0:05:49.709,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in this larval form.

126
0:05:52.57,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Their main goal here, like my teenagers,

127
0:05:54.823,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is to eat and grow.

128
0:05:57.978,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And firefly light first originated

129
0:06:00.43,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in these juveniles.

130
0:06:02.477,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Every single firefly larva can light up,

131
0:06:04.907,000 --> 0:06:06,000
even when their adults can't.

132
0:06:07.786,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But what's the point

133
0:06:08.878,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to being so conspicuous?

134
0:06:12.515,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Well, we know that these juveniles

135
0:06:14.133,000 --> 0:06:15,000
make nasty-tasting chemicals

136
0:06:16.113,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that help them survive their extended childhood,

137
0:06:19.731,000 --> 0:06:22,000
so we think these lights first evolved as a warning,

138
0:06:23.561,000 --> 0:06:27,000
a neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!"

139
0:06:28.12,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to any would-be predators.

140
0:06:31.014,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It took many millions of years

141
0:06:33.964,000 --> 0:06:34,000
before these bright lights

142
0:06:35.363,000 --> 0:06:37,000
evolved into a smart communication tool

143
0:06:37.901,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that could be used not just to ward off potential predators

144
0:06:40.916,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but to bring in potential mates.

145
0:06:43.886,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Driven now by sexual selection,

146
0:06:46.687,000 --> 0:06:47,000
some adult fireflies

147
0:06:48.577,000 --> 0:06:5,000
like this proud male

148
0:06:50.973,000 --> 0:06:53,000
evolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern

149
0:06:54.765,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that would let them take courtship

150
0:06:56.609,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to a whole new level.

151
0:07:00.389,000 --> 0:07:02,000
These adults only live a few weeks,

152
0:07:02.841,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and now they're single-mindedly focused on sex,

153
0:07:07.757,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that is, on propelling their genes

154
0:07:09.727,000 --> 0:07:11,000
into the next firefly generation.

155
0:07:12.503,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So we can follow this male out into the field

156
0:07:15.767,000 --> 0:07:18,000
as he joins hundreds of other males

157
0:07:18.791,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who are all showing off their new courtship signals.

158
0:07:23.169,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's amazing to think that the luminous displays

159
0:07:26.161,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we admire

160
0:07:27.845,000 --> 0:07:29,000
here and in fact everywhere around the world

161
0:07:30.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
are actually the silent love songs

162
0:07:34.476,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of male fireflies.

163
0:07:37.453,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They're flying and flashing their hearts out.

164
0:07:41.54,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I still find it very romantic.

165
0:07:45.08,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But meanwhile, where are all the females?

166
0:07:48.497,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Well, they're lounging down below

167
0:07:50.092,000 --> 0:07:51,000
surveying their options.

168
0:07:51.83,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They have plenty of males to choose from,

169
0:07:53.758,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and these females turn out to be very picky.

170
0:07:57.85,000 --> 0:07:59,000
When a female sees a flash

171
0:08:00.215,000 --> 0:08:02,000
from an especially attractive male,

172
0:08:02.862,000 --> 0:08:04,000
she'll aim her lantern in his direction,

173
0:08:05.843,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and give him a flash back.

174
0:08:08.37,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's her "come hither" sign.

175
0:08:11.771,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So he flies closer and he flashes again.

176
0:08:15.366,000 --> 0:08:16,000
If she still likes him,

177
0:08:16.492,000 --> 0:08:19,000
they'll strike up a conversation.

178
0:08:19.703,000 --> 0:08:21,000
These creatures speak their love

179
0:08:22.395,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in the language of light.

180
0:08:25.298,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So what exactly do these females consider sexy?

181
0:08:30.195,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls

182
0:08:32.94,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to find out.

183
0:08:34.702,000 --> 0:08:37,000
When we tested females using blinking LED lights,

184
0:08:37.91,000 --> 0:08:39,000
we discovered they prefer males

185
0:08:40.225,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who give longer-lasting flashes.

186
0:08:44.28,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

187
0:08:47.891,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I know you're wondering,

188
0:08:49.07,000 --> 0:08:52,000
what gives these males their sex appeal?

189
0:08:52.273,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Now we get to see what happens

190
0:08:53.648,000 --> 0:08:55,000
when the lights go out.

191
0:08:56.209,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The first thing we discovered

192
0:08:57.678,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is that once a male and female hook up like this,

193
0:09:00.447,000 --> 0:09:02,000
they stay together all night long,

194
0:09:03.192,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and when we looked inside

195
0:09:04.419,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to see what might be happening,

196
0:09:05.853,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we discovered a surprising new twist

197
0:09:08.141,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to firefly sex.

198
0:09:10.105,000 --> 0:09:11,000
While they're mating,

199
0:09:11.275,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the male is busy giving the female

200
0:09:13.079,000 --> 0:09:14,000
not just his sperm

201
0:09:15.05,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but also a nutrient-filled package

202
0:09:19.156,000 --> 0:09:23,000
called a nuptial gift.

203
0:09:23.777,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We can zoom in to look more closely

204
0:09:25.711,000 --> 0:09:26,000
inside this mating pair.

205
0:09:27.274,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We can actually see the gift —

206
0:09:28.967,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it's shown here in red —

207
0:09:30.379,000 --> 0:09:33,000
as it's being passed from the male to the female.

208
0:09:34.329,000 --> 0:09:37,000
What makes this gift so valuable

209
0:09:37.464,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is that it's packed with protein

210
0:09:39.32,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that the female will use to provision her eggs.

211
0:09:43.781,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So females are keeping their eyes on this prize

212
0:09:47.651,000 --> 0:09:49,000
as they size up potential mates.

213
0:09:49.923,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We discovered that females use male flash signals

214
0:09:52.792,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to try to predict which males

215
0:09:54.839,000 --> 0:09:56,000
have the biggest gifts to offer,

216
0:09:56.909,000 --> 0:10:,000
because this bling helps the female lay more eggs

217
0:10:01.746,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and ultimately launch more of her own offspring

218
0:10:04.997,000 --> 0:10:06,000
into the next generation.

219
0:10:09.687,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So it's not all sweetness and light.

220
0:10:11.695,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Firefly romance is risky.

221
0:10:14.466,000 --> 0:10:16,000
For the most part, these adult fireflies

222
0:10:16.943,000 --> 0:10:18,000
don't get eaten because like their juveniles

223
0:10:19.627,000 --> 0:10:21,000
they can manufacture toxins that are repellent

224
0:10:22.563,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to birds and other insectivores,

225
0:10:25.62,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but somewhere along the line,

226
0:10:28.12,000 --> 0:10:3,000
one particular group of fireflies

227
0:10:30.44,000 --> 0:10:33,000
somehow lost the metabolic machinery

228
0:10:33.567,000 --> 0:10:36,000
needed to make their own protective toxins.

229
0:10:37.37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This evolutionary flaw,

230
0:10:39.65,000 --> 0:10:41,000
which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,

231
0:10:42.356,000 --> 0:10:43,000
has driven these fireflies

232
0:10:44.299,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to take their bright lights out into the night

233
0:10:47.697,000 --> 0:10:5,000
with treacherous intent.

234
0:10:51.38,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Dubbed "femme fatales"

235
0:10:53.01,000 --> 0:10:55,000
by Jim Lloyd, another colleague,

236
0:10:55.495,000 --> 0:10:57,000
these females have figured out how to target

237
0:10:58.413,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the males of other firefly species.

238
0:11:02.224,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So the hunt begins with the predator —

239
0:11:04.124,000 --> 0:11:06,000
she's shown here in the lower left —

240
0:11:06.171,000 --> 0:11:08,000
where she's sitting quietly

241
0:11:08.218,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation

242
0:11:11.35,000 --> 0:11:12,000
of her intended prey,

243
0:11:12.79,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and here's how it might go.

244
0:11:14.803,000 --> 0:11:17,000
First the prey male flashes, "Do you love me?"

245
0:11:18.673,000 --> 0:11:22,000
His own female responds, "Maybe."

246
0:11:22.779,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So then he flashes again.

247
0:11:25.605,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But this time, the predator sneaks in a reply

248
0:11:29.158,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said.

249
0:11:34.834,000 --> 0:11:38,000
She's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.

250
0:11:39.3,000 --> 0:11:42,000
If she's good, she can lure this male close enough

251
0:11:43.181,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to reach out and grab him,

252
0:11:46.172,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and he's not just a light snack.

253
0:11:48.613,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Over the next hour, she slowly

254
0:11:51.448,000 --> 0:11:53,000
exsanguinates this male

255
0:11:54.307,000 --> 0:11:57,000
leaving behind just some gory remains.

256
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
Unable to make their own toxins,

257
0:12:00.751,000 --> 0:12:02,000
these females resort to drinking the blood

258
0:12:03.088,000 --> 0:12:07,000
of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.

259
0:12:07.783,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So a firefly vampire,

260
0:12:13.628,000 --> 0:12:17,000
brought to you by natural selection.

261
0:12:17.98,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We still have a lot to learn about fireflies,

262
0:12:21.161,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but it looks like many stories will remain untold,

263
0:12:24.544,000 --> 0:12:26,000
because around the world, firefly populations

264
0:12:26.973,000 --> 0:12:28,000
are blinking out.

265
0:12:29.628,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The main culprit: habitat loss.

266
0:12:32.216,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Pretty much everywhere, the fields and forests,

267
0:12:34.702,000 --> 0:12:36,000
the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive,

268
0:12:37.649,000 --> 0:12:4,000
are giving way to development and to sprawl.

269
0:12:41.281,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Here's another problem: we've conquered darkness,

270
0:12:45.47,000 --> 0:12:48,000
but in the process, we spill so much extra light out into the night

271
0:12:48.964,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that it disrupts the lives of other creatures,

272
0:12:52.09,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution

273
0:12:55.534,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because it obscures the signals

274
0:12:58.155,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that they use to find their mates.

275
0:13:02.614,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Do we really need fireflies?

276
0:13:04.592,000 --> 0:13:06,000
After all, they're just one tiny bit

277
0:13:06.631,000 --> 0:13:08,000
of Earth's biodiversity.

278
0:13:08.9,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Yet every time a species is lost,

279
0:13:12.208,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it's like extinguishing a room full of candles

280
0:13:14.897,000 --> 0:13:16,000
one by one.

281
0:13:17.825,000 --> 0:13:17,000
You might not notice

282
0:13:18.771,000 --> 0:13:21,000
when the first few flames flicker out,

283
0:13:22.061,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.

284
0:13:31.591,000 --> 0:13:35,000
As we work together to craft a planetary future,

285
0:13:36.411,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I hope we can find a way

286
0:13:38.875,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to keep these bright lights shining.

287
0:13:42.328,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Thank you.

288
0:13:44.364,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm not at all a cook.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
But I do want to talk to you about something

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that I think is dear to all of us.

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And that is bread -- something which is as simple

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as our basic, most fundamental human staple.

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I think few of us spend the day

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
without eating bread in some form.

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
bread is standard.

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
As I will show to you, it is actually

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the mainstay of modern life.

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I'm going to bake bread for you.

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In the meantime I'm also talking to you,

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me.

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
First of all, a little bit of audience participation.

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I have two loaves of bread here.

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
One is a supermarket standard:

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
white bread, pre-packaged,

21
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which I'm told is called a Wonderbread.

22
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I didn't know this word until I arrived.

24
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And this is more or less,

25
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a whole-meal, handmade,

26
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
small-bakery loaf of bread.

27
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Here we go. I want to see a show of hands.

28
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Who prefers the whole-meal bread?

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I have two tentative male hands.

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Okay, now the question is really,

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
why is this so?

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I think it is because

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we feel that this kind of bread

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
really is about authenticity.

38
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's about a traditional way of living.

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
A way that is perhaps more real, more honest.

40
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is an image from Tuscany, where we feel

41
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
agriculture is still about beauty.

42
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And life is really, too.

43
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And this is about good taste, good traditions.

44
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Why do we have this image?

45
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Why do we feel that this is more true than this?

46
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Well I think it has a lot to do with our history.

47
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved,

48
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists

49
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or they were closely related to food production.

50
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And we have this mythical image

51
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of how life was in rural areas in the past.

52
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.

53
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It was a mythical past.

54
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Of course, the reality is quite different.

55
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
These poor farmers

56
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
working the land by hand or with their animals,

57
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
had yield levels that are comparable

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to the poorest farmers today in West Africa.

59
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But we have, somehow,

60
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades,

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
started to cultivate an image of

62
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a mythical, rural agricultural past.

63
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It was only 200 years ago

64
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.

65
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here,

66
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it's very important to understand

67
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
what that revolution did to us.

68
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.

69
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And it actually drove up our yields.

70
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand,

71
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
can now be done automatically.

72
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
All that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.

73
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Of course we also, particularly in the last decade,

74
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
managed to envelop the world

75
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in a dense chain of supermarkets,

76
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in a chain of global trade.

77
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And it means that you now eat products,

78
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which can come from all around the world.

79
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
That is the reality of our modern life.

80
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.

81
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Excuse my hands but this is how it is.

82
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But actually the real relevant bread,

83
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
historically, is this white Wonder loaf.

84
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And don't despise the white bread

85
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because it really, I think,

86
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
symbolizes the fact that bread and food

87
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
have become plentiful and affordable to all.

88
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And that is a feat that we

89
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
are not really conscious of that much.

90
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But it has changed the world.

91
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways

92
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and has a lot of problems

93
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
has changed the world.

94
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So what is happening?

95
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.

96
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
With the advent of the Industrial Revolution

97
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
with modernization of agriculture

98
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in the last few decades, since the 1960s,

99
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
food availability, per head, in this world,

100
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
has increased by 25 percent.

101
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And the world population in the meantime has doubled.

102
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
That means that we have now more food available

103
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
than ever before in human history.

104
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And that is the result, directly,

105
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of being so successful

106
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
at increasing the scale and volume of our production.

107
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And this is true, as you can see, for all countries,

108
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
including the so-called developing countries.

109
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
What happened to our bread in the meantime?

110
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
As food became plentiful here,

111
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it also meant that we were able to decrease

112
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the number of people working in agriculture

113
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to something like, on average, in the high income countries,

114
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
five percent or less of the population.

115
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.

116
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And it frees us all up to do other things --

117
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.

118
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
That is, historically, a really unique situation.

119
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Never before has the responsibility to feed the world

120
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
been in the hands of so few people.

121
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And never before have so many people

122
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
been oblivious of that fact.

123
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.

124
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.

125
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We added in more sugar.

126
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We add in raisins and oil and milk

127
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and all kinds of things to make bread,

128
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
from a simple food into kind of a support for calories.

129
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And today, bread now is associated with obesity,

130
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which is very strange.

131
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It is the basic, most fundamental food

132
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that we've had in the last ten thousand years.

133
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticated

134
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the most important crop we still grow today.

135
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But this is now this strange concoction

136
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of high calories.

137
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And that's not only true in this country,

138
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it is true all over the world.

139
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Bread has migrated to tropical countries,

140
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers

141
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and where the commuters

142
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
find bread much more handy to use

143
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
than rice or cassava.

144
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So bread has become from a main staple,

145
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
a source of calories

146
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
associated with obesity

147
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and also a source of modernity,

148
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of modern life.

149
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.

150
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So this is the story of bread as we know it now.

151
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But of course the price of mass production

152
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
has been that we moved large-scale.

153
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes,

154
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
destruction of biodiversity --

155
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
still a lonely emu here

156
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.

157
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The costs have been tremendous --

158
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
water pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats.

159
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about.

160
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And this is where I have to query all of you.

161
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?

162
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
How many of you actually can make a bread

163
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in this way, without starting with a bread machine

164
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
or just some kind of packaged flavor?

165
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?

166
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We have become very removed

167
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
from what our bread really is,

168
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which, again, evolutionarily speaking,

169
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is very strange.

170
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
In fact not many of you know that

171
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
our bread, of course, was not a European invention.

172
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It was invented by farmers in Iraq

173
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and Syria in particular.

174
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The tiny spike on the left to the center

175
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is actually the forefather of wheat.

176
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This is where it all comes from,

177
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago,

178
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
put us on the road of bread.

179
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Now it is not surprising

180
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that with this massification and large-scale production,

181
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
there is a counter-movement that emerged --

182
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
very much also here in California.

183
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.

184
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Let's go back to traditional farming.

185
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Let's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets,

186
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
small bakeries and all that." Wonderful.

187
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Don't we all agree? I certainly agree.

188
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I would love to go back to Tuscany

189
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to this kind of traditional setting,

190
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
gastronomy, good food.

191
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But this is a fallacy.

192
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And the fallacy comes from idealizing

193
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
a past that we have forgotten about.

194
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
If we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming

195
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
we are going, actually, to relegate

196
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
these poor farmers and their husbands --

197
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
among whom I have lived for many years,

198
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
working without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production --

199
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
we relegate them to poverty.

200
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What they want are implements

201
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to increase their production:

202
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
something to fertilize the soil,

203
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.

204
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We cannot just think that small-scale

205
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
is the solution to the world food problem.

206
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it,

207
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
if you want to afford it.

208
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
In fact we do not want this poor woman

209
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to work the land like this.

210
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
If we say just small-scale production,

211
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
as is the tendency here,

212
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling

213
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
cannot even eat oranges anymore

214
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.

215
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So local food production is out.

216
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But also we do not want

217
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to relegate to poverty in the rural areas.

218
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And we do not want to relegate

219
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the urban poor to starvation.

220
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So we must find other solutions.

221
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
One of our problems is that world food production

222
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
needs to increase very rapidly --

223
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
doubling by about 2030.

224
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The main driver of that is actually meat.

225
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular

226
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is what drives the prices of cereals.

227
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That need for animal protein is going to continue.

228
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day,

229
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but this is our driving force.

230
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So what can we do?

231
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Can we find a solution to produce more?

232
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Yes. But we need mechanization.

233
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And I'm making a real plea here.

234
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer

235
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice,

236
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.

237
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
You cannot ask people to work under these conditions.

238
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We need clever low-key mechanization

239
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had.

240
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So what can we do?

241
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We must feed three billion people in cities.

242
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We will not do that through small farmers' markets

243
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.

244
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They have low incomes. And they benefit

245
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
from cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.

246
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
That's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years.

247
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But yes there are some solutions.

248
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And let me just do one simple conceptual thing:

249
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
if I plot science as a proxy

250
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
for control of the production process and scale.

251
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
What you see is that we've started

252
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture,

253
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
which was sort of small-scale and low-control.

254
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control.

255
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there

256
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but go to a kind of regional scale --

257
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
not just in terms of the scale of the fields,

258
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but in terms of the entire food network.

259
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
That's where we should move.

260
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals,

261
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that we have entirely closed ecosystems --

262
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.

263
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So we need to think differently about agriculture science.

264
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers

265
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
among you here --

266
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
has this name of being bad,

267
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of being about pollution, about large-scale,

268
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
about the destruction of the environment.

269
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
That is not necessary.

270
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We need more science and not less. And we need good science.

271
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So what kind of science can we have?

272
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Well first of all I think

273
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
we can do much better on the existing technologies.

274
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Use biotechnology where useful,

275
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
particularly in pest and disease resistance.

276
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
There are also robots, for example,

277
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
who can recognize weeds

278
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
with a resolution of half an inch.

279
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We have much cleverer irrigation.

280
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.

281
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And we need to think very dispassionately

282
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
about the comparative advantages

283
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
of small-scale and large-scale.

284
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
We need to think that land is multi-functional.

285
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It has different functions.

286
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
There are different ways in which we must use it --

287
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.

288
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And we also need to re-examine livestock.

289
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Go regional and go to urban food systems.

290
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.

291
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
I want to have horticulture

292
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and greenhouses on top of residential areas.

293
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses

294
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and from the fermentation of crops

295
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to heat our residential areas.

296
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
There are all kinds of ways we can do it.

297
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We cannot solve the world food problem

298
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
by using biological agriculture.

299
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But we can do a lot more.

300
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And the main thing that I would really ask all of you

301
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
as you go back to your countries, or as you stay here:

302
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
ask your government for an integrated food policy.

303
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Food is as important as energy,

304
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
as security, as the environment.

305
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Everything is linked together.

306
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country

307
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
like the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands,

308
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we have combined these functions.

309
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So this is not science fiction. We can combine things

310
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
even in a social sense of making

311
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
the rural areas more accessible to people --

312
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to house, for example, the chronically sick.

313
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
There is all kinds of things we can do.

314
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say,

315
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
"Let's get more bold science into agriculture."

316
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You must go back

317
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and think about your own food chain.

318
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Talk to farmers. When was the last time

319
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you went to a farm and talked to a farmer?

320
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Talk to people in restaurants.

321
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Understand where you are in the food chain,

322
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
where your food comes from.

323
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Understand that you are part

324
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
of this enormous chain of events.

325
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And that frees you up to do other things.

326
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And above all, to me, food is about respect.

327
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It's about understanding, when you eat,

328
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that there are also many people who are still in this situation,

329
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
who are still struggling for their daily food.

330
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have,

331
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
to think that doing everything by hand

332
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
is going to be the solution,

333
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is really not morally justified.

334
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We need to help to lift them out of poverty.

335
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We need to make them proud of being a farmer

336
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
because they allow us to survive.

337
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Never before, as I said,

338
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
has the responsibility for food

339
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
been in the hands of so few.

340
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And never before have we had the luxury

341
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
of taking it for granted

342
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
because it is now so cheap.

343
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And I think there is nobody else who has expressed

344
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
better, to me, the idea that food, in the end,

345
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
in our own tradition, is something holy.

346
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It's not about nutrients and calories.

347
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.

348
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi,

349
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.

350
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
He did not speak about rice, in India. He said,

351
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
"To those who have to go without two meals a day,

352
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
God can only appear as bread."

353
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And so as I'm finishing my bread here --

354
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.

355
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Let me share

356
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
with those of you here in the first row.

357
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Let me share some of the food with you.

358
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Take some of my bread.

359
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And as you eat it, and as you try it --

360
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
please come and stand up.

361
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Have some of it.

362
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I want you to think that every bite connects you

363
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
to the past and the future:

364
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
to these anonymous farmers,

365
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
that first bred the first wheat varieties;

366
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and to the farmers of today,

367
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.

368
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Every meal you eat

369
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
contains ingredients from all across the world.

370
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Everything makes us so privileged,

371
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
that we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.

372
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And that, I think,

373
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
evolutionarily-speaking is unique.

374
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
We've never had that before.

375
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
So enjoy your bread.

376
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Eat it, and feel privileged.

377
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Thank you very much.

378
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
(Applause)

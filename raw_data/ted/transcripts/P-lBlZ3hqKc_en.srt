1
0:00:12.637,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Democracy is in trouble, no question about that,

2
0:00:16.14,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and it comes in part from a deep dilemma

3
0:00:19.398,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in which it is embedded.

4
0:00:22.07,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions

5
0:00:25.817,000 --> 0:00:28,000
we face that have to do with global pandemics,

6
0:00:29.342,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a cross-border problem;

7
0:00:31.451,000 --> 0:00:34,000
with HIV, a transnational problem;

8
0:00:34.874,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with markets and immigration,

9
0:00:36.949,000 --> 0:00:38,000
something that goes beyond national borders;

10
0:00:39.503,000 --> 0:00:41,000
with terrorism, with war,

11
0:00:41.776,000 --> 0:00:43,000
all now cross-border problems.

12
0:00:44.423,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In fact, we live in a 21st-century world

13
0:00:48.178,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of interdependence,

14
0:00:50.383,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and brutal interdependent problems,

15
0:00:53.906,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy,

16
0:00:59.55,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we are faced with political institutions

17
0:01:02.738,000 --> 0:01:05,000
designed 400 years ago,

18
0:01:06.191,000 --> 0:01:1,000
autonomous, sovereign nation-states

19
0:01:10.669,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with jurisdictions and territories

20
0:01:13.231,000 --> 0:01:14,000
separate from one another,

21
0:01:14.99,000 --> 0:01:16,000
each claiming to be able to solve the problem

22
0:01:17.923,000 --> 0:01:19,000
of its own people.

23
0:01:19.996,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Twenty-first-century, transnational world

24
0:01:23.292,000 --> 0:01:24,000
of problems and challenges,

25
0:01:25.034,000 --> 0:01:28,000
17th-century world of political institutions.

26
0:01:29.01,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.

27
0:01:35.39,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And like many others, I've been thinking about

28
0:01:37.236,000 --> 0:01:4,000
what can one do about this, this asymmetry

29
0:01:40.704,000 --> 0:01:41,000
between 21st-century challenges

30
0:01:42.697,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional

31
0:01:46.752,000 --> 0:01:49,000
political institutions like nation-states.

32
0:01:50.251,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And my suggestion is

33
0:01:51.955,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that we change the subject,

34
0:01:55.576,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that we stop talking about nations,

35
0:01:59.688,000 --> 0:02:,000
about bordered states,

36
0:02:01.104,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and we start talking about cities.

37
0:02:05.071,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Because I think you will find, when we talk about cities,

38
0:02:08.429,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we are talking about the political institutions

39
0:02:12.486,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in which civilization and culture were born.

40
0:02:15.307,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We are talking about the cradle of democracy.

41
0:02:18.472,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We are talking about the venues in which

42
0:02:21.03,000 --> 0:02:24,000
those public spaces where we come together

43
0:02:24.243,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to create democracy, and at the same time

44
0:02:28.31,000 --> 0:02:32,000
protest those who would take our freedom, take place.

45
0:02:33.273,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Think of some great names:

46
0:02:35.907,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the Place de la Bastille,

47
0:02:38.6,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Zuccotti Park,

48
0:02:40.567,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Tahrir Square,

49
0:02:42.733,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul,

50
0:02:47.039,000 --> 0:02:49,000
or, yes,

51
0:02:49.399,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

52
0:02:52.191,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Applause)

53
0:02:53.897,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Those are the public spaces

54
0:02:56.823,000 --> 0:02:59,000
where we announce ourselves as citizens,

55
0:03:00.188,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as participants, as people with the right

56
0:03:03.634,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to write our own narratives.

57
0:03:07.909,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Cities are not only the oldest of institutions,

58
0:03:10.587,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they're the most enduring.

59
0:03:12.555,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If you think about it,

60
0:03:14.727,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Constantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.

61
0:03:18.696,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Alexandria, much older than Egypt.

62
0:03:21.806,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Rome, far older than Italy.

63
0:03:25.756,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Cities endure the ages.

64
0:03:29.364,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They are the places where we are born,

65
0:03:34.147,000 --> 0:03:38,000
grow up, are educated, work, marry,

66
0:03:38.483,000 --> 0:03:42,000
pray, play, get old, and in time, die.

67
0:03:43.342,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They are home.

68
0:03:45.47,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Very different than nation-states,

69
0:03:47.526,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which are abstractions.

70
0:03:48.867,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We pay taxes, we vote occasionally,

71
0:03:52.989,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we watch the men and women we choose rule

72
0:03:56.364,000 --> 0:03:59,000
rule more or less without us.

73
0:03:59.588,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Not so in those homes known as our towns

74
0:04:03.896,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and cities where we live.

75
0:04:05.695,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Moreover, today, more than half of the world's population

76
0:04:10.744,000 --> 0:04:12,000
live in cities.

77
0:04:12.751,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In the developed world, it's about 78 percent.

78
0:04:16.723,000 --> 0:04:17,000
More than three out of four people

79
0:04:18.718,000 --> 0:04:22,000
live in urban institutions, urban places,

80
0:04:22.758,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in cities today.

81
0:04:24.366,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So cities are where the action is.

82
0:04:27.142,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world,

83
0:04:30.258,000 --> 0:04:33,000
man is a political animal.

84
0:04:33.839,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I say we are an urban animal.

85
0:04:36.866,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We are an urban species, at home in our cities.

86
0:04:41.731,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So to come back to the dilemma,

87
0:04:43.883,000 --> 0:04:45,000
if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned

88
0:04:46.401,000 --> 0:04:49,000
political nation-states unable to govern the world,

89
0:04:50.185,000 --> 0:04:53,000
respond to the global challenges that we face

90
0:04:53.199,000 --> 0:04:55,000
like climate change,

91
0:04:55.359,000 --> 0:05:01,000
then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world,

92
0:05:01.401,000 --> 0:05:04,000
for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent

93
0:05:04.61,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to engage in global governance.

94
0:05:10.495,000 --> 0:05:11,000
When I say if mayors ruled the world,

95
0:05:12.326,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when I first came up with that phrase,

96
0:05:14.594,000 --> 0:05:17,000
it occurred to me that actually, they already do.

97
0:05:18.5,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There are scores of international, inter-city,

98
0:05:23.298,000 --> 0:05:27,000
cross-border institutions, networks of cities

99
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in which cities are already, quite quietly,

100
0:05:30.605,000 --> 0:05:32,000
below the horizon, working together

101
0:05:33.432,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to deal with climate change, to deal with security,

102
0:05:36.129,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to deal with immigration,

103
0:05:37.517,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to deal with all of those tough,

104
0:05:39.176,000 --> 0:05:41,000
interdependent problems that we face.

105
0:05:41.982,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They have strange names:

106
0:05:45.438,000 --> 0:05:48,000
UCLG,

107
0:05:48.808,000 --> 0:05:52,000
United Cities and Local Governments;

108
0:05:53.434,000 --> 0:05:54,000
ICLEI,

109
0:05:55.234,000 --> 0:06:,000
the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.

110
0:06:00.75,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And the list goes on:

111
0:06:01.96,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Citynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization

112
0:06:05.507,000 --> 0:06:08,000
out of Barcelona that is using the web

113
0:06:08.992,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to share best practices among countries.

114
0:06:12.069,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And then all the things we know a little better,

115
0:06:13.485,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the U.S. Conference of Mayors,

116
0:06:14.776,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the Mexican Conference of Mayors,

117
0:06:16.812,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the European Conference of Mayors.

118
0:06:20.378,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Mayors are where this is happening.

119
0:06:25.361,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And so the question is,

120
0:06:27.89,000 --> 0:06:28,000
how can we create a world

121
0:06:29.644,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in which mayors and the citizens they represent

122
0:06:33.259,000 --> 0:06:35,000
play a more prominent role?

123
0:06:35.725,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, to understand that,

124
0:06:38.675,000 --> 0:06:41,000
we need to understand why cities are special,

125
0:06:42.473,000 --> 0:06:43,000
why mayors are so different

126
0:06:44.368,000 --> 0:06:45,000
than prime ministers and presidents,

127
0:06:45.856,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister

128
0:06:50.204,000 --> 0:06:54,000
are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.

129
0:06:54.483,000 --> 0:06:56,000
To be a prime minister or a president,

130
0:06:56.891,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you have to have an ideology,

131
0:06:59.05,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you have to have a meta-narrative,

132
0:07:01.112,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you have to have a theory of how things work,

133
0:07:03.634,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you have to belong to a party.

134
0:07:05.669,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Independents, on the whole,

135
0:07:07.226,000 --> 0:07:08,000
don't get elected to office.

136
0:07:08.976,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But mayors are just the opposite.

137
0:07:11.209,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.

138
0:07:15.658,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Their job is to get things done, and if they don't,

139
0:07:17.621,000 --> 0:07:19,000
they're out of a job.

140
0:07:20.34,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said,

141
0:07:23.078,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we could never get away here in Philadelphia

142
0:07:26.66,000 --> 0:07:28,000
with the stuff that goes on in Washington,

143
0:07:28.97,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.

144
0:07:33.985,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Why? Because potholes have to get filled,

145
0:07:38.444,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because the trains have to run,

146
0:07:40.343,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because kids have to be able to get to school.

147
0:07:43.292,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And that's what we have to do,

148
0:07:44.588,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and to do that is about pragmatism

149
0:07:47.527,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in that deep, American sense,

150
0:07:49.499,000 --> 0:07:5,000
reaching outcomes.

151
0:07:51.429,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Washington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals,

152
0:07:57.538,000 --> 0:08:,000
are anything but pragmatic,

153
0:08:00.85,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but real city mayors have to be pragmatists.

154
0:08:03.769,000 --> 0:08:04,000
They have to get things done,

155
0:08:05.493,000 --> 0:08:08,000
they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside

156
0:08:08.89,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and draw their cities together.

157
0:08:11.254,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We saw this a couple of decades ago

158
0:08:13.924,000 --> 0:08:16,000
when Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem

159
0:08:16.999,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in the '80s and the '90s,

160
0:08:19.104,000 --> 0:08:22,000
was besieged one day in his office

161
0:08:22.407,000 --> 0:08:26,000
by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds,

162
0:08:27.07,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Christian prelates, rabbis, imams.

163
0:08:29.905,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They were arguing with one another

164
0:08:31.404,000 --> 0:08:33,000
about access to the holy sites.

165
0:08:33.53,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And the squabble went on and on,

166
0:08:35.309,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and Kollek listened and listened,

167
0:08:37.151,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and he finally said, "Gentlemen,

168
0:08:41.453,000 --> 0:08:43,000
spare me your sermons,

169
0:08:43.609,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and I will fix your sewers."

170
0:08:46.653,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:47.674,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That's what mayors do.

172
0:08:49.738,000 --> 0:08:52,000
They fix sewers, they get the trains running.

173
0:08:53.158,000 --> 0:08:55,000
There isn't a left or a right way of doing.

174
0:08:55.706,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.

175
0:09:00.183,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Strange term, but in some ways, he is.

176
0:09:02.058,000 --> 0:09:04,000
He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.

177
0:09:04.491,000 --> 0:09:05,000
He rides to work on a bike,

178
0:09:05.98,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.

179
0:09:08.827,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat,

180
0:09:12.067,000 --> 0:09:12,000
then he was a Republican,

181
0:09:12.885,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and finally he was an Independent, and said

182
0:09:14.722,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the party label just gets in the way.

183
0:09:17.143,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Luzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow,

184
0:09:20.258,000 --> 0:09:23,000
though he helped found a party, United Party with Putin,

185
0:09:23.718,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in fact refused to be defined by the party

186
0:09:27.014,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev,

187
0:09:30.304,000 --> 0:09:32,000
not under Gorbachev, but under Putin,

188
0:09:33.177,000 --> 0:09:37,000
who wanted a more faithful party follower.

189
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.

190
0:09:41.444,000 --> 0:09:42,000
They get things done.

191
0:09:42.817,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But the second thing about mayors

192
0:09:44.226,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is they are also what I like to call homeboys,

193
0:09:48.407,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or to include the women mayors, homies.

194
0:09:51.047,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They're from the neighborhood.

195
0:09:53.71,000 --> 0:09:54,000
They're part of the neighborhood. They're known.

196
0:09:55.517,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Ed Koch used to wander around New York City

197
0:09:57.792,000 --> 0:09:59,000
saying, "How am I doing?"

198
0:10:00.308,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Imagine David Cameron

199
0:10:01.963,000 --> 0:10:02,000
wandering around the United Kingdom

200
0:10:03.913,000 --> 0:10:05,000
asking, "How am I doing?" He wouldn't like the answer.

201
0:10:06.391,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Or Putin. Or any national leader.

202
0:10:09.109,000 --> 0:10:11,000
He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers

203
0:10:11.121,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and they knew him.

204
0:10:12.997,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Mayors are usually from the places they govern.

205
0:10:16.863,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.

206
0:10:19.667,000 --> 0:10:2,000
You can run for the Senate out of a different state,

207
0:10:21.481,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but it's hard to do that as a mayor.

208
0:10:24.407,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And as a result, mayors and city councillors

209
0:10:27.491,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and local authorities

210
0:10:29.228,000 --> 0:10:31,000
have a much higher trust level,

211
0:10:31.479,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and this is the third feature about mayors,

212
0:10:34.007,000 --> 0:10:36,000
than national governing officials.

213
0:10:36.38,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In the United States, we know the pathetic figures:

214
0:10:39.965,000 --> 0:10:43,000
18 percent of Americans approve of Congress

215
0:10:44.424,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and what they do.

216
0:10:45.926,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And even with a relatively popular president like Obama,

217
0:10:49.525,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45,

218
0:10:52.621,000 --> 0:10:53,000
sometimes 50 percent at best.

219
0:10:54.406,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.

220
0:10:57.575,000 --> 0:11:,000
But when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor,

221
0:11:01.025,000 --> 0:11:03,000
do you trust your mayor?"

222
0:11:03.201,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent,

223
0:11:08.354,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because they're from the neighborhood,

224
0:11:10.499,000 --> 0:11:12,000
because the people they work with are their neighbors,

225
0:11:13.416,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because, like Mayor Booker in Newark,

226
0:11:16.833,000 --> 0:11:19,000
a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work

227
0:11:20.032,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and go in and pull people out of a burning building --

228
0:11:22.786,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that happened to Mayor Booker --

229
0:11:25.124,000 --> 0:11:27,000
or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work

230
0:11:28.065,000 --> 0:11:29,000
because he sees it.

231
0:11:29.397,000 --> 0:11:31,000
No head of state would be permitted

232
0:11:31.78,000 --> 0:11:32,000
by their security details to do it,

233
0:11:33.632,000 --> 0:11:35,000
nor be in a position to do it.

234
0:11:35.85,000 --> 0:11:36,000
That's the difference, and the difference

235
0:11:37.389,000 --> 0:11:39,000
has to do with the character of cities themselves,

236
0:11:39.554,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because cities are profoundly multicultural,

237
0:11:46.175,000 --> 0:11:5,000
open, participatory, democratic,

238
0:11:50.51,000 --> 0:11:52,000
able to work with one another.

239
0:11:53.164,000 --> 0:11:55,000
When states face each other,

240
0:11:55.99,000 --> 0:11:59,000
China and the U.S., they face each other like this.

241
0:12:00.28,000 --> 0:12:04,000
When cities interact, they interact like this.

242
0:12:04.883,000 --> 0:12:07,000
China and the U.S., despite the recent

243
0:12:08.19,000 --> 0:12:1,000
meta-meeting in California,

244
0:12:10.801,000 --> 0:12:14,000
are locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry

245
0:12:15.566,000 --> 0:12:16,000
for number one.

246
0:12:16.807,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We heard more about who will be number one.

247
0:12:19.784,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Cities don't worry about number one.

248
0:12:21.935,000 --> 0:12:23,000
They have to work together, and they do work together.

249
0:12:24.118,000 --> 0:12:27,000
They work together in climate change, for example.

250
0:12:27.729,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Organizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned,

251
0:12:31.235,000 --> 0:12:32,000
have been working together

252
0:12:33.119,000 --> 0:12:35,000
many, many years before Copenhagen.

253
0:12:35.309,000 --> 0:12:37,000
In Copenhagen, four or five years ago,

254
0:12:37.83,000 --> 0:12:4,000
184 nations came together to explain to one another

255
0:12:41.224,000 --> 0:12:43,000
why their sovereignty didn't permit them

256
0:12:43.469,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change,

257
0:12:47.771,000 --> 0:12:5,000
but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited

258
0:12:51.047,000 --> 0:12:52,000
200 mayors to attend.

259
0:12:52.769,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They came, they stayed, and they found ways

260
0:12:55.829,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and are still finding ways to work together,

261
0:12:58.92,000 --> 0:13:01,000
city-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.

262
0:13:02.369,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities,

263
0:13:06.146,000 --> 0:13:07,000
which means cities are in a position

264
0:13:08.03,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to solve the carbon problem, or most of it,

265
0:13:11.238,000 --> 0:13:13,000
whether or not the states of which they are a part

266
0:13:14.026,000 --> 0:13:16,000
make agreements with one another.

267
0:13:16.084,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And they are doing it.

268
0:13:17.332,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Los Angeles cleaned up its port,

269
0:13:19.632,000 --> 0:13:21,000
which was 40 percent of carbon emissions,

270
0:13:22.207,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.

271
0:13:25.988,000 --> 0:13:27,000
New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings,

272
0:13:28.972,000 --> 0:13:31,000
make them better insulated in the winter,

273
0:13:32.156,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to not leak energy in the summer,

274
0:13:34.099,000 --> 0:13:36,000
not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.

275
0:13:37.046,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Bogota, where Mayor Mockus,

276
0:13:38.94,000 --> 0:13:42,000
when he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system

277
0:13:43.176,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that saved energy, that allowed surface buses

278
0:13:47.628,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to run in effect like subways,

279
0:13:49.163,000 --> 0:13:5,000
express buses with corridors.

280
0:13:51.079,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It helped unemployment, because people could get across town,

281
0:13:54.365,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and it had a profound impact on climate as well as

282
0:13:58.221,000 --> 0:13:59,000
many other things there.

283
0:13:59.292,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Singapore, as it developed its high-rises

284
0:14:02.146,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and its remarkable public housing,

285
0:14:03.851,000 --> 0:14:06,000
also developed an island of parks,

286
0:14:07.344,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and if you go there, you'll see how much of it

287
0:14:09.06,000 --> 0:14:1,000
is green land and park land.

288
0:14:10.601,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.

289
0:14:13.109,000 --> 0:14:14,000
They are doing it together.

290
0:14:14.694,000 --> 0:14:17,000
They are sharing what they do,

291
0:14:18.352,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and they are making a difference by shared best practices.

292
0:14:22.321,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Bike shares, many of you have heard of it,

293
0:14:23.953,000 --> 0:14:25,000
started 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.

294
0:14:26.256,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.

295
0:14:28.6,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Pedestrian zones, congestion fees,

296
0:14:31.891,000 --> 0:14:34,000
emission limits in cities like California cities have,

297
0:14:35.601,000 --> 0:14:37,000
there's lots and lots that cities can do

298
0:14:37.905,000 --> 0:14:46,000
even when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act.

299
0:14:47.265,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So what's the bottom line here?

300
0:14:51.233,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The bottom line is, we still live politically

301
0:14:54.98,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in a world of borders, a world of boundaries,

302
0:14:57.195,000 --> 0:14:58,000
a world of walls,

303
0:14:58.793,000 --> 0:15:04,000
a world where states refuse to act together.

304
0:15:04.953,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Yet we know that the reality we experience

305
0:15:08.746,000 --> 0:15:12,000
day to day is a world without borders,

306
0:15:12.943,000 --> 0:15:14,000
a world of diseases without borders

307
0:15:15.417,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and doctors without borders,

308
0:15:17.717,000 --> 0:15:21,000
maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières,

309
0:15:22.289,000 --> 0:15:28,000
of economics and technology without borders,

310
0:15:28.36,000 --> 0:15:3,000
of education without borders,

311
0:15:30.476,000 --> 0:15:33,000
of terrorism and war without borders.

312
0:15:33.706,000 --> 0:15:36,000
That is the real world, and unless we find a way

313
0:15:36.92,000 --> 0:15:41,000
to globalize democracy or democratize globalization,

314
0:15:42.35,000 --> 0:15:46,000
we will increasingly not only risk

315
0:15:46.718,000 --> 0:15:5,000
the failure to address all of these transnational problems,

316
0:15:50.799,000 --> 0:15:53,000
but we will risk losing democracy itself,

317
0:15:54.518,000 --> 0:15:58,000
locked up in the old nation-state box,

318
0:15:59.144,000 --> 0:16:04,000
unable to address global problems democratically.

319
0:16:04.837,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So where does that leave us?

320
0:16:07.831,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I'll tell you. The road to global democracy

321
0:16:10.842,000 --> 0:16:11,000
doesn't run through states.

322
0:16:12.813,000 --> 0:16:14,000
It runs through cities.

323
0:16:15.375,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Democracy was born in the ancient polis.

324
0:16:20.175,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.

325
0:16:25.683,000 --> 0:16:28,000
In that journey from polis to cosmopolis,

326
0:16:29.627,000 --> 0:16:31,000
we can rediscover the power

327
0:16:31.898,000 --> 0:16:33,000
of democracy on a global level.

328
0:16:34.021,000 --> 0:16:38,000
We can create not a League of Nations, which failed,

329
0:16:38.043,000 --> 0:16:39,000
but a League of Cities,

330
0:16:39.431,000 --> 0:16:42,000
not a United or a dis-United Nations,

331
0:16:42.543,000 --> 0:16:44,000
but United Cities of the World.

332
0:16:44.801,000 --> 0:16:48,000
We can create a global parliament of mayors.

333
0:16:48.888,000 --> 0:16:52,000
That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world,

334
0:16:52.984,000 --> 0:16:54,000
but it's also on the table in City Halls

335
0:16:55.666,000 --> 0:16:57,000
in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam,

336
0:16:58.394,000 --> 0:17:,000
in Hamburg, and in New York.

337
0:17:00.433,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually

338
0:17:03.291,000 --> 0:17:06,000
constitute a global parliament of mayors,

339
0:17:06.45,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors

340
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
is a parliament of citizens

341
0:17:11.476,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us,

342
0:17:15.371,000 --> 0:17:18,000
of you and of me.

343
0:17:18.502,000 --> 0:17:22,000
If ever there were citizens without borders,

344
0:17:23.292,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I think it's the citizens of TED

345
0:17:25.435,000 --> 0:17:28,000
who show the promise to be those citizens without borders.

346
0:17:28.626,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I am ready to reach out and embrace

347
0:17:33.556,000 --> 0:17:35,000
a new global democracy,

348
0:17:35.882,000 --> 0:17:38,000
to take back our democracy.

349
0:17:38.981,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And the only question is,

350
0:17:41.119,000 --> 0:17:43,000
are you?

351
0:17:43.178,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Thank you so much, my fellow citizens.

352
0:17:45.161,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Applause)

353
0:17:56.351,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is simply repeat many of the points

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that the three people before me have already made,

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but do them --

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
this is called "creative collaboration;"

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it's actually called "borrowing" --

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but do it through a particular perspective,

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers

9
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in this emerging world of

10
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
collaborative creativity

11
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that Jimmy and others have talked about.

12
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let me just ask you, to start with,

13
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
this simple question:

14
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
who invented the mountain bike?

15
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Because traditional economic theory would say,

16
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation

17
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that had a big R&D lab

18
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
where they were thinking up new projects,

19
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.

20
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius

21
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
working in his garage, who,

22
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up

23
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
with a bike out of thin air.

24
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It didn't come from there. The mountain bike

25
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
came from users, came from young users,

26
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
particularly a group in Northern California,

27
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes,

28
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode,

29
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or your big brother, and they're very glamorous.

30
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode,

31
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy.

32
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So, they got the frames from these big bikes,

33
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
put them together with the gears from the racing bikes,

34
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
got the brakes from motorcycles,

35
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients.

36
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,

37
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
mountain bikes were known as "clunkers."

38
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And they were just made in a community of bikers,

39
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
mainly in Northern California.

40
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And then one of these companies that was importing parts

41
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for the clunkers decided to set up in business,

42
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
start selling them to other people,

43
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,

44
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and it probably was, I don't know,

45
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
10, maybe even 15, years,

46
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
before the big bike companies

47
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
realized there was a market.

48
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Thirty years later,

49
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
mountain bike sales

50
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and mountain bike equipment

51
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
account for 65 percent of bike sales in America.

52
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
That's 58 billion dollars.

53
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is a category entirely created by consumers

54
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market

55
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
because they couldn't see the need,

56
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the opportunity;

57
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they didn't have the incentive to innovate.

58
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The one thing I think I disagree with

59
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
about Yochai's presentation

60
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is when he said the Internet causes

61
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive.

62
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's when the Internet combines

63
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers --

64
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;

65
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
they've got the tools; they want to --

66
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that you get this kind of explosion

67
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of creative collaboration.

68
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And out of that, you get the need for the kind of things

69
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,

70
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or a better way to put it:

71
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
how do we organize ourselves without organizations?

72
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,

73
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to achieve large and complex tasks,

74
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
like innovating new software programs.

75
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So this is a huge challenge

76
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to the way we think creativity comes about.

77
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The traditional view, still enshrined

78
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in much of the way that we think about creativity

79
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
-- in organizations, in government --

80
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is that creativity is about special people:

81
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
wear baseball caps the wrong way round,

82
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
come to conferences like this, in special places,

83
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
elite universities, R&D labs in the forests, water,

84
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,

85
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.

86
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Special people, special places, think up special ideas,

87
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas

88
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
down to the waiting consumers, who are passive.

89
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.

90
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That's the idea of creativity.

91
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
What's the policy recommendation out of that

92
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
if you're in government, or you're running a large company?

93
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
More special people, more special places.

94
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Build creative clusters in cities;

95
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
create more R&D parks, so on and so forth.

96
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.

97
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.

98
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I think it's always been wrong,

99
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,

100
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and it's probably been largely interactive.

101
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong

102
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.

103
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The ideas are coming back from the consumers,

104
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and they're often ahead of the producers.

105
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Why is that?

106
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Well, one issue

107
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is that radical innovation,

108
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when you've got ideas that

109
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
affect a large number of technologies or people,

110
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.

111
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The payoffs to innovation are greatest

112
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
where the uncertainty is highest.

113
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And when you get a radical innovation,

114
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.

115
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The whole history of telephony

116
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is a story of dealing with that uncertainty.

117
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The very first landline telephones,

118
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the inventors thought

119
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that they would be used for people to listen in

120
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to live performances

121
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
from West End theaters.

122
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,

123
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
they had no idea what it was for;

124
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it was only when that technology got into the hands

125
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of teenage users

126
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that they invented the use.

127
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So the more radical the innovation,

128
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the more the uncertainty,

129
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the more you need innovation in use

130
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to work out what a technology is for.

131
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
All of our patents, our entire approach

132
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to patents and invention, is based on the idea

133
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that the inventor knows what the invention is for;

134
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we can say what it's for.

135
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
More and more, the inventors of things

136
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
will not be able to say that in advance.

137
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It will be worked out in use,

138
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in collaboration with users.

139
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We like to think that invention is

140
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
a sort of moment of creation:

141
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.

142
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The truth is that most creativity

143
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is cumulative and collaborative;

144
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:36,000
like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.

145
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The second reason why users are more and more important

146
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.

147
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
If you want to find the big new ideas,

148
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,

149
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in big organizations.

150
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And just look inside large organizations

151
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and you'll see why that is so.

152
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So, you're in a big corporation.

153
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.

154
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Do you go into your board and say,

155
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"Look, I've got a fantastic idea

156
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
for an embryonic product

157
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in a marginal market,

158
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with consumers we've never dealt with before,

159
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"

160
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
No, what you do, is you go in and you say,

161
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation

162
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to an existing product we sell through existing channels

163
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to existing users, and I can guarantee

164
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
you get this much return out of it over the next three years."

165
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Big corporations have an in-built tendency

166
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to reinforce past success.

167
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They've got so much sunk in it

168
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that it's very difficult for them to spot

169
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
emerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,

170
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
are the breeding grounds for passionate users.

171
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Best example:

172
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
who in the music industry,

173
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
30 years ago, would have said,

174
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"Yes, let's invent a musical form

175
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which is all about dispossessed black men

176
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in ghettos expressing their frustration

177
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
with the world through a form of music

178
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.

179
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."

180
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter).

181
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So what happens? Rap music is created by the users.

182
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment;

183
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:19,000
they distribute it themselves.

184
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
30 years later,

185
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture --

186
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
would never have come from the big companies.

187
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Had to start -- this is the third point --

188
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
with these pro-ams.

189
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
This is the phrase that I've used in

190
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
some stuff which I've done

191
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
with a think tank in London called Demos,

192
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs --

193
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
i.e., they do it for the love of it --

194
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but they want to do it to very high standards.

195
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And across a whole range of fields --

196
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
from software, astronomy,

197
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
natural sciences,

198
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
vast areas of leisure and culture

199
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
like kite-surfing, so on and so forth --

200
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you find people who want to do things because they love it,

201
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but they want to do these things to very high standards.

202
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They work at their leisure, if you like.

203
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They take their leisure very seriously:

204
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
they acquire skills; they invest time;

205
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet:

206
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
cameras, design technology,

207
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:21,000
leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.

208
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Largely through globalization,

209
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.

210
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
More knowledgeable consumers, more educated,

211
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
more able to connect with one another,

212
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
more able to do things together.

213
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Consumption, in that sense, is an expression

214
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
of their productive potential.

215
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Why, we found, people were interested in this,

216
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is that at work they don't feel very expressed.

217
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them,

218
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
so they pick up these kinds of activities.

219
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This has huge organizational implications

220
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
for very large areas of life.

221
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Take astronomy as an example,

222
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which Yochai has already mentioned.

223
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Twenty years ago, 30 years ago,

224
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
only big professional astronomers

225
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
with very big telescopes could see far into space.

226
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,

227
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and when I was a kid, it was amazing,

228
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.

229
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, six

230
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
amateur astronomers, working with the Internet,

231
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with Dobsonian digital telescopes --

232
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
which are pretty much open source --

233
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
with some light sensors

234
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
developed over the last 10 years, the Internet --

235
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.

236
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion

237
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of new productive resources.

238
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The users can be producers.

239
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What does this mean, then, for our

240
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
organizational landscape?

241
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Well, just imagine a world,

242
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for the moment, divided into two camps.

243
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:

244
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
special people, special places;

245
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
patent it, push it down the pipeline

246
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to largely waiting, passive consumers.

247
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Over here, let's imagine we've got

248
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond -- open source.

249
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This is open; this is closed.

250
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This is new; this is traditional.

251
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,

252
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is what Yochai has said already --

253
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is there is a great big struggle

254
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
between those two organizational forms.

255
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
These people over there will do everything they can

256
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding,

257
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
because they're threatened by them.

258
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And so the debates about

259
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth --

260
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
these are all about trying to stifle, in my view,

261
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
these kinds of organizations.

262
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What we're seeing is a complete corruption

263
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of the idea of patents and copyright.

264
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Meant to be a way to incentivize invention,

265
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge,

266
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
they are increasingly being used by large companies

267
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to create thickets of patents

268
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to prevent innovation taking place.

269
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Let me just give you two examples.

270
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist

271
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and saying, "I've got a fantastic idea.

272
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I've invented this brilliant new program

273
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook."

274
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture

275
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
competing with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.

276
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come --

277
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
will only come --

278
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
from an open-source kind of project.

279
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So, there is a huge competitive argument

280
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
about sustaining the capacity

281
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:4,000
for open-source and consumer-driven innovation,

282
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because it's one of the greatest

283
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
competitive levers against monopoly.

284
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
There'll be huge professional arguments as well.

285
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Because the professionals, over here

286
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
in these closed organizations --

287
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
they might be academics; they might be programmers;

288
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
they might be doctors; they might be journalists --

289
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,000
my former profession --

290
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
say, "No, no -- you can't trust these people over here."

291
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:05,000
When I started in journalism --

292
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Financial Times, 20 years ago --

293
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:11,000
it was very, very exciting

294
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to see someone reading the newspaper.

295
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube

296
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to see if they were reading your article.

297
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Usually they were reading the share prices,

298
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and the bit of the paper with your article on

299
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
was on the floor, or something like that,

300
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing!

301
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They're not reading my brilliant article!"

302
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And we allowed users, readers,

303
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
two places where they could contribute to the paper:

304
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the letters page, where they could write a letter in,

305
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and we would condescend to them, cut it in half,

306
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and print it three days later.

307
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor --

308
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
had been to school with him, slept with his wife --

309
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
they could write an article for the op-ed page.

310
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Those were the two places.

311
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.

312
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.

313
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think

314
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that the bloggers want to be journalists;

315
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.

316
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.

317
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:1,000
They want to be part of that flow of information.

318
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
What's happening there is that the whole domain

319
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of creativity is expanding.

320
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.

321
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement

322
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
from the open to the closed.

323
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,

324
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and these, I think, are two challenges

325
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
for the open movement.

326
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
The first is:

327
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
can we really survive on volunteers?

328
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
If this is so critical,

329
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
do we not need it funded, organized, supported

330
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
in much more structured ways?

331
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I think the idea of creating the Red Cross

332
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,

333
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but can we really organize that, just on volunteers?

334
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
What kind of changes do we need in public policy

335
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and funding to make that possible?

336
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
What's the role of the BBC,

337
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
for instance, in that world?

338
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What should be the role of public policy?

339
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And finally, what I think you will see

340
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is the intelligent, closed organizations

341
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
moving increasingly in the open direction.

342
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So it's not going to be a contest between two camps,

343
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places

344
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that people will occupy.

345
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
New organizational models coming about,

346
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:24,000
mixing closed and open in tricky ways.

347
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux --

348
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
there'll be all sorts of things in between.

349
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And those organizational models, it turns out,

350
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
are incredibly powerful,

351
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and the people who can understand them

352
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
will be very, very successful.

353
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Let me just give you one final example

354
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
of what that means.

355
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I was in Shanghai,

356
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:47,000
in an office block

357
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
built on what was a rice paddy five years ago --

358
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
one of the 2,500 skyscrapers

359
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.

360
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.

361
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business

362
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:03,000
in 2000.

363
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money,

364
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
decided to go into computer games.

365
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
He runs a company called Shanda,

366
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:15,000
which is the largest computer games company in China.

367
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Nine thousand servers all over China,

368
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:22,000
has 250 million subscribers.

369
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.

370
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:29,000
How many people does he employ

371
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
to service that population?

372
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
500 people.

373
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Well, how can he service

374
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,000
250 million people from 500 employees?

375
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Because basically, he doesn't service them.

376
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
He gives them a platform;

377
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools

378
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;

379
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:51,000
he orchestrates the action.

380
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
But actually, a lot of the content

381
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
is created by the users themselves.

382
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And it creates a kind of stickiness

383
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
between the community and the company

384
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
which is really, really powerful.

385
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:05,000
The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,

386
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
you create a character

387
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that you develop in the course of the game.

388
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
If, for some reason, your credit card bounces,

389
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
or there's some other problem,

390
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
you lose your character.

391
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
You've got two options.

392
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:21,000
One option: you can create a new character,

393
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:24,000
right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.

394
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:26,000
That costs about 100 dollars.

395
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Or you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,

396
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:32,000
queue up outside Shanda's offices --

397
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:36,000
cost probably 600, 700 dollars --

398
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and reclaim your character, get your history back.

399
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Every morning, there are 600 people queuing

400
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:43,000
outside their offices

401
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:45,000
to reclaim these characters. (Laughter)

402
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:48,000
So this is about companies built on communities,

403
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:51,000
that provide communities with tools,

404
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:53,000
resources, platforms in which they can share.

405
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:55,000
He's not open source,

406
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:57,000
but it's very, very powerful.

407
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:,000
So here is one of the challenges, I think,

408
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:02,000
for people like me, who

409
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:05,000
do a lot of work with government.

410
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:08,000
If you're a games company,

411
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and you've got a million players in your game,

412
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:14,000
you only need one percent of them

413
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:16,000
to be co-developers, contributing ideas,

414
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and you've got a development workforce

415
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:21,000
of 10,000 people.

416
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Imagine you could take all the children

417
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:27,000
in education in Britain, and one percent of them

418
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:29,000
were co-developers of education.

419
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:31,000
What would that do to the resources available

420
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:33,000
to the education system?

421
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS

422
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
to, in some sense, be co-producers of health.

423
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:41,000
The reason why --

424
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:44,000
despite all the efforts to cut it down,

425
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:46,000
to constrain it, to hold it back --

426
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:49,000
why these open models will still start emerging

427
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:51,000
with tremendous force,

428
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:53,000
is that they multiply our productive resources.

429
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And one of the reasons they do that

430
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
is that they turn users into producers,

431
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:59,000
consumers into designers.

432
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Thank you very much.

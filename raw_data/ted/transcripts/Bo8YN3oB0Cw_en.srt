1
0:00:12.38,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Have you ever heard the one about how breastfeeding is free?

2
0:00:17.086,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Yeah, it's pretty funny,

4
0:00:20.5,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because it's only free if we don't value women's time and energy.

5
0:00:26.94,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Any mother can tell you how much time and energy it takes

6
0:00:31.54,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to liquify her body --

7
0:00:33.5,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to literally dissolve herself --

8
0:00:36.06,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:37.66,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as she feeds this precious little cannibal.

10
0:00:40.94,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:43.18,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Milk is why mammals suck.

12
0:00:47.22,000 --> 0:00:48,000
At Arizona State University,

13
0:00:49.14,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in the Comparative Lactation Lab,

14
0:00:51.1,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I decode mothers' milk composition

15
0:00:53.9,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to understand its complexity

16
0:00:56.9,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and how it influences infant development.

17
0:01:00.54,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The most important thing that I've learned

18
0:01:03.62,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is that we do not do enough to support mothers and babies.

19
0:01:09.54,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And when we fail mothers and babies,

20
0:01:11.74,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we fail everyone who loves mothers and babies:

21
0:01:15.9,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the fathers, the partners, the grandparents, the aunties,

22
0:01:19.1,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the friends and kin that make our human social networks.

23
0:01:24.3,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's time that we abandon simple solutions and simple slogans,

24
0:01:29.06,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and grapple with the nuance.

25
0:01:32.02,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was very fortunate

26
0:01:33.62,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to run smack-dab into that nuance very early,

27
0:01:37.3,000 --> 0:01:39,000
during my first interview with a journalist

28
0:01:40.38,000 --> 0:01:41,000
when she asked me,

29
0:01:41.7,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"How long should a mother breastfeed her baby?"

30
0:01:47.86,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And it was that word "should" that brought me up short,

31
0:01:52.46,000 --> 0:01:56,000
because I will never tell a woman what she should do with her body.

32
0:01:58.62,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Babies survive and thrive

33
0:02:00.42,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because their mother's milk is food, medicine and signal.

34
0:02:05.1,000 --> 0:02:06,000
For young infants,

35
0:02:06.34,000 --> 0:02:07,000
mother's milk is a complete diet

36
0:02:08.3,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that provides all the building blocks for their bodies,

37
0:02:10.9,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that shapes their brain

38
0:02:12.3,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and fuels all of their activity.

39
0:02:15.18,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Mother's milk also feeds the microbes

40
0:02:17.62,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that are colonizing the infant's intestinal tract.

41
0:02:20.66,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Mothers aren't just eating for two,

42
0:02:22.38,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they're eating for two to the trillions.

43
0:02:26.38,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Milk provides immunofactors that help fight pathogens

44
0:02:30.82,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and mother's milk provides hormones that signal to the infant's body.

45
0:02:36.62,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But in recent decades,

46
0:02:38.14,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we have come to take milk for granted.

47
0:02:40.3,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We stopped seeing something in plain sight.

48
0:02:43.3,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We began to think of milk as standardized, homogenized, pasteurized,

49
0:02:48.46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
packaged, powdered, flavored and formulated.

50
0:02:52.5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We abandoned the milk of human kindness

51
0:02:54.7,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and turned our priorities elsewhere.

52
0:02:58.38,000 --> 0:02:59,000
At the National Institutes of Health

53
0:03:00.14,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in Washington DC

54
0:03:01.78,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is the National Library of Medicine,

55
0:03:04.34,000 --> 0:03:06,000
which contains 25 million articles --

56
0:03:07.1,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the brain trust of life science and biomedical research.

57
0:03:11.9,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We can use keywords to search that database,

58
0:03:15.3,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and when we do that,

59
0:03:16.58,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we discover nearly a million articles about pregnancy,

60
0:03:20.46,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but far fewer about breast milk and lactation.

61
0:03:24.66,000 --> 0:03:28,000
When we zoom in on the number of articles just investigating breast milk,

62
0:03:29.3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we see that we know much more about coffee, wine and tomatoes.

63
0:03:33.82,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:36.34,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We know over twice as much about erectile dysfunction.

65
0:03:40.06,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:44.06,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I'm not saying we shouldn't know about those things --

67
0:03:46.66,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'm a scientist, I think we should know about everything.

68
0:03:49.38,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But that we know so much less --

69
0:03:51.74,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:53.54,000 --> 0:03:54,000
about breast milk --

71
0:03:54.86,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the first fluid a young mammal is adapted to consume --

72
0:03:57.66,000 --> 0:03:58,000
should make us angry.

73
0:03:59.78,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Globally, nine out of 10 women will have at least one child in her lifetime.

74
0:04:04.3,000 --> 0:04:08,000
That means that nearly 130 million babies are born each year.

75
0:04:08.78,000 --> 0:04:11,000
These mothers and babies deserve our best science.

76
0:04:12.9,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Recent research has shown that milk doesn't just grow the body,

77
0:04:16.58,000 --> 0:04:19,000
it fuels behavior and shapes neurodevelopment.

78
0:04:20.62,000 --> 0:04:23,000
In 2015, researchers discovered

79
0:04:23.66,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that the mixture of breast milk and baby saliva --

80
0:04:26.66,000 --> 0:04:28,000
specifically, baby saliva --

81
0:04:28.74,000 --> 0:04:31,000
causes a chemical reaction that produces hydrogen peroxide

82
0:04:32.58,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that can kill staph and salmonella.

83
0:04:35.7,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And from humans and other mammal species,

84
0:04:37.9,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we're starting to understand that the biological recipe of milk

85
0:04:41.34,000 --> 0:04:44,000
can be different when produced for sons or daughters.

86
0:04:45.38,000 --> 0:04:48,000
When we reach for donor milk in the neonatal intensive care unit,

87
0:04:49.02,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or formula on the store shelf,

88
0:04:51.02,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it's nearly one-size-fits-all.

89
0:04:53.78,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We aren't thinking about how sons and daughters may grow at different rates,

90
0:04:58.06,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or different ways,

91
0:04:59.3,000 --> 0:05:,000
and that milk may be a part of that.

92
0:05:02.02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Mothers have gotten the message

93
0:05:03.98,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and the vast majority of mothers intend to breastfeed,

94
0:05:07.42,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but many do not reach their breastfeeding goals.

95
0:05:11.34,000 --> 0:05:13,000
That is not their failure;

96
0:05:13.46,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it's ours.

97
0:05:15.58,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Increasingly common medical conditions like obesity, endocrine disorders,

98
0:05:20.18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
C-section and preterm births

99
0:05:21.82,000 --> 0:05:23,000
all can disrupt the underlying biology of lactation.

100
0:05:25.1,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And many women do not have knowledgeable clinical support.

101
0:05:29.34,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Twenty-five years ago,

102
0:05:30.74,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the World Health Organization and UNICEF established criteria

103
0:05:34.62,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for hospitals to be considered baby friendly --

104
0:05:37.22,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that provide the optimal level of support for mother-infant bonding

105
0:05:41.06,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and infant feeding.

106
0:05:43.3,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Today, only one in five babies in the United States

107
0:05:46.7,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is born in a baby-friendly hospital.

108
0:05:51.02,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is a problem,

109
0:05:52.3,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because mothers can grapple with many problems

110
0:05:55.18,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in the minutes, hours, days and weeks of lactation.

111
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They can have struggles with establishing latch,

112
0:06:01.78,000 --> 0:06:02,000
with pain,

113
0:06:03.02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
with milk letdown

114
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and perceptions of milk supply.

115
0:06:06.82,000 --> 0:06:1,000
These mothers deserve knowledgeable clinical staff

116
0:06:11.34,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that understand these processes.

117
0:06:14.3,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Mothers will call me as they're grappling with these struggles,

118
0:06:18.7,000 --> 0:06:2,000
crying with wobbly voices.

119
0:06:23.22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
"It's not working.

120
0:06:25.06,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This is what I'm supposed to naturally be able to do.

121
0:06:27.74,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Why is it not working?"

122
0:06:30.06,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And just because something is evolutionarily ancient

123
0:06:33.66,000 --> 0:06:35,000
doesn't mean that it's easy or that we're instantly good at it.

124
0:06:37.38,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You know what else is evolutionarily ancient?

125
0:06:40.06,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:44.02,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Sex.

127
0:06:45.34,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And nobody expects us to start out being good at it.

128
0:06:48.3,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:51.3,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Clinicians best deliver quality equitable care

130
0:06:55.86,000 --> 0:06:57,000
when they have continuing education

131
0:06:57.9,000 --> 0:07:,000
about how to best support lactation and breastfeeding.

132
0:07:01.66,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And in order to have that continuing education,

133
0:07:03.9,000 --> 0:07:05,000
we need to anchor it to cutting-edge research

134
0:07:06.06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in both the life sciences and the social sciences,

135
0:07:09.58,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because we need to recognize

136
0:07:11.3,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that too often

137
0:07:13.46,000 --> 0:07:16,000
historical traumas and implicit biases

138
0:07:16.9,000 --> 0:07:19,000
sit in the space between a new mother and her clinician.

139
0:07:21.5,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The body is political.

140
0:07:24.58,000 --> 0:07:27,000
If our breastfeeding support is not intersectional,

141
0:07:28.3,000 --> 0:07:29,000
it's not good enough.

142
0:07:30.94,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And for moms who have to return for work,

143
0:07:33.94,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because countries like the United States do not provide paid parental leave,

144
0:07:38.98,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they can have to go back in as short as just a few days after giving birth.

145
0:07:44.22,000 --> 0:07:47,000
How do we optimize mother and infant health

146
0:07:47.58,000 --> 0:07:5,000
just by messaging about breast milk to moms

147
0:07:50.94,000 --> 0:07:52,000
without providing the institutional support

148
0:07:53.74,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that facilitates that mother-infant bonding

149
0:07:56.42,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to support breastfeeding?

150
0:07:58.5,000 --> 0:08:,000
The answer is: we can't.

151
0:08:02.82,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I'm talking to you, legislators,

152
0:08:05.3,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and the voters who elect them.

153
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I'm talking to you, job creators and collective bargaining units,

154
0:08:11.98,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and workers, and shareholders.

155
0:08:15.18,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We all have a stake in the public health of our community,

156
0:08:19.14,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and we all have a role to play in achieving it.

157
0:08:23.02,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Breast milk is a part of improving human health.

158
0:08:26.82,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In the NICU, when infants are born early or sick or injured,

159
0:08:30.86,000 --> 0:08:33,000
milk or bioactive constituents in milk can be critically important.

160
0:08:35.18,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Environments or ecologies,

161
0:08:36.62,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or communities where there's high risk of infectious disease,

162
0:08:39.86,000 --> 0:08:41,000
breast milk can be incredibly protective.

163
0:08:42.34,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Where there are emergencies like storms and earthquakes,

164
0:08:45.979,000 --> 0:08:46,000
when the electricity goes out,

165
0:08:47.499,000 --> 0:08:48,000
when safe water is not available,

166
0:08:49.499,000 --> 0:08:51,000
breast milk can keep babies fed and hydrated.

167
0:08:54.18,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And in the context of humanitarian crises,

168
0:08:56.9,000 --> 0:08:58,000
like Syrian mothers fleeing war zones,

169
0:09:00.06,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the smallest drops can buffer babies from the biggest global challenges.

170
0:09:07.3,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But understanding breast milk is not just about messaging to mothers

171
0:09:12.06,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and policy makers.

172
0:09:13.9,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's also about understanding what is important in breast milk

173
0:09:17.02,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so that we can deliver better formulas

174
0:09:19.82,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to moms who cannot or do not breastfeed for whatever reason.

175
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We can all do a better job

176
0:09:26.1,000 --> 0:09:29,000
of supporting the diversity of moms raising their babies

177
0:09:29.42,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in a diversity of ways.

178
0:09:32.5,000 --> 0:09:33,000
As women around the world struggle

179
0:09:34.38,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to achieve political, social and economic equality,

180
0:09:38.06,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we must reimagine motherhood

181
0:09:40.62,000 --> 0:09:45,000
as not the central, core aspect of womanhood,

182
0:09:45.86,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but one of the many potential facets of what makes women awesome.

183
0:09:50.9,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's time.

184
0:09:52.86,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.948,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Joan Blades: Do you have politically diverse friends?

2
0:00:15.925,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What do you talk about with them?

3
0:00:18.076,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm a progressive; I live in a town full of progressives,

4
0:00:20.93,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and 15 years ago, I didn't have any conservative friends.

5
0:00:24.602,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now I have a wonderful mix of friends,

6
0:00:27.39,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and they include John.

7
0:00:29.354,000 --> 0:00:3,000
John Gable: I am not a progressive.

8
0:00:31.672,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm a Republican who grew up in a Republican family

9
0:00:34.575,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in the conservative South,

10
0:00:35.88,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and even worked in Republican politics, locally and at the national level.

11
0:00:39.584,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But the last 24 years, I've been in technology

12
0:00:42.156,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and living in a very progressive area.

13
0:00:44.483,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So I have a lot of progressive friends,

14
0:00:46.407,000 --> 0:00:47,000
including Joan.

15
0:00:48.666,000 --> 0:00:5,000
JB: I was born in Berkeley, California,

16
0:00:51.194,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a notoriously progressive college town.

17
0:00:54.299,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I live there now.

18
0:00:56.891,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In 1998, six months into the Monica Lewinsky-Clinton impeachment scandal,

19
0:01:02.614,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I helped cofound MoveOn.org with a one-sentence petition:

20
0:01:07.195,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"Congress must immediately censure the president

21
0:01:10.526,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and move on to pressing issues facing the nation."

22
0:01:13.507,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, that was actually a very unifying petition in many ways.

23
0:01:17.107,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You could love Clinton or hate Clinton

24
0:01:19.349,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and agree that the best thing for the country was to move on.

25
0:01:23.858,000 --> 0:01:27,000
As the leader of MoveOn, I saw the polarization just continue.

26
0:01:28.457,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I found myself wondering

27
0:01:31.557,000 --> 0:01:33,000
why I saw things so differently

28
0:01:34.064,000 --> 0:01:36,000
than many people in other parts of the country.

29
0:01:36.765,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So in 2005, when I had an opportunity to get together with grassroots leaders

30
0:01:42.995,000 --> 0:01:44,000
across the political divide,

31
0:01:45.226,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I grabbed it.

32
0:01:47.144,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I became friends with a lot of people

33
0:01:49.874,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I never had a chance to talk to before.

34
0:01:53.05,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And that included leadership in the Christian Coalition,

35
0:01:56.348,000 --> 0:02:,000
often seen as on the right the way MoveOn is seen as on the left.

36
0:02:00.797,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And this lead to me showing up on Capitol Hill

37
0:02:04.168,000 --> 0:02:08,000
with one of the Christian Coalition leaders, my friend,

38
0:02:08.456,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to lobby for net neutrality.

39
0:02:10.452,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That was powerful.

40
0:02:11.627,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We turned heads.

41
0:02:13.915,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So this work was transformational for me.

42
0:02:17.997,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And I found myself wondering:

43
0:02:20.401,000 --> 0:02:23,000
How could vast numbers of people have the opportunity

44
0:02:24.266,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to really connect with people that have very different views?

45
0:02:28.972,000 --> 0:02:3,000
JG: I was born Oneida, Tennessee,

46
0:02:31.013,000 --> 0:02:35,000
right across the state border from a small coal mining town,

47
0:02:35.699,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Stearns, Kentucky.

48
0:02:37.04,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I lived there for the first few years of my life,

49
0:02:39.58,000 --> 0:02:41,000
before moving to another small town, Frankfort, Kentucky.

50
0:02:42.348,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Basically, I grew up in small-town America,

51
0:02:44.472,000 --> 0:02:45,000
conservative at its heart.

52
0:02:46.908,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now, Stearns and Berkeley -- they're a little different.

53
0:02:50.598,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:53.543,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So in the '90s I moved out west to a progressive area

55
0:02:57.179,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to work in technology --

56
0:02:58.73,000 --> 0:03:,000
worked at Microsoft, worked at Netscape.

57
0:03:00.826,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I actually became the product manager lead for Netscape Navigator,

58
0:03:04.039,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the first popular web browser.

59
0:03:06.204,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now in the early days of the internet,

60
0:03:08.119,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we were just moved and inspired by a vision:

61
0:03:11.319,000 --> 0:03:14,000
when we're connected to all these different people around the world

62
0:03:14.59,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and all these different ideas,

63
0:03:16.132,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we'll be able to make great decisions,

64
0:03:17.982,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and we'll be able to appreciate each other

65
0:03:20.026,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for the beautiful diversity that the whole world has to offer.

66
0:03:23.019,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now I also, 20 years ago, gave a speech

67
0:03:24.956,000 --> 0:03:25,000
saying it might not work out that way,

68
0:03:27.645,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that we might actually be trained to discriminate against each other

69
0:03:31.354,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in new ways.

70
0:03:34.357,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So what happened?

71
0:03:36.233,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's not like we just woke up one day and decided to hate each other more.

72
0:03:40.532,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Here's what happened.

73
0:03:42.249,000 --> 0:03:45,000
There's just too much noise -- too many people, too many ideas --

74
0:03:45.385,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so we use technology to filter it out a little bit.

75
0:03:47.921,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And what happens?

76
0:03:49.417,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It lets in ideas I already agree with.

77
0:03:52.08,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It lets in the popular ideas,

78
0:03:54.016,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it lets in people just like me who think just like me.

79
0:03:56.834,000 --> 0:03:57,000
That sounds kind of good, right?

80
0:03:58.911,000 --> 0:04:,000
Well, not necessarily,

81
0:04:01.091,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because two very scary things happen

82
0:04:04.038,000 --> 0:04:06,000
when we have such narrow worldviews.

83
0:04:06.902,000 --> 0:04:09,000
First, we become more extreme in our beliefs.

84
0:04:11.272,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Second, we become less tolerant of anybody who's different than we are.

85
0:04:18.266,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Does this sound familiar?

86
0:04:20.856,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Does this sound like modern America? The modern world?

87
0:04:24.365,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Well, the good news is that technology is changing,

88
0:04:26.852,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it could change for the better.

89
0:04:28.562,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And that's, in fact, why I started AllSides.com --

90
0:04:31.023,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to create technologies and services to free us from these filter bubbles.

91
0:04:35.381,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The very first thing we did was create technology that identifies bias,

92
0:04:38.977,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so we could show different perspectives side by side

93
0:04:42.246,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to free us from the filter bubbles of news media.

94
0:04:46.193,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And then I met Joan.

95
0:04:49.291,000 --> 0:04:52,000
JB: So I met John outside of Washington, DC,

96
0:04:52.684,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with an idealistic group of cross-partisan bridge builders,

97
0:04:58.482,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and we wanted to re-weave the fabric of our communities.

98
0:05:02.109,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We believe that our differences can be a strength,

99
0:05:06.534,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that our values can be complimentary

100
0:05:09.417,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and that we have to overcome the fight

101
0:05:12.392,000 --> 0:05:14,000
so that we can honor everyone's values

102
0:05:14.912,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and not lose any of our own.

103
0:05:17.051,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I went for this wonderful walk with John,

104
0:05:19.105,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where I started learning about the work he was doing

105
0:05:21.625,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to pierce the filter bubble.

106
0:05:23.756,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It was powerful;

107
0:05:25.117,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it was brilliant.

108
0:05:27.137,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Living in separate narratives is not good.

109
0:05:30.907,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We can't even have a conversation or do collaborative problem-solving

110
0:05:34.792,000 --> 0:05:36,000
when we don't share the same facts.

111
0:05:38.605,000 --> 0:05:39,000
JG: So one thing you take away from today

112
0:05:40.607,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is if Joan Blades asks you to go on a walk,

113
0:05:43.001,000 --> 0:05:44,000
go on that walk.

114
0:05:44.311,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:45.968,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It changed things. It really changed the way I was thinking about things.

116
0:05:49.488,000 --> 0:05:51,000
To free ourselves from the filter bubbles,

117
0:05:51.606,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we can't just think about information filter bubbles,

118
0:05:54.17,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but also relationship and social filter bubbles.

119
0:05:56.882,000 --> 0:05:59,000
You see, we human beings -- we're not nearly as smart as we think we are.

120
0:06:00.366,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We don't generally make decisions intellectually.

121
0:06:02.847,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We make them emotionally, intuitively,

122
0:06:04.778,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and then we use our big old brains

123
0:06:06.523,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to rationalize anything we want to rationalize.

124
0:06:08.961,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We're not really like Vulcans like Mr. Spock,

125
0:06:12.4,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we're more like bold cowboys like Captain Kirk,

126
0:06:15.786,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or passionate idealists like Dr. McCoy.

127
0:06:19.504,000 --> 0:06:21,000
OK, for those of y'all who prefer the new "Star Trek" crew,

128
0:06:22.417,000 --> 0:06:23,000
here you go.

129
0:06:23.593,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:24.633,000 --> 0:06:25,000
JB: Don't forget the strong women!

131
0:06:26.863,000 --> 0:06:27,000
JG: Come on, strong women. OK.

132
0:06:28.35,000 --> 0:06:29,000
JB: All right.

133
0:06:29.551,000 --> 0:06:3,000
John and I are both "Star Trek" fans.

134
0:06:31.408,000 --> 0:06:35,000
What's not to love about a future with that kind of optimism?

135
0:06:36.495,000 --> 0:06:39,000
JG: And having a good future in mind is a big deal -- very important.

136
0:06:40.142,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And understanding what the problem is is very important.

137
0:06:42.914,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But we have to do something.

138
0:06:44.316,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So what do we do?

139
0:06:45.523,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It's actually not that hard.

140
0:06:46.897,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We have to add diversity to our lives --

141
0:06:48.932,000 --> 0:06:51,000
not just information, but relationship diversity.

142
0:06:52.273,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And by diversity, I mean big "D" diversity,

143
0:06:54.988,000 --> 0:06:56,000
not just racial and gender, which are very important,

144
0:06:57.877,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but also ...

145
0:06:59.82,000 --> 0:07:01,000
diversity of age, like young and old;

146
0:07:02.564,000 --> 0:07:04,000
rural and urban;

147
0:07:04.787,000 --> 0:07:06,000
liberal and conservative;

148
0:07:07.428,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in the US, Democrat and Republican.

149
0:07:10.418,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, one of the great examples of somebody freeing themselves

150
0:07:13.674,000 --> 0:07:14,000
from their filter bubbles

151
0:07:14.941,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and getting a more diverse life

152
0:07:16.578,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is, once again, next to me -- Joan.

153
0:07:19.551,000 --> 0:07:2,000
JB: So the question is:

154
0:07:21.388,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Who among you has had relationships lost or harmed

155
0:07:25.878,000 --> 0:07:28,000
due to differences in politics, religion or whatever?

156
0:07:29.484,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Raise your hands.

157
0:07:31.95,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Yeah.

158
0:07:33.132,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This year I have talked to so many people

159
0:07:35.929,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that have experienced that kind of loss.

160
0:07:41.487,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I've seen tears well up in people's eyes as they talk about family members

161
0:07:45.824,000 --> 0:07:46,000
from whom they're estranged.

162
0:07:48.166,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Living Room Conversations were designed

163
0:07:51.888,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to begin to heal political and personal differences.

164
0:07:57.891,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They're simple conversations

165
0:07:59.627,000 --> 0:08:02,000
where two friends with different viewpoints each invite two friends

166
0:08:04.274,000 --> 0:08:05,000
for structured conversation,

167
0:08:05.914,000 --> 0:08:08,000
where everyone's agreed to some simple ground rules:

168
0:08:08.97,000 --> 0:08:11,000
curiosity, listening, respect, taking turns --

169
0:08:12.083,000 --> 0:08:14,000
everything we learned in kindergarten, right?

170
0:08:14.215,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Really easy.

171
0:08:16.017,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So by the time you're talking about the topic you've agreed to talk about,

172
0:08:20.907,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you actually have the sense that,

173
0:08:22.572,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"You know, I kind of like this person,"

174
0:08:24.546,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and you listen to each other differently.

175
0:08:26.886,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That's kind of a human condition;

176
0:08:28.504,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we listen differently to people we care about.

177
0:08:31.159,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And then there's reflection

178
0:08:33.82,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and possibly next steps.

179
0:08:36.301,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is a deep listening practice;

180
0:08:38.964,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it's never a debate.

181
0:08:41.172,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And that's incredibly powerful.

182
0:08:43.366,000 --> 0:08:47,000
These conversations in our own living rooms

183
0:08:47.704,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with people who have different viewpoints

184
0:08:50.421,000 --> 0:08:52,000
are an incredible adventure.

185
0:08:52.461,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We rediscover that we can respect and even love people

186
0:08:55.904,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that are different from us.

187
0:08:58.148,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And it's powerful.

188
0:09:01.014,000 --> 0:09:03,000
JG: So, what are you curious about?

189
0:09:04.061,000 --> 0:09:06,000
JB: What's the conversation you yearn to have?

190
0:09:07.199,000 --> 0:09:08,000
JG: Let's do this together.

191
0:09:09.177,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Together.

192
0:09:10.698,000 --> 0:09:11,000
JB: Yes.

193
0:09:11.873,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:12.92,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Applause)

195
0:09:15.134,000 --> 0:09:16,000
JB and JG: Thank you.

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I get asked a lot what the difference between my work is

2
0:00:28.691,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and typical Pentagon long-range strategic planners.

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And the answer I like to offer is

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
what they typically do is they think about the future of wars

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the context of war.

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And what I've spent 15 years doing in this business --

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and it's taken me almost 14 to figure it out --

8
0:00:43.263,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else.

9
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace.

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with a lot of ideas.

12
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's the one that takes me around the world right now

13
0:00:58.548,000 --> 0:01:,000
interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit.

14
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The material was generated in two years of work I did

15
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for the Secretary of Defense,

16
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
thinking about a new national grand strategy

17
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:08,000
for the United States.

18
0:01:08.826,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I'm going to present a problem

19
0:01:10.279,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and try to give you an answer.

20
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Here's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the Pentagon:

21
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.

22
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Why do we call it that?

23
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess.

24
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is gobbledygook for

25
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge.

26
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They're going to be small.

27
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And if they try to fight us in the traditional, straight-up manner

28
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we're going to kick their ass,

29
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
which is why people don't try to do that any more.

30
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I met the last Air Force General who had actually

31
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:46,000
shot down an enemy plane in combat.

32
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:48,000
He's now a one star General.

33
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force

34
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:54,000
willing to fly against ours.

35
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So that overmatched capability creates problems --

36
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
catastrophic successes the White House calls them.

37
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And we're trying to figure that out,

39
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because it is an amazing capability.

40
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The question is, what's the good you can do with it?

41
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:12,000
OK?

42
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies --

43
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:18,000
gobbledygook that we sell to Congress,

44
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses

45
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want.

46
0:02:24.072,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So we say, area-denial, anti-access asymmetrical strategies

47
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and their eyes glaze over.

48
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And they say, "Will you build it in my district?"

50
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Applause)

52
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Here's my parody and it ain't much of one.

53
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Let's talk about a battle space.

54
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025.

55
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space.

56
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I don't know, the Million Man Swim.

57
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The United States has to access that battle space instantaneously.

59
0:02:57.167,000 --> 0:03:,000
They throw up anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies.

60
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:02,000
A banana peel on the tarmac.

61
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Trojan horses on our computer networks

63
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.

64
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We say, "China, it's yours."

65
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Prometheus approach, largely a geographic definition,

66
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:15,000
focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict.

67
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We field the first-half team in a league

68
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that insists on keeping score until the end of the game.

69
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That's the problem.

70
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We can run the score up against anybody,

71
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and then get our asses kicked in the second half --

72
0:03:27.453,000 --> 0:03:29,000
what they call fourth generation warfare.

73
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Here's the way I like to describe it instead.

74
0:03:32.167,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access.

75
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease.

76
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They said we couldn't do Iraq.

77
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks.

78
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse.

79
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There is nobody we can't take down.

80
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The question is, what do you do with the power?

81
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces.

82
0:03:54.215,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What we have trouble accessing is the transition space

83
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that must naturally follow,

84
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and creating the peace space that allows us to move on.

85
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Problem is, the Defense Department over here

86
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:07,000
beats the hell out of you.

87
0:04:07.826,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The State Department over here says,

88
0:04:09.565,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Come on boy, I know you can make it."

89
0:04:11.976,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And that poor country runs off that ledge,

90
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:15,000
does that cartoon thing and then drops.

91
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This is not about overwhelming force, but proportional force.

93
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's about non-lethal technologies,

94
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
because if you fire real ammo into a crowd

95
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of women and children rioting

96
0:04:31.976,000 --> 0:04:33,000
you're going to lose friends very quickly.

97
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This is not about projecting power, but about staying power,

98
0:04:36.882,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which is about legitimacy with the locals.

99
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Who do you access in this transition space?

100
0:04:41.072,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners.

101
0:04:44.716,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We asked the Indians for 17,000 peace keepers.

102
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I know their senior leadership, they wanted to give it to us.

103
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But they said to us, "You know what?

104
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle.

105
0:04:55.826,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We don't think you can pull it off,

106
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder."

107
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We asked the Russians for 40,000.

108
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:02,000
They said no.

109
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I was in China in August, I said,

110
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"You should have 50,000 peace keepers in Iraq.

111
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's your oil, not ours."

112
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Which is the truth. It's their oil.

113
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And the Chinese said to me, "Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right.

114
0:05:15.167,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there.

115
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But it's not a perfect world,

116
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and your administration isn't getting us any closer."

117
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But we have trouble accessing our outcomes.

118
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We lucked out, frankly, on the selection.

119
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We face different opponents across these three.

120
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And it's time to start admitting

121
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
you can't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all, day in and day out.

122
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's just too damn hard.

123
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.

124
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We don't do the everything else so well.

125
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Frankly, we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it.

126
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We have a brilliant Secretary of War.

127
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We don't have a Secretary of Everything Else.

128
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Because if we did, that guy would be in front of the Senate,

129
0:05:55.882,000 --> 0:05:57,000
still testifying over Abu Ghraib.

130
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
The problem is he doesn't exist.

131
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There is no Secretary of Everything Else.

132
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war.

133
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I call that the Leviathan Force.

134
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:1,000
What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else.

135
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I call them the System Administrators.

136
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What I think this really represents

137
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole

138
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
for processing politically bankrupt states.

139
0:06:19.072,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We have one for processing economically bankrupt states.

140
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan, OK?

141
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We argue about it every time we use it.

142
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Argentina just went through it, broke a lot of rules.

143
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They got out on the far end, we said, "Fine, don't worry about it."

144
0:06:33.215,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's transparent. A certain amount of certainty

145
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:37,000
gives the sense of a non-zero outcome.

146
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states

147
0:06:40.882,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that, frankly, everybody wants gone.

148
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Like Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il --

149
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions.

150
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan.

151
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:56,000
What would an A to Z system look like?

152
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I'm going to distinguish between what I call

153
0:06:59.12,000 --> 0:07:01,000
front half and back half.

154
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And let's call this red line, I don't know, mission accomplished.

155
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Applause)

157
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What we have extant right now,

158
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:16,000
at the beginning of this system, is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury.

159
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What can they do?

160
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They can indict your ass.

161
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:23,000
They can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper.

162
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you,

163
0:07:26.405,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and then say in no uncertain terms, "Please cut that out."

164
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s.

166
0:07:39.405,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That gets you 250,000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 months.

167
0:07:43.826,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Everybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day

168
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
what you did about the holocaust in Africa,

169
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and you better have an answer.

170
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We don't have anything to translate that will into action.

171
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says,

172
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"You want me to take that guy down? I'll take that guy down.

173
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you 20 billion dollars."

174
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But here's the deal.

176
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out,

177
0:08:15.31,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I leave the scene immediately.

178
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That's called the Powell Doctrine.

179
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Way downstream we have the International Criminal Court.

180
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:24,000

1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Do you worry about what is going to kill you?

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Heart disease, cancer,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a car accident?

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Most of us worry about things we can't control,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
like war, terrorism,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But what really threatens humanity?

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
A few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
tried to calculate the probability

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of sudden disasters

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
large enough to change history.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He called these,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
"massively fatal discontinuities,"

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
meaning that they could kill

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
up to 100 million people

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in the next 50 years.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He looked at the odds of another world war,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of a massive volcanic eruption,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
even of an asteroid hitting the Earth.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But he placed the likelihood of one such event

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
above all others

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
at close to 100 percent,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and that is a severe flu pandemic.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, you might think of flu

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as just a really bad cold,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but it can be a death sentence.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Every year, 36,000 people in the United States

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
die of seasonal flu.

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but the death toll is almost

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
certainly higher.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
You know, the problem is if

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
this virus occasionally mutates

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so dramatically,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it essentially is a new virus

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and then we get a pandemic.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In 1918, a new virus appeared

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that killed some 50 to 100 million people.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It spread like wildfire

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and some died within hours of developing symptoms.

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Are we safer today?

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Well, we seem to have dodged

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
the deadly pandemic this year

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that most of us feared,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but this threat could reappear at any time.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The good news is that

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we're at a moment in time

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
when science, technology, globalization is converging

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to create an unprecedented possibility:

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the possibility to make history

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
by preventing infectious diseases

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that still account for one-fifth of all deaths

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and countless misery on Earth.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We can do this.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We're already preventing millions of deaths

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
with existing vaccines,

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and if we get these to more people,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we can certainly save more lives.

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But with new or better vaccines

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for malaria, TB, HIV,

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
pneumonia, diarrhea, flu,

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we could end suffering

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So, I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But first, I have to explain why they're important

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because vaccines, the power of them,

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is really like a whisper.

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
When they work, they can make history,

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but after a while

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you can barely hear them.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, some of us are old enough

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to have a small, circular scar on our arms

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
from an inoculation we received as children.

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox,

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a disease that killed half a billion people last century

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and no longer is with us?

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We don't see scenes like this anymore

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because of vaccines.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, it's interesting

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because there are 30-odd diseases

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that can be treated with vaccines now,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Why is that?

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Well, here's the dirty little secret.

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Until recently, we haven't had to know

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
exactly how a vaccine worked.

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You took a pathogen, you modified it,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you injected it into a person or an animal

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and you saw what happened.

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This worked well for most pathogens,

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu,

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but not at all for HIV,

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
for which humans have no natural immunity.

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So let's explore how vaccines work.

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They basically create a cache

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of weapons for your immune system

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
which you can deploy when needed.

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now, when you get a viral infection,

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
what normally happens is it takes days or weeks

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
for your body to fight back

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
at full strength,

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and that might be too late.

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
When you're pre-immunized,

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
what happens is you have forces in your body

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
pre-trained to recognize

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and defeat specific foes.

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So that's really how vaccines work.

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, let's take a look at a video

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that we're debuting at TED, for the first time,

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Music)

114
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Narrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
how to recognize and neutralize

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a specific invader.

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers,

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it infects immune cells to replicate.

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The invader draws the attention

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of the immune system's front-line troops.

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Dendritic cells, or macrophages,

122
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
capture the virus and display pieces of it.

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
are activated when they learn

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
HIV is present from the front-line troops.

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
These memory cells immediately deploy

127
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the exact weapons needed.

128
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells,

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which produce wave after wave

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of the specific antibodies

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that latch onto HIV

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to prevent it from infecting cells,

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
while squadrons of killer T cells

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
seek out and destroy cells

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that are already HIV infected.

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The virus is defeated.

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Without a vaccine,

138
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
these responses would have taken more than a week.

139
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
By that time, the battle against HIV

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
would already have been lost.

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Seth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it?

142
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The antibodies you just saw in this video,

143
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in action, are the ones that make most vaccines work.

144
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So the real question then is:

145
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
How do we ensure that your body makes

146
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the exact ones that we need to protect

147
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
against flu and HIV?

148
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The principal challenge for both of these viruses

149
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is that they're always changing.

150
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So let's take a look at the flu virus.

151
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In this rendering of the flu virus,

152
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And also, what the antibodies use is a handle

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to essentially grab and neutralize the virus.

155
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
When these mutate, they change their shape,

156
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.

157
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So that's why every year

158
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
you can catch a slightly different strain of flu.

159
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's also why in the spring,

160
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
we have to make a best guess

161
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
at which three strains are going to prevail the next year,

162
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
put those into a single vaccine

163
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and rush those into production for the fall.

164
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Even worse,

165
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the most common influenza -- influenza A --

166
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
also infects animals

167
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that live in close proximity to humans,

168
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and they can recombine

169
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in those particular animals.

170
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In addition, wild aquatic birds

171
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
carry all known strains

172
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
of influenza.

173
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, you've got this situation:

174
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
In 2003,

175
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we had an H5N1 virus

176
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that jumped from birds into humans

177
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in a few isolated cases

178
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.

179
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now luckily, that particular virus,

180
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
although very scary at the time,

181
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
did not transmit from person to person

182
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
very easily.

183
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This year's H1N1 threat

184
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
was actually a human, avian, swine mixture

185
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that arose in Mexico.

186
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It was easily transmitted,

187
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but, luckily, was pretty mild.

188
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And so, in a sense,

189
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
our luck is holding out,

190
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime.

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Now let's take a look at HIV.

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
As variable as flu is,

193
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
HIV makes flu

194
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
look like the Rock of Gibraltar.

195
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The virus that causes AIDS

196
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is the trickiest pathogen

197
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
scientists have ever confronted.

198
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It mutates furiously,

199
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
it has decoys to evade the immune system,

200
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it

201
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and it quickly hides itself

202
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in your genome.

203
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Here's a slide looking at

204
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the genetic variation of flu

205
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and comparing that to HIV,

206
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
a much wilder target.

207
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
In the video a moment ago,

208
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.

209
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now realize that in a recently infected person,

210
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
there are millions of these ships;

211
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
each one is just slightly different.

212
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Finding a weapon that recognizes

213
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and sinks all of them

214
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
makes the job that much harder.

215
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Now, in the 27 years since HIV

216
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
was identified as the cause of AIDS,

217
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we've developed more drugs to treat HIV

218
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
than all other viruses put together.

219
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
These drugs aren't cures,

220
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but they represent a huge triumph of science

221
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because they take away the automatic death sentence

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
from a diagnosis of HIV,

223
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
at least for those who can access them.

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The vaccine effort though is really quite different.

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Large companies moved away from it

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
because they thought the science was so difficult

227
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and vaccines were seen as poor business.

228
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but today, evidence tells us otherwise.

230
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In September,

231
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we had surprising but exciting findings

232
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.

233
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
For the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans --

234
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
albeit, quite modestly --

235
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
and that particular vaccine was made

236
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
almost a decade ago.

237
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Newer concepts and early testing now

238
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
show even greater promise in the best of our animal models.

239
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But in the past few months, researchers have also isolated

240
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
several new broadly neutralizing antibodies

241
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
from the blood of an HIV infected individual.

242
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Now, what does this mean?

243
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We saw earlier that HIV

244
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
is highly variable,

245
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that a broad neutralizing antibody

246
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
latches on and disables

247
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
multiple variations of the virus.

248
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
If you take these and you put them

249
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in the best of our monkey models,

250
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
they provide full protection from infection.

251
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
In addition, these researchers found

252
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
a new site on HIV

253
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
where the antibodies can grab onto,

254
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and what's so special about this spot

255
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is that it changes very little

256
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
as the virus mutates.

257
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's like, as many times

258
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
as the virus changes its clothes,

259
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
it's still wearing the same socks,

260
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and now our job is to make sure

261
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we get the body to really hate those socks.

262
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So what we've got is a situation.

263
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The Thai results tell us

264
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we can make an AIDS vaccine,

265
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and the antibody findings

266
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
tell us how we might do that.

267
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This strategy, working backwards

268
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,

269
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
has never been done before in vaccine research.

270
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It's called retro-vaccinology,

271
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and its implications extend

272
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
way beyond that of just HIV.

273
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So think of it this way.

274
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We've got these new antibodies we've identified,

275
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus.

276
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part,

277
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part,

278
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
present that through a vaccine,

279
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
what we hope is we can prompt

280
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
your immune system to make these matching antibodies.

281
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And that would create

282
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
a universal HIV vaccine.

283
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Now, it sounds easier than it is

284
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
because the structure actually looks more like

285
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
this blue antibody diagram

286
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
attached to its yellow binding site,

287
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures

288
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
are much harder to work on.

289
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this,

290
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
we'd love to hear about it.

291
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now

292
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
has really helped with innovation with other diseases.

293
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So for instance, a biotechnology company

294
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
has now found broadly neutralizing

295
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
antibodies to influenza,

296
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus.

297
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They're currently making a cocktail --

298
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat

299
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
severe, overwhelming cases of flu.

300
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
In the longer term, what they can do

301
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is use these tools of retro-vaccinology

302
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to make a preventive flu vaccine.

303
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique

304
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.

305
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Let me give you another example.

306
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We talked about before the H and N spikes

307
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
on the surface of the flu virus.

308
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Notice these other, smaller protuberances.

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
These are largely hidden from the immune system.

310
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Now it turns out that these spots

311
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
also don't change much when the virus mutates.

312
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
If you can cripple these with specific antibodies,

313
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
you could cripple all versions of the flu.

314
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So far, animal tests indicate

315
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease,

316
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
although you might get a mild case.

317
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about

318
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
is a universal flu vaccine,

319
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
one that doesn't need to change every year

320
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and would remove the threat of death.

321
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We really could think of flu, then,

322
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
as just a bad cold.

323
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Of course, the best vaccine imaginable

324
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is only valuable to the extent

325
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
we get it to everyone who needs it.

326
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So to do that, we have to combine

327
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
smart vaccine design with smart production methods

328
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and, of course, smart delivery methods.

329
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So I want you to think back a few months ago.

330
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
In June, the World Health Organization

331
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
declared the first global

332
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
flu pandemic in 41 years.

333
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The U.S. government promised

334
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
150 million doses of vaccine

335
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
by October 15th for the flu peak.

336
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Vaccines were promised to developing countries.

337
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent

338
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.

339
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So what happened?

340
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Well, we first figured out

341
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
how to make flu vaccines, how to produce them,

342
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in the early 1940s.

343
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It was a slow, cumbersome process

344
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that depended on chicken eggs,

345
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
millions of living chicken eggs.

346
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Viruses only grow in living things,

347
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and so it turned out that, for flu,

348
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
chicken eggs worked really well.

349
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
For most strains, you could get one to two doses

350
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
of vaccine per egg.

351
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Luckily for us,

352
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
we live in an era of breathtaking

353
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
biomedical advances.

354
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So today, we get our flu vaccines from ...

355
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
chicken eggs,

356
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Laughter)

357
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
hundreds of millions of chicken eggs.

358
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Almost nothing has changed.

359
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The system is reliable

360
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
but the problem is you never know how well

361
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
a strain is going to grow.

362
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
This year's swine flu strain

363
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
grew very poorly in early production:

364
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
basically .6 doses per egg.

365
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So, here's an alarming thought.

366
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
What if that wild bird flies by again?

367
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
You could see an avian strain

368
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that would infect the poultry flocks,

369
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.

370
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So, Dan [Barber], if you want

371
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
billions of chicken pellets

372
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
for your fish farm,

373
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I know where to get them.

374
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
So right now, the world can produce

375
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
about 350 million doses

376
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
of flu vaccine for the three strains,

377
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses

378
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
if we want to target a single variant

379
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
like swine flu.

380
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But this assumes that our factories are humming

381
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
because, in 2004,

382
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
the U.S. supply was cut in half

383
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
by contamination at one single plant.

384
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And the process still takes

385
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
more than half a year.

386
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So are we better prepared

387
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
than we were in 1918?

388
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Well, with the new technologies emerging now,

389
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I hope we can say definitively, "Yes."

390
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine

391
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
for everyone in the entire world

392
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
for less than half of what we're currently spending

393
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
now in the United States.

394
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
With a range of new technologies, we could.

395
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Here's an example:

396
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
A company I'm engaged with has found

397
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
a specific piece of the H spike of flu

398
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that sparks the immune system.

399
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
If you lop this off and attach it

400
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to the tail of a different bacterium,

401
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
which creates a vigorous immune response,

402
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
they've created a very powerful flu fighter.

403
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
This vaccine is so small

404
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
it can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.

405
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly --

406
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
it's like making yogurt --

407
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and so we could produce enough swine origin flu

408
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,

409
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
with no eggs,

410
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
for a fraction of the cost of current methods.

411
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Applause)

412
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies.

413
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And, aside from the radically increased production

414
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and huge cost savings --

415
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
for example, the E. coli method I just talked about --

416
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
look at the time saved: this would be lives saved.

417
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
The developing world,

418
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
mostly left out of the current response,

419
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
sees the potential of these alternate technologies

420
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and they're leapfrogging the West.

421
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
India, Mexico and others are already

422
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
making experimental flu vaccines,

423
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and they may be the first place

424
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
we see these vaccines in use.

425
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Because these technologies are so efficient

426
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and relatively cheap,

427
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines

428
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
if we can figure out how to deliver them.

429
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Now think of where this leads us.

430
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
New infectious diseases

431
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
appear or reappear

432
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
every few years.

433
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Some day, perhaps soon,

434
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.

435
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Will we be quick enough to react

436
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
before millions die?

437
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.

438
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I say, "luckily" in part

439
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
because virtually no one in the developing world

440
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
was vaccinated.

441
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
So if we have the political and financial foresight

442
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
to sustain our investments,

443
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
we will master these and new tools of vaccinology,

444
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and with these tools we can produce

445
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
enough vaccine for everyone at low cost

446
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and ensure healthy productive lives.

447
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.

448
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
No longer does AIDS

449
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
need to kill two million a year.

450
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
No longer do the poor and vulnerable

451
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
need to be threatened by infectious diseases,

452
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
or indeed, anybody.

453
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Instead of having Vaclav Smil's

454
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
"massively fatal discontinuity" of life,

455
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
we can ensure

456
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
the continuity of life.

457
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
What the world needs now are these new vaccines,

458
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and we can make it happen.

459
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Thank you very much.

460
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
(Applause)

461
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

462
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
(Applause)

463
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Thank you.

464
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
So, the science is changing.

465
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
In your mind, Seth -- I mean, you must dream about this --

466
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
what is the kind of time scale

467
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
on, let's start with HIV,

468
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable?

469
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
SB: The game change can come at any time,

470
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
because the problem we have now is

471
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;

472
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
we just need a better one.

473
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.

474
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
So, if we can figure out how to do that,

475
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
then we have the vaccine,

476
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
and what's interesting is there already is

477
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.

478
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So, the challenge is full speed ahead.

479
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
CA: In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years?

480
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
SB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years,

481
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
but it's been 10 years every 10 years.

482
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
So I hate to put a timeline

483
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
on scientific innovation,

484
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.

485
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
CA: And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing?

486
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
SB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is

487
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this --

488
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:07,000
a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.

489
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:09,000
They look good. The problem has been that,

490
0:20:09.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
what we did is we invested in traditional technologies

491
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
because that's what we were comfortable with.

492
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:17,000
You also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.

493
0:20:17.26,000 --> 0:20:19,000
That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out

494
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
our supply of flu and made more available,

495
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:24,000
but, going back to what Michael Specter said,

496
0:20:24.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
the anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen.

497
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
CA: And malaria's even further behind?

498
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:31,000
SB: No, malaria, there is a candidate

499
0:20:31.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial

500
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and is currently in phase three trials now.

501
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:39,000
It probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along.

502
0:20:39.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
CA: Seth, most of us do work where every month,

503
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:43,000
we produce something;

504
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
we get that kind of gratification.

505
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade,

506
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:51,000
and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.

507
0:20:51.26,000 --> 0:20:53,000
The world needs people like you. Thank you.

508
0:20:53.26,000 --> 0:20:55,000
SB: Thank you.

509
0:20:55.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
(Applause)

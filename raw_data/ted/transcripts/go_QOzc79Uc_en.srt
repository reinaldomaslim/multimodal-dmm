1
0:00:16.2,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Sadly,

2
0:00:18.2,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,

3
0:00:21.487,000 --> 0:00:23,000
four Americans that are alive

4
0:00:24.2,000 --> 0:00:27,000
will be dead through the food that they eat.

5
0:00:29.891,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My name's Jamie Oliver.

6
0:00:31.29,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm 34 years old.

7
0:00:33.041,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm from Essex in England

8
0:00:35.2,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and for the last seven years

9
0:00:38.2,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way.

10
0:00:44.384,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm not a doctor;

11
0:00:46.2,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I'm a chef,

12
0:00:47.401,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I don't have expensive equipment

13
0:00:49.947,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or medicine.

14
0:00:51.041,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I use information, education.

15
0:00:54.525,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I profoundly believe that the power of food

16
0:00:57.526,000 --> 0:01:,000
has a primal place in our homes

17
0:01:00.725,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that binds us to the best bits of life.

18
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We have an awful, awful reality right now.

19
0:01:13.779,000 --> 0:01:15,000
America, you're at the top of your game.

20
0:01:17.2,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.

21
0:01:20.89,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Can I please just see a raise of hands

22
0:01:23.56,000 --> 0:01:25,000
for how many of you have children in this room today?

23
0:01:26.163,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Put your hands up.

24
0:01:27.588,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well.

25
0:01:31.532,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Most of you. OK.

26
0:01:33.533,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We, the adults of the last four generations,

27
0:01:36.534,000 --> 0:01:38,000
have blessed our children with the destiny

28
0:01:39.423,000 --> 0:01:43,000
of a shorter lifespan than their own parents.

29
0:01:45.279,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Your child will live a life ten years younger than you

30
0:01:50.2,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because of the landscape of food that we've built around them.

31
0:01:54.595,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Two-thirds of this room,

32
0:01:56.104,000 --> 0:01:58,000
today, in America, are statistically overweight or obese.

33
0:01:59.434,000 --> 0:02:,000
You lot, you're all right,

34
0:02:00.705,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.

35
0:02:02.744,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:04.2,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The statistics of bad health are clear,

37
0:02:07.2,000 --> 0:02:08,000
very clear.

38
0:02:09.009,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We spend our lives being paranoid about death, murder, homicide,

39
0:02:12.657,000 --> 0:02:15,000
you name it; it's on the front page of every paper, CNN.

40
0:02:16.2,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.

41
0:02:19.598,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Right?

42
0:02:20.653,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:22.2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Applause)

44
0:02:27.2,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease.

45
0:02:31.54,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Any doctor, any specialist will tell you that.

46
0:02:34.152,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Fact: diet-related disease is the biggest killer

47
0:02:37.463,000 --> 0:02:4,000
in the United States, right now, here today.

48
0:02:43.305,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is a global problem.

49
0:02:45.77,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's a catastrophe.

50
0:02:46.946,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's sweeping the world.

51
0:02:48.438,000 --> 0:02:5,000
England is right behind you, as usual.

52
0:02:51.413,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:55.644,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I know they were close, but not that close.

54
0:02:58.366,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We need a revolution.

55
0:02:59.738,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Mexico, Australia, Germany,

56
0:03:02.041,000 --> 0:03:03,000
India, China,

57
0:03:03.293,000 --> 0:03:06,000
all have massive problems of obesity and bad health.

58
0:03:07.985,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Think about smoking.

59
0:03:10.294,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It costs way less than obesity now.

60
0:03:12.937,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health-care bills,

61
0:03:17.871,000 --> 0:03:19,000
150 billion dollars a year.

62
0:03:22.274,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In 10 years, it's set to double:

63
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
300 billion dollars a year.

64
0:03:25.717,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Let's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.

65
0:03:28.117,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:32.025,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in.

67
0:03:38.44,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We need it. The time is now.

68
0:03:40.719,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We're in a tipping-point moment.

69
0:03:42.47,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I've been doing this for seven years.

70
0:03:44.279,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I've been trying in America for seven years.

71
0:03:46.466,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now is the time when it's ripe -- ripe for the picking.

72
0:03:50.374,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I went to the eye of the storm.

73
0:03:52.2,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America.

74
0:03:55.153,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Or it was last year.

75
0:03:56.216,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.

76
0:03:59.479,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:01.386,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.

78
0:04:03.433,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I wanted to put heart and soul and people,

79
0:04:06.954,000 --> 0:04:07,000
your public,

80
0:04:08.733,000 --> 0:04:11,000
around the statistics that we've become so used to.

81
0:04:12.604,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about:

82
0:04:15.628,000 --> 0:04:16,000
your public, your children.

83
0:04:17.272,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.

84
0:04:19.845,000 --> 0:04:2,000
She's 16 years old.

85
0:04:22.128,000 --> 0:04:25,000
She's got six years to live

86
0:04:25.642,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because of the food that she's eaten.

87
0:04:28.484,000 --> 0:04:3,000
She's the third generation of Americans

88
0:04:30.612,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that hasn't grown up within a food environment

89
0:04:32.827,000 --> 0:04:34,000
where they've been taught to cook at home or in school,

90
0:04:35.44,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or her mom, or her mom's mom.

91
0:04:37.471,000 --> 0:04:39,000
She has six years to live.

92
0:04:40.787,000 --> 0:04:42,000
She's eating her liver to death.

93
0:04:43.66,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Stacy, the Edwards family.

94
0:04:45.613,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is a normal family, guys.

95
0:04:48.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Stacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well;

96
0:04:51.05,000 --> 0:04:53,000
she was never taught to cook at home or at school.

97
0:04:53.423,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The family's obese.

98
0:04:54.582,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Justin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds.

99
0:04:57.327,000 --> 0:04:58,000
He gets bullied, for God's sake.

100
0:04:59.019,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The daughter there, Katie, she's four years old.

101
0:05:01.51,000 --> 0:05:03,000
She's obese before she even gets to primary school.

102
0:05:04.534,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Marissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot.

103
0:05:07.482,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But you know what?

104
0:05:08.529,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Her father, who was obese, died in her arms,

105
0:05:11.911,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And then the second most important man in her life,

106
0:05:14.339,000 --> 0:05:16,000
her uncle, died of obesity,

107
0:05:16.887,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and now her step-dad is obese.

108
0:05:19.977,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You see, the thing is,

109
0:05:21.777,000 --> 0:05:23,000
obesity and diet-related disease

110
0:05:24.2,000 --> 0:05:26,000
doesn't just hurt the people that have it;

111
0:05:26.224,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters.

112
0:05:30.413,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Pastor Steve:

113
0:05:32.2,000 --> 0:05:33,000
an inspirational man,

114
0:05:33.661,000 --> 0:05:35,000
one of my early allies in Huntington, West Virginia.

115
0:05:36.531,000 --> 0:05:39,000
He's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.

116
0:05:40.475,000 --> 0:05:41,000
He has to bury the people, OK?

117
0:05:42.832,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And he's fed up with it.

118
0:05:44.036,000 --> 0:05:47,000
He's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community.

119
0:05:47.387,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Come winter, three times as many people die.

120
0:05:50.716,000 --> 0:05:51,000
He's sick of it.

121
0:05:52.2,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is preventable disease. Waste of life.

122
0:05:55.2,000 --> 0:05:57,000
By the way, this is what they get buried in.

123
0:05:58.525,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We're not geared up to do this.

124
0:06:01.303,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Can't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious.

125
0:06:03.955,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Can't even get them there. Forklift.

126
0:06:06.732,000 --> 0:06:08,000
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?

127
0:06:08.848,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is our landscape of food.

128
0:06:10.404,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I need you to understand it.

129
0:06:11.785,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You've probably heard all this before.

130
0:06:13.873,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Over the last 30 years,

131
0:06:15.183,000 --> 0:06:17,000
what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country?

132
0:06:18.04,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Let's be frank and honest.

133
0:06:20.724,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Well, modern-day life.

134
0:06:22.948,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Let's start with the Main Street.

135
0:06:25.327,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Fast food has taken over the whole country; we know that.

136
0:06:28.035,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The big brands are some of the most important powers,

137
0:06:30.863,000 --> 0:06:31,000
powerful powers, in this country.

138
0:06:33.313,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Sighs)

139
0:06:34.338,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Supermarkets as well.

140
0:06:36.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Big companies. Big companies.

141
0:06:38.471,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Thirty years ago, most of the food

142
0:06:41.455,000 --> 0:06:43,000
was largely local and largely fresh.

143
0:06:44.2,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives,

144
0:06:47.583,000 --> 0:06:49,000
extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story.

145
0:06:50.298,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Portion size is obviously a massive, massive problem.

146
0:06:54.877,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Labeling is a massive problem.

147
0:06:57.533,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The labeling in this country is a disgrace.

148
0:07:00.69,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The industry wants to self-police themselves.

149
0:07:06.2,000 --> 0:07:08,000
What, in this kind of climate? They don't deserve it.

150
0:07:08.779,000 --> 0:07:11,000
How can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?

151
0:07:13.271,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Home.

152
0:07:16.473,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The biggest problem with the home

153
0:07:18.072,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture,

154
0:07:23.2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
what made our society.

155
0:07:25.648,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That is not happening anymore.

156
0:07:27.105,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And you know, as we go to work and as life changes,

157
0:07:30.01,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and as life always evolves,

158
0:07:32.011,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we kind of have to look at it holistically --

159
0:07:34.148,000 --> 0:07:36,000
step back for a moment, and re-address the balance.

160
0:07:36.56,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?

161
0:07:39.604,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I want to show you a situation

162
0:07:42.986,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that is very normal right now; the Edwards family.

163
0:07:46.842,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.

164
0:07:49.672,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week.

165
0:07:53.729,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And I need you to know

166
0:07:55.662,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that this is going to kill your children early.

167
0:07:59.81,000 --> 0:08:,000
How are you feeling?

168
0:08:01.899,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Stacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now.

169
0:08:05.89,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life

170
0:08:09.027,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and this isn't going to get them there.

171
0:08:12.009,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But I'm killing them.

172
0:08:14.915,000 --> 0:08:16,000
JO: Yes you are. You are.

173
0:08:17.915,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But we can stop that.

174
0:08:23.017,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Normal.

175
0:08:25.266,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Let's get on schools,

176
0:08:27.124,000 --> 0:08:3,000
something that I'm fairly much a specialist in.

177
0:08:30.2,000 --> 0:08:31,000
OK, school.

178
0:08:32.2,000 --> 0:08:34,000
What is school? Who invented it? What's the purpose of school?

179
0:08:35.2,000 --> 0:08:37,000
School was always invented to arm us with the tools

180
0:08:38.056,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to make us creative, do wonderful things,

181
0:08:40.899,000 --> 0:08:42,000
make us earn a living, etc., etc.

182
0:08:43.38,000 --> 0:08:47,000
You know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK?

183
0:08:48.2,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But we haven't really evolved it

184
0:08:50.2,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK?

185
0:08:53.554,000 --> 0:08:56,000
School food is something

186
0:08:56.665,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that most kids -- 31 million a day, actually --

187
0:08:59.347,000 --> 0:09:03,000
have twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch,

188
0:09:04.032,000 --> 0:09:05,000
180 days of the year.

189
0:09:05.785,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So you could say that school food is quite important, really,

190
0:09:08.984,000 --> 0:09:09,000
judging the circumstances.

191
0:09:10.594,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:15.659,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Before I crack into my rant,

193
0:09:18.2,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which I'm sure you're waiting for --

194
0:09:20.25,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:23.321,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I need to say one thing, and it's so important

196
0:09:25.711,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds

197
0:09:28.442,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in the next three months.

198
0:09:30.2,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America --

199
0:09:33.513,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I offer myself as their ambassador.

200
0:09:36.912,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I'm not slagging them off.

201
0:09:38.422,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They're doing the best they can do.

202
0:09:43.088,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They're doing their best.

203
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But they're doing what they're told,

204
0:09:47.056,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and what they're being told to do is wrong.

205
0:09:49.636,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The system is highly run by accountants;

206
0:09:52.897,000 --> 0:09:56,000
there's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business.

207
0:09:56.998,000 --> 0:09:57,000
There's a problem:

208
0:09:58.053,000 --> 0:10:01,000
If you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets

209
0:10:01.2,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative,

210
0:10:03.934,000 --> 0:10:06,000
you can't duck and dive and write different things around things.

211
0:10:07.097,000 --> 0:10:09,000
If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,

212
0:10:09.128,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the only thing you can do in these circumstances

213
0:10:11.398,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is buy cheaper shit.

214
0:10:12.45,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Now, the reality is,

215
0:10:13.804,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the food that your kids get every day is fast food,

216
0:10:17.439,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it's highly processed,

217
0:10:18.772,000 --> 0:10:2,000
there's not enough fresh food in there at all.

218
0:10:21.036,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You know, the amount of additives, E numbers,

219
0:10:23.241,000 --> 0:10:24,000
ingredients you wouldn't believe --

220
0:10:24.971,000 --> 0:10:25,000
there's not enough veggies at all.

221
0:10:26.706,000 --> 0:10:27,000
French fries are considered a vegetable.

222
0:10:28.654,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery.

223
0:10:31.2,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.

224
0:10:34.357,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They have scissors in the classroom,

225
0:10:36.121,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but knives and forks? No.

226
0:10:37.526,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And the way I look at it is:

227
0:10:38.946,000 --> 0:10:4,000
If you don't have knives and forks in your school,

228
0:10:41.359,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you're purely endorsing,

229
0:10:42.922,000 --> 0:10:45,000
from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.

230
0:10:46.018,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And yes, by the way, it is fast food:

231
0:10:47.827,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,

232
0:10:49.441,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.

233
0:10:53.465,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Sighs)

234
0:10:55.652,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Ten percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier,

235
0:10:58.653,000 --> 0:11:,000
is on obesity, and it's going to double.

236
0:11:02.35,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We're not teaching our kids.

237
0:11:03.804,000 --> 0:11:05,000
There's no statutory right to teach kids about food,

238
0:11:06.533,000 --> 0:11:07,000
elementary or secondary school, OK?

239
0:11:08.35,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We don't teach kids about food, right?

240
0:11:10.692,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And this is a little clip from an elementary school,

241
0:11:13.145,000 --> 0:11:14,000
which is very common in England.

242
0:11:17.2,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Video) Who knows what this is?

243
0:11:18.753,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Child: Potatoes.

244
0:11:19.848,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Jamie Oliver: Potato? So, you think these are potatoes?

245
0:11:22.46,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Do you know what that is?

246
0:11:23.994,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Do you know what that is?

247
0:11:25.222,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Child: Broccoli?

248
0:11:26.261,000 --> 0:11:28,000
JO: What about this? Our good old friend.

249
0:11:28.741,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Child: Celery.

250
0:11:29.925,000 --> 0:11:3,000
JO: No. What do you think this is?

251
0:11:31.893,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Child: Onion. JO: Onion? No.

252
0:11:33.401,000 --> 0:11:35,000
JO: Immediately you get a really clear sense

253
0:11:35.831,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"

254
0:11:39.075,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?

255
0:11:41.076,000 --> 0:11:43,000
JO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.

256
0:11:43.528,000 --> 0:11:44,000
JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,

257
0:11:45.536,000 --> 0:11:46,000
then they will never eat it.

258
0:11:49.123,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Laughter)

259
0:11:50.404,000 --> 0:11:52,000
JO: Normal. England and America,

260
0:11:53.2,000 --> 0:11:54,000
England and America.

261
0:11:54.762,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Guess what fixed that.

262
0:11:57.367,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Two one-hour sessions.

263
0:12:00.411,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.

264
0:12:04.636,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Applause)

265
0:12:10.2,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I want to tell you about something

266
0:12:14.245,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK?

267
0:12:18.607,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I want to talk about something so basic as milk.

268
0:12:21.842,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Every kid has the right to milk at school.

269
0:12:23.867,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Your kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right?

270
0:12:27.487,000 --> 0:12:28,000
They'll be having two bottles, OK?

271
0:12:29.309,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And most kids do.

272
0:12:30.826,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But milk ain't good enough anymore.

273
0:12:33.635,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Don't get me wrong, I support milk --

274
0:12:36.2,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but someone at the milk board

275
0:12:38.34,000 --> 0:12:4,000
probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out

276
0:12:41.034,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that if you put loads of flavorings,

277
0:12:42.799,000 --> 0:12:43,000
colorings and sugar in milk,

278
0:12:44.246,000 --> 0:12:45,000
more kids will drink it.

279
0:12:46.905,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Yeah.

280
0:12:48.421,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Obviously now that's going to catch on

281
0:12:50.398,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the apple board is going to work out

282
0:12:52.208,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well.

283
0:12:55.009,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Do you know what I mean?

284
0:12:56.446,000 --> 0:12:59,000
For me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.

285
0:12:59.517,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Okay? There's sugar in everything.

286
0:13:01.564,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.

287
0:13:03.737,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's in everything.

288
0:13:04.787,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems.

289
0:13:08.389,000 --> 0:13:09,000
There's our milk. There's our carton.

290
0:13:10.2,000 --> 0:13:14,000
In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,

291
0:13:14.473,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and they are having two a day.

292
0:13:15.933,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So, let me just show you.

293
0:13:17.512,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We've got one kid, here --

294
0:13:22.287,000 --> 0:13:25,000
having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day.

295
0:13:26.819,000 --> 0:13:28,000
You know, there's your week.

296
0:13:29.7,000 --> 0:13:3,000
There's your month.

297
0:13:32.778,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And I've taken the liberty of putting in

298
0:13:34.997,000 --> 0:13:37,000
just the five years of elementary school sugar,

299
0:13:41.653,000 --> 0:13:42,000
just from milk.

300
0:13:46.2,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Now, I don't know about you guys,

301
0:13:48.044,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but judging the circumstances, right,

302
0:13:50.885,000 --> 0:13:52,000
any judge in the whole world,

303
0:13:53.2,000 --> 0:13:55,000
would look at the statistics and the evidence,

304
0:13:55.688,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse.

305
0:13:59.528,000 --> 0:14:,000
That's my belief.

306
0:14:00.656,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Applause)

307
0:14:07.547,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Applause ends)

308
0:14:09.2,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Now, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today

309
0:14:12.516,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,

310
0:14:15.201,000 --> 0:14:17,000
you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me.

311
0:14:18.684,000 --> 0:14:2,000
This, all this bad news, is preventable.

312
0:14:22.2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
That's the good news.

313
0:14:23.735,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It's very, very preventable.

314
0:14:26.48,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So, let's just think about, we got a problem here,

315
0:14:29.2,000 --> 0:14:3,000
we need to reboot.

316
0:14:31.533,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do?

317
0:14:34.2,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Here is the thing, right,

318
0:14:35.939,000 --> 0:14:37,000
it cannot just come from one source.

319
0:14:38.2,000 --> 0:14:41,000
To reboot and make real tangible change,

320
0:14:41.631,000 --> 0:14:43,000
real change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes

321
0:14:44.599,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and say, "In 10 years' time,

322
0:14:46.2,000 --> 0:14:47,000
the history of your children's lives,

323
0:14:48.2,000 --> 0:14:51,000
happiness -- and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well,

324
0:14:51.272,000 --> 0:14:52,000
you know you're going to live longer --

325
0:14:53.154,000 --> 0:14:55,000
all of that stuff, it will look different. OK?"

326
0:14:56.806,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So, supermarkets.

327
0:14:58.536,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Where else do you shop so religiously?

328
0:15:00.48,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Week in, week out.

329
0:15:01.692,000 --> 0:15:04,000
How much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket?

330
0:15:04.795,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Love them.

331
0:15:05.827,000 --> 0:15:07,000
They just sell us what we want. All right.

332
0:15:07.907,000 --> 0:15:11,000
They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket.

333
0:15:12.882,000 --> 0:15:13,000
They need to help us shop.

334
0:15:14.486,000 --> 0:15:17,000
They need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals

335
0:15:18.2,000 --> 0:15:19,000
for people that are busy.

336
0:15:20.089,000 --> 0:15:21,000
This is not expensive.

337
0:15:22.082,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board

338
0:15:24.987,000 --> 0:15:25,000
in America soon, and quick.

339
0:15:27.064,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The big brands, you know, the food brands,

340
0:15:30.065,000 --> 0:15:33,000
need to put food education at the heart of their businesses.

341
0:15:33.814,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I know, easier said than done.

342
0:15:35.718,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It's the future. It's the only way.

343
0:15:37.953,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Fast food.

344
0:15:39.598,000 --> 0:15:41,000
With the fast-food industry

345
0:15:42.382,000 --> 0:15:43,000
you know, it's very competitive.

346
0:15:44.2,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I've had loads of secret papers and dealings

347
0:15:46.319,000 --> 0:15:47,000
with fast food restaurants.

348
0:15:48.061,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I know how they do it.

349
0:15:49.902,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I mean, basically they've weaned us on

350
0:15:52.199,000 --> 0:15:54,000
to these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z,

351
0:15:55.002,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and everyone loves them, right?

352
0:15:57.003,000 --> 0:16:,000
So, these guys are going to be part of the solution.

353
0:16:00.223,000 --> 0:16:01,000
But we need to get the government to work

354
0:16:02.2,000 --> 0:16:05,000
with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry,

355
0:16:05.272,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and over a five, six, seven year period

356
0:16:07.345,000 --> 0:16:09,000
wean of us off the extreme amounts

357
0:16:09.688,000 --> 0:16:12,000
of fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients.

358
0:16:13.2,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:

359
0:16:15.506,000 --> 0:16:18,000
labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce

360
0:16:18.712,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and has got to be sorted.

361
0:16:21.503,000 --> 0:16:22,000
OK, school.

362
0:16:23.73,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them

363
0:16:26.2,000 --> 0:16:27,000
to make sure those 180 days of the year,

364
0:16:28.2,000 --> 0:16:29,000
from that little precious age of four,

365
0:16:30.2,000 --> 0:16:31,000
until 18, 20, 24, whatever,

366
0:16:32.2,000 --> 0:16:36,000
they need to be cooked proper, fresh food

367
0:16:37.075,000 --> 0:16:39,000
from local growers on site, OK?

368
0:16:39.2,000 --> 0:16:41,000
There needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food

369
0:16:41.75,000 --> 0:16:42,000
for your children, yeah?

370
0:16:43.2,000 --> 0:16:47,000
(Applause)

371
0:16:47.653,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Under the circumstances, it's profoundly important

372
0:16:51.113,000 --> 0:16:53,000
that every single American child leaves school

373
0:16:53.706,000 --> 0:16:54,000
knowing how to cook 10 recipes

374
0:16:55.707,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that will save their life.

375
0:16:58.2,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Life skills.

376
0:16:59.303,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Applause)

377
0:17:01.524,000 --> 0:17:04,000
That means that they can be students, young parents,

378
0:17:04.586,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking,

379
0:17:08.849,000 --> 0:17:1,000
no matter what recession hits them next time.

380
0:17:10.976,000 --> 0:17:12,000
If you can cook, recession money doesn't matter.

381
0:17:13.382,000 --> 0:17:15,000
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.

382
0:17:17.395,000 --> 0:17:19,000
The workplace, we haven't really talked about it.

383
0:17:19.864,000 --> 0:17:22,000
You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility

384
0:17:23.45,000 --> 0:17:27,000
to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff.

385
0:17:27.498,000 --> 0:17:3,000
The staff are the moms and dads of America's children.

386
0:17:30.832,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Marissa, her father died in her hand,

387
0:17:33.015,000 --> 0:17:34,000
I think she'd be quite happy

388
0:17:35.016,000 --> 0:17:38,000
if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly.

389
0:17:38.2,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.

390
0:17:40.2,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Let's go back to the home.

391
0:17:41.79,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Now, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can,

392
0:17:44.054,000 --> 0:17:45,000
it's so achievable.

393
0:17:45.151,000 --> 0:17:46,000
You can care and be commercial.

394
0:17:46.917,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Absolutely.

395
0:17:47.964,000 --> 0:17:51,000
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.

396
0:17:52.983,000 --> 0:17:53,000
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.

397
0:17:55.473,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And for me, it's quite romantic,

398
0:17:57.141,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but it's about if one person teaches three people

399
0:17:59.558,000 --> 0:18:,000
how to cook something,

400
0:18:01.2,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and they teach three of their mates,

401
0:18:02.964,000 --> 0:18:04,000
that only has to repeat itself 25 times,

402
0:18:05.312,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and that's the whole population of America.

403
0:18:07.591,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Romantic, yes, but most importantly,

404
0:18:11.915,000 --> 0:18:13,000
it's about trying to get people to realize

405
0:18:14.63,000 --> 0:18:16,000
that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.

406
0:18:17.638,000 --> 0:18:19,000
We've got to put back what's been lost.

407
0:18:20.332,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Huntington's Kitchen.

408
0:18:22.195,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Huntington, where I made this program,

409
0:18:24.49,000 --> 0:18:25,000
we've got this prime-time program

410
0:18:26.101,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change.

411
0:18:29.313,000 --> 0:18:31,000
I truly believe that change will happen.

412
0:18:31.368,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community.

413
0:18:33.559,000 --> 0:18:34,000
I worked in the schools.

414
0:18:35.064,000 --> 0:18:37,000
I found local sustainable funding

415
0:18:37.353,000 --> 0:18:41,000
to get every single school in the area from the junk, onto the fresh food:

416
0:18:41.663,000 --> 0:18:42,000
six-and-a-half grand per school.

417
0:18:44.2,000 --> 0:18:45,000
(Applause)

418
0:18:45.43,000 --> 0:18:47,000
That's all it takes, six-and-a-half grand per school.

419
0:18:47.95,000 --> 0:18:49,000
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?

420
0:18:50.377,000 --> 0:18:52,000
This can do 5,000 people a year,

421
0:18:53.276,000 --> 0:18:55,000
which is 10 percent of their population,

422
0:18:55.418,000 --> 0:18:56,000
and it's people on people.

423
0:18:56.823,000 --> 0:18:58,000
You know, it's local cooks teaching local people.

424
0:18:59.148,000 --> 0:19:02,000
It's free cooking lessons, guys, in the Main Street.

425
0:19:03.54,000 --> 0:19:06,000
This is real, tangible change, real, tangible change.

426
0:19:07.684,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Around America, if we just look back now,

427
0:19:10.73,000 --> 0:19:12,000
there is plenty of wonderful things going on.

428
0:19:13.834,000 --> 0:19:15,000
There is plenty of beautiful things going on.

429
0:19:15.967,000 --> 0:19:18,000
There are angels around America doing great things

430
0:19:19.2,000 --> 0:19:21,000
in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,

431
0:19:22.121,000 --> 0:19:24,000
garden set-ups, education --

432
0:19:24.756,000 --> 0:19:26,000
there are amazing people doing this already.

433
0:19:26.877,000 --> 0:19:27,000
The problem is they all want to roll out

434
0:19:28.83,000 --> 0:19:3,000
what they're doing to the next school,

435
0:19:30.989,000 --> 0:19:31,000
but there's no cash.

436
0:19:33.257,000 --> 0:19:36,000
We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly,

437
0:19:36.981,000 --> 0:19:39,000
identify them, and allow them to easily find the resource

438
0:19:40.2,000 --> 0:19:42,000
to keep rolling out what they're already doing,

439
0:19:42.464,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and doing well.

440
0:19:44.048,000 --> 0:19:46,000
Businesses of America need to support

441
0:19:46.344,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do.

442
0:19:49.2,000 --> 0:19:55,000
(Applause)

443
0:19:55.623,000 --> 0:19:56,000
And look, I know it's weird

444
0:19:57.593,000 --> 0:19:59,000
having an English person standing here before you

445
0:20:00.2,000 --> 0:20:01,000
talking about all this.

446
0:20:01.665,000 --> 0:20:02,000
All I can say is: I care.

447
0:20:03.569,000 --> 0:20:04,000
I'm a father,

448
0:20:05.015,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and I love this country.

449
0:20:07.2,000 --> 0:20:09,000
And I believe truly, actually,

450
0:20:09.826,000 --> 0:20:11,000
that if change can be made in this country,

451
0:20:12.699,000 --> 0:20:14,000
beautiful things will happen around the world.

452
0:20:14.906,000 --> 0:20:16,000
If America does it, other people will follow.

453
0:20:17.065,000 --> 0:20:18,000
It's incredibly important.

454
0:20:18.837,000 --> 0:20:19,000
(Audience) Yeah!

455
0:20:19.929,000 --> 0:20:24,000
(Applause)

456
0:20:25.584,000 --> 0:20:26,000
When I was in Huntington,

457
0:20:26.886,000 --> 0:20:28,000
trying to get a few things to work when they weren't,

458
0:20:29.534,000 --> 0:20:34,000
I thought "If I had a magic wand, what would I do?"

459
0:20:34.869,000 --> 0:20:35,000
And I thought, "You know what?

460
0:20:36.45,000 --> 0:20:39,000
I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing

461
0:20:39.757,000 --> 0:20:4,000
movers and shakers in America."

462
0:20:42.441,000 --> 0:20:45,000
And a month later, TED phoned me up and gave me this award.

463
0:20:46.993,000 --> 0:20:47,000
I'm here.

464
0:20:50.715,000 --> 0:20:51,000
So, my wish.

465
0:20:56.935,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.

466
0:21:04.2,000 --> 0:21:05,000
My wish

467
0:21:06.2,000 --> 0:21:1,000
is for you to help a strong, sustainable movement

468
0:21:10.355,000 --> 0:21:13,000
to educate every child

469
0:21:14.053,000 --> 0:21:16,000
about food,

470
0:21:16.465,000 --> 0:21:19,000
to inspire families to cook again,

471
0:21:20.004,000 --> 0:21:22,000
and to empower people everywhere

472
0:21:22.689,000 --> 0:21:23,000

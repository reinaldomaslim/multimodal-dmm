1
0:00:12.691,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Almost a year ago,

2
0:00:14.036,000 --> 0:00:16,000
my aunt started suffering back pains.

3
0:00:16.897,000 --> 0:00:17,000
She went to see the doctor

4
0:00:18.262,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and they told her it was a normal injury

5
0:00:20.511,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for someone who had been playing tennis

6
0:00:22.165,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for almost 30 years.

7
0:00:24.19,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They recommended that she do some therapy,

8
0:00:26.158,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but after a while she wasn't feeling better,

9
0:00:29.253,000 --> 0:00:32,000
so the doctors decided to do further tests.

10
0:00:32.593,000 --> 0:00:32,000
They did an x-ray

11
0:00:33.592,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and discovered an injury in her lungs,

12
0:00:35.681,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and at the time they thought that the injury

13
0:00:37.238,000 --> 0:00:38,000
was a strain in the muscles and tendons

14
0:00:38.796,000 --> 0:00:39,000
between her ribs,

15
0:00:39.966,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but after a few weeks of treatment,

16
0:00:41.735,000 --> 0:00:45,000
again her health wasn't getting any better.

17
0:00:45.793,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So finally, they decided to do a biopsy,

18
0:00:49.483,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and two weeks later,

19
0:00:50.7,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the results of the biopsy came back.

20
0:00:53.443,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It was stage 3 lung cancer.

21
0:00:58.212,000 --> 0:01:,000
Her lifestyle was almost free of risk.

22
0:01:01.114,000 --> 0:01:02,000
She never smoked a cigarette,

23
0:01:02.847,000 --> 0:01:03,000
she never drank alcohol,

24
0:01:04.613,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and she had been playing sports

25
0:01:05.715,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for almost half her life.

26
0:01:07.897,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Perhaps, that is why it took them almost six months

27
0:01:11.073,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to get her properly diagnosed.

28
0:01:14.197,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My story might be, unfortunately,

29
0:01:16.3,000 --> 0:01:18,000
familiar to most of you.

30
0:01:18.539,000 --> 0:01:2,000
One out of three people sitting in this audience

31
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:23,000
will be diagnosed with some type of cancer,

32
0:01:24.166,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and one out of four

33
0:01:25.312,000 --> 0:01:28,000
will die because of it.

34
0:01:28.91,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Not only did that cancer diagnosis

35
0:01:30.992,000 --> 0:01:31,000
change the life of our family,

36
0:01:32.859,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but that process of going

37
0:01:34.872,000 --> 0:01:36,000
back and forth with new tests,

38
0:01:37.48,000 --> 0:01:38,000
different doctors describing symptoms,

39
0:01:39.248,000 --> 0:01:42,000
discarding diseases over and over,

40
0:01:42.42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
was stressful and frustrating,

41
0:01:44.8,000 --> 0:01:45,000
especially for my aunt.

42
0:01:46.712,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done

43
0:01:49.423,000 --> 0:01:51,000
since the beginning of history.

44
0:01:51.763,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs

45
0:01:54.609,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to treat cancer,

46
0:01:56.172,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but we still have 20th-century procedures

47
0:01:58.714,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and processes for diagnosis, if any.

48
0:02:02.842,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Today, most of us have to wait for symptoms

49
0:02:05.486,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to indicate that something is wrong.

50
0:02:07.953,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Today, the majority of people still don't have access

51
0:02:10.47,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to early cancer detection methods,

52
0:02:12.888,000 --> 0:02:13,000
even though we know

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that catching cancer early

54
0:02:16.184,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is basically the closest thing we have

55
0:02:17.647,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to a silver bullet cure against it.

56
0:02:21.127,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We know that we can change this in our lifetime,

57
0:02:23.608,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that is why my team and I

58
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
have decided to begin this journey,

59
0:02:27.354,000 --> 0:02:29,000
this journey to try to make cancer detection

60
0:02:29.86,000 --> 0:02:3,000
at the early stages

61
0:02:31.405,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and monitoring the appropriate response at the molecular level

62
0:02:34.557,000 --> 0:02:38,000
easier, cheaper, smarter

63
0:02:38.819,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and more accessible than ever before.

64
0:02:42.276,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The context, of course,

65
0:02:43.648,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is that we're living at a time

66
0:02:45.191,000 --> 0:02:46,000
where technology is disrupting our present

67
0:02:46.6,000 --> 0:02:47,000
at exponential rates,

68
0:02:48.107,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and the biological realm is no exception.

69
0:02:51.117,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It is said today that biotech is advancing

70
0:02:53.547,000 --> 0:02:55,000
at least six times faster than the growth rate

71
0:02:55.842,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of the processing power of computers.

72
0:02:58.218,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But progress in biotech

73
0:02:59.53,000 --> 0:03:,000
is not only being accelerated,

74
0:03:01.17,000 --> 0:03:03,000
it is also being democratized.

75
0:03:03.216,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Just as personal computers or the Internet

76
0:03:06.428,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or smartphones leveled the playing field

77
0:03:08.879,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for entrepreneurship, politics or education,

78
0:03:11.736,000 --> 0:03:14,000
recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well,

79
0:03:15.156,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and that is allowing

80
0:03:16.449,000 --> 0:03:18,000
multidisciplinary teams like ours

81
0:03:18.564,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to try to tackle and look at these problems

82
0:03:21.219,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with new approaches.

83
0:03:23.57,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We are a team of scientists and technologists

84
0:03:26.193,000 --> 0:03:28,000
from Chile, Panama,

85
0:03:29.183,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Mexico, Israel and Greece,

86
0:03:32.57,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and based on recent scientific discoveries,

87
0:03:35.192,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we believe that we have found

88
0:03:36.574,000 --> 0:03:38,000
a reliable and accurate way

89
0:03:39.375,000 --> 0:03:41,000
of detecting several types of cancer

90
0:03:41.377,000 --> 0:03:43,000
at the very early stages through a blood sample.

91
0:03:44.275,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules

92
0:03:47.223,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that circulate freely in our blood

93
0:03:48.892,000 --> 0:03:5,000
called microRNAs.

94
0:03:51.688,000 --> 0:03:53,000
To explain what microRNAs are

95
0:03:53.999,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and their important role in cancer,

96
0:03:56.214,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I need to start with proteins,

97
0:03:57.607,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because when cancer is present in our body,

98
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
protein modification is observed

99
0:04:01.591,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in all cancerous cells.

100
0:04:03.202,000 --> 0:04:04,000
As you might know,

101
0:04:04.575,000 --> 0:04:06,000
proteins are large biological molecules

102
0:04:06.85,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that perform different functions within our body,

103
0:04:09.19,000 --> 0:04:11,000
like catalyzing metabolic reactions

104
0:04:11.275,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or responding to stimuli

105
0:04:13.121,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or replicating DNA,

106
0:04:14.923,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but before a protein is expressed or produced,

107
0:04:17.666,000 --> 0:04:18,000
relevant parts of its genetic code

108
0:04:19.364,000 --> 0:04:21,000
present in the DNA

109
0:04:21.513,000 --> 0:04:24,000
are copied into the messenger RNA,

110
0:04:25.482,000 --> 0:04:26,000
so this messenger RNA

111
0:04:27.392,000 --> 0:04:3,000
has instructions on how to build a specific protein,

112
0:04:31.106,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,

113
0:04:33.706,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but the one that tells them when to build them

114
0:04:36.303,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and how many to build

115
0:04:38.632,000 --> 0:04:4,000
are microRNAs.

116
0:04:41.07,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So microRNAs are small molecules

117
0:04:42.9,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that regulate gene expression.

118
0:04:45.1,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,

119
0:04:47.315,000 --> 0:04:49,000
microRNAs can vary depending on internal

120
0:04:49.464,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and environmental conditions at any given time,

121
0:04:52.321,000 --> 0:04:55,000
telling us which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment.

122
0:04:55.775,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And that is what makes microRNAs

123
0:04:57.194,000 --> 0:04:59,000
such a promising biomarker for cancer,

124
0:04:59.495,000 --> 0:05:,000
because as you know,

125
0:05:01.377,000 --> 0:05:04,000
cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.

126
0:05:05.19,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.

127
0:05:08.744,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Another important thing to consider

128
0:05:10.398,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is that no two cancers are the same,

129
0:05:12.817,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but at the microRNA level, there are patterns.

130
0:05:15.865,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Several scientific studies have shown

131
0:05:18.115,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that abnormal microRNA expression levels

132
0:05:21.456,000 --> 0:05:24,000
varies and creates a unique, specific pattern

133
0:05:24.571,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for each type of cancer,

134
0:05:26.259,000 --> 0:05:27,000
even at the early stages,

135
0:05:27.991,000 --> 0:05:28,000
reflecting the progression of the disease,

136
0:05:29.881,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and whether it's responding to medication

137
0:05:31.782,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or in remission,

138
0:05:32.99,000 --> 0:05:34,000
making microRNAs a perfect,

139
0:05:35.123,000 --> 0:05:38,000
highly sensitive biomarker.

140
0:05:38.727,000 --> 0:05:4,000
However, the problem with microRNAs

141
0:05:41.401,000 --> 0:05:43,000
is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology

142
0:05:43.95,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to detect them in a reliable way,

143
0:05:46.563,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because they are very short sequences of nucleotides,

144
0:05:49.353,000 --> 0:05:51,000
much smaller than DNA.

145
0:05:51.535,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And also, all microRNAs are very similar to each other,

146
0:05:54.55,000 --> 0:05:56,000
with just tiny differences.

147
0:05:56.597,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,

148
0:05:59.117,000 --> 0:06:02,000
extremely similar, extremely small.

149
0:06:02.311,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We believe that we have found a way to do so,

150
0:06:05.217,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and this is the first time that we've shown it in public.

151
0:06:07.966,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Let me do a demonstration.

152
0:06:10.467,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Imagine that next time you go to your doctor

153
0:06:12.908,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and do your next standard blood test,

154
0:06:14.831,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a lab technician extracts a total RNA,

155
0:06:17.183,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which is quite simple today,

156
0:06:19.106,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and puts it in a standard 96-well plate like this one.

157
0:06:21.898,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Each well of these plates

158
0:06:23.565,000 --> 0:06:25,000
has specific biochemistry that we assign,

159
0:06:26.204,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that is looking for a specific microRNA,

160
0:06:28.544,000 --> 0:06:29,000
acting like a trap that closes

161
0:06:30.323,000 --> 0:06:32,000
only when the microRNA is present in the sample,

162
0:06:32.68,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and when it does, it will shine with green color.

163
0:06:35.801,000 --> 0:06:36,000
To run the reaction,

164
0:06:36.904,000 --> 0:06:39,000
you put the plate inside a device like this one,

165
0:06:40.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and then you can put your smartphone on top of it.

166
0:06:43.93,000 --> 0:06:45,000
If we can have a camera here

167
0:06:46.67,000 --> 0:06:48,000
so you can see my screen.

168
0:06:49.378,000 --> 0:06:51,000
A smartphone is a connected computer

169
0:06:51.774,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and it's also a camera,

170
0:06:53.383,000 --> 0:06:55,000
good enough for our purpose.

171
0:06:59.431,000 --> 0:07:,000
The smartphone is taking pictures,

172
0:07:01.411,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and when the reaction is over,

173
0:07:02.755,000 --> 0:07:03,000
it will send the pictures

174
0:07:03.798,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to our online database for processing

175
0:07:06.112,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and interpretation.

176
0:07:07.73,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This entire process lasts around 60 minutes,

177
0:07:10.455,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but when the process is over,

178
0:07:12.3,000 --> 0:07:15,000
wells that shine are matched with the specific microRNAs

179
0:07:15.325,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast

180
0:07:17.969,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they shine.

181
0:07:19.218,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And then, when this entire process is over,

182
0:07:23.486,000 --> 0:07:25,000
this is what happens.

183
0:07:25.944,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This chart is showing the specific microRNAs

184
0:07:28.541,000 --> 0:07:29,000
present in this sample

185
0:07:29.976,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and how they reacted over time.

186
0:07:32.388,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Then, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA

187
0:07:34.89,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of this person's samples

188
0:07:36.296,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and compare it with existing scientific documentation

189
0:07:39.272,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that correlates microRNA patterns

190
0:07:41.22,000 --> 0:07:46,000
with a specific presence of a disease,

191
0:07:46.501,000 --> 0:07:49,000
this is how pancreatic cancer looks like.

192
0:07:49.95,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This inside is a real sample

193
0:07:52.607,000 --> 0:07:55,000
where we just detected pancreatic cancer.

194
0:07:55.926,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Applause)

195
0:08:04.086,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Another important aspect of this approach

196
0:08:06.444,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,

197
0:08:08.783,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so we can get results in real time

198
0:08:10.426,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and analyze them with our contextual information.

199
0:08:13.863,000 --> 0:08:14,000
If we want to better understand

200
0:08:15.341,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and decode diseases like cancer,

201
0:08:17.456,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we need to stop treating them

202
0:08:18.806,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as acute, isolated episodes,

203
0:08:20.988,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and consider and measure everything

204
0:08:22.912,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that affects our health on a permanent basis.

205
0:08:27.22,000 --> 0:08:31,000
This entire platform is a working prototype.

206
0:08:31.506,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,

207
0:08:34.971,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a low-cost, 3D-printed device,

208
0:08:37.717,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and data science

209
0:08:39.679,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to try to tackle one of humanity's toughest challenges.

210
0:08:43.594,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Since we believe early cancer detection

211
0:08:45.596,000 --> 0:08:46,000
should really be democratized,

212
0:08:47.384,000 --> 0:08:49,000
this entire solution costs at least 50 times less

213
0:08:49.769,000 --> 0:08:51,000
than current available methods,

214
0:08:51.77,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and we know that the community can help us

215
0:08:53.503,000 --> 0:08:54,000
accelerate this even more,

216
0:08:54.988,000 --> 0:08:55,000
so we're making the design of the device

217
0:08:56.923,000 --> 0:08:58,000
open-source.

218
0:08:59.4,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

219
0:09:07.944,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Let me say very clearly

220
0:09:09.541,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that we are at the very early stages,

221
0:09:11.276,000 --> 0:09:12,000
but so far, we have been able

222
0:09:13.257,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to successfully identify the microRNA pattern

223
0:09:15.866,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,

224
0:09:19.128,000 --> 0:09:22,000
breast cancer and hepatic cancer.

225
0:09:22.188,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And currently, we're doing a clinical trial

226
0:09:25.37,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center

227
0:09:28.249,000 --> 0:09:31,000
with 200 women for breast cancer.

228
0:09:31.84,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Applause)

229
0:09:35.448,000 --> 0:09:37,000
This is the single non-invasive,

230
0:09:38.162,000 --> 0:09:4,000
accurate and affordable test

231
0:09:40.904,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that has the potential to dramatically change

232
0:09:43.15,000 --> 0:09:44,000
how cancer procedures and diagnostics

233
0:09:44.96,000 --> 0:09:45,000
have been done.

234
0:09:46.78,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns

235
0:09:48.397,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in your blood at any given time,

236
0:09:50.962,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for.

237
0:09:52.858,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You don't need to have any symptoms.

238
0:09:55.025,000 --> 0:09:57,000
You only need one milliliter of blood

239
0:09:57.833,000 --> 0:10:,000
and a relatively simple array of tools.

240
0:10:01.343,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Today, cancer detection happens mainly

241
0:10:04.155,000 --> 0:10:06,000
when symptoms appear.

242
0:10:06.24,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That is, at stage 3 or 4,

243
0:10:08.869,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and I believe that is too late.

244
0:10:10.793,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It is too expensive for our families.

245
0:10:12.941,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It is too expensive for humanity.

246
0:10:15.393,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We cannot lose the war against cancer.

247
0:10:18.34,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It not only costs us billions of dollars,

248
0:10:20.23,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but it also costs us the people we love.

249
0:10:23.152,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely

250
0:10:26.65,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and going through this process with a very positive attitude.

251
0:10:29.56,000 --> 0:10:31,000
However, I want fights like this

252
0:10:32.138,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to become very rare.

253
0:10:33.761,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I want to see the day

254
0:10:34.888,000 --> 0:10:35,000
when cancer is treated easily

255
0:10:36.815,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because it can be routinely diagnosed

256
0:10:38.967,000 --> 0:10:39,000
at the very early stages,

257
0:10:40.924,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and I'm certain

258
0:10:42.016,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that in the very near future,

259
0:10:44.152,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because of this

260
0:10:45.45,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and other breakthroughs that we are seeing

261
0:10:46.69,000 --> 0:10:48,000
every day in the life sciences,

262
0:10:48.713,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the way we see cancer

263
0:10:50.345,000 --> 0:10:51,000
will radically change.

264
0:10:52.336,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It will give us the chance of detecting it early,

265
0:10:54.8,000 --> 0:10:55,000
understanding it better,

266
0:10:56.565,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and finding a cure.

267
0:10:58.801,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Thank you very much.

268
0:11:00.48,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.775,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Pat Mitchell: I know you don't like that "legend" business.

2
0:00:15.567,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Marian Wright Edelman: I don't.

3
0:00:17.206,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:18.381,000 --> 0:00:19,000
PM: Why not, Marian?

5
0:00:19.752,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Because you are somewhat of a legend.

6
0:00:21.61,000 --> 0:00:23,000
You've been doing this for a long time,

7
0:00:24.247,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and you're still there as founder and president.

8
0:00:27.469,000 --> 0:00:31,000
MWE: Well, because my daddy raised us and my mother raised us to serve,

9
0:00:32.101,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and we are servant-leaders.

10
0:00:34.501,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And it is not about external things or labels,

11
0:00:39.176,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I feel like the luckiest person in the world

12
0:00:41.588,000 --> 0:00:45,000
having been born at the intersection of great needs and great injustices

13
0:00:45.798,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and great opportunities to change them.

14
0:00:47.843,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So I just feel very grateful

15
0:00:50.392,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that I could serve and make a difference.

16
0:00:52.487,000 --> 0:00:53,000
PM: What a beautiful way of saying it.

17
0:00:54.464,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Applause)

18
0:00:57.741,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You grew up in the American South,

19
0:00:59.896,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and like all children,

20
0:01:02.829,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a lot of who you became was molded by your parents.

21
0:01:07.61,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Tell me: What did they teach you about movement-building?

22
0:01:12.314,000 --> 0:01:14,000
MWE: I had extraordinary parents. I was so lucky.

23
0:01:14.666,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My mother was the best organizer I ever knew.

24
0:01:17.142,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And she always insisted, even back then, on having her own dime.

25
0:01:21.037,000 --> 0:01:24,000
She started her dairy so that she could have her penny,

26
0:01:24.909,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and that sense of independence has certainly been passed on to me.

27
0:01:28.421,000 --> 0:01:31,000
My daddy was a minister, and they were real partners.

28
0:01:31.831,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And my oldest sibling is a sister,

29
0:01:35.132,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm the youngest, and there are three boys in between.

30
0:01:38.554,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But I always knew I was as smart as my brothers.

31
0:01:41.039,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I always was a tomboy.

32
0:01:43.428,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I always had the same high aspirations that they had.

33
0:01:47.295,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But most importantly, we were terribly blessed,

34
0:01:50.136,000 --> 0:01:51,000
even though we were growing up

35
0:01:51.626,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in a very segregated small town in South Carolina --

36
0:01:57.389,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we knew it was wrong.

37
0:01:59.366,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I always knew, from the time I was four years old,

38
0:02:02.167,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that I wasn't going to accept being put into slots.

39
0:02:05.778,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But Daddy and Mama always had the sense that it was not us,

40
0:02:10.365,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it was the outside world,

41
0:02:11.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but you have the capacity to grow up to change it,

42
0:02:14.031,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I began to do that very early on.

43
0:02:15.926,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But most importantly, they were the best role models,

44
0:02:18.491,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because they said: if you see a need,

45
0:02:21.022,000 --> 0:02:22,000
don't ask why somebody doesn't do it.

46
0:02:22.895,000 --> 0:02:23,000
See what you can do.

47
0:02:24.293,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There was no home for the aged in our hometown.

48
0:02:26.756,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And Reverend Reddick, who had what we know now, 50 years later, as Alzheimer's,

49
0:02:31.071,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and he began to wander the streets.

50
0:02:32.807,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And so Daddy and Mama figured out he needed a place to go,

51
0:02:35.943,000 --> 0:02:36,000
so we started a home for the aged.

52
0:02:37.588,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Children had to cook and clean and serve.

53
0:02:39.951,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We didn't like it at the time,

54
0:02:41.737,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but that's how we learned that it was our obligation

55
0:02:44.619,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to take care of those who couldn't take care of themselves.

56
0:02:47.991,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I had 12 foster sisters and brothers.

57
0:02:52.062,000 --> 0:02:56,000
My mother took them in after we left home, and she took them in before we left home.

58
0:02:56.293,000 --> 0:03:,000
And again, whenever you see a need, you try to fulfill it.

59
0:03:00.404,000 --> 0:03:03,000
God runs, Daddy used to say, a full employment economy.

60
0:03:04.214,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:05.239,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And so if you just follow the need,

62
0:03:07.016,000 --> 0:03:11,000
you will never lack for something to do or a real purpose in life.

63
0:03:11.148,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And every issue that the Children's Defense Fund works on today

64
0:03:14.485,000 --> 0:03:18,000
comes out of my childhood in a very personal way.

65
0:03:18.799,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Little Johnny Harrington, who lived three doors down from me,

66
0:03:22.152,000 --> 0:03:24,000
stepped on a nail; he lived with his grandmother,

67
0:03:24.844,000 --> 0:03:27,000
got tetanus, went to the hospital, no tetanus shots, he died.

68
0:03:29.06,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He was 11 years old.

69
0:03:30.758,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I remember that.

70
0:03:31.997,000 --> 0:03:33,000
An accident in front of our highway,

71
0:03:34.394,000 --> 0:03:36,000
turns out to have been two white truck drivers

72
0:03:37.396,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and a migrant family that happened to be black.

73
0:03:40.593,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We all ran out to help.

74
0:03:42.254,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It was in the front of a church, and the ambulance came,

75
0:03:45.603,000 --> 0:03:48,000
saw that the white truck drivers were not injured,

76
0:03:48.939,000 --> 0:03:5,000
saw the black migrant workers were,

77
0:03:51.646,000 --> 0:03:53,000
turned around and left them.

78
0:03:53.737,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I never forgot that.

79
0:03:55.24,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And immunizations was one of the first things

80
0:03:57.473,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I worked on at the Children's Defense Fund

81
0:03:59.584,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to make sure that every child gets immunized against preventable diseases.

82
0:04:04.095,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Unequal schools ...

83
0:04:05.27,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Applause)

84
0:04:09.198,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Separate and unequal,

85
0:04:10.373,000 --> 0:04:11,000
hand-me-downs from the white schools.

86
0:04:12.18,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But we always had books in our house.

87
0:04:14.053,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Daddy was a great reader.

88
0:04:15.362,000 --> 0:04:17,000
He used to make me read every night with him.

89
0:04:17.566,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I'd have to sit for 15 or 20 minutes.

90
0:04:19.38,000 --> 0:04:21,000
One day I put a "True Confessions" inside a "Life Magazine"

91
0:04:22.278,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and he asked me to read it out loud.

92
0:04:24.961,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I never read a "True Confessions" again.

93
0:04:27.012,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:28.595,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But they were great readers.

95
0:04:30.032,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We always had books before we had a second pair of shoes,

96
0:04:32.738,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and that was very important.

97
0:04:34.191,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And although we had hand-me-down books for the black schools

98
0:04:37.044,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and hand-me-down everythings,

99
0:04:38.485,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it was a great need.

100
0:04:40.231,000 --> 0:04:43,000
He made it clear that reading was the window to the outside world,

101
0:04:43.652,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and so that was a great gift from them.

102
0:04:49.358,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But the reinforced lesson was that God runs a full employment economy,

103
0:04:55.453,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and that if you just follow the need,

104
0:04:57.413,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you will never lack for a purpose in life,

105
0:05:00.159,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and that has been so for me.

106
0:05:01.935,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We had a very segregated small town.

107
0:05:04.199,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I was a rebel from the time I was four or five.

108
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I went out to a department store

109
0:05:09.121,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and there was "white" and "black" water signs,

110
0:05:11.3,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but I didn't know that and didn't pay much attention to that,

111
0:05:14.247,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and I was with one of my Sunday school teachers.

112
0:05:16.546,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I drank out of the wrong water fountain,

113
0:05:18.494,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and she jerked me away, and I didn't know what had happened,

114
0:05:21.342,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and then she explained to me about black and white water.

115
0:05:24.106,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I didn't know that, and after that,

116
0:05:25.837,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I went home, took my little wounded psyche to my parents,

117
0:05:28.575,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and told them what had happened, and said, "What's wrong with me?"

118
0:05:31.773,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And they said, "It wasn't much wrong with you.

119
0:05:34.013,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's what's wrong with the system."

120
0:05:35.703,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I used to go then secretly and switch water signs

121
0:05:38.205,000 --> 0:05:39,000
everywhere I went.

122
0:05:39.308,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:40.333,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And it felt so good.

124
0:05:41.757,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Applause)

125
0:05:44.313,000 --> 0:05:5,000
PM: There is no question that this legend is a bit of a rebel,

126
0:05:50.511,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and has been for a long time.

127
0:05:52.503,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So you started your work as an attorney and with the Civil Rights Movement,

128
0:05:56.647,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and you worked with Dr. King on the original Poor People's Campaign.

129
0:06:01.027,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And then you made this decision, 45 years ago,

130
0:06:04.289,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to set up a national advocacy campaign for children.

131
0:06:08.345,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Why did you choose that particular service, to children?

132
0:06:13.108,000 --> 0:06:17,000
MWE: Well, because so many of the things that I saw in Mississippi

133
0:06:17.136,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and across the South

134
0:06:19.791,000 --> 0:06:2,000
had to do with children.

135
0:06:21.036,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I saw children with bloated bellies in this country

136
0:06:23.685,000 --> 0:06:24,000
who were close to starvation,

137
0:06:25.167,000 --> 0:06:26,000
who were hungry,

138
0:06:26.744,000 --> 0:06:28,000
who were without clothes,

139
0:06:29.41,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and nobody wanted to believe

140
0:06:30.838,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that there were children who were starving,

141
0:06:33.252,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and that's a slow process.

142
0:06:35.545,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And nobody wanted to listen.

143
0:06:37.313,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Every congressman that would come to Mississippi,

144
0:06:39.694,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I'd say, "Go see," and most of them didn't want to do anything about it.

145
0:06:43.1,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But I saw grinding poverty.

146
0:06:44.599,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The state of Mississippi wanted, during voter registration efforts --

147
0:06:47.854,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and with outside white kids coming in to help black citizens register to vote --

148
0:06:51.648,000 --> 0:06:54,000
they wanted everybody to leave the state, so they were trying to starve them out.

149
0:06:55.625,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And they switched from free food commodities

150
0:06:57.745,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to food stamps that cost two dollars.

151
0:06:59.728,000 --> 0:07:01,000
People had no income, and nobody in America wanted to believe

152
0:07:02.657,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that there was anybody in America without any income.

153
0:07:05.426,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Well, I knew hundreds of them, thousands of them.

154
0:07:07.743,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And malnutrition was becoming a big problem.

155
0:07:10.018,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And so one of these days came Dr. King down

156
0:07:13.369,000 --> 0:07:16,000
on a number of things we were fighting to get the Head Start program --

157
0:07:16.9,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which the state of Mississippi turned down --

158
0:07:19.098,000 --> 0:07:2,000
refinanced.

159
0:07:20.471,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And he went into a center

160
0:07:22.559,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that the poor community was running without any help,

161
0:07:25.615,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and he saw a teacher carve up an apple for eight or 10 children,

162
0:07:29.433,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and he had to run out, because he was in tears.

163
0:07:31.981,000 --> 0:07:32,000
He couldn't believe it.

164
0:07:33.211,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But only when Robert Kennedy decided he would come --

165
0:07:37.003,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I had gone to testify about the Head Start program,

166
0:07:39.426,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because they were attacking.

167
0:07:40.956,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I asked, please, come and see yourself,

168
0:07:42.988,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and when you come and see,

169
0:07:44.312,000 --> 0:07:46,000
see hungry people and see starving children.

170
0:07:46.8,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And they came, and he brought the press,

171
0:07:48.73,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and that began to get the movement going.

172
0:07:50.801,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But they wanted to push all the poor people to go north

173
0:07:54.104,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and to get away from being voters.

174
0:07:56.721,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And I'm proud of Mike Espy.

175
0:07:58.079,000 --> 0:08:,000
Even though he lost last night, he'll win one of these days.

176
0:08:00.914,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Applause)

177
0:08:04.236,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But you wouldn't have seen such grinding poverty,

178
0:08:08.577,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and the outside white kids who'd come in to help register voters

179
0:08:12.252,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in the 1964 Summer Project where we lost those three young men.

180
0:08:16.232,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But once they left, the press left,

181
0:08:20.266,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and there was just massive need,

182
0:08:21.941,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and people were trying to push the poor out.

183
0:08:24.195,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And so, you know, Head Start came,

184
0:08:26.702,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we applied for it, because the state turned it down.

185
0:08:29.893,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And that's true of a lot of states that don't take Medicaid these days.

186
0:08:33.437,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And we ran the largest Head Start program in the nation,

187
0:08:36.081,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and it changed their lives.

188
0:08:37.461,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They had books that had children who looked like them in it,

189
0:08:40.612,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and we were attacked all over the place.

190
0:08:42.542,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But the bottom line

191
0:08:43.746,000 --> 0:08:46,000
was that Mississippi gave birth to the Children's Defense Fund

192
0:08:47.017,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in many ways,

193
0:08:48.484,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and it also occurred to me that children

194
0:08:52.263,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and preventive investment,

195
0:08:54.401,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and avoiding costly care

196
0:08:56.578,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and failure and neglect,

197
0:08:59.099,000 --> 0:09:01,000
was a more strategic way to proceed.

198
0:09:02.083,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And so the Children's Defense Fund

199
0:09:04.232,000 --> 0:09:07,000
was born out of the Poor People's Campaign.

200
0:09:07.564,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But it was pretty clear that whatever you called

201
0:09:09.914,000 --> 0:09:1,000
black independent or brown independent

202
0:09:11.804,000 --> 0:09:13,000
was going to have a shrinking constituency.

203
0:09:13.857,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And who can be mad at a two-month-old baby or at a two-year-old toddler?

204
0:09:18.212,000 --> 0:09:19,000
A lot of people can be.

205
0:09:19.935,000 --> 0:09:21,000
They don't want to feed them, neither, from what we've seen.

206
0:09:22.769,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But it was the right judgment to make.

207
0:09:24.714,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And so out of the privilege of serving

208
0:09:26.563,000 --> 0:09:29,000
as the Poor People's Campaign coordinator for policy

209
0:09:29.889,000 --> 0:09:31,000
for two years, and there were two of them,

210
0:09:31.914,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and it was not a failure,

211
0:09:33.225,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because the seeds of change get planted

212
0:09:36.343,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and have to have people who are scut workers and follow up.

213
0:09:39.434,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I'm a good scut worker and a persistent person.

214
0:09:43.184,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And you know, as a result,

215
0:09:44.515,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I would say that all those people on food stamps today

216
0:09:47.136,000 --> 0:09:5,000
ought to thank those poor people in the mud in Resurrection City.

217
0:09:50.217,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But it takes a lot of follow-up, detailed work -- and never going away.

218
0:09:54.5,000 --> 0:09:56,000
PM: And you've been doing it for 45 years,

219
0:09:56.882,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and you've seen some amazing outcomes.

220
0:10:00.404,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What are you proudest of out of the Children's Defense Fund?

221
0:10:05.976,000 --> 0:10:08,000
MWE: Well, I think the children now have sort of become a mainstream issue.

222
0:10:09.912,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We have got lots of new laws.

223
0:10:14.592,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Millions of children are getting food.

224
0:10:17.399,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Millions of children are getting a head start.

225
0:10:19.768,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Millions of children are getting Head Start

226
0:10:22.284,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and have gotten a head start,

227
0:10:24.372,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and the Child Health Insurance Program, CHIP,

228
0:10:28.05,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Medicaid expansions for children.

229
0:10:30.316,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We've been trying to reform the child welfare system for decades.

230
0:10:33.466,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We finally got a big breakthrough this year,

231
0:10:36.079,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and it says, be ready with the proposals when somebody's ready to move,

232
0:10:39.437,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and sometimes it takes five years, 10 years, 20 years, but you're there.

233
0:10:43.172,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I've been trying to keep children out of foster care and out of institutions

234
0:10:46.847,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and with their families, with preventive services.

235
0:10:49.252,000 --> 0:10:5,000
That got passed.

236
0:10:50.427,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But there are millions of children who have hope,

237
0:10:52.823,000 --> 0:10:53,000
who have access to early childhood.

238
0:10:54.557,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now, we are not finished,

239
0:10:55.943,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and we are not going to ever feel finished

240
0:10:57.967,000 --> 0:11:,000
until we end child poverty in the richest nation on earth.

241
0:11:01.91,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's just ridiculous that we have to be demanding that.

242
0:11:05.153,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause)

243
0:11:10.41,000 --> 0:11:14,000
PM: And there are so many of the problems in spite of the successes,

244
0:11:14.696,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and thank you for going through some of them, Marian --

245
0:11:18.295,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the Freedom Schools,

246
0:11:19.903,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the generations of children now

247
0:11:22.102,000 --> 0:11:25,000
who have gone through Children's Defense Fund programs.

248
0:11:25.827,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But when you look around the world,

249
0:11:27.597,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in this country, the United States, and in other countries,

250
0:11:31.746,000 --> 0:11:32,000
there are still so many problems.

251
0:11:33.526,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What worries you the most?

252
0:11:37.031,000 --> 0:11:41,000
MWE: What worries me is how irresponsible we adults in power have been

253
0:11:41.173,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in passing on a healthier earth.

254
0:11:44.511,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And it worries me when I read the "Bulletin of Atomic Scientists"

255
0:11:47.916,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and see now that we are two minutes from midnight,

256
0:11:51.371,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and that's gotten closer.

257
0:11:52.623,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We have put our future

258
0:11:55.52,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and our children's future and safety at risk

259
0:11:59.433,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in a world that is still too much governed by violence.

260
0:12:03.077,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We must end that.

261
0:12:04.673,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We must stop investing in war and start investing in the young and in peace,

262
0:12:09.524,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and we are really so far away from doing that.

263
0:12:11.967,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

264
0:12:13.063,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And I don't want my grandchildren

265
0:12:17.42,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to have to fight these battles all over again,

266
0:12:19.661,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and so I get more radical.

267
0:12:21.246,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The older I get, the more radical I get,

268
0:12:23.852,000 --> 0:12:26,000
because there are just some things that we as adults have to do

269
0:12:27.069,000 --> 0:12:28,000
for the next generations.

270
0:12:28.359,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And I looked at the sacrifices of Mrs. Hamer

271
0:12:30.469,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and all those people in Mississippi

272
0:12:32.408,000 --> 0:12:34,000
who risked their lives to give us a better life.

273
0:12:35.167,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But the United States has got to come to grips

274
0:12:37.343,000 --> 0:12:39,000
with its failure to invest in its children,

275
0:12:40.011,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and it's the Achilles' heel of this nation.

276
0:12:43.248,000 --> 0:12:46,000
How can you be one of the biggest economies in the world

277
0:12:46.273,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and you let 13.2 million children go live in poverty,

278
0:12:51.025,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and you let children go homeless

279
0:12:53.303,000 --> 0:12:54,000
when you've got the means to do it?

280
0:12:55.074,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We've got to rethink who we are as a people,

281
0:12:58.556,000 --> 0:12:59,000
be an example for the world.

282
0:12:59.999,000 --> 0:13:,000
There should be no poverty.

283
0:13:01.443,000 --> 0:13:04,000
In fact, we want to say we're going to end poverty in the world.

284
0:13:04.536,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Just start at home.

285
0:13:05.711,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And we've made real progress,

286
0:13:07.288,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but it's such hard work,

287
0:13:09.36,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and it's going to be our Achilles' heel.

288
0:13:11.35,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We should stop giving more tax cuts,

289
0:13:14.28,000 --> 0:13:16,000
sorry folks, to billionaires rather than to babies

290
0:13:16.711,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and their health care.

291
0:13:18.059,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We should get our priorities straight.

292
0:13:20.257,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Applause)

293
0:13:21.282,000 --> 0:13:23,000
That's not right, and it's not cost-effective.

294
0:13:24.035,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And the key to this country is going to be an educated child population,

295
0:13:28.091,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and yet we've got so many children

296
0:13:29.782,000 --> 0:13:31,000
who cannot read or write at the most basic levels.

297
0:13:32.15,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We're investing in the wrong things,

298
0:13:34.114,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and I wouldn't be upset about anybody having one billion,

299
0:13:37.494,000 --> 0:13:38,000
10 billion [US dollars],

300
0:13:38.669,000 --> 0:13:4,000
if there were no hungry children,

301
0:13:40.93,000 --> 0:13:42,000
if there were no homeless children,

302
0:13:42.982,000 --> 0:13:44,000
if there were no uneducated children.

303
0:13:45.265,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And so it's really about what does it mean to live

304
0:13:47.663,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and lead this life.

305
0:13:49.988,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Why were we put on this earth?

306
0:13:51.449,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We were put on this earth to make things better

307
0:13:54.353,000 --> 0:13:55,000
for the next generations.

308
0:13:55.592,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And here we're worrying about climate change

309
0:13:58.071,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and global warming.

310
0:13:59.601,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And we're looking at, again, I constantly cite --

311
0:14:02.541,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I look at that "Bulletin of Atomic Scientists" every year.

312
0:14:05.49,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And it says now: "Two minutes to midnight."

313
0:14:07.567,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Are we out of our minds, adults,

314
0:14:09.165,000 --> 0:14:13,000
about passing on a better a world to our children?

315
0:14:13.241,000 --> 0:14:16,000
That's what our purpose is, to leave a better world for everybody,

316
0:14:16.361,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and the concept of enough for everybody.

317
0:14:19.438,000 --> 0:14:21,000
There should be no hungry children in this world

318
0:14:21.723,000 --> 0:14:22,000
with the rich wealth that we have.

319
0:14:23.383,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And so I can't think of a bigger cause,

320
0:14:25.665,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and I think that I'm driven by my faith.

321
0:14:28.8,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And it's been a privilege to serve,

322
0:14:30.848,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but I always had the best role models in the world.

323
0:14:33.855,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Daddy always said God runs a full employment economy,

324
0:14:37.534,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and that if you just follow the need,

325
0:14:39.911,000 --> 0:14:4,000
you'll never lack for a purpose in life.

326
0:14:41.841,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And I watched the partnership -- because my mother was a true partner.

327
0:14:45.176,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I always knew I was as smart as my brothers, at least.

328
0:14:48.158,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And we always knew that we were not just to be about ourselves,

329
0:14:52.826,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but that we were here to serve.

330
0:14:54.793,000 --> 0:14:57,000
PM: Well, Marian, I want to say, on behalf of all the world's children,

331
0:14:58.23,000 --> 0:15:,000
thank you for your passion,

332
0:15:00.525,000 --> 0:15:02,000
your purpose and your advocacy.

333
0:15:02.62,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Applause)

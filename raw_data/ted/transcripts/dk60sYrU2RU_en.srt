1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I started in the context

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of developing countries,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So if you think of a map of your country,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I think you'll realize

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that for every country on Earth,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you could draw little circles to say,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"These are places where good teachers won't go."

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
On top of that,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
those are the places from where trouble comes.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So we have an ironic problem --

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
good teachers don't want to go

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to just those places where they're needed the most.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I started in 1999

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to try and address this problem with an experiment,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I basically embedded a computer

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English --

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
they'd never seen a computer before,

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and they didn't know what the internet was.

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground --

25
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
turned it on and left it there.

26
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
After this,

27
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.

28
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But I repeated this all over India

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and then through

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a large part of the world

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and noticed

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that children will learn to do

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
what they want to learn to do.

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
This is the first experiment that we did --

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
eight year-old boy on your right

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
teaching his student, a six year-old girl,

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and he was teaching her how to browse.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This boy here in the middle of central India --

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
this is in a Rajasthan village,

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
where the children recorded their own music

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and then played it back to each other

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and in the process,

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They did all of this in four hours

45
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
after seeing the computer for the first time.

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
In another South Indian village,

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
these boys here

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
had assembled a video camera

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.

50
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They downloaded it from Disney.com,

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or one of these websites,

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
14 days after putting the computer in their village.

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So at the end of it,

54
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we concluded that groups of children

55
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
can learn to use computers and the internet on their own,

56
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
irrespective of who

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or where they were.

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
At that point, I became a little more ambitious

59
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and decided to see

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
what else could children do with a computer.

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
where I gave a group of children --

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.

64
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I gave them a computer

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with a speech-to-text interface,

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which you now get free with Windows,

67
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and asked them to speak into it.

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So when they spoke into it,

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the computer typed out gibberish,

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."

71
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Make yourself understood

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to the computer."

74
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So the children said, "How do we do that."

75
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I said,

76
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"I don't know, actually."

77
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And I left.

79
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Two months later --

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and this is now documented

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in the Information Technology

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
for International Development journal --

84
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that accents had changed

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent

86
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.

88
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So they could do that on their own.

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
After that, I started to experiment

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
with various other things

92
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that they might learn to do on their own.

93
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,

94
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
from the late Arthur C. Clarke,

95
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
who said, "I want to see what's going on."

96
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.

97
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
He said two interesting things,

98
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The second thing he said was that,

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"If children have interest,

102
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
then education happens."

103
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And I was doing that in the field,

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so every time I would watch it and think of him.

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely

106
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
help people,

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because children quickly learn to navigate

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the web and find things which interest them.

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And when you've got interest, then you have education.

110
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is a 15 year-old boy.

112
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games

113
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
like animals,

114
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I listen to music.

115
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."

117
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This is in Cambodia,

118
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
rural Cambodia --

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
a fairly silly arithmetic game,

120
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.

121
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They would, you know, throw it back at you.

122
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They'd say, "This is very boring."

123
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If you leave it on the pavement

124
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and if all the adults go away,

125
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
then they will show off with each other

126
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
about what they can do.

127
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This is what these children are doing.

128
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They are trying to multiply, I think.

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And all over India,

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
at the end of about two years,

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
children were beginning to Google their homework.

132
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
As a result, the teachers reported

133
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
tremendous improvements in their English --

134
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

135
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
rapid improvement and all sorts of things.

136
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And indeed they had.

139
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I mean, if there's stuff on Google,

140
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
why would you need to stuff it into your head?

141
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So at the end of the next four years,

142
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet

143
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to achieve educational objectives on their own.

144
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
At that time, a large amount of money

145
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
had come into Newcastle University

146
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to improve schooling in India.

147
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi."

148
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle

149
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
a million pounds-worth of University money

150
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
sitting in Delhi."

151
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So in 2006,

152
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I bought myself a heavy overcoat

153
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and moved to Newcastle.

154
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I wanted to test the limits

155
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of the system.

156
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
was actually done in India.

158
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And I set myself and impossible target:

159
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
can Tamil speaking

160
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
12-year-old children

161
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in a South Indian village

162
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
teach themselves biotechnology

163
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
in English on their own?

164
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero --

165
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them --

166
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
they get another zero,

167
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."

168
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I called in 26 children.

169
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They all came in there, and I told them

170
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.

171
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.

172
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's all in English, and I'm going.

173
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So I left them with it.

175
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I came back after two months,

176
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.

177
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"

178
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They said, "Yes, we did."

179
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."

180
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So I said,

181
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"Well, how long did you practice on it

182
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
before you decided you understood nothing?"

183
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They said, "We look at it every day."

184
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"

185
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,

186
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
literally,

187
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule

188
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
causes genetic disease,

189
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we've understood nothing else."

190
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Applause)

192
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

193
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It took me three years to publish that.

194
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.

195
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
One of the referees who refereed the paper said,

196
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"It's too good to be true,"

197
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
which was not very nice.

198
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Well, one of the girls had taught herself

199
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to become the teacher.

200
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And then that's her over there.

201
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Remember, they don't study English.

202
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"

203
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and she says, "The neuron? The neuron,"

204
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and then she looked and did this.

205
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.

206
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,

207
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.

208
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But 30 percent is not a pass.

209
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So I found that they had a friend,

210
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
a local accountant, a young girl,

211
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and they played football with her.

212
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I asked that girl, "Would you teach them

213
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
enough biotechnology to pass?"

214
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject."

215
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."

216
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
She said, "What's that?"

217
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I said, "Well, what you've got to do

218
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is stand behind them

219
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and admire them all the time.

220
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.

221
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'"

222
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
She did that for two months.

223
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The scores went up to 50,

224
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
which is what the posh schools of New Delhi,

225
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.

226
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
So I came back to Newcastle

227
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
with these results

228
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and decided

229
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that there was something happening here

230
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that definitely was getting very serious.

231
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,

232
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I came to the most remote place that I could think of.

233
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter)

234
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi

235
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
is the little town of Gateshead.

236
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
In Gateshead, I took 32 children

237
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and I started to fine-tune the method.

238
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I made them into groups of four.

239
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I said, "You make your own groups of four.

240
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers."

241
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.

242
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"You can exchange groups.

243
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You can walk across to another group,

244
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
if you don't like your group, etc.

245
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,

246
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
come back to you own group and claim it as your own work."

247
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And I explained to them

248
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.

249
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

250
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Applause)

251
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The children enthusiastically got after me and said,

252
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"Now, what do you want us to do?"

253
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I gave them six GCSE questions.

254
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The first group -- the best one --

255
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
solved everything in 20 minutes.

256
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The worst, in 45.

257
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They used everything that they knew --

258
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
news groups, Google, Wikipedia,

259
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Ask Jeeves, etc.

260
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"

261
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I said, "Well, let's try it.

262
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I'll come back after two months.

263
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We'll give them a paper test --

264
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
no computers, no talking to each other, etc."

265
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups

266
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
was 76 percent.

267
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
When I did the experiment, when I did the test,

268
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
after two months, the score

269
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
was 76 percent.

270
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
There was photographic recall

271
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
inside the children,

272
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I suspect because they're discussing with each other.

273
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
A single child in front of a single computer

274
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
will not do that.

275
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I have further results,

276
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
which are almost unbelievable,

277
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
of scores which go up with time.

278
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Because their teachers say

279
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that after the session is over,

280
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the children continue to Google further.

281
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Here in Britain, I put out a call

282
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
for British grandmothers,

283
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
after my Kuppam experiment.

284
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Well, you know,

285
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.

286
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
200 of them volunteered immediately.

287
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

288
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The deal was that they would give me

289
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
one hour of broadband time,

290
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
sitting in their homes,

291
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
one day in a week.

292
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So they did that,

293
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and over the last two years,

294
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
over 600 hours of instruction

295
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
has happened over Skype,

296
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
using what my students call the granny cloud.

297
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The granny cloud sits over there.

298
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I can beam them to whichever school I want to.

299
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.

300
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
You say it.

301
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You can't catch me.

302
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Children: You can't catch me.

303
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man.

304
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Children: I'm the gingerbread man.

305
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Teacher: Well done. Very good ...

306
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
SM: Back at Gateshead,

307
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism

308
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
in 15 minutes.

309
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.

310
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Two children watch a TEDTalk.

311
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
They wanted to be footballers before.

312
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
After watching eight TEDTalks,

313
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.

314
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
(Laughter)

315
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

316
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's pretty simple stuff.

317
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
This is what I'm building now --

318
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.

319
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
The furniture is designed

320
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,

321
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
big broadband connections, but in groups.

322
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
If they want, they can call the granny cloud.

323
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
This is a SOLE in Newcastle.

324
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
The mediator is from Pune, India.

325
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.

326
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I went to Turin in May.

327
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.

328
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I speak only English, they speak only Italian,

329
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
so we had no way to communicate.

330
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I started writing English questions on the blackboard.

331
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The children looked at it and said, "What?"

332
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I said, "Well, do it."

333
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,

334
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
went back into Italian Google.

335
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Fifteen minutes later --

336
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
next question: where is Calcutta?

337
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
This one, they took only 10 minutes.

338
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I tried a really hard one then.

339
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?

340
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
There was silence for a while,

341
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.

342
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
It's Pitagora."

343
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And then,

344
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
in 20 minutes,

345
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.

346
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
This sent shivers up my spine.

347
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
These are 10 year-olds.

348
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?

349
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Laughter)

350
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Applause)

351
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
SM: So you know what's happened?

352
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I think we've just stumbled across

353
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
a self-organizing system.

354
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
A self-organizing system is one

355
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
where a structure appears

356
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
without explicit intervention from the outside.

357
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence,

358
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
which is that the system starts to do things,

359
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
which it was never designed for.

360
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Which is why you react the way you do,

361
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
because it looks impossible.

362
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I think I can make a guess now --

363
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
education is self-organizing system,

364
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
where learning is an emergent phenomenon.

365
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,

366
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
but I'm going to try.

367
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.

368
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
One billion children, we need 100 million mediators --

369
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
there are many more than that on the planet --

370
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
10 million SOLEs,

371
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
180 billion dollars and 10 years.

372
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
We could change everything.

373
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Thanks.

374
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Applause)

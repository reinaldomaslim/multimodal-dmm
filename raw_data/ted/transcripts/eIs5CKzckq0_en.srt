1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:13,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and we're not going to show you any of it.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The truth of the matter is that the Titanic --

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records --

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
it's not the most exciting story from the sea.

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Most of the planet is ocean water.

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The average depth is about two miles.

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or we see images like this of the ocean,

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but you have no idea for what lies in there.

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Most of the animals are in the oceans.

21
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,

22
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
at the bottom of the sea.

23
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,

24
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
than it is in the rainforests.

25
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this

26
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.

27
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think

28
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.

29
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We have to have a very special technology

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to get into that unfamiliar world.

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,

32
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.

33
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery

34
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."

35
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,

36
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
not only on what exists --

37
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea --

38
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but also how we think about life on the planet itself.

39
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Here's a jelly.

40
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.

41
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.

42
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It gets up to about 150 feet long.

43
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
But see all those different working things?

44
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I love that kind of stuff.

45
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.

46
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.

47
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's a colonial animal.

48
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
These are all individual animals

49
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
banding together to make this one creature.

50
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And it's got these jet thrusters up in front

51
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.

52
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,

53
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals

54
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
on the other side, those guys win hands down.

55
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.

56
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Here's the X-wing death jelly.

57
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates

59
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and attracting prey and communicating.

60
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.

61
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They come in all different sizes and shapes.

62
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Bill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep

63
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals

64
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar

65
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.

66
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And these are the types of animals

67
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that live in that three-dimensional space,

68
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.

69
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You hear about giant squid and things like that,

70
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.

71
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They're very little understood.

72
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
DG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.

73
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You can actually see through his head.

74
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.

75
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.

76
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.

77
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They come right up to the submarine --

78
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.

79
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is really a world within a world,

80
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and we're going to show you two.

81
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.

82
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is kind of like an undersea rooster.

83
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.

84
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And then one of my favorites. What a face!

85
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.

86
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.

87
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,

88
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,

89
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in the world where they belong.

90
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
They don't catch them in a net.

91
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They're actually looking at them down in that world.

92
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We're going to take a joystick,

93
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
sit in front of our computer, on the Earth,

94
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.

95
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge,

96
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
a 40,000-mile long mountain range.

97
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.

98
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there --

99
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,

100
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.

101
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,

102
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and this is one of those mountain ranges.

103
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We're coming around a cliff here on the right.

104
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The height of these mountains on either side of this valley

105
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is greater than the Alps in most cases.

106
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.

107
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is a volcanic ridge.

108
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We're getting down further and further in scale.

109
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And eventually, we can come up with something like this.

110
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.

111
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And you can sit in a room like this,

112
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that

113
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
around the bottom of the ocean in real time.

114
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners

115
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is to bring this virtual world --

116
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.

117
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.

118
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video,

119
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,

120
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.

121
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine.

122
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is what's called a hydrothermal vent.

123
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,

124
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
hydrogen-sulfide-rich water

125
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.

126
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.

127
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So that's all water under the sea --

128
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.

129
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.

130
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And then we had some hint that these things existed

131
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,

132
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,

133
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.

134
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.

135
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.

136
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This is one of these hydrothermal vents.

137
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.

138
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,

139
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so the setting here is very dramatic.

140
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
BL: The white material is a type of bacteria

141
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that thrives at 180 degrees C.

142
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now

143
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,

144
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor

145
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
after a volcanic eruption is bacteria.

146
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And we started to wonder for a long time,

147
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
how did it all get down there?

148
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.

149
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Not only is it coming out of the Earth --

150
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity --

151
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but that bacteria supports these colonies of life.

152
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.

153
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles --

154
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
no sun has ever gotten down here.

155
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
All the energy to support these life forms

156
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.

157
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And you can see how dense the population is.

158
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
These are called tube worms.

159
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
BL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.

160
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But they have two types of gill structures.

161
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,

162
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,

163
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which takes the hydrothermal fluid --

164
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom --

165
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.

166
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
DG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.

167
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms.

168
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.

169
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Oh! Good going.

170
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So, as soon as a crab touches them,

171
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.

172
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
There's a whole story being played out here

173
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that we're just now beginning to have some idea of

174
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because of this new camera technology.

175
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
BL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.

176
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Their foot is at about 200 degrees C

177
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and their head is out at three degrees C,

178
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.

179
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's how they like to live.

180
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
DG: This is a female of this kind of worm.

182
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And here's a male.

183
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here --

184
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight.

185
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.

186
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.

187
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Here they go.

188
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
On one of the last dive series,

189
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
we counted 200 species in these areas --

190
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
198 were new, new species.

191
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
BL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists

192
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.

193
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And they disintegrate on the way up,

194
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
so the imagery is critical for the science.

195
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
DG: Two octopods at about two miles depth.

196
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This pressure thing really amazes me --

197
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that these animals can exist there at a depth

198
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.

199
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
What we saw up till now was from the Pacific.

200
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.

201
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here,

202
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!

203
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

204
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And the same thing's going on over here.

205
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab --

206
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria

207
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that lives on the backs of all these animals.

208
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And what these shrimp are trying to do

209
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.

210
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
And the crabs don't like it at all.

211
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab

212
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
are actually created by the product of that bacteria.

213
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.

214
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
On the back, you see this again.

215
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin

216
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.

217
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Those are all shrimp.

218
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.

219
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They're clinging to a rock face

220
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.

221
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.

222
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Those pillars get up to several stories.

223
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape

224
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,

225
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
inhabited by these very strange animals

226
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.

227
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They don't need the sun at all.

228
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
BL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp?

229
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's actually a light-sensing organ.

230
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.

231
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature --

232
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.

233
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range

234
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today,

235
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.

236
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
This is the first time we've ever tried this any place.

237
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.

238
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We're moving up one of these pillars.

239
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This one's several stories tall.

240
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.

241
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.

242
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So all of these are individual homes for worms.

243
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now here's a closer view of that community.

244
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Here's crabs here, worms here.

245
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
There are smaller animals crawling around.

246
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Here's pagoda structures.

247
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I think this is the neatest-looking thing.

248
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I just can't get over this --

249
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.

250
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.

251
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean,

252
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and it's coming out all from it.

253
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

254
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid,

255
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.

256
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here.

257
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
That's probably where we evolved from.

258
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
BL: This bacteria that we've been talking about

259
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
turns out to be the most simplest form of life found.

260
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There are a number of groups that are proposing

261
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that life evolved at these vent sites.

262
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Although the vent sites are short-lived --

263
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
an individual site may last only 10 years or so --

264
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years.

265
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.

266
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
There's a fish sitting here.

267
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm,

268
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
waiting for that worm to stick his head out.

269
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Laughter)

270
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
BL: The biologists right now cannot explain

271
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
why these animals are so active.

272
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The worms are growing inches per week!

273
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
DG: I already said that this site,

274
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
from a human perspective, is toxic as hell.

275
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Not only that, but on top -- the lifeblood --

276
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that plumbing system turns off every year or so.

277
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.

278
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And then there's earthquakes,

279
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years,

280
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that completely wipes the area out.

281
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.

282
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again,

283
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.

284
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Is it sensitive? Yes.

285
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.

286
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I'll end up with saying one thing.

287
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea,

288
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.

289
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's an incredible story.

290
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
What we see when we look back in time,

291
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.

292
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms.

293
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The continents move apart. They come back together.

294
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.

295
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.

296
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.

297
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It's just like music -- it really is just like music.

298
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And what we're learning now is that

299
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say,

300
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today."

301
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's absurd. It's just absurd.

302
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going

303
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
at all these different scales and work with it.

304
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Learn to manage it.

305
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The concept of preservation is futile.

306
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000

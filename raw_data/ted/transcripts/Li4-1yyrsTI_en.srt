1
0:00:13.261,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want you to imagine

2
0:00:14.753,000 --> 0:00:15,000
what a breakthrough this was

3
0:00:16.708,000 --> 0:00:18,000
for women who were victims of violence

4
0:00:19.136,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the 1980s.

5
0:00:21.092,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They would come into the emergency room

6
0:00:24.605,000 --> 0:00:27,000
with what the police would call "a lovers' quarrel,"

7
0:00:28.017,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I would see a woman who was beaten,

8
0:00:31.792,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist

9
0:00:36.534,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and swollen eyes.

10
0:00:38.295,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera,

11
0:00:42.333,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we would take her picture,

12
0:00:44.89,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we would wait 90 seconds,

13
0:00:47.042,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and we would give her the photograph.

14
0:00:50.169,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And she would then have

15
0:00:52.063,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the evidence she needed to go to court.

16
0:00:55.29,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We were making what was invisible visible.

17
0:00:59.724,000 --> 0:01:,000
I've been doing this for 30 years.

18
0:01:01.695,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I've been part of a social movement

19
0:01:03.858,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that has been working on ending

20
0:01:05.821,000 --> 0:01:09,000
violence against women and children.

21
0:01:09.928,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And for all those years,

22
0:01:12.817,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I've had an absolutely passionate

23
0:01:17.549,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and sometimes not popular belief

24
0:01:20.496,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that this violence is not inevitable,

25
0:01:23.79,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that it is learned, and if it's learned,

26
0:01:26.795,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it can be un-learned, and it can be prevented.

27
0:01:30.86,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:38.045,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Why do I believe this?

29
0:01:40.008,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Because it's true.

30
0:01:42.221,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It is absolutely true.

31
0:01:44.458,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Between 1993 and 2010,

32
0:01:50.014,000 --> 0:01:53,000
domestic violence among adult women

33
0:01:53.347,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in the United States

34
0:01:54.699,000 --> 0:01:57,000
has gone down by 64 percent,

35
0:01:58.086,000 --> 0:02:,000
and that is great news.

36
0:02:00.763,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Applause)

37
0:02:03.512,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Sixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there?

38
0:02:06.615,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Our eyes were wide open.

39
0:02:08.41,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Thirty years ago, women were beaten,

40
0:02:10.83,000 --> 0:02:12,000
they were stalked, they were raped,

41
0:02:12.965,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and no one talked about it.

42
0:02:15.506,000 --> 0:02:16,000
There was no justice.

43
0:02:17.289,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And as an activist, that was not good enough.

44
0:02:21.913,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And so step one on this journey

45
0:02:24.384,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is we organized,

46
0:02:26.381,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and we created this extraordinary

47
0:02:29.015,000 --> 0:02:31,000
underground network of amazing women

48
0:02:32.007,000 --> 0:02:33,000
who opened shelters,

49
0:02:33.874,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and if they didn't open a shelter,

50
0:02:35.993,000 --> 0:02:36,000
they opened their home

51
0:02:37.585,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so that women and children could be safe.

52
0:02:40.619,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And you know what else we did?

53
0:02:42.299,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We had bake sales, we had car washes,

54
0:02:45.764,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and we did everything we could do to fundraise,

55
0:02:48.298,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and then at one point we said,

56
0:02:50.275,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you know, it's time that we went

57
0:02:52.416,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to the federal government

58
0:02:54.07,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and asked them to pay for these

59
0:02:56.041,000 --> 0:03:,000
extraordinary services that are saving people's lives.

60
0:03:00.056,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Right? (Applause)

61
0:03:02.517,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And so, step number two,

62
0:03:05.591,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we knew we needed to change the laws.

63
0:03:07.936,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so we went to Washington,

64
0:03:10.223,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation.

65
0:03:15.093,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I remember walking through the halls

66
0:03:17.854,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of the U.S. Capitol,

67
0:03:20.264,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose,

68
0:03:24.622,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and I couldn't imagine

69
0:03:26.728,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that anybody would ever challenge

70
0:03:28.855,000 --> 0:03:3,000
this important piece of legislation.

71
0:03:30.966,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I was probably 30 and naive.

72
0:03:33.902,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But I heard about a congressman

73
0:03:35.984,000 --> 0:03:37,000
who had a very, very different point of view.

74
0:03:38.301,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Do you know what he called

75
0:03:40.1,000 --> 0:03:42,000
this important piece of legislation?

76
0:03:42.851,000 --> 0:03:45,000
He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.

77
0:03:46.338,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.

78
0:03:48.517,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Ladies and gentlemen, that was in 1984

79
0:03:50.98,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in the United States, and I wish I had Twitter.

80
0:03:54.056,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:57.243,000 --> 0:04:,000
Ten years later, after lots of hard work,

82
0:04:00.655,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act,

83
0:04:03.732,000 --> 0:04:05,000
which is a life-changing act

84
0:04:05.988,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that has saved so many lives. (Applause)

85
0:04:08.842,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Thank you.

86
0:04:10.272,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I was proud to be part of that work,

87
0:04:13.163,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and it changed the laws

88
0:04:15.613,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and it put millions of dollars into local communities.

89
0:04:18.464,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And you know what else it did? It collected data.

90
0:04:20.791,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data.

91
0:04:23.474,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In fact, I am a data nerd.

92
0:04:26.056,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.

93
0:04:28.084,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I am a data nerd,

94
0:04:29.429,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the reason for that is I want to make sure

95
0:04:32.064,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that if we spend a dollar, that the program works,

96
0:04:35.51,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.

97
0:04:39.974,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I also want to say one other thing:

98
0:04:43.573,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We are not going to solve this problem

99
0:04:45.788,000 --> 0:04:47,000
by building more jails

100
0:04:48.641,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or by even building more shelters.

101
0:04:50.938,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It is about economic empowerment for women,

102
0:04:54.131,000 --> 0:04:56,000
it is about healing kids who are hurt,

103
0:04:56.876,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and it is about prevention with a capital P.

104
0:05:00.336,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And so, step number three on this journey:

105
0:05:04.73,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We know, if we're going to keep making this progress,

106
0:05:07.682,000 --> 0:05:09,000
we're going to have to turn up the volume,

107
0:05:09.983,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we're going to have to increase the visibility,

108
0:05:12.195,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and we're going to have to engage the public.

109
0:05:15.107,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And so knowing that, we went to the Advertising Council,

110
0:05:18.517,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and we asked them to help us

111
0:05:20.838,000 --> 0:05:22,000
build a public education campaign.

112
0:05:23.428,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And we looked around the world to Canada

113
0:05:25.884,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa,

114
0:05:28.526,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and we took this knowledge

115
0:05:30.288,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and we built the first national

116
0:05:32.781,000 --> 0:05:34,000
public education campaign

117
0:05:34.872,000 --> 0:05:36,000
called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence.

118
0:05:37.442,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Take a look at one of our spots.

119
0:05:39.641,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Video) Man: Where's dinner?

120
0:05:41.502,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Woman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so—

121
0:05:45.014,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Man: What is this? Pizza. Woman: If you had just called me, I would have known—

122
0:05:48.058,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Man: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza? Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud.

123
0:05:51.231,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Please don't—Let go of me!

124
0:05:53.136,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Man: Get in the kitchen! Woman: No! Help!

125
0:05:56.03,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Man: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman)

126
0:05:58.385,000 --> 0:06:01,000
That's what hurts! That's what hurts! (Breaking glass)

127
0:06:01.803,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Woman: Help me!

128
0:06:04.044,000 --> 0:06:07,000
["Children have to sit by and watch. What's your excuse?"]

129
0:06:07.463,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Esta Soler: As we were in the process

130
0:06:09.482,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of releasing this campaign,

131
0:06:11.144,000 --> 0:06:13,000
O.J. Simpson was arrested

132
0:06:13.327,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for the murder of his wife and her friend.

133
0:06:17.461,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We learned that he had a long history

134
0:06:19.564,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of domestic violence.

135
0:06:20.937,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The media became fixated.

136
0:06:23.463,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The story of domestic violence

137
0:06:25.482,000 --> 0:06:26,000
went from the back page,

138
0:06:26.836,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but actually from the no-page, to the front page.

139
0:06:29.642,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Our ads blanketed the airwaves,

140
0:06:32.596,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and women, for the first time,

141
0:06:34.946,000 --> 0:06:36,000
started to tell their stories.

142
0:06:37.067,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Movements are about moments,

143
0:06:40.42,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and we seized this moment.

144
0:06:43.014,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And let me just put this in context.

145
0:06:45.353,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Before 1980, do you have any idea

146
0:06:48.489,000 --> 0:06:51,000
how many articles were in The New York Times

147
0:06:51.774,000 --> 0:06:54,000
on domestic violence?

148
0:06:54.787,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'll tell you: 158.

149
0:06:58.451,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And in the 2000s, over 7,000.

150
0:07:02.962,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We were obviously making a difference.

151
0:07:05.997,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But we were still missing a critical element.

152
0:07:08.743,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So, step four: We needed to engage men.

153
0:07:14.258,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We couldn't solve this problem

154
0:07:16.201,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines.

155
0:07:19.318,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I already told you I'm a data nerd.

156
0:07:21.538,000 --> 0:07:24,000
National polling told us that men felt indicted

157
0:07:25.161,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and not invited into this conversation.

158
0:07:27.66,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So we wondered, how can we include men?

159
0:07:31.376,000 --> 0:07:33,000
How can we get men to talk about

160
0:07:33.495,000 --> 0:07:35,000
violence against women and girls?

161
0:07:36.239,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And a male friend of mine pulled me aside

162
0:07:38.893,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and he said, "You want men to talk about violence

163
0:07:42.269,000 --> 0:07:44,000
against women and girls. Men don't talk."

164
0:07:45.186,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:46.902,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I apologize to the men in the audience.

166
0:07:49.178,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I know you do.

167
0:07:50.652,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But he said, "Do you know what they do do?

168
0:07:52.706,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They do talk to their kids.

169
0:07:54.385,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They talk to their kids as parents, as coaches."

170
0:07:57.902,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And that's what we did.

171
0:07:59.546,000 --> 0:08:,000
We met men where they were at

172
0:08:01.32,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and we built a program.

173
0:08:02.859,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And then we had this one event

174
0:08:04.638,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that stays in my heart forever

175
0:08:06.713,000 --> 0:08:08,000
where a basketball coach

176
0:08:09.298,000 --> 0:08:12,000
was talking to a room filled with male athletes

177
0:08:13.22,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and men from all walks of life.

178
0:08:15.801,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And he was talking about the importance

179
0:08:17.704,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of coaching boys into men

180
0:08:19.063,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and changing the culture of the locker room

181
0:08:21.101,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships.

182
0:08:24.37,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And all of a sudden, he looked at the back of the room,

183
0:08:27.298,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and he saw his daughter,

184
0:08:29.01,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and he called out his daughter's name, Michaela,

185
0:08:31.572,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and he said, "Michaela, come up here."

186
0:08:33.431,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy,

187
0:08:35.638,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and she got up there,

188
0:08:36.999,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and he said, "Sit down next to me."

189
0:08:39.605,000 --> 0:08:41,000
She sat right down next to him.

190
0:08:41.728,000 --> 0:08:43,000
He gave her this big hug, and he said,

191
0:08:44.536,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"People ask me why I do this work.

192
0:08:47.788,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I do this work because I'm her dad,

193
0:08:50.535,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her."

194
0:08:54.23,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And as a parent, I get it.

195
0:08:57.582,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I get it,

196
0:08:59.738,000 --> 0:09:01,000
knowing that there are so many sexual assaults

197
0:09:02.621,000 --> 0:09:03,000
on college campuses

198
0:09:04.489,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that are so widespread and so under-reported.

199
0:09:08.029,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We've done a lot for adult women.

200
0:09:10.134,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We've got to do a better job for our kids.

201
0:09:13.201,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We just do. We have to. (Applause)

202
0:09:16.391,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We've come a long way

203
0:09:18.461,000 --> 0:09:21,000
since the days of the Polaroid.

204
0:09:21.472,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Technology has been our friend.

205
0:09:24.625,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The mobile phone is a global game changer

206
0:09:28.684,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for the empowerment of women,

207
0:09:30.647,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube

208
0:09:34.852,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and all the social media helps us organize

209
0:09:38.657,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and tell our story in a powerful way.

210
0:09:42.108,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And so those of you in this audience

211
0:09:44.606,000 --> 0:09:45,000
who have helped build those applications

212
0:09:46.447,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and those platforms, as an organizer,

213
0:09:48.808,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I say, thank you very much.

214
0:09:51.218,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Really. I clap for you.

215
0:09:53.293,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

216
0:09:56.274,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I'm the daughter of a man

217
0:09:59.021,000 --> 0:10:01,000
who joined one club in his life,

218
0:10:01.292,000 --> 0:10:04,000
the Optimist Club.

219
0:10:04.966,000 --> 0:10:06,000
You can't make that one up.

220
0:10:07.728,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And it is his spirit and his optimism

221
0:10:11.278,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that is in my DNA.

222
0:10:13.188,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I have been doing this work

223
0:10:15.05,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for over 30 years,

224
0:10:17.204,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and I am convinced, now more than ever,

225
0:10:19.901,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in the capacity of human beings to change.

226
0:10:23.574,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I believe we can bend the arc of human history

227
0:10:27.113,000 --> 0:10:3,000
toward compassion and equality,

228
0:10:30.131,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and I also fundamentally believe

229
0:10:32.949,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and passionately believe

230
0:10:34.987,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that this violence does not have to be part

231
0:10:38.117,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of the human condition.

232
0:10:39.942,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And I ask you, stand with us

233
0:10:43.295,000 --> 0:10:46,000
as we create futures without violence

234
0:10:47.11,000 --> 0:10:51,000
for women and girls and men and boys everywhere.

235
0:10:51.53,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Thank you very much.

236
0:10:53.692,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Applause)

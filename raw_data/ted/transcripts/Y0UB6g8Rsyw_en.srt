1
0:00:12.881,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So, what is capitalism?

2
0:00:14.071,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Capitalism, fundamentally, is a series of marketplaces.

3
0:00:17.285,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You can have a marketplace for lemonade,

4
0:00:19.223,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a marketplace for lemons,

5
0:00:20.532,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a marketplace for trucks that transport lemons,

6
0:00:22.935,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a marketplace that fuels those trucks,

7
0:00:25.514,000 --> 0:00:28,000
marketplaces that sell wood to build lemonade stands.

8
0:00:28.926,000 --> 0:00:3,000
However, capitalism of course, as we know,

9
0:00:31.395,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is this either celebrated term

10
0:00:33.855,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or condemned term.

11
0:00:35.03,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's either revered or it's reviled.

12
0:00:37.649,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I'm here to argue that this is because capitalism,

13
0:00:41.028,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in the modern iteration, is largely misunderstood.

14
0:00:44.982,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In my view,

15
0:00:46.165,000 --> 0:00:48,000
capitalism should not be thought of as an ideology,

16
0:00:48.998,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but instead should be thought of as an operating system.

17
0:00:52.849,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Think of your iPhone.

18
0:00:54.762,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Your iPhone merges hardware with software.

19
0:00:58.683,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Apps and hardware.

20
0:01:00.071,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now think about all the hardware as the physical reality all around you,

21
0:01:03.832,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and think of the apps as entrepreneurial activity,

22
0:01:06.624,000 --> 0:01:07,000
creative energy.

23
0:01:08.188,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And in-between, you have an operating system.

24
0:01:11.307,000 --> 0:01:13,000
As you have advances in hardware,

25
0:01:13.561,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you have advances in software.

26
0:01:15.561,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And the operating system needs to keep up.

27
0:01:17.593,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It needs to be patched, it needs to be updated,

28
0:01:20.553,000 --> 0:01:21,000
new releases have to happen.

29
0:01:22.482,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And all of these things have to happen symbiotically.

30
0:01:25.465,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The operating system needs to keep getting more and more advanced

31
0:01:28.791,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to keep up with innovation.

32
0:01:31.728,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And this is why, fundamentally,

33
0:01:34.133,000 --> 0:01:36,000
when you think about it as an operating system,

34
0:01:36.363,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it devolves the language of ideology

35
0:01:38.536,000 --> 0:01:41,000
away from what traditional defenders of capitalism think.

36
0:01:42.236,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But even if you go to the constitution,

37
0:01:44.127,000 --> 0:01:47,000
you'll notice, before the founders even got to the First Amendment --

38
0:01:47.398,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with free speech, free religion, free press,

39
0:01:50.697,000 --> 0:01:52,000
they thought about patents and copyright.

40
0:01:53.095,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They talked about the government's role in promoting arts and sciences.

41
0:01:57.645,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's the reason why I could not start a search engine tomorrow called Goggle.

42
0:02:02.082,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:03.464,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Google doesn't own Gs,

44
0:02:05.164,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but I couldn't do it because there could be some confusion.

45
0:02:07.967,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So even property rights have ambiguity built into them.

46
0:02:11.173,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And on and on.

47
0:02:12.506,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And by 1900, you have other types of property that come into being.

48
0:02:16.886,000 --> 0:02:19,000
For instance, imagine that in 1900, you owned 100 acres of land

49
0:02:20.767,000 --> 0:02:21,000
someplace in the Midwest.

50
0:02:22.709,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's very easy to see where your fence ends,

51
0:02:24.828,000 --> 0:02:25,000
your neighbor's property begins.

52
0:02:26.486,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now let me ask you,

53
0:02:27.673,000 --> 0:02:29,000
where in the sky does your property end?

54
0:02:30.071,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Does it end at 1,000 feet,

55
0:02:31.776,000 --> 0:02:33,000
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet?

56
0:02:34.141,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It makes no difference,

57
0:02:35.348,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because other than the novelty of a few hot-air balloons,

58
0:02:38.387,000 --> 0:02:39,000
man couldn't fly.

59
0:02:40.053,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But within three years, he could.

60
0:02:41.822,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now all of a sudden, it was very much relevant

61
0:02:44.776,000 --> 0:02:46,000
whether your land ends at 1,000 feet in the sky,

62
0:02:47.474,000 --> 0:02:48,000
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet.

63
0:02:49.665,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And you have to have someone arbitrate that.

64
0:02:53.116,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And indeed, that's exactly what happened.

65
0:02:55.101,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And five or ten years from now,

66
0:02:56.638,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when Amazon wants to deliver a package over your house to your neighbor

67
0:03:00.25,000 --> 0:03:01,000
from that UPS truck,

68
0:03:01.918,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we're going to have to decide: Does you property end at five feet,

69
0:03:05.204,000 --> 0:03:07,000
10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet?

70
0:03:07.936,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Where does it end?

71
0:03:09.135,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And there is no ideology

72
0:03:10.882,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that will tell you where your property ends.

73
0:03:14.132,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's an operating system.

74
0:03:16.03,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And similarly,

75
0:03:17.205,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we're going to see this with automobiles.

76
0:03:19.386,000 --> 0:03:21,000
A few years after the Wright brothers figured out flight,

77
0:03:22.132,000 --> 0:03:24,000
human beings started using more and more cars.

78
0:03:24.328,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And all of a sudden,

79
0:03:25.503,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the regulatory system -- the operating system --

80
0:03:27.813,000 --> 0:03:31,000
had to be patched to all of a sudden address the safety of consumers.

81
0:03:32.411,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That the consumers of vehicles were presenting danger to horses,

82
0:03:35.562,000 --> 0:03:37,000
other pedestrians, trolleys, what have you.

83
0:03:38.957,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And all of a sudden,

84
0:03:40.132,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the drivers of these automobiles had to have driver's licenses, eye exams,

85
0:03:43.99,000 --> 0:03:45,000
registered motor vehicles, speed limits,

86
0:03:46.72,000 --> 0:03:47,000
rules of the road,

87
0:03:47.958,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so that horses, pedestrians, could coexist with cars.

88
0:03:52.974,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It had to be backwards compatible.

89
0:03:55.199,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So a new invention had to basically fit advances from the past.

90
0:04:00.355,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Similarly, five or ten years from now,

91
0:04:02.204,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we're going to see the same thing with self-driving cars --

92
0:04:05.019,000 --> 0:04:07,000
coexisting with human-driven cars.

93
0:04:07.173,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The reason why this is important, is in 10 years,

94
0:04:09.521,000 --> 0:04:12,000
another thing is going to happen beyond drones and self-driving cars,

95
0:04:12.994,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but you're going to see the most valuable economy in the world --

96
0:04:16.185,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the largest economy in the world --

97
0:04:17.907,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is going to be a country run by communists.

98
0:04:20.558,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The Chinese seem to be very good at capitalism.

99
0:04:24.469,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And this is going to have fundamental problems

100
0:04:27.97,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and present an identity crisis for the United States.

101
0:04:31.572,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Because for a long time,

102
0:04:33.261,000 --> 0:04:38,000
free markets coincided with liberties such as free speech, free press,

103
0:04:39.204,000 --> 0:04:4,000
free religion.

104
0:04:40.53,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And all of a sudden, this equation is going to be decoupled.

105
0:04:44.644,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And when it gets decoupled,

106
0:04:46.028,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we might find that democracy, the multitude of voices,

107
0:04:49.72,000 --> 0:04:51,000
actually impedes capitalism

108
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because a state that does not have any pretense of limited government

109
0:04:56.21,000 --> 0:04:59,000
can very quickly mandate a regulatory framework for drones,

110
0:04:59.776,000 --> 0:05:01,000
for electric cars, for self-driving cars,

111
0:05:02.243,000 --> 0:05:03,000
for any new innovation

112
0:05:04.062,000 --> 0:05:07,000
where they feel that they can leapfrog Western societies.

113
0:05:08.792,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And this is a very unique thing in the American experience.

114
0:05:13.236,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And this is why it's very important to think of American capitalism

115
0:05:17.157,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as an operating system and not as an ideology.

116
0:05:20.331,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Because when you think about it as an ideology,

117
0:05:22.553,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you can have good politics make for very, very bad policy.

118
0:05:28.371,000 --> 0:05:31,000
That market outcomes and democratic voices

119
0:05:31.823,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and battles for votes

120
0:05:33.498,000 --> 0:05:35,000
can end up stifling progress.

121
0:05:37.006,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So over the next few years,

122
0:05:39.006,000 --> 0:05:41,000
as this political cycle plays out,

123
0:05:41.815,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you're going to see American democracy

124
0:05:45.475,000 --> 0:05:5,000
rise to meet the challenges that capitalism poses and modernity poses.

125
0:05:50.997,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I ask policymakers to think about --

126
0:05:55.573,000 --> 0:05:58,000
decoupling ideology from economics,

127
0:05:59.103,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and think about how good policy can ultimately become good politics.

128
0:06:03.793,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Thank you.

129
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.818,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is an equipment graveyard.

2
0:00:15.064,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a typical final resting place

3
0:00:17.316,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for medical equipment from hospitals in Africa.

4
0:00:20.72,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Now, why is this?

5
0:00:22.641,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Most of the medical devices used in Africa are imported,

6
0:00:26.852,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and quite often, they're not suitable for local conditions.

7
0:00:31.095,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They may require trained staff

8
0:00:34.369,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that aren't available to operate and maintain and repair them;

9
0:00:38.739,000 --> 0:00:41,000
they may not be able to withstand high temperatures and humidity;

10
0:00:42.532,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and they usually require a constant and reliable supply of electricity.

11
0:00:48.104,000 --> 0:00:5,000
An example of a medical device

12
0:00:50.227,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that may have ended up in an equipment graveyard at some point

13
0:00:55.039,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is an ultrasound monitor to track the heart rate of unborn babies.

14
0:01:00.447,000 --> 0:01:03,000
This is the standard of care in rich countries.

15
0:01:03.902,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In low-resource settings, the standard of care is often

16
0:01:07.672,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a midwife listening to the baby's heart rate

17
0:01:10.905,000 --> 0:01:11,000
through a horn.

18
0:01:12.689,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now, this approach has been around for more than a century.

19
0:01:16.684,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's very much dependent on the skill and the experience of the midwife.

20
0:01:22.528,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Two young inventors from Uganda

21
0:01:25.357,000 --> 0:01:29,000
visited an antenatal clinic at a local hospital a few years ago,

22
0:01:29.913,000 --> 0:01:31,000
when they were students in information technology.

23
0:01:33.425,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They noticed that quite often,

24
0:01:36.117,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the midwife was not able to hear any heart rate

25
0:01:39.225,000 --> 0:01:41,000
when trying to listen to it through this horn.

26
0:01:42.665,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So they invented their own fetal heart rate monitor.

27
0:01:48.156,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They adapted the horn and connected it to a smartphone.

28
0:01:52.779,000 --> 0:01:56,000
An app on the smartphone records the heart rate, analyzes it

29
0:01:57.296,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and provides the midwife with a range of information

30
0:02:00.224,000 --> 0:02:01,000
on the status of the baby.

31
0:02:03.529,000 --> 0:02:04,000
These inventors --

32
0:02:04.865,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Applause)

33
0:02:06.111,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are called Aaron Tushabe and Joshua Okello.

34
0:02:10.591,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Another inventor, Tendekayi Katsiga,

35
0:02:14.739,000 --> 0:02:19,000
was working for an NGO in Botswana that manufactured hearing aids.

36
0:02:20.738,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now, he noticed that these hearing aids needed batteries

37
0:02:25.859,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that needed replacement,

38
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
very often at a cost that was not affordable

39
0:02:29.738,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for most of the users that he knew.

40
0:02:32.151,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In response, and being an engineer, Tendekayi invented

41
0:02:37.264,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a solar-powered battery charger with rechargeable batteries,

42
0:02:40.898,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that could be used in these hearing aids.

43
0:02:43.625,000 --> 0:02:46,000
He cofounded a company called Deaftronics,

44
0:02:47.551,000 --> 0:02:49,000
which now manufactures the Solar Ear,

45
0:02:50.727,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which is a hearing aid powered by his invention.

46
0:02:55.829,000 --> 0:03:,000
My colleague, Sudesh Sivarasu, invented a smart glove

47
0:03:01.09,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for people who have suffered from leprosy.

48
0:03:03.799,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Even though their disease may have been cured,

49
0:03:06.828,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the resulting nerve damage will have left many of them

50
0:03:10.008,000 --> 0:03:12,000
without a sense of touch in their hands.

51
0:03:12.57,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This puts them at risk of injury.

52
0:03:16.017,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The glove has sensors to detect temperature and pressure

53
0:03:20.066,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and warn the user.

54
0:03:22.581,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It effectively serves as an artificial sense of touch

55
0:03:26.114,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and prevents injury.

56
0:03:28.032,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Sudesh invented this glove after observing former leprosy patients

57
0:03:32.745,000 --> 0:03:34,000
as they carried out their day-to-day activities,

58
0:03:35.715,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and he learned about the risks and the hazards in their environment.

59
0:03:41.774,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now, the inventors that I've mentioned

60
0:03:43.978,000 --> 0:03:45,000
integrated engineering with healthcare.

61
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This is what biomedical engineers do.

62
0:03:50.558,000 --> 0:03:51,000
At the University of Cape Town,

63
0:03:52.487,000 --> 0:03:55,000
we run a course called Health Innovation and Design.

64
0:03:55.668,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It's taken by many of our graduate students in biomedical engineering.

65
0:04:00.106,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The aim of the course is to introduce these students

66
0:04:03.727,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to the philosophy of the design world.

67
0:04:06.306,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The students are encouraged to engage with communities

68
0:04:09.351,000 --> 0:04:12,000
as they search for solutions to health-related problems.

69
0:04:13.055,000 --> 0:04:16,000
One of the communities that we work with is a group of elderly people

70
0:04:16.348,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in Cape Town.

71
0:04:17.596,000 --> 0:04:21,000
A recent class project had the task of addressing hearing loss

72
0:04:21.76,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in these elderly people.

73
0:04:23.886,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The students, many of them being engineers,

74
0:04:26.682,000 --> 0:04:3,000
set out believing that they would design a better hearing aid.

75
0:04:31.557,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They spent time with the elderly,

76
0:04:33.189,000 --> 0:04:36,000
chatted to their healthcare providers and their caregivers.

77
0:04:37.039,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They soon realized that, actually, adequate hearing aids already existed,

78
0:04:42.177,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but many of the elderly who needed them and had access to them

79
0:04:46.197,000 --> 0:04:47,000
didn't have them.

80
0:04:47.954,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And many of those who had hearing aids

81
0:04:50.09,000 --> 0:04:51,000
wouldn't wear them.

82
0:04:52.321,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The students realized

83
0:04:54.335,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that many of these elderly people were in denial of their hearing loss.

84
0:04:58.296,000 --> 0:05:,000
There's a stigma attached to wearing a hearing aid.

85
0:05:01.757,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They also discovered that the environment in which these elderly people lived

86
0:05:06.539,000 --> 0:05:08,000
did not accommodate their hearing loss.

87
0:05:08.586,000 --> 0:05:11,000
For example, their homes and their community center

88
0:05:12.391,000 --> 0:05:15,000
were filled with echoes that interfered with their hearing.

89
0:05:15.999,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So instead of developing and designing a new and better hearing aid,

90
0:05:21.131,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the students did an audit of the environment,

91
0:05:23.838,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with a view to improving the acoustics.

92
0:05:27.196,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They also devised a campaign to raise awareness of hearing loss

93
0:05:31.054,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and to counter the stigma attached to wearing a hearing aid.

94
0:05:35.603,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now, this often happens when one pays attention to the user --

95
0:05:39.011,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in this case, the elderly --

96
0:05:40.685,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and their needs and their context.

97
0:05:43.219,000 --> 0:05:45,000
One often has to move away from the focus of technology

98
0:05:46.089,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and reformulate the problem.

99
0:05:48.861,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This approach to understanding a problem through listening and engaging

100
0:05:52.862,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is not new,

101
0:05:54.601,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but it often isn't followed by engineers,

102
0:05:57.237,000 --> 0:06:,000
who are intent on developing technology.

103
0:06:01.704,000 --> 0:06:04,000
One of our students has a background in software engineering.

104
0:06:05.176,000 --> 0:06:07,000
He had often created products for clients

105
0:06:07.877,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that the client ultimately did not like.

106
0:06:10.902,000 --> 0:06:12,000
When a client would reject a product,

107
0:06:13.103,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it was common at his company

108
0:06:15.012,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to proclaim that the client just didn't know what they wanted.

109
0:06:19.384,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Having completed the course, the student fed back to us

110
0:06:22.97,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that he now realized that it was he who hadn't understood

111
0:06:26.192,000 --> 0:06:27,000
what the client wanted.

112
0:06:28.254,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Another student gave us feedback

113
0:06:30.851,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that she had learned to design with empathy,

114
0:06:33.343,000 --> 0:06:35,000
as opposed to designing for functionality,

115
0:06:36.357,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which is what her engineering education had taught her.

116
0:06:39.83,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So what all of this illustrates is that we're often blinded to real needs

117
0:06:43.986,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in our pursuit of technology.

118
0:06:45.936,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But we need technology.

119
0:06:47.541,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We need hearing aids. We need fetal heart rate monitors.

120
0:06:51.385,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So how do we create more medical device success stories from Africa?

121
0:06:56.967,000 --> 0:06:57,000
How do we create more inventors,

122
0:06:58.969,000 --> 0:07:01,000
rather than relying on a few exceptional individuals

123
0:07:02.24,000 --> 0:07:04,000
who are able to perceive real needs

124
0:07:04.372,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and respond in ways that work?

125
0:07:06.718,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Well, we focus on needs and people and context.

126
0:07:10.497,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"But this is obvious," you might say,

127
0:07:12.353,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"Of course context is important."

128
0:07:15.486,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But Africa is a diverse continent,

129
0:07:17.918,000 --> 0:07:21,000
with vast disparities in health and wealth and income and education.

130
0:07:22.813,000 --> 0:07:27,000
If we assume that our engineers and inventors already know enough

131
0:07:27.864,000 --> 0:07:29,000
about the different African contexts

132
0:07:30.474,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to be able to solve the problems of our different communities

133
0:07:34.339,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and our most marginalized communities,

134
0:07:36.302,000 --> 0:07:37,000
then we might get it wrong.

135
0:07:38.907,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But then, if we on the African continent

136
0:07:41.526,000 --> 0:07:44,000
don't necessarily know enough about it,

137
0:07:44.822,000 --> 0:07:48,000
then perhaps anybody with the right level of skill and commitment could fly in,

138
0:07:48.976,000 --> 0:07:5,000
spend some time listening and engaging

139
0:07:51.469,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and fly out knowing enough to invent for Africa.

140
0:07:55.953,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But understanding context is not about a superficial interaction.

141
0:08:00.292,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's about deep engagement

142
0:08:02.276,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and an immersion in the realities and the complexities of our context.

143
0:08:07.877,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And we in Africa are already immersed.

144
0:08:11.522,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We already have a strong and rich base of knowledge

145
0:08:15.219,000 --> 0:08:18,000
from which to start finding solutions to our own problems.

146
0:08:19.873,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So let's not rely too much on others

147
0:08:23.548,000 --> 0:08:27,000
when we live on a continent that is filled with untapped talent.

148
0:08:28.124,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Thank you.

149
0:08:29.334,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I specialize in human behavioral research,

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and to design for that future.

5
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,

6
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.

7
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But I've got a pretty good idea

8
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
how people will behave when they get there.

9
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This is my office. It's out there.

10
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's not in the lab,

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.

12
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.

13
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
About three billion people, by the end of this year,

14
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
will have cellular connectivity.

15
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.

16
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I mention this because,

17
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
if we want to design for that future,

18
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we need to figure out what those people are about.

19
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is

20
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and what our team's job is.

21
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Our research often starts with a very simple question.

22
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?

23
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
If you think of everything in your life that you own,

24
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
when you walk out that door,

25
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
what do you consider to take with you?

26
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
When you're looking around, what do you consider?

27
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Of that stuff, what do you carry?

28
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And of that stuff, what do you actually use?

29
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So this is interesting to us,

30
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because the conscious and subconscious decision process

31
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using

32
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.

33
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And to put it really bluntly, you know,

34
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?

35
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I've probably done about five years' research

36
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
looking at what people carry.

37
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.

38
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,

39
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and we follow them around town with video cameras.

40
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's kind of like stalking with permission.

41
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question,

42
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
what do people carry?

43
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.

44
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
OK, that's fair enough.

45
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are --

46
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
across cultures and across gender and across contexts --

47
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
most people will say keys, money

48
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and, if they own one, a mobile phone.

49
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?

50
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.

51
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You'd probably kick me out, or something.

52
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
OK, it might seem like an obvious thing

53
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.

54
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But really, the question is, why? Right?

55
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So why are these things so important in our lives?

56
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival --

57
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
survival for us and survival for our loved ones.

58
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth --

59
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.

60
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Money is useful for buying food, sustenance,

61
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:4,000
among all its other uses.

62
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.

63
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

64
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
those three objects are very good at supporting

65
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

66
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,

67
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but they're very good at this.

68
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability

69
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to allow people to transcend space and time.

70
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And what I mean by that is, you know,

71
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?

72
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,

73
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.

74
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,

75
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.

76
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And they value that connectivity.

77
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.

78
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And you can do them with phone kiosks.

79
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal --

80
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.

81
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You don't need to ask permission from anyone,

82
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you can just go ahead and do it, right?

83
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
However, for these things to help us survive,

84
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it depends on them being carried.

85
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget.

86
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.

87
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I think, quite a nice feature.

88
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So we forget, but we're also adaptable,

89
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.

90
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And so we have these strategies to remember,

91
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and one of them was mentioned yesterday.

92
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.

93
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space,

94
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.

95
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.

96
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And you turn around, and you look back into the space,

97
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and some people talk aloud.

98
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And pretty much everyone does it at some point.

99
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life,

100
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels,

101
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but most people have what we call a center of gravity.

102
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.

103
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity,

104
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but over time, they gravitate there.

105
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's where you expect to find stuff.

106
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And in fact, when you're turning around,

107
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and you're looking inside the house,

108
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and you're looking for this stuff,

109
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:59,000
this is where you look first, right?

110
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
OK, so when we did this research,

111
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way

112
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to never forget anything ever, ever again.

113
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.

114
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?

116
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.

117
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And from a design perspective,

118
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:3,000
it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology

119
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and what you can delegate to other people.

120
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be --

121
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:39,000
can be the solution for pretty much everything,

122
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.

123
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.

124
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And apart from things like entertainment,

125
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,

126
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or, at least, not yet.

127
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Maybe sometime in the future, we will.

128
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.

129
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about

130
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy

131
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and how people who are illiterate communicate.

132
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures --

133
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.

134
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So, we've been conducting a lot of research.

135
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And one of the things we were looking at is --

136
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
if you can't read and write,

137
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
if you want to communicate over distances,

138
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you need to be able to identify the person

139
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that you want to communicate with.

140
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address,

141
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it could be a postal address.

142
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Simple question: if you can't read and write,

143
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
how do you manage your contact information?

144
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the fact is that millions of people do it.

145
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it,

146
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and so that's just one small example

147
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of the kind of research that we were doing.

148
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.

149
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people,

150
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the stuff that they can't do themselves.

151
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Let me give you another example of delegation.

152
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This one's a little bit more sophisticated,

153
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and this is from a study that we did in Uganda

154
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:09,000
about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.

155
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Sente is a word in Uganda that means money.

156
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?

157
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And it works like this.

158
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.

159
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.

160
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'm sending money back, and it works like this.

161
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone,

162
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and that's the phone kiosk operator.

163
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.

164
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.

165
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone,

166
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I call up the local village operator.

167
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.

168
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, they're topping up the value from Kampala,

169
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and it's now being topped up in the village.

170
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you --

171
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,

172
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and passes the rest over to you in cash.

173
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
OK, there's two things I like about this.

174
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone --

175
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
anyone who has a mobile phone --

176
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
essentially into an ATM machine.

177
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It brings rudimentary banking services to places

178
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
where there's no banking infrastructure.

179
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,

180
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers,

181
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.

182
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
There's a second thing I like about this.

183
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,

184
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,

185
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I know I could never have designed something as elegant

186
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?

187
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.

188
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But the difference between this and that

189
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is, there's no central authority trying to control this.

190
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
This is just street-up innovation.

191
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of

192
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
inspiration for us.

193
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.

194
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They'll give you a new one.

195
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They'll probably give you three new ones, right?

196
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.

197
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.

198
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks,

199
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.

200
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China,

201
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and you can see people taking down a phone

202
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and putting it back together.

203
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They reverse-engineer manuals.

204
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This is a kind of hacker's manual,

205
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and it's written in Chinese and English.

206
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
They also write them in Hindi.

207
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You can subscribe to these.

208
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
There are training institutes where they're churning out people

209
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
for fixing these things as well.

210
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
But what I like about this is,

211
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,

212
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:1,000
a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads --

213
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.

214
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.

215
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,

216
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.

217
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It challenges the norms.

218
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:33,000
OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.

219
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.

220
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.

221
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And I know what you're asking -- did I test it?

222
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'm not going to answer that, OK.

223
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications

224
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
of trust and confidence in the purchase process.

225
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,

226
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this --

227
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:05,000
apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?

228
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This is a pair of underpants from --

229
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Laughter) --

230
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:13,000
from Tibet.

231
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,

232
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?

233
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And I look at something like this and it makes me question,

234
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
if we were to take all the functionality in things like this,

235
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and redistribute them around the body

236
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in some kind of personal area network,

237
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
how would we prioritize where to put stuff?

238
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that

239
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
kind of personal area networks.

240
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers

241
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
written above the shack in rural Uganda.

242
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.

243
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?

244
0:12:55,000 --> 0:13:,000
When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?

245
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,

246
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for those extra three billion people.

247
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This is how it's shifting.

248
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.

249
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And this is from Delhi.

250
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It's from a study we did into illiteracy,

251
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and it's a guy in a teashop.

252
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
You can see the chai being poured in the background.

253
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,

254
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
on the lowest rungs in the society.

255
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And he, somehow, has the appreciation

256
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
of the values of Livestrong.

257
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And it's not necessarily the same values,

258
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but some kind of values of Livestrong,

259
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to actually go out and purchase them,

260
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and actually display them.

261
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
For me, this kind of personifies this connected world,

262
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:51,000
where everything is intertwined, and the dots are --

263
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:54,000
it's all about the dots joining together.

264
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences,"

265
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out

266
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet

267
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
has the ability to transcend space and time

268
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in a personal and convenient manner, right?

269
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
When everyone's connected.

270
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And there are four things.

271
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,

272
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the speed at which ideas go around.

273
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I know TED is about big ideas,

274
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.

275
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:34,000
If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,

276
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that's the first thing.

277
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The second thing is the immediacy of objects.

278
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,

279
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater --

280
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
things like banking, identity --

281
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:54,000
these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.

282
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And so the speed of the adoption of things

283
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is just going to become that much more rapid,

284
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:01,000
in a way that we just totally cannot conceive,

285
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
when you get it to 6.3 billion

286
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and the growth in the world's population.

287
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The next thing is that, however we design this stuff --

288
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:11,000
carefully design this stuff --

289
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:14,000
the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,

290
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
as long as it meets base needs --

291
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
the ability to transcend space and time, for example.

292
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.

293
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.

294
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
That's my feeling.

295
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on,

296
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse

297
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
both what we design and how we design.

298
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation.

299
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:54,000
With another three billion people connected,

300
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
they want to be part of the conversation.

301
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And I think our relevance and TED's relevance

302
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:07,000
is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.

303
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And we need to learn how to listen.

304
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So thank you very, very much.

305
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause)

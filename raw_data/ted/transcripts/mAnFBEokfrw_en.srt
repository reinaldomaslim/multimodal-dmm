2
0:00:13.532,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here today to talk about fundraising,

3
0:00:16.23,000 --> 0:00:18,000
or as you probably think of it, "the other F-word."

4
0:00:18.833,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:20.079,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Because if you want to change the world,

6
0:00:22.032,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you have to know how to pay for it.

7
0:00:23.756,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm not talking about being a good person --

8
0:00:25.828,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you can do that for free.

9
0:00:27.216,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm talking about if you want to create something,

10
0:00:30.002,000 --> 0:00:31,000
start something,

11
0:00:31.327,000 --> 0:00:32,000
galvanize a community,

12
0:00:32.716,000 --> 0:00:34,000
improve the lives of others, run for office.

13
0:00:35.979,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Every day, great ideas die on the vine,

14
0:00:37.995,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because they don't have capital to get off the ground.

15
0:00:40.598,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And all of the work,

16
0:00:42.082,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the thought, the vision that goes into the idea,

17
0:00:44.582,000 --> 0:00:46,000
isn't worth much if you can't pay your bills.

18
0:00:47.088,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And while most of the greatest social movements in history

19
0:00:50.304,000 --> 0:00:51,000
were powered purely by an idea

20
0:00:52.278,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and people's belief in that idea,

21
0:00:54.58,000 --> 0:00:57,000
real change and impact require resources.

22
0:00:58.941,000 --> 0:01:,000
Real people do this work,

23
0:01:01.751,000 --> 0:01:04,000
they need real change, real impact and resources

24
0:01:05.037,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to actually make it happen.

25
0:01:06.83,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The people that believe in this work

26
0:01:08.712,000 --> 0:01:11,000
have to have the support and the resources to do it.

27
0:01:11.919,000 --> 0:01:12,000
That's where I come in.

28
0:01:13.149,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I get essential resources

29
0:01:14.57,000 --> 0:01:17,000
into the hands of people and visionaries on the front lines,

30
0:01:17.935,000 --> 0:01:18,000
doing work that matters.

31
0:01:19.704,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We spend the majority of our waking hours working.

32
0:01:22.101,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We spend more time working than we do with our loved ones.

33
0:01:25.323,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I decided early on that I have to love my work,

34
0:01:27.96,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and it has to add value.

35
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And while I would love to be one of these people

36
0:01:32.555,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who spearheads social change from the ground up,

37
0:01:36.698,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the thing I realized early on in my nonprofit career

38
0:01:39.736,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is that the thing I'm good at,

39
0:01:41.444,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the thing I'm really good at,

40
0:01:43.309,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is raising money.

41
0:01:45.196,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I love it.

42
0:01:46.609,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I think it is a privilege

43
0:01:48.133,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to work alongside bold, ambitious, optimistic leaders

44
0:01:51.841,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and the organizations they serve.

45
0:01:54.11,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So I teach people how to do the thing I'm good at,

46
0:01:56.873,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because the more people that learn how to be good at my end of this work,

47
0:02:00.411,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the more work will get done.

48
0:02:02.322,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I teach everyone.

49
0:02:03.783,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I teach CEOs and presidents,

50
0:02:06.379,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and boards of directors and EDs.

51
0:02:09.545,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I teach development directors in all sorts of teams

52
0:02:12.726,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and nonprofit newbies,

53
0:02:14.665,000 --> 0:02:16,000
social change agents and candidates.

54
0:02:17.268,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I teach anyone that wants to do something extraordinary

55
0:02:19.903,000 --> 0:02:2,000
how to fund their dream.

56
0:02:21.72,000 --> 0:02:23,000
My dream is that there will be more people like me

57
0:02:24.093,000 --> 0:02:25,000
doing this work well

58
0:02:25.49,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and that development will be an undergraduate course at universities,

59
0:02:28.793,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so that fundraising animals like me will find this job out of the gate,

60
0:02:33.142,000 --> 0:02:35,000
instead of discovering it years later, accidentally.

61
0:02:36.024,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I even have the curriculum developed,

62
0:02:37.857,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but short of overhauling undergraduate course requirements,

63
0:02:41.369,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I think tonight's probably a good first step

64
0:02:43.512,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to get people to think about fundraising

65
0:02:45.829,000 --> 0:02:47,000
more as an opportunity

66
0:02:48.282,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and less as a dirty word.

67
0:02:50.953,000 --> 0:02:53,000
If you want to change the world, you have to know how to pay for it.

68
0:02:54.224,000 --> 0:02:55,000
To do that well,

69
0:02:55.438,000 --> 0:02:56,000
you have to understand three big things.

70
0:02:57.438,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Your feelings about wealth and money,

71
0:03:00.199,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the importance of building relationships,

72
0:03:02.716,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and how to ask for what you want.

73
0:03:05.303,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Let's start at the top, your feelings about wealth and money.

74
0:03:08.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
What is your relationship to money?

75
0:03:10.931,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Money is complicated,

76
0:03:12.646,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it makes everyone squeamish,

77
0:03:14.228,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it makes everyone act kind of weird.

78
0:03:16.371,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Anyone who's ever had to split the check after dinner with friends

79
0:03:19.61,000 --> 0:03:2,000
can tell you this.

80
0:03:20.839,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Imagine what it was like before Venmo.

81
0:03:23.125,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:25.188,000 --> 0:03:26,000
To help people learn how to raise money,

83
0:03:27.173,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you have to help them understand their deal with money,

84
0:03:29.823,000 --> 0:03:3,000
because everybody has baggage.

85
0:03:31.347,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Grew up poor? Baggage.

86
0:03:33.014,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Grew up rich? Baggage.

87
0:03:35.094,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Mad or envious that other people have more money than you?

88
0:03:38.507,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Baggage.

89
0:03:39.681,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Think people with money are smarter than you?

90
0:03:42.919,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Baggage.

91
0:03:44.094,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

92
0:03:45.118,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Feel guilty that you have more money than other people?

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
That's some first-class baggage.

94
0:03:50.14,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

95
0:03:52.046,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's still baggage, people, it's still baggage.

96
0:03:54.645,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So whatever your deal is with your baggage,

97
0:03:57.426,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you have to reconcile it

98
0:03:58.669,000 --> 0:04:,000
if you're going to be able to ask for money.

99
0:04:00.756,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And here's a little tip about asking people for money.

100
0:04:03.319,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The only difference about really wealthy people and us

101
0:04:05.923,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is that they have more money than us.

102
0:04:08.36,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That's it.

103
0:04:09.582,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Don't overcomplicate it.

104
0:04:11.55,000 --> 0:04:12,000
They come with their own baggage.

105
0:04:14.649,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When you think about how to do this work,

106
0:04:17.546,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it's important to remember that money makes the world go round.

107
0:04:20.613,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You hear that all the time, but it's true.

108
0:04:22.665,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Whether you're a nonprofit, for-profit, or you pay your own bills.

109
0:04:26.014,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We often feel like talking about it is this icky, embarrassing, ugly thing,

110
0:04:30.446,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but it's just money.

111
0:04:31.899,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And it's a fact of life.

112
0:04:33.588,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So how you feel about it directly affects how you approach it.

113
0:04:37.367,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Like everyone else when I started out in this work,

114
0:04:40.286,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I had to examine and understand my own feelings about wealth and money.

115
0:04:44.81,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I had to learn how to separate them

116
0:04:46.699,000 --> 0:04:49,000
from how I feel about raising money for important causes.

117
0:04:50.077,000 --> 0:04:53,000
How I feel about asking for money to help people do good work in the world

118
0:04:54.014,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is not the same as how I feel about asking for money for myself.

119
0:04:57.649,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is an important distinction.

120
0:05:00.078,000 --> 0:05:01,000
When I go and talk to someone,

121
0:05:01.706,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I'm not asking them to pay my mortgage.

122
0:05:04.546,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I'm giving them an opportunity to invest in an idea

123
0:05:07.717,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that's going to change the world for the better.

124
0:05:10.069,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Why should I feel bad about that?

125
0:05:12.879,000 --> 0:05:14,000
If you want to be good at raising money,

126
0:05:14.983,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you have to be able to reframe the ask,

127
0:05:16.926,000 --> 0:05:18,000
both for yourself and for other people,

128
0:05:19.014,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as an opportunity.

129
0:05:21.784,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Next, you have to get prepared to build some relationships.

130
0:05:25.17,000 --> 0:05:27,000
People give to people, they don't just give to ideas.

131
0:05:27.987,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And if they don't believe in the person running the place,

132
0:05:30.75,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you're already dead in the water.

133
0:05:32.392,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This is true whether you're in stocks or venture capital,

134
0:05:36.44,000 --> 0:05:37,000
politics or nonprofits.

135
0:05:38.916,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Building a relationship with people takes work.

136
0:05:42.138,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You have to care about more than just what you want or need,

137
0:05:45.376,000 --> 0:05:47,000
you have to also value what someone else wants or needs.

138
0:05:48.415,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I know, it's a shocking, terrible idea.

139
0:05:50.97,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But oftentimes, closing gifts is understanding the person,

140
0:05:54.891,000 --> 0:05:56,000
more than it's important to know the product.

141
0:05:57.061,000 --> 0:06:,000
And if you think building a relationship with people takes work,

142
0:06:00.609,000 --> 0:06:03,000
building a relationship with someone you're asking for money from

143
0:06:03.951,000 --> 0:06:05,000
takes work, and it takes homework.

144
0:06:07.347,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Have you done any research?

145
0:06:09.466,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Do you have any idea what they care about?

146
0:06:11.791,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Do you know why they should invest in your work?

147
0:06:14.069,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Can you answer that question in less than 30 seconds?

148
0:06:16.776,000 --> 0:06:18,000
If you can't, the meeting is going to be pretty rough.

149
0:06:19.752,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And the answer can't be "Because they're super rich

150
0:06:22.219,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and they live in your zip code."

151
0:06:25.477,000 --> 0:06:28,000
When you talk to people and understand what they care about,

152
0:06:29.263,000 --> 0:06:3,000
it has to be in person.

153
0:06:30.874,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Fundraising is relational, it's not transactional.

154
0:06:34.183,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And you have to ask them questions.

155
0:06:36.989,000 --> 0:06:39,000
When I sit down with a donor, it goes something like this.

156
0:06:40.822,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"Hi, thanks so much for seeing me.

157
0:06:42.728,000 --> 0:06:43,000
How have you been?

158
0:06:43.941,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Did you guys go anywhere fun over holiday?

159
0:06:45.982,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Nice, I love Mexico.

160
0:06:47.165,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Do you always go to the same place?

161
0:06:48.879,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Oh, that's awesome!

162
0:06:50.085,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Are those your kids? They're so cute.

163
0:06:51.911,000 --> 0:06:52,000
How old are they?

164
0:06:53.085,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Where are they in school?

165
0:06:54.332,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Oh, that's a great school, are you guys very involved there?

166
0:06:57.204,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Your spouse in on the board? How's that?

167
0:06:59.165,000 --> 0:07:,000
How did you guys meet?

168
0:07:00.38,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Oh, at Santa Clara, that's awesome.

169
0:07:02.141,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Are you super involved in the alumni network?

170
0:07:04.292,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So interesting.

171
0:07:05.527,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Where do you guys live, again?

172
0:07:07.003,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That's great. Is that your boat?"

173
0:07:08.601,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:09.879,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I literally go through all of these things, right.

175
0:07:13.49,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And you know why?

176
0:07:14.665,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Because guess what I know now.

177
0:07:16.196,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I know they're out of 120 grand a year in schooling for the next 12 years.

178
0:07:19.736,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Right?

179
0:07:20.926,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Spouse is on the board of the kids' school,

180
0:07:22.99,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I know they're out of 100K probably.

181
0:07:24.815,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's a six-figure.

182
0:07:26.038,000 --> 0:07:28,000
They're both involved in their school alumni,

183
0:07:28.18,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that's probably 25K.

184
0:07:29.387,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They told me they live on the Upper East Side --

185
0:07:31.661,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I can look up their apartment online and find out what their mortgage is.

186
0:07:35.204,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I know they own a second home in Mexico.

187
0:07:37.283,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Oh, and they own a boat.

188
0:07:38.952,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Which is like funny money, right?

189
0:07:41.095,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So what I now understand --

190
0:07:43.683,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

191
0:07:44.739,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's true.

192
0:07:46.057,000 --> 0:07:47,000
What I now understand

193
0:07:47.561,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is that their 1,000-dollar gift is probably more of a starter gift.

194
0:07:51.615,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I should be thinking about ways to help them partner with us

195
0:07:56.234,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and invest in a more meaningful way.

196
0:07:59.234,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I know this sounds a tad mercenary.

197
0:08:01.982,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I'm not confused about how it sounds.

198
0:08:04.45,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But here's what I want to tell you,

199
0:08:06.506,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because this is the part that all my clients always want to skip,

200
0:08:09.678,000 --> 0:08:11,000
because they think it's the fluff and it's not important.

201
0:08:12.76,000 --> 0:08:15,000
If you don't understand what they care about and what they value,

202
0:08:16.284,000 --> 0:08:19,000
how are you ever going to be able to tell them about your work, right?

203
0:08:19.601,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I want them to fund our work, I do.

204
0:08:22.03,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But I also want them to have a really meaningful experience as a donor,

205
0:08:25.584,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so that they feel like we're partners

206
0:08:27.744,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and they're not an ATM, right?

207
0:08:30.212,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So it's important to ask the questions,

208
0:08:33.529,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because the more you know about them

209
0:08:35.276,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and you know what they value,

210
0:08:36.72,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the more you can steer the conversation

211
0:08:38.641,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in a direction about your work that will resonate for them.

212
0:08:41.474,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And once you get past the get-to-know-you part,

213
0:08:43.702,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you get into the fun stuff,

214
0:08:45.076,000 --> 0:08:47,000
like, "Why are you philanthropic at all?"

215
0:08:47.647,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Right?

216
0:08:49.133,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Why do you invest in new ideas?

217
0:08:51.553,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Do you want giving back to be a value you pass on to your children?

218
0:08:54.942,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Can we help you do that?"

219
0:08:57.276,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It's really awesome, it's meaningful,

220
0:08:59.102,000 --> 0:09:,000
and remember, it's a conversation,

221
0:09:00.816,000 --> 0:09:01,000
it's not a cross examination,

222
0:09:02.411,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it's not an interview.

223
0:09:04.744,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Don't walk in there and tell them everything you already know about them,

224
0:09:08.204,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because you did your research.

225
0:09:09.752,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You don't get extra points for knowing how to use Google.

226
0:09:12.506,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It's 75 percent them talking,

227
0:09:14.546,000 --> 0:09:15,000
25 percent you listening.

228
0:09:16.338,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's better to be a good listener than a good showman.

229
0:09:19.053,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And once you understand what they care about,

230
0:09:21.966,000 --> 0:09:23,000
you can talk to them about what you care about.

231
0:09:24.204,000 --> 0:09:25,000
You can tell them about you.

232
0:09:25.737,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, when you do this,

233
0:09:27.617,000 --> 0:09:29,000
don't get too deep into the weeds, or you'll lose them.

234
0:09:30.274,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It's a lot like when I sit down with guys in finance, right,

235
0:09:33.41,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and I say,

236
0:09:35.855,000 --> 0:09:36,000
you know, "How's work?"

237
0:09:37.046,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I'm looking for, like, a thumbs up, thumbs down.

238
0:09:39.728,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But what I get sometimes

239
0:09:42.707,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is a long description of how the markets are trending,

240
0:09:49.708,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and my brain leaves my body

241
0:09:51.847,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and starts to think about what time my dry cleaner closes.

242
0:09:54.938,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

243
0:09:55.977,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Like, I don't have capacity for that.

244
0:09:57.959,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And they don't have capacity for that level detail of our work.

245
0:10:00.951,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If they want it, they'll ask you the questions.

246
0:10:03.665,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It's this thing that happens over and over,

247
0:10:06.99,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because -- here's an example.

248
0:10:09.665,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I worked with this CEO once,

249
0:10:11.09,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and I was hired to teach him how to talk to human people,

250
0:10:13.941,000 --> 0:10:14,000
like a human person.

251
0:10:15.417,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

252
0:10:16.442,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It was a very difficult job.

253
0:10:18.663,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So, he kept getting great donor meetings,

254
0:10:21.735,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and he wasn't closing any gifts.

255
0:10:23.506,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I could not figure out what the problem was,

256
0:10:25.792,000 --> 0:10:27,000
so finally, I was like, "I'm going to come with you."

257
0:10:28.442,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So I went with him to meetings, and what would happen was,

258
0:10:31.474,000 --> 0:10:33,000
he was getting into such detail with the donors

259
0:10:33.982,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that their eyes were glazing over,

260
0:10:36.141,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and then after he was done with his 15-minute pitch,

261
0:10:39.704,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they literally would say --

262
0:10:41.062,000 --> 0:10:43,000
this happened, like, three times in a row --

263
0:10:43.53,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"God, that sounds great. Congratulations.

264
0:10:46.617,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Keep up the good work."

265
0:10:47.895,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And that was the meeting,

266
0:10:49.117,000 --> 0:10:51,000
which was obviously not the outcome we were looking for.

267
0:10:51.807,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So, he couldn't understand what I was trying to say to him,

268
0:10:54.617,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that I finally, in an act of sheer desperation, was like ...

269
0:10:58.998,000 --> 0:10:59,000
"You know what I love?

270
0:11:01.133,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I love NASA.

271
0:11:03.046,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I love NASA.

272
0:11:04.72,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I think it is unbelievably amazing we have figured out

273
0:11:08.469,000 --> 0:11:09,000
how to get a person to the Moon.

274
0:11:10.641,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I think it's awesome.

275
0:11:12.292,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I think the idea of getting someone to the Moon,

276
0:11:15.194,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and they walk on the Moon,

277
0:11:16.68,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and I love rocket ships.

278
0:11:18.911,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I love rocket ships, rocket ships are amazing.

279
0:11:21.904,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But if you start to tell me about the rocket ship,

280
0:11:24.277,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and how it gets to the Moon,

281
0:11:25.65,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and the math and the science equations,

282
0:11:27.542,000 --> 0:11:29,000
on how the rocket ship gets to the Moon,

283
0:11:29.761,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I promise you, I will hang myself with my own hair."

284
0:11:32.695,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

285
0:11:35.028,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I was like, "That is not how you tell people about your work.

286
0:11:38.798,000 --> 0:11:39,000
What is the need?"

287
0:11:40.655,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Like, what's the point, right?

288
0:11:42.371,000 --> 0:11:43,000
How do you address the need,

289
0:11:43.776,000 --> 0:11:45,000
why are you better at it than anybody else?

290
0:11:45.807,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And what can you do to make it about them?

291
0:11:49.971,000 --> 0:11:52,000
How can they help you get to the Moon?

292
0:11:53.423,000 --> 0:11:54,000
That's the good stuff.

293
0:11:55.273,000 --> 0:11:58,000
If you're able to do that, you're probably ready to make the ask.

294
0:11:58.542,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Now, I don't expect

295
0:12:00.006,000 --> 0:12:02,000
everyone to be super excited to ask people for money.

296
0:12:02.863,000 --> 0:12:04,000
That's why development is an actual profession

297
0:12:05.141,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and not an awkward hobby.

298
0:12:06.812,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Laughter)

299
0:12:07.846,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Naturally great fundraisers love people,

300
0:12:11.347,000 --> 0:12:13,000
they can and will talk to anyone,

301
0:12:13.371,000 --> 0:12:15,000
they can find common ground with anyone,

302
0:12:15.767,000 --> 0:12:17,000
they're your friends that talk to people in the elevator

303
0:12:18.569,000 --> 0:12:19,000
or at the grocery store.

304
0:12:20.791,000 --> 0:12:23,000
They believe in the work required

305
0:12:24.006,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to both build relationships and keep them.

306
0:12:27.007,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And they naturally have a high tolerance for rejection.

307
0:12:31.975,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But I don't expect everyone to be a natural,

308
0:12:34.055,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and you don't have to be a natural to raise money.

309
0:12:36.426,000 --> 0:12:38,000
You just have to respect the people and the process,

310
0:12:39.339,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and do the work.

311
0:12:41.307,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Will you reconcile your baggage?

312
0:12:45.403,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Will you commit to build relationships?

313
0:12:47.982,000 --> 0:12:49,000
If you will, you're ready to make the ask.

314
0:12:50.474,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And the ask is oftentimes as simple as using the phrase

315
0:12:53.347,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"Would you consider?"

316
0:12:55.584,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Would you consider becoming a monthly donor?

317
0:12:58.013,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Would you consider increasing your support to 100 dollars?

318
0:13:01.554,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Would you consider investing in our work at the one-million-dollar level?

319
0:13:05.419,000 --> 0:13:07,000
"Would you consider" does a couple of awesome things.

320
0:13:07.983,000 --> 0:13:09,000
One, it gives the donor an easy way out.

321
0:13:10.395,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Like, they can say "no" without it being "yes-no."

322
0:13:12.927,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And two, it gives you a second ask.

323
0:13:14.982,000 --> 0:13:15,000
"Well, what would you consider?"

324
0:13:16.569,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Laughter)

325
0:13:18.642,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It's good, right?

326
0:13:19.817,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

327
0:13:21.491,000 --> 0:13:24,000
When you do this, remember, you're not asking for yourself.

328
0:13:24.847,000 --> 0:13:26,000
You're asking on behalf of all of the people you serve

329
0:13:27.634,000 --> 0:13:29,000
or are touched by your genius.

330
0:13:29.908,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This isn't a personal favor, right?

331
0:13:32.178,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Feel proud of the ask -- it's incredible that you do this work.

332
0:13:36.836,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Don't try to be someone you're not,

333
0:13:38.551,000 --> 0:13:41,000
you're going to go to these meetings and think you need to big-shot it.

334
0:13:41.917,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Be yourself, authenticity matters, nobody likes a phony.

335
0:13:44.6,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Just be yourself.

336
0:13:45.862,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And please,

337
0:13:47.385,000 --> 0:13:49,000
please don't torpedo your own ask.

338
0:13:50.092,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What I mean by this

339
0:13:51.314,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is don't walk into the meeting and say -- I had an ED that did this all the time,

340
0:13:55.609,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I stopped inviting him.

341
0:13:57.688,000 --> 0:13:59,000
He'd say, "We're not here today to ask you for money."

342
0:14:00.259,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Laughter)

343
0:14:02.561,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Yes, we are!

344
0:14:03.742,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Laughter)

345
0:14:04.767,000 --> 0:14:07,000
That's exactly, literally, why we're here today.

346
0:14:09.18,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Don't do that.

347
0:14:10.728,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Don't say, "Whatever you can do to help."

348
0:14:13.402,000 --> 0:14:16,000
That is hands down the fastest way to get the smallest possible gift

349
0:14:17.275,000 --> 0:14:19,000
someone thinks they can give you and get away with.

350
0:14:19.728,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Not kidding.

351
0:14:20.91,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And don't take it back.

352
0:14:23.117,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Once you've made the ask --

353
0:14:24.479,000 --> 0:14:27,000
"Would you consider supporting us at the 10,000-dollar level?

354
0:14:27.665,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Or the five? Or the two? Or one?

355
0:14:29.507,000 --> 0:14:3,000
You know what? Take the year off.

356
0:14:31.133,000 --> 0:14:32,000
You're the best, thanks!"

357
0:14:32.403,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Don't do that!

358
0:14:34.593,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Ask the question,

359
0:14:36.284,000 --> 0:14:39,000
wait till 10, count to 10 before you speak again,

360
0:14:39.404,000 --> 0:14:4,000
keep your face like this.

361
0:14:41.8,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Laughter)

362
0:14:43.704,000 --> 0:14:44,000
They are grown-ups.

363
0:14:46.411,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They have all the power in this situation.

364
0:14:48.895,000 --> 0:14:49,000
They can answer the question.

365
0:14:50.649,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Don't take it back.

366
0:14:52.331,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Which brings me to my favorite.

367
0:14:54.109,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Don't ask, don't get.

368
0:14:55.982,000 --> 0:14:56,000
If you don't make an actual ask,

369
0:14:57.911,000 --> 0:14:58,000
no one will give you actual money.

370
0:14:59.838,000 --> 0:15:,000
And if no one gives you actual money,

371
0:15:01.625,000 --> 0:15:02,000
you actually can't do anything with it.

372
0:15:03.617,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It's very simple -- don't ask, don't get.

373
0:15:07.784,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Listen, I would love to live in a world

374
0:15:09.681,000 --> 0:15:11,000
where we didn't have to ask people for money

375
0:15:11.824,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to do important work that will change people's lives.

376
0:15:15.149,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I would love to not have to teach people

377
0:15:17.387,000 --> 0:15:2,000
how to make a case for the importance of feeding and housing

378
0:15:20.641,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and educating people.

379
0:15:22.68,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But this is the world that we live in,

380
0:15:24.53,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and if we're committed to doing this work,

381
0:15:26.585,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and doing it well,

382
0:15:27.792,000 --> 0:15:29,000
we have to be as committed to the art of funding this work

383
0:15:30.585,000 --> 0:15:32,000
as we are to the art of executing it.

384
0:15:32.887,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I'm going to repeat that, because I think it's really important.

385
0:15:35.935,000 --> 0:15:38,000
We have to be as committed to the art of funding our work

386
0:15:39.612,000 --> 0:15:41,000
as we are to the art of executing it.

387
0:15:42.771,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And at its core,

388
0:15:43.953,000 --> 0:15:46,000
the art of funding the work means that we have to truly believe

389
0:15:47.168,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that the purpose and the privilege of our work

390
0:15:50.141,000 --> 0:15:51,000
is to provide people

391
0:15:51.823,000 --> 0:15:53,000
with an extraordinary way to use their wealth

392
0:15:54.503,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that will change people's lives.

393
0:15:57.286,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It's an opportunity,

394
0:15:59.103,000 --> 0:16:01,000
because at its core, that's what it is.

395
0:16:01.19,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And how great is that?

396
0:16:03.413,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Thank you.

397
0:16:04.595,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Applause, cheers)

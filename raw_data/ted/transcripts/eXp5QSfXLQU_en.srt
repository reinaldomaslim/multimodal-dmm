1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I started with paragliding.

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Paragliding is taking off from mountains

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
with a paraglider, with the possibility to

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
fly cross-country, distance,

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
just with the use of thermals to soar.

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
with a paraglider.

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
From there I started with skydiving.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In this picture you can see

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
there is a four-way skydive,

11
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
four people flying together,

12
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and on the left hand side it's the camera flier

13
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with the camera mounted to his helmet

14
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so he can film the whole jump,

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the film itself and also for the judging.

16
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
From regular, relative skydiving

17
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I went on to freeflying.

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.

19
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You can see the skydiver with the red suit,

20
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
he's in a stand-up position.

21
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The one with the yellow-green suit,

22
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
he's flying head-down.

23
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation

24
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in freefall also, with the helmet cam

25
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to film this jump.

26
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.

27
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.

28
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You can imagine with this big surface

29
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of a skysurfing board,

30
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
there is a lot of force, a lot of power.

31
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Of course I can use this power

32
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."

33
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.

34
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Wingsuit flying is a suit,

35
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that I can make fly, just only with my body.

36
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit,

37
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I can make it fly. And as you see

38
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the fall rate is much much slower

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because of the bigger surface.

40
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward

41
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to gain quite some distance.

42
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.

43
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.

44
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
From there with all the skills and knowledge

45
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
from paragliding and all the different disciplines

46
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.

47
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects,

48
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth --

49
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
meaning mountains, cliffs.

50
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling

51
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of being in free fall,

52
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with all the visual references.

53
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So my goal soon was to discover new places

54
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that nobody had jumped before.

55
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump

56
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the Eiger North Face in Switzerland.

57
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn,

58
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
a very famous mountain that probably

59
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
everybody knows in here.

60
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau,

61
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
three very famous mountains in Switzerland.

62
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The special thing on these three jumps were,

63
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.

64
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

65
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So with all this knowledge, I also

67
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
wanted to get into stunts.

68
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So with some friends we started to do different tricks,

69
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
like for example this jump here,

70
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I jumped from a paraglider.

71
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,

72
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because it was very cold in Austria

73
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where we did this filming.

74
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Everybody sitting in a basket,

75
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I was on top of the balloon,

76
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
ready to slide down with my skysurf board.

77
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.

78
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Extreme sports on top level like this

80
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is only possible if you practice step by step,

81
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
if you really work hard on your skills

82
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and on your knowledge.

83
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,

84
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so I'm training a lot.

85
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You need to have the best possible equipment.

86
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And probably the most important is

87
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.

88
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And all this to come as close as possible

89
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to the human dream of being able to fly.

90
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So for 2009,

91
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I'm training hard for my two new projects.

92
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The first one, I want to set a world record

93
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.

94
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I want to set a new record,

95
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with the longest distance ever flown.

96
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
For my second project,

97
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I have a sensational idea

98
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of a jump that never has been done before.

99
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So now, on the following movie you will see

100
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit

101
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
than speaking in English.

102
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Enjoy, and thank you very much.

103
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Applause)

104
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Applause)

105
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
June Cohen: I have some questions.

106
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I think we all might have some questions.

107
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Question one: so does that actually feel

108
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
the way the flying dream does?

109
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Because it looks like it might.

110
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest

111
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.

112
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
JC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?

113
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute

114
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
just seconds before, I would say, impact.

115
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

116
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.

117
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those --

118
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?

119
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.

120
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We're still working on it and we're

121
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
developing the wingsuits to get better performance,

122
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to get more knowledge.

123
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And I believe soon.

124
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.

125
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
What is the -- there was exhaust coming

126
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?

127
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
UE: Nope. It's just smoke.

128
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
JC: Coming off of you?

129
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

130
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
UE: Hopefully not.

131
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

132
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
JC: That seems dangerous.

133
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
UE: No, smoke is for two reasons,

134
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
you can see the speed, you can see the way

135
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
where I was flying.

136
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
That's reason number one. And reason number two:

137
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
it's much easier for the camera guy to film

138
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
If I'm using smoke.

139
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke

140
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
so that you can be tracked. One more question.

141
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
What do you do to to cover your face?

142
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast

143
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and having your whole face smushed backwards.

144
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?

145
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.

146
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
JC: And is that how you usually fly?

147
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet

148
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because of landings -- usually it's difficult --

149
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.

150
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So you have to be prepared.

151
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?

152
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!"

153
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."

154
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and --

155
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

156
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
JC: ...a round of applause...

157
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

158
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
UE: Thank you very much.

159
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

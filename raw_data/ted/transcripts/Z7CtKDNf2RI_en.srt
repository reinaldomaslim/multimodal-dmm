1
0:00:15.7,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm Ellen and I'm totally obsessed with food.

2
0:00:18.82,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But I didn't start out obsessed with food.

3
0:00:20.844,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I started out obsessed with global security policy,

4
0:00:23.32,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because I lived in New York during 9/11 and it was a very relevant thing.

5
0:00:26.8,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I got from global security policy to food

6
0:00:28.777,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because I realized when I'm hungry, I'm really pissed off,

7
0:00:31.52,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I'm assuming the rest of the world is too.

8
0:00:33.72,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Especially if you and your kids are hungry and your neighbor's kids are hungry

9
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and your whole neighborhood is hungry.

10
0:00:39.32,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And actually, it looks like the areas of the world that are hungry

11
0:00:42.5,000 --> 0:00:44,000
are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure.

12
0:00:45.22,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I took a job at the United Nations World Food Programme

13
0:00:47.98,000 --> 0:00:49,000
as a way to try to address these security issues

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
through food security issues.

15
0:00:51.7,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There, I came across what I think is the most brilliant of their programs.

16
0:00:55.217,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's called School Feeding and it's a really simple idea

17
0:00:57.866,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to get in the middle of the cycle of poverty and hunger

18
0:01:00.47,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that continues for a lot of people around the world, and stop it.

19
0:01:03.587,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A free school meal gets kids into school,

20
0:01:05.58,000 --> 0:01:07,000
which is education, the first step out of poverty,

21
0:01:07.98,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but it also gives them the micronutrients and the macronutrients they need

22
0:01:11.5,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to develop mentally and physically.

23
0:01:13.22,000 --> 0:01:16,000
While I was working at the UN, I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.

24
0:01:16.66,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag, called the "Feed Bag" --

25
0:01:20.351,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the Feed Bag.

26
0:01:23.82,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But each bag we'd sell would provide

27
0:01:25.58,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a year's worth of school meals for one kid.

28
0:01:28.14,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's so simple, and we thought, OK,

29
0:01:30.06,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year.

30
0:01:33.46,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We could sell these bags and raise a ton of money and awareness

31
0:01:36.54,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for the World Food Programme.

32
0:01:37.98,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But at the UN, sometimes things move slowly

33
0:01:40.06,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and they basically said no.

34
0:01:41.42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And we thought, this is such a good idea, it's going to raise so much money.

35
0:01:45.06,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So we said screw it, we'll start our own company,

36
0:01:47.42,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which we did, three years ago.

37
0:01:48.873,000 --> 0:01:5,000
That was my first dream, to start this company called FEED,

38
0:01:51.7,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and here's a screenshot of our website.

39
0:01:53.62,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We did a bag for Haiti just a month after the earthquake

40
0:01:56.3,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.

41
0:01:58.38,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So FEED's doing great.

42
0:01:59.62,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We've so far provided 55 million meals to kids around the world

43
0:02:02.62,000 --> 0:02:05,000
by selling now 550,000 bags, a ton of bags, a lot of bags.

44
0:02:06.06,000 --> 0:02:07,000
All this time you're really --

45
0:02:07.82,000 --> 0:02:08,000
hunger is a hard thing to think about,

46
0:02:09.7,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because what we think about is eating.

47
0:02:11.58,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I think about eating a lot and I really love it.

48
0:02:13.86,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And the thing that's strange about international hunger

49
0:02:16.5,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and talking about international issues

50
0:02:18.38,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is that most people want to know:

51
0:02:20.02,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"What are you doing for America's kids?"

52
0:02:22.5,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There's definitely hunger in America:

53
0:02:24.54,000 --> 0:02:26,000
49 million people and almost 16.7 million children.

54
0:02:27.1,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I mean that's pretty dramatic for our own country.

55
0:02:29.5,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Hunger definitely means something different in America

56
0:02:32.06,000 --> 0:02:33,000
than it does internationally,

57
0:02:33.5,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country.

58
0:02:36.7,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity,

59
0:02:39.42,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and it's dramatic.

60
0:02:40.7,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The other thing that's dramatic

61
0:02:42.22,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is that both hunger and obesity have really risen in the last 30 years.

62
0:02:45.7,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Unfortunately, obesity's not only an American problem.

63
0:02:48.3,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's actually been spreading all around the world

64
0:02:50.66,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting.

65
0:02:53.74,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The numbers are pretty crazy.

66
0:02:55.18,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There's a billion people obese or overweight

67
0:02:57.3,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and a billion people hungry.

68
0:02:58.7,000 --> 0:03:,000
So those seem like two bifurcated problems,

69
0:03:00.98,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but I kind of started to think about, you know,

70
0:03:03.22,000 --> 0:03:04,000
what is obesity and hunger?

71
0:03:04.58,000 --> 0:03:05,000
What are both those things about?

72
0:03:06.22,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Well, they're both about food.

73
0:03:07.7,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And when you think about food,

74
0:03:09.7,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture.

75
0:03:14.54,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And agriculture is where food comes from.

76
0:03:17.46,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Agriculture in America's very interesting.

77
0:03:19.5,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's very consolidated

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat.

79
0:03:24.22,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The foods that are produced are, more or less, corn, soy and wheat.

80
0:03:27.42,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And that's three-quarters of the food that we're eating:

81
0:03:30.1,000 --> 0:03:31,000
processed foods and fast foods.

82
0:03:31.66,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Unfortunately, in our agricultural system,

83
0:03:33.7,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we haven't done a good job in the last three decades

84
0:03:36.18,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of exporting those technologies around the world.

85
0:03:38.54,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So African agriculture, which is the place of most hunger in the world,

86
0:03:41.9,000 --> 0:03:43,000
has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen.

87
0:03:44.62,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So somehow we're not making the connect

88
0:03:46.74,000 --> 0:03:48,000
between exporting a good agricultural system

89
0:03:49.1,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that will help feed people all around the world.

90
0:03:51.38,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Who is farming? That's what I was wondering.

91
0:03:53.7,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So I went and stood on a big grain bin in the Midwest,

92
0:03:56.34,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and that really didn't help me understand farming,

93
0:03:58.74,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but I think it's a really cool picture.

94
0:04:00.66,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the reality is that between farmers in America --

95
0:04:03.62,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who actually, quite frankly, when I spend time in the Midwest,

96
0:04:06.58,000 --> 0:04:07,000
are pretty large in general.

97
0:04:08.34,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And their farms are also large.

98
0:04:10.18,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny,

99
0:04:13.18,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and that's because they're starving.

100
0:04:14.919,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers.

101
0:04:17.58,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And most of those people are women --

102
0:04:19.42,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which is a totally other topic that I won't get on right now,

103
0:04:22.34,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but I'd love to do the feminist thing at some point.

104
0:04:24.82,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I think it's really interesting to look at agriculture from these two sides.

105
0:04:28.42,000 --> 0:04:31,000
There's this large, consolidated farming that's led to what we eat in America,

106
0:04:32.14,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and it's really been since around 1980, after the oil crisis,

107
0:04:35.14,000 --> 0:04:36,000
when, you know -- mass consolidation,

108
0:04:36.98,000 --> 0:04:38,000
mass exodus of small farmers in this country.

109
0:04:39.22,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And then in the same time period,

110
0:04:40.86,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing.

111
0:04:43.86,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Unfortunately, what is farmed ends up as what we eat.

112
0:04:46.74,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And in America, a lot of what we eat has led to obesity

113
0:04:49.78,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and has led to a real change

114
0:04:51.78,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in sort of what our diet is, in the last 30 years.

115
0:04:54.9,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's crazy.

116
0:04:56.14,000 --> 0:04:58,000
A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.

117
0:04:59.02,000 --> 0:05:,000
Hello! You don't put soda in bottles.

118
0:05:01.02,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But people do, because it's so cheap,

119
0:05:03.02,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted.

120
0:05:06.3,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I mean, you know, it's not just in our own country,

121
0:05:09.02,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but really we're exporting the system around the world,

122
0:05:11.98,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and when you look at the data of least developed countries --

123
0:05:14.9,000 --> 0:05:17,000
especially in cities, which are growing really rapidly --

124
0:05:18.34,000 --> 0:05:2,000
people are eating American processed foods.

125
0:05:20.66,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And in one generation, they're going from hunger

126
0:05:23.02,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger

127
0:05:26.02,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation.

128
0:05:29.66,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity.

129
0:05:34.34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Not to beat a dead horse, but this is a global food system

130
0:05:37.54,000 --> 0:05:4,000
where there's a billion people hungry and a billion people obese.

131
0:05:40.66,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I think that's the only way to look at it.

132
0:05:42.74,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And instead of taking these two things

133
0:05:44.62,000 --> 0:05:46,000
as bifurcated problems that are very separate,

134
0:05:46.82,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it's really important to look at them as one system.

135
0:05:49.74,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We get a lot of our food from all around the world

136
0:05:52.14,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and people from all around the world are importing our food system,

137
0:05:55.34,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so it's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it.

138
0:05:58.38,000 --> 0:06:,000
I've learned -- and the technology people here,

139
0:06:00.66,000 --> 0:06:01,000
which I'm totally not one of --

140
0:06:02.18,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but apparently, it really takes 30 years

141
0:06:04.14,000 --> 0:06:06,000
for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us,

142
0:06:06.98,000 --> 0:06:08,000
like the mouse and the Internet and Windows.

143
0:06:09.5,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You know, there's 30-year cycles.

144
0:06:11.14,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I think 2010 can be a really interesting year

145
0:06:13.3,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because it is the end of the 30-year cycle,

146
0:06:15.34,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and it's the birthday of the global food system.

147
0:06:17.62,000 --> 0:06:19,000
That's the first birthday I want to talk about.

148
0:06:19.86,000 --> 0:06:22,000
If we really think that this is something that's happened in the last 30 years,

149
0:06:23.62,000 --> 0:06:24,000
there's hope in that.

150
0:06:24.9,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops

151
0:06:26.78,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets, high-fructose corn syrup,

152
0:06:29.74,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the farm crisis in America

153
0:06:31.02,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally.

154
0:06:34.18,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So there's a lot of reasons to take this 30-year time period

155
0:06:37.06,000 --> 0:06:39,000
as sort of the creation of this new food system.

156
0:06:39.54,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole 30-year thing.

157
0:06:42.7,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The icons like Michael Pollan and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish

158
0:06:46.42,000 --> 0:06:48,000
both addressed this last three-decade time period

159
0:06:49.38,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as incredibly relevant for food system change.

160
0:06:52.42,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Well, I really care about 1980

161
0:06:54.02,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because it's also the 30th anniversary of me this year.

162
0:06:57.18,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And so in my lifetime,

163
0:06:59.86,000 --> 0:07:,000
a lot of what's happened in the world --

164
0:07:01.82,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and being a person obsessed with food --

165
0:07:03.78,000 --> 0:07:04,000
a lot of this has really changed.

166
0:07:05.66,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So my second dream is that I think we can look to the next 30 years

167
0:07:09.78,000 --> 0:07:11,000
as a time to change the food system again.

168
0:07:12.22,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And we know what's happened in the past,

169
0:07:14.18,000 --> 0:07:16,000
so if we start now and we look at technologies

170
0:07:16.38,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and improvements to the food system long-term,

171
0:07:18.58,000 --> 0:07:2,000
we might be able to recreate the food system

172
0:07:20.7,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so when I give my next talk and I'm 60 years old,

173
0:07:23.06,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I'll be able to say that it's been a success.

174
0:07:25.22,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So I'm announcing today the start of a new organization,

175
0:07:27.9,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or a new fund within the FEED Foundation, called the 30 Project.

176
0:07:30.94,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the 30 Project is really focused

177
0:07:32.7,000 --> 0:07:34,000
on these long-term ideas for food system change.

178
0:07:35.54,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And I think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger

179
0:07:39.06,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity,

180
0:07:41.5,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we might actually look for long-term solutions

181
0:07:43.86,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that will make the food system better for everyone.

182
0:07:46.3,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We all tend to think that these systems are quite different

183
0:07:49.1,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world,

184
0:07:51.9,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but if we take a 30-year view, there's more hope in collaborative ideas.

185
0:07:55.34,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations

186
0:07:58.34,000 --> 0:07:59,000
like the ONE campaign and Slow Food,

187
0:08:00.1,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which don't seem right now to have much in common,

188
0:08:02.5,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we can talk about holistic, long-term, systemic solutions

189
0:08:05.38,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that will improve food for everyone.

190
0:08:07.34,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Some ideas I've had is like, look, the reality is --

191
0:08:09.793,000 --> 0:08:11,000
kids in the South Bronx need apples and carrots

192
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and so do kids in Botswana.

193
0:08:13.94,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods?

194
0:08:16.9,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Another thing that's become incredibly global is production of meat and fish.

195
0:08:20.58,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Understanding how to produce protein

196
0:08:22.34,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in a way that's healthy for the environment

197
0:08:24.38,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and healthy for people

198
0:08:25.66,000 --> 0:08:28,000
will be incredibly important to address things like climate change

199
0:08:28.82,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and how we use petrochemical fertilizers.

200
0:08:30.9,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And, you know, these are really relevant topics

201
0:08:33.22,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that are long-term and important

202
0:08:35.06,000 --> 0:08:38,000
for both people in Africa who are small farmers

203
0:08:38.14,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and people in America who are farmers and eaters.

204
0:08:40.7,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And I also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way,

205
0:08:44.22,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where we actually price the negative externalities

206
0:08:46.9,000 --> 0:08:48,000
like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff

207
0:08:49.62,000 --> 0:08:5,000
into the price of a bag of chips --

208
0:08:51.46,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple,

209
0:08:56.14,000 --> 0:09:,000
then maybe it's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice

210
0:09:00.34,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because the choices are actually choices

211
0:09:02.3,000 --> 0:09:05,000
instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn, soy and wheat.

212
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The 30Project.org is launched

213
0:09:07.7,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start.

214
0:09:10.66,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And it'll be growing over the next few months.

215
0:09:12.86,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But I really hope that you will all think of ways

216
0:09:15.22,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that you can look long-term at things like the food system

217
0:09:17.98,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and make change.

218
0:09:19.22,000 --> 0:09:24,000

1
0:00:13.507,000 --> 0:00:15,000
If you happened to be in the town of Lubec, Maine

2
0:00:16.31,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in July of 2016,

3
0:00:18.619,000 --> 0:00:2,000
you may have seen something a little curious on the horizon

4
0:00:21.591,000 --> 0:00:23,000
when you looked out across the bay.

5
0:00:24.363,000 --> 0:00:25,000
In the distance,

6
0:00:25.649,000 --> 0:00:27,000
on an otherwise uninhabited island,

7
0:00:28.259,000 --> 0:00:31,000
loomed large black letters that spelled the word "FOREVER."

8
0:00:31.981,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The sign was 15 feet tall and 50 feet wide,

9
0:00:35.981,000 --> 0:00:39,000
large enough so that on a clear day, you really could see "FOREVER,"

10
0:00:40.331,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the word perfectly visible and legible in the distance.

11
0:00:44.061,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But on some days,

12
0:00:45.426,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a thick white fog would roll in off the ocean,

13
0:00:49.172,000 --> 0:00:52,000
erasing the word and the view altogether.

14
0:00:53.291,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And sometimes, like in this video,

15
0:00:55.839,000 --> 0:00:59,000
you could barely see "FOREVER" peeking out of the shifting fog,

16
0:01:00.235,000 --> 0:01:04,000
accompanied only by the rhythmic warning sounds of fog horns.

17
0:01:04.613,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Sound of fog horn)

18
0:01:09.8,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Sound of fog horn)

19
0:01:13.792,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It started out as a fairly simple idea,

20
0:01:16.307,000 --> 0:01:17,000
albeit a little strange,

21
0:01:18.022,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to put the word "FOREVER" in the landscape

22
0:01:20.259,000 --> 0:01:22,000
so it could appear and disappear in the fog.

23
0:01:23.601,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But it took over a year to plan and execute,

24
0:01:26.698,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and it required the help of so many people,

25
0:01:29.452,000 --> 0:01:31,000
like the lobster boat captain,

26
0:01:31.595,000 --> 0:01:34,000
who helped transport all of the materials to the island.

27
0:01:35.27,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And the volunteers, who helped carry thousands of pounds of wood and steel

28
0:01:39.462,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to the top of the hill through waist-high shrubs.

29
0:01:43.791,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And in the end,

30
0:01:45.229,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"FOREVER" only lasted for three weeks.

31
0:01:47.942,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:50.784,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So if you're wondering why I did it at all,

33
0:01:53.626,000 --> 0:01:56,000
as I often did during that process,

34
0:01:56.911,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it might help for you to know a little bit more about me

35
0:01:59.561,000 --> 0:02:,000
and my upbringing.

36
0:02:02.41,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I grew up in an evangelical Christian family.

37
0:02:05.696,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And although I'm an atheist today,

38
0:02:08.157,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I've realized that my religious upbringing

39
0:02:10.71,000 --> 0:02:14,000
has played a really important role in shaping the person that I've become.

40
0:02:16.109,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In 1986, when I was five years old,

41
0:02:19.643,000 --> 0:02:22,000
my parents became missionaries to South Africa.

42
0:02:23.237,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And that was during the last few years of the apartheid,

43
0:02:26.428,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so we lived in an all-white neighborhood,

44
0:02:29.427,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and I attended an all-white public school,

45
0:02:32.585,000 --> 0:02:34,000
while my parents helped found a multiracial church

46
0:02:35.196,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in downtown Cape Town.

47
0:02:38.37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Because I was so young,

48
0:02:39.545,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it was impossible for me to understand

49
0:02:41.846,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the magnitude of what was happening in South Africa at that time.

50
0:02:47.887,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I witnessed the racism and oppression of people of color I knew and loved

51
0:02:52.81,000 --> 0:02:53,000
on a daily basis,

52
0:02:54.363,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but because of my own skin color,

53
0:02:56.736,000 --> 0:02:58,000
there was no way I could fully comprehend it.

54
0:03:00.276,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But I had the privilege to experience, firsthand,

55
0:03:04.175,000 --> 0:03:08,000
one of the most influential social movements of the 20th century.

56
0:03:08.921,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And the thing that left a long-lasting impression on me

57
0:03:12.966,000 --> 0:03:14,000
was how the people I met in South Africa

58
0:03:15.688,000 --> 0:03:19,000
could envision a better future for themselves and their country.

59
0:03:20.228,000 --> 0:03:23,000
A future they really believed was possible.

60
0:03:23.974,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And then they worked together, relentlessly, for decades,

61
0:03:27.855,000 --> 0:03:31,000
until they achieved that extraordinary historic change.

62
0:03:32.958,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I was there to see Nelson Mandela released from prison,

63
0:03:36.246,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I watched an entire country begin a major transformation.

64
0:03:41.913,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And that transformed me as a person.

65
0:03:44.974,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It instilled in me a sense of wonder and optimism

66
0:03:49.855,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and possibility that permeates everything I create.

67
0:03:55.178,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I make sculptures like "FOREVER"

68
0:03:56.827,000 --> 0:04:01,000
as a way of giving physical, tangible forms to language and time.

69
0:04:02.908,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Those powerful but invisible forces

70
0:04:05.817,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that shape the way we perceive and experience our realities.

71
0:04:10.802,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And in doing so, I try to give other people the opportunity

72
0:04:14.934,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to reflect on their own perception of reality

73
0:04:18.466,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and inspire them to wonder and imagine

74
0:04:21.59,000 --> 0:04:23,000
what else might be possible.

75
0:04:25.371,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I often use signs to do this,

76
0:04:27.268,000 --> 0:04:31,000
because of how simply and effectively they're able to grab our attention

77
0:04:32.17,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and communicate information.

78
0:04:34.965,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They often point out things we would otherwise overlook,

79
0:04:38.203,000 --> 0:04:42,000
like this sign on the side of the highway in Texas.

80
0:04:42.889,000 --> 0:04:43,000
[TEMPTATIONS]

81
0:04:44.063,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They can often signify things that we can't see at all,

82
0:04:46.713,000 --> 0:04:48,000
like the distance to our destination.

83
0:04:48.776,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Signs often help to orient us in the world

84
0:04:52.038,000 --> 0:04:53,000
[You are on an island]

85
0:04:53.213,000 --> 0:04:54,000
by telling us where we are now

86
0:04:54.776,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and what's happening in the present moment,

87
0:04:57.014,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but they can also help us zoom out,

88
0:04:59.704,000 --> 0:05:01,000
shift our perspective

89
0:05:01.744,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and get a glimpse of the bigger picture.

90
0:05:05.014,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Imagine, for example,

91
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you're walking down the street in Philadelphia.

92
0:05:11.081,000 --> 0:05:14,000
A city in the US that contains so much history,

93
0:05:14.755,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the birthplace of our constitution.

94
0:05:18.565,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But imagine you're walking down the street

95
0:05:20.609,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in an area that's undergoing a huge transformation

96
0:05:23.8,000 --> 0:05:24,000
due to gentrification.

97
0:05:26.069,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And as you walk down that street,

98
0:05:28.157,000 --> 0:05:3,000
you notice something flashing up above you.

99
0:05:30.807,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So you look up and you see this.

100
0:05:34.371,000 --> 0:05:36,000
A flashing neon sign that says

101
0:05:36.493,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"All the light you see is from the past,"

102
0:05:39.434,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and then "All you see is past,"

103
0:05:42.053,000 --> 0:05:45,000
before turning off completely for a brief moment.

104
0:05:46.723,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It asks you to stop and notice

105
0:05:48.613,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the history embedded in everything that you see.

106
0:05:53.486,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And it reminds you

107
0:05:54.684,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that because light takes time to travel across space,

108
0:05:58.878,000 --> 0:06:01,000
even from just across the street or across the room,

109
0:06:02.561,000 --> 0:06:04,000
everything you're seeing in the present moment

110
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is technically an image of the past.

111
0:06:10.565,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Signs influence the way we all navigate the world,

112
0:06:13.994,000 --> 0:06:15,000
which means they have the ability to create

113
0:06:16.885,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a collective experience or understanding.

114
0:06:20.807,000 --> 0:06:22,000
My time in South Africa taught me

115
0:06:23.046,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that when people are able to find common ground

116
0:06:26.483,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and work together towards a mutual goal,

117
0:06:29.847,000 --> 0:06:32,000
powerful things can happen and so much more becomes possible.

118
0:06:34.34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I want to create more opportunities

119
0:06:36.832,000 --> 0:06:39,000
for people to find that kind of common ground.

120
0:06:40.237,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I want people to feel the power of collaboration,

121
0:06:44.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
sometimes quite literally.

122
0:06:47.252,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A few years ago,

123
0:06:48.571,000 --> 0:06:49,000
a friend of mine showed me

124
0:06:49.993,000 --> 0:06:53,000
how our bodies can safely conduct small amounts of electricity.

125
0:06:54.982,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And if you hold hands with another person,

126
0:06:57.704,000 --> 0:07:,000
a small electrical current can pass through your held hands

127
0:07:01.379,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and become like a switch that can trigger something else to happen.

128
0:07:06.275,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So last year, I used that form of human connection

129
0:07:11.005,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to activate an inflatable sculpture.

130
0:07:14.3,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I put two sensors on a platform far enough apart

131
0:07:17.516,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so that one person can't make it work on their own.

132
0:07:20.903,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But when two or more people work together

133
0:07:23.198,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to complete that electrical circuit,

134
0:07:25.784,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the inflatable comes to life.

135
0:07:28.522,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And it begins to fill with air,

136
0:07:31.276,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and the longer people hold hands, the larger it becomes,

137
0:07:34.871,000 --> 0:07:37,000
expanding into the words "You are magic."

138
0:07:38.228,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Music, birds chirping)

139
0:07:42.411,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I always love to see

140
0:07:43.768,000 --> 0:07:46,000
how each group of people finds a different way

141
0:07:47.426,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to bridge that physical and metaphorical divide.

142
0:07:52.331,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But as soon as they release their hands and break that connection,

143
0:07:57.069,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the words immediately begin to slouch and fall over

144
0:08:01.147,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and eventually return to a lifeless pile of fabric on the ground.

145
0:08:06.733,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Applause)

146
0:08:15.422,000 --> 0:08:19,000
At this moment in time, I think we could all agree

147
0:08:19.673,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that the future feels pretty bleak and uncertain.

148
0:08:25.709,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But maybe the hope

149
0:08:27.352,000 --> 0:08:32,000
for a brighter, more sustainable, more equitable future

150
0:08:32.617,000 --> 0:08:35,000
depends first on our ability to imagine it.

151
0:08:38.101,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But after we imagine it,

152
0:08:39.934,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we actually have to believe it's possible.

153
0:08:44.006,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And then we have to find common ground

154
0:08:47.442,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with people we would maybe otherwise disagree with

155
0:08:51.371,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and work together towards that mutual goal.

156
0:08:55.315,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And if we do that, I believe we have the capacity for magic.

157
0:09:00.641,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So if you can humor me for one more minute,

158
0:09:04.101,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'm going to ask everyone in this theater to hold hands.

159
0:09:14.602,000 --> 0:09:16,000
When was the last time you held hands with a stranger?

160
0:09:17.349,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

161
0:09:21.078,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And if you feel comfortable,

162
0:09:22.546,000 --> 0:09:25,000
go ahead and make that metaphorical gesture

163
0:09:26.332,000 --> 0:09:27,000
of reaching across the aisle.

164
0:09:28.315,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And after you've held hands with people on either side of you,

165
0:09:31.998,000 --> 0:09:33,000
if you feel comfortable, please close your eyes.

166
0:09:35.522,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now take a minute to imagine what you want,

167
0:09:39.289,000 --> 0:09:42,000
what you want the future to look like.

168
0:09:42.797,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And give yourself permission to be at least a little bit idealistic.

169
0:09:50.075,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What do you want to see change or happen in your own life as an individual?

170
0:09:56.868,000 --> 0:10:01,000
What do you want to see change or happen for everyone, for the planet?

171
0:10:04.3,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Can you picture it?

172
0:10:06.641,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And can you start to see how, if we all worked together,

173
0:10:11.092,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it might actually be possible?

174
0:10:15.512,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now open your eyes,

175
0:10:18.275,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and let's make it real.

176
0:10:20.998,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Thank you.

177
0:10:22.197,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Applause)

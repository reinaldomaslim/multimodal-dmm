1
0:00:12.914,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Good afternoon.

2
0:00:14.241,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name is Uldus.

3
0:00:15.782,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I am a photo-based artist from Russia.

4
0:00:19.755,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I started my way around six years ago

5
0:00:22.784,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with ironic self-portraits

6
0:00:25.81,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to lay open so many stereotypes

7
0:00:28.78,000 --> 0:00:31,000
about nationalities, genders,

8
0:00:32.222,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and social issues —

9
0:00:33.662,000 --> 0:00:36,000
["I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with kids!"] ["Vodka = water. I love vodka!"] (Laughter) —

10
0:00:36.665,000 --> 0:00:4,000
using photography as my tool to send a message. ["Marry me, I need a visa."]

11
0:00:41.233,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Today, I am still performing in front of the camera

12
0:00:44.315,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.

13
0:00:48.162,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I focus on balancing meaningful message,

14
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:57,000
aesthetic, beauty, composition, some irony, and artifacts.

15
0:00:57.87,000 --> 0:01:,000
Today, I'm going to tell you about my project,

16
0:01:01.312,000 --> 0:01:03,000
which is named Desperate Romantics.

17
0:01:04.271,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They're my artifacts, or paintings

18
0:01:05.989,000 --> 0:01:09,000
from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England

19
0:01:10.817,000 --> 0:01:12,000
mid-19th century.

20
0:01:12.926,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I took the painting

21
0:01:14.94,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and gifted new, contemporary meaning

22
0:01:18.182,000 --> 0:01:21,000
talking about issues which are surrounding me

23
0:01:22.037,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in Russia,

24
0:01:23.377,000 --> 0:01:26,000
capturing people who are non-models

25
0:01:26.698,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but have an interesting story.

26
0:01:29.78,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This boy is a professional dancer,

27
0:01:31.929,000 --> 0:01:32,000
only 12 years old,

28
0:01:33.512,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but at secondary school, he hides his dancing classes

29
0:01:37.44,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and is wearing the mask of brutality,

30
0:01:39.821,000 --> 0:01:43,000
trying to be united with the rest of his classmates

31
0:01:44.145,000 --> 0:01:46,000
like a storm trooper has no personality.

32
0:01:46.877,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But this boy has goals and dreams

33
0:01:49.577,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but hides it to be socially accepted,

34
0:01:52.57,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because being different isn't easy,

35
0:01:55.218,000 --> 0:01:57,000
especially in Russia.

36
0:01:57.515,000 --> 0:02:,000
Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric.

37
0:02:01.261,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And this is Nikita,

38
0:02:03.376,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a security guard from one of the bars

39
0:02:06.74,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in St. Petersburg.

40
0:02:08.607,000 --> 0:02:11,000
He likes to say, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"

41
0:02:12.207,000 --> 0:02:13,000
quoting Hulk from the movie,

42
0:02:14.198,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but I've never seen him angry.

43
0:02:16.442,000 --> 0:02:19,000
He hides his sensitivities and romantic side,

44
0:02:19.947,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because in Russia, among guys,

45
0:02:21.938,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that's not cool to be romantic,

46
0:02:23.772,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but it's cool to be surrounded with women

47
0:02:26.52,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and look like an aggressive hulk.

48
0:02:28.823,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:31.1,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Sometimes, in my project,

50
0:02:33.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I would take the painting

51
0:02:35.35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and give it new meaning

52
0:02:38.205,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and new temptation about it.

53
0:02:41.04,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Sometimes, I would compare facial features

54
0:02:44.572,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and playing with words:

55
0:02:46.858,000 --> 0:02:5,000
irony, Iron Man, ironing man.

56
0:02:51.232,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:54.527,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Through the artifacts,

58
0:02:56.02,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I bring social issues

59
0:02:58.1,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which surround me in Russia into the conversation.

60
0:03:01.806,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Interesting fact about marriage in Russia,

61
0:03:04.809,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that most of the 18, 19-year-old girls

62
0:03:08.285,000 --> 0:03:11,000
are already ready, and dream to get married.

63
0:03:11.525,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We're taught from childhood,

64
0:03:13.1,000 --> 0:03:16,000
successful marriage means successful life,

65
0:03:16.385,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so most of the girls kind of fight

66
0:03:18.949,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to get a good husband.

67
0:03:21.534,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And what about me?

68
0:03:23.787,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I'm 27 years old.

69
0:03:25.822,000 --> 0:03:27,000
For Russian society, I'm an old maid

70
0:03:28.703,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and hopeless to ever get married.

71
0:03:31.526,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask,

72
0:03:34.822,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in the wedding dress, all desperate in my garden.

73
0:03:39.209,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But remember, irony is the key,

74
0:03:41.93,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and this is actually to motivate girls

75
0:03:44.283,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to fight for goals, for dreams,

76
0:03:47.185,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and change stereotypes.

77
0:03:50.481,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Be brave. Be ironic — it helps.

78
0:03:53.823,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Be funny and create some magic.

79
0:03:57.962,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Applause)

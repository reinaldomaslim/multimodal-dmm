1
0:00:14.246,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I am the proud father of two beautiful children,

2
0:00:19.217,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Elijah, 15, and Octavia, 12.

3
0:00:24.313,000 --> 0:00:27,000
When Elijah was in the fourth grade,

4
0:00:27.654,000 --> 0:00:28,000
he came to me,

5
0:00:29.242,000 --> 0:00:31,000
came home from school bubbling over with excitement

6
0:00:32.127,000 --> 0:00:36,000
about what he had learned that day about African-American history.

7
0:00:37.07,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, I'm an African-American and cultural studies professor,

8
0:00:41.526,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and so, as you can imagine,

9
0:00:43.691,000 --> 0:00:45,000
African-American culture is kind of serious around my home.

10
0:00:46.642,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I was very proud that my son was excited about what he had learned

11
0:00:50.912,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that day in school.

12
0:00:52.087,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I said, "What did you learn?"

13
0:00:54.051,000 --> 0:00:57,000
He said, "I learned about Rosa Parks."

14
0:00:57.907,000 --> 0:01:,000
I said, "OK, what did you learn about Rosa Parks?"

15
0:01:00.983,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He said, "I learned that Rosa Parks was this frail, old black woman

16
0:01:06.521,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in the 1950s

17
0:01:08.395,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in Montgomery, Alabama.

18
0:01:10.853,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And she sat down on this bus,

19
0:01:13.127,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and she had tired feet,

20
0:01:15.119,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and when the bus driver told her to give up her seat to a white patron,

21
0:01:20.076,000 --> 0:01:22,000
she refused because she had tired feet.

22
0:01:22.776,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It had been a long day,

23
0:01:24.065,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and she was tired of oppression,

24
0:01:25.907,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and she didn't give up her seat.

25
0:01:27.82,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And she marched with Martin Luther King,

26
0:01:29.773,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and she believed in nonviolence."

27
0:01:31.989,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I guess he must have looked at my face

28
0:01:35.177,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and saw that I was a little less than impressed

29
0:01:39.731,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by his

30
0:01:41.484,000 --> 0:01:42,000
... um ...

31
0:01:42.754,000 --> 0:01:43,000
history lesson.

32
0:01:44.134,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so he stopped, and he was like, "Dad, what's wrong? What did I get wrong?"

33
0:01:48.812,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I said, "Son, you didn't get anything wrong,

34
0:01:50.925,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but I think your teacher got a whole lot of things wrong."

35
0:01:53.709,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:54.743,000 --> 0:01:55,000
He said, "Well, what do you mean?"

37
0:01:56.439,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I said, "Rosa Parks was not tired.

38
0:02:00.78,000 --> 0:02:02,000
She was not old.

39
0:02:03.353,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And she certainly didn't have tired feet."

40
0:02:06.433,000 --> 0:02:07,000
He said, "What?"

41
0:02:07.621,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I said, "Yes!

42
0:02:08.803,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Rosa Parks was only 42 years old" --

43
0:02:12.261,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Yeah, you're shocked, right? Never heard that.

44
0:02:14.629,000 --> 0:02:15,000
"Rosa Parks was only 42 years old,

45
0:02:16.61,000 --> 0:02:2,000
she had only worked six hours that day, and she was a seamstress

46
0:02:21.378,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and her feet were just fine.

47
0:02:23.77,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:24.925,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The only thing that she was tired of

49
0:02:27.648,000 --> 0:02:29,000
was she was tired of inequality.

50
0:02:30.095,000 --> 0:02:32,000
She was tired of oppression."

51
0:02:32.185,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And my son said,

52
0:02:33.497,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Well, why would my teacher tell me this thing?

53
0:02:37.479,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This is confusing for me."

54
0:02:39.377,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Because he loved his teacher, and she was a good teacher,

55
0:02:42.803,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a young-ish, 20-something white woman,

56
0:02:45.77,000 --> 0:02:48,000
really, really smart, pushed him, so I liked her as well.

57
0:02:49.505,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But he was confused. "Why would she tell me this?" he said.

58
0:02:52.522,000 --> 0:02:55,000
He said, "Dad, tell me more. Tell me more. Tell me more about Rosa Parks."

59
0:02:56.057,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I said, "Son, I'll do you one better."

60
0:02:58.884,000 --> 0:02:59,000
He was like, "What?"

61
0:03:00.061,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I said, "I'm going to buy her autobiography,

62
0:03:02.145,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I'm going to let you read it yourself."

63
0:03:04.207,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:07.787,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So as you can imagine,

65
0:03:10.453,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Elijah wasn't too excited about this new, lengthy homework assignment

66
0:03:15.114,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that his dad had just given him, but he took it in stride.

67
0:03:19.451,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And he came back after he had read it,

68
0:03:23.121,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and he was excited about what he had learned.

69
0:03:27.063,000 --> 0:03:33,000
He said, "Dad, not only was Rosa Parks not initially into nonviolence,

70
0:03:34.086,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but Rosa Parks's grandfather, who basically raised her

71
0:03:38.646,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and was light enough to pass as white,

72
0:03:40.83,000 --> 0:03:44,000
used to walk around town with his gun in his holster,

73
0:03:45.494,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and people knew if you messed with Mr. Parks's children or grandchildren,

74
0:03:50.473,000 --> 0:03:54,000
he would put a cap in your proverbial bottom."

75
0:03:54.708,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:55.934,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Right?

77
0:03:57.118,000 --> 0:03:59,000
He was not someone to mess with.

78
0:03:59.922,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And he said, "I also learned that Rosa Parks married a man in Raymond

79
0:04:05.814,000 --> 0:04:08,000
who was a lot like her grandfather."

80
0:04:09.884,000 --> 0:04:1,000
He would organize.

81
0:04:11.353,000 --> 0:04:13,000
He was a civil rights activist.

82
0:04:13.693,000 --> 0:04:16,000
He would organize events

83
0:04:17.332,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and sometimes the events would be at Rosa Parks's home.

84
0:04:22.295,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And one time Rosa Parks remarked

85
0:04:24.339,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that there were so many guns on the table,

86
0:04:26.678,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because they were prepared for somebody to come busting into the door

87
0:04:29.97,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that they were prepared for whatever was going to go down,

88
0:04:32.757,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that Rosa Parks said, "There were so many guns on the table

89
0:04:35.611,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that I forgot to even offer them coffee or food."

90
0:04:38.832,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This is who Rosa Parks was.

91
0:04:41.427,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And in fact, Rosa Parks, when she was sitting on that bus that day,

92
0:04:46.137,000 --> 0:04:48,000
waiting for those police officers to arrive

93
0:04:48.799,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and not knowing what was going to happen to her,

94
0:04:51.77,000 --> 0:04:53,000
she was not thinking about Martin Luther King,

95
0:04:53.951,000 --> 0:04:54,000
who she barely knew.

96
0:04:55.431,000 --> 0:04:57,000
She was not thinking about nonviolence or Gandhi.

97
0:04:58.295,000 --> 0:04:59,000
She was thinking about her grandfather,

98
0:05:00.25,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a gun-toting, take-no-mess grandfather.

99
0:05:04.3,000 --> 0:05:07,000
That's who Rosa Parks was thinking about.

100
0:05:07.862,000 --> 0:05:1,000
My son was mesmerized by Rosa Parks,

101
0:05:11.56,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and I was proud of him to see this excitement.

102
0:05:15.125,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But then I still had a problem.

103
0:05:17.207,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Because I still had to go his school

104
0:05:19.786,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and address the issue with his teacher,

105
0:05:21.817,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because I didn't want her to continue to teach the kids

106
0:05:25.14,000 --> 0:05:27,000
obviously false history.

107
0:05:27.885,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So I'm agonizing over this,

108
0:05:29.34,000 --> 0:05:32,000
primarily because I understand, as an African-American man,

109
0:05:32.824,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that whenever you talk to whites about racism

110
0:05:35.192,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or anything that's racially sensitive,

111
0:05:37.221,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there's usually going to be a challenge.

112
0:05:39.203,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is what white sociologist Robin DiAngelo calls "white fragility."

113
0:05:45.287,000 --> 0:05:46,000
She argues that, in fact,

114
0:05:47.108,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because whites have so little experience being challenged

115
0:05:51.171,000 --> 0:05:52,000
about their white privilege

116
0:05:52.668,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that whenever even the most minute challenge is brought before them,

117
0:05:56.187,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they usually cry,

118
0:05:58.034,000 --> 0:05:59,000
get angry

119
0:05:59.209,000 --> 0:06:,000
or run.

120
0:06:00.384,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:01.413,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And I have experienced them all.

122
0:06:04.424,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And so, when I was contemplating confronting his teacher,

123
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I wasn't happy about it,

124
0:06:11.857,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but I was like, this is a necessary evil

125
0:06:13.944,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of being a black parent trying to raise self-actualized black children.

126
0:06:18.27,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So I called Elijah to me and said,

127
0:06:19.971,000 --> 0:06:23,000
"Elijah, I'm going to set up an appointment with your teacher

128
0:06:24.768,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and try and correct this

129
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and maybe your principal.

130
0:06:27.261,000 --> 0:06:28,000
What do you think?"

131
0:06:28.686,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And Elijah said,

132
0:06:29.861,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Dad, I have a better idea."

133
0:06:33.021,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And I said, "Really? What's your idea?"

134
0:06:34.998,000 --> 0:06:38,000
He said, "We have a public speaking assignment,

135
0:06:39.652,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and why don't I use that public speaking assignment

136
0:06:42.241,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to talk about debunking the myths of Rosa Parks?"

137
0:06:46.756,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I was like,

138
0:06:48.815,000 --> 0:06:49,000
"Well, that is a good idea."

139
0:06:51.85,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So Elijah goes to school,

140
0:06:55.107,000 --> 0:06:56,000
he does his presentation,

141
0:06:56.91,000 --> 0:06:57,000
he comes back home,

142
0:06:58.428,000 --> 0:07:,000
and I could see something positive happened.

143
0:07:00.825,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I said, "Well, what happened, son?"

144
0:07:03.231,000 --> 0:07:05,000
He said, "Well, later on in that day,

145
0:07:05.435,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the teacher pulled me aside,

146
0:07:07.403,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and she apologized to me for giving that misinformation."

147
0:07:12.771,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And then something else miraculous happened the next day.

148
0:07:16.323,000 --> 0:07:19,000
She actually taught a new lesson on Rosa Parks,

149
0:07:20.056,000 --> 0:07:24,000
filling in the gaps that she had left and correcting the mistakes that she made.

150
0:07:24.394,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I was so, so proud of my son.

151
0:07:29.956,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But then I thought about it.

152
0:07:33.875,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I got angry.

153
0:07:35.565,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I got real angry.

154
0:07:38.344,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Why? Why would I get angry?

155
0:07:40.878,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Because my nine-year-old son had to educate his teacher

156
0:07:45.876,000 --> 0:07:46,000
about his history,

157
0:07:47.391,000 --> 0:07:5,000
had to educate his teacher about his own humanity.

158
0:07:50.465,000 --> 0:07:51,000
He's nine years old.

159
0:07:52.784,000 --> 0:07:55,000
He should be thinking about basketball or soccer

160
0:07:56.025,000 --> 0:07:58,000
or the latest movie.

161
0:07:58.52,000 --> 0:08:02,000
He should not be thinking about having to take the responsibility

162
0:08:02.711,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of educating his teacher,

163
0:08:05.098,000 --> 0:08:08,000
his students,

164
0:08:08.185,000 --> 0:08:1,000
about himself, about his history.

165
0:08:10.676,000 --> 0:08:11,000
That was a burden that I carried.

166
0:08:12.327,000 --> 0:08:14,000
That was a burden that my parents carried

167
0:08:14.374,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and generations before them carried.

168
0:08:16.128,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And now I was seeing my son take on that burden, too.

169
0:08:21.513,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You see, that's why Rosa Parks wrote her autobiography.

170
0:08:26.467,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Because during her lifetime,

171
0:08:28.229,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if you can imagine,

172
0:08:29.769,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you do this amazing thing,

173
0:08:34.408,000 --> 0:08:37,000
you're alive and you're talking about your civil rights activism,

174
0:08:38.351,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and a story emerges

175
0:08:40.308,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in which somebody is telling the world

176
0:08:43.223,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that you were old and you had tired feet

177
0:08:45.887,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and you just were an accidental activist,

178
0:08:48.232,000 --> 0:08:51,000
not that you had been activist by then for 20 years,

179
0:08:52.117,000 --> 0:08:55,000
not that the boycott had been planned for months,

180
0:08:55.515,000 --> 0:08:59,000
not that you were not even the first or the second or even the third woman

181
0:09:00.01,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to be arrested for doing that.

182
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You become an accidental activist, even in her own lifetime.

183
0:09:08.016,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So she wrote that autobiography to correct the record,

184
0:09:11.17,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because what she wanted to remind people of

185
0:09:15.468,000 --> 0:09:17,000
was that this

186
0:09:17.591,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is what it was like

187
0:09:19.813,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in the 1950s

188
0:09:23.008,000 --> 0:09:25,000
trying to be black in America

189
0:09:25.749,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and fight for your rights.

190
0:09:28.561,000 --> 0:09:31,000
During the year, a little over a year, that the boycott lasted,

191
0:09:33.298,000 --> 0:09:35,000
there were over four church bombings.

192
0:09:35.951,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Martin Luther King's house was bombed twice.

193
0:09:39.392,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Other civil rights leaders' houses were bombed in Birmingham.

194
0:09:43.587,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Rosa Parks's husband slept at night with a shotgun,

195
0:09:48.879,000 --> 0:09:5,000
because they would get constant death threats.

196
0:09:51.17,000 --> 0:09:53,000
In fact, Rosa Parks's mother lived with them,

197
0:09:53.7,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and sometimes she would stay on the phone for hours

198
0:09:56.2,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so that nobody would call in with death threats,

199
0:09:59.384,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because it was constant and persistent.

200
0:10:01.633,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In fact, there was so much tension,

201
0:10:04.284,000 --> 0:10:06,000
there was so much pressure, there was so much terrorism,

202
0:10:06.965,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that Rosa Parks and her husband, they lost their jobs,

203
0:10:09.516,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and they became unemployable

204
0:10:11.354,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and eventually had to leave and move out of the South.

205
0:10:17.558,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is a civil rights reality

206
0:10:20.536,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that Rosa Parks wanted to make sure that people understood.

207
0:10:25.981,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So you say, "Well, David, what does that have to do with me?

208
0:10:31.576,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I'm a well-meaning person.

209
0:10:33.53,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I didn't own slaves.

210
0:10:35.088,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I'm not trying to whitewash history.

211
0:10:36.867,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I'm a good guy. I'm a good person."

212
0:10:40.433,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Let me tell you what it has to do with you,

213
0:10:42.47,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and I'll tell it to you by telling you a story

214
0:10:44.958,000 --> 0:10:47,000
about a professor of mine, a white professor,

215
0:10:48.509,000 --> 0:10:52,000
when I was in graduate school, who was a brilliant, brilliant individual.

216
0:10:52.898,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We'll call him "Fred."

217
0:10:55.061,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And Fred was writing this history of the civil rights movement,

218
0:10:59.734,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but he was writing specifically about a moment

219
0:11:02.239,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that happened to him in North Carolina

220
0:11:04.175,000 --> 0:11:08,000
when this white man shot this black man in cold blood in a wide-open space

221
0:11:08.462,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and was never convicted.

222
0:11:10.769,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And so it was this great book,

223
0:11:12.561,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and he called together a couple of his professor friends

224
0:11:16.297,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and he called me to read a draft of it before the final submission.

225
0:11:20.902,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I was flattered that he called me;

226
0:11:22.768,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I was only a graduate student then.

227
0:11:24.512,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I was kind of feeling myself a little bit. I was like, "OK, yeah."

228
0:11:28.444,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I'm sitting around amongst intellectuals,

229
0:11:31.038,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and I read the draft of the book.

230
0:11:35.564,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And there was a moment in the book

231
0:11:37.583,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that struck me as being deeply problematic,

232
0:11:40.25,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and so I said,

233
0:11:41.439,000 --> 0:11:44,000
"Fred," as we were sitting around talking about this draft,

234
0:11:45.039,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I said, "Fred, I've got a real problem with this moment that you talk

235
0:11:49.75,000 --> 0:11:52,000
about your maid in your book."

236
0:11:52.992,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And I could see Fred get a little "tight," as we say.

237
0:11:59.709,000 --> 0:12:02,000
He said, "What do you mean? That's a great story.

238
0:12:03.496,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It happened just like I said."

239
0:12:05.371,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I said, "Mmm ... can I give you another scenario?"

240
0:12:08.95,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now, what's the story?

241
0:12:10.303,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It was 1968.

242
0:12:12.649,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Martin Luther King had just been assassinated.

243
0:12:16.443,000 --> 0:12:2,000
His maid, "domestic" -- we'll call her "Mabel,"

244
0:12:20.604,000 --> 0:12:21,000
was in the kitchen.

245
0:12:22.706,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Little Fred is eight years old.

246
0:12:24.336,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Little Fred comes into the kitchen,

247
0:12:26.968,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and Mabel, who he has only seen as smiling and helpful and happy,

248
0:12:33.143,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is bent over the sink,

249
0:12:35.449,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and she's crying,

250
0:12:37.896,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and she's sobbing

251
0:12:40.479,000 --> 0:12:41,000
inconsolably.

252
0:12:42.604,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And little Fred comes over to her and says, "Mabel, what is wrong?"

253
0:12:47.941,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Mabel turns, and she says,

254
0:12:50.004,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"They killed him! They killed our leader. They killed Martin Luther King.

255
0:12:54.574,000 --> 0:12:57,000
He's dead! They are monsters."

256
0:12:59.054,000 --> 0:13:,000
And little Fred says,

257
0:13:00.897,000 --> 0:13:03,000
"It'll be OK, Mabel. It'll be OK. It'll be OK."

258
0:13:04.246,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And she looked at him, and she says, "No, it's not going to be OK.

259
0:13:07.369,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Did you not hear what I just said?

260
0:13:09.335,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They killed Martin Luther King."

261
0:13:13.106,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And Fred,

262
0:13:15.111,000 --> 0:13:16,000
son of a preacher,

263
0:13:17.882,000 --> 0:13:19,000
looks up at Mabel, and he says,

264
0:13:20.368,000 --> 0:13:25,000
"But Mabel, didn't Jesus die on the cross for our sins?

265
0:13:25.784,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Wasn't that a good outcome?

266
0:13:27.35,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Maybe this will be a good outcome.

267
0:13:30.766,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Maybe the death of Martin Luther King will lead to a good outcome."

268
0:13:36.1,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And as Fred tells the story,

269
0:13:38.398,000 --> 0:13:41,000
he says that Mabel put her hand over her mouth,

270
0:13:43.417,000 --> 0:13:45,000
she reached down and she gave little Fred a hug,

271
0:13:47.002,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and then she reached into the icebox,

272
0:13:49.603,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and took out a couple Pepsis,

273
0:13:51.903,000 --> 0:13:52,000
gave him some Pepsis

274
0:13:53.383,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and sent him on his way to play with his siblings.

275
0:13:56.948,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And he said,

276
0:13:58.535,000 --> 0:14:03,000
"This was proof that even in the most harrowing times of race struggle

277
0:14:04.193,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that two people could come together across racial lines

278
0:14:07.469,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and find human commonality

279
0:14:09.689,000 --> 0:14:11,000
along the lines of love and affection."

280
0:14:12.383,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And I said, "Fred, that is some BS."

281
0:14:16.252,000 --> 0:14:18,000
(Laughter)

282
0:14:18.803,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

283
0:14:20.203,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Fred was like,

284
0:14:23.179,000 --> 0:14:26,000
"But I don't understand, David. That's the story."

285
0:14:26.776,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I said, "Fred, let me ask you a question."

286
0:14:29.732,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I said, "You were in North Carolina in 1968.

287
0:14:35.975,000 --> 0:14:38,000
If Mabel would've went to her community -- you were eight years old --

288
0:14:39.304,000 --> 0:14:41,000
what do you think the eight-year-old African-American children

289
0:14:42.246,000 --> 0:14:43,000
were calling her?

290
0:14:43.421,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Do you think they called her by her first name?"

291
0:14:45.692,000 --> 0:14:46,000
No, they called her "Miss Mabel,"

292
0:14:47.296,000 --> 0:14:5,000
or they called her "Miss Johnson," or they called her "Auntie Johnson."

293
0:14:50.724,000 --> 0:14:52,000
They would have never dared call her by her first name,

294
0:14:53.335,000 --> 0:14:55,000
because that would have been the height of disrespect.

295
0:14:55.891,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And yet, you were calling her by her first name

296
0:14:58.149,000 --> 0:14:59,000
every single day that she worked,

297
0:14:59.757,000 --> 0:15:,000
and you never thought about it."

298
0:15:01.709,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I said, "Let me ask you another question: Was Mabel married?

299
0:15:05.255,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Did she have children?

300
0:15:06.753,000 --> 0:15:07,000
What church did she go to?

301
0:15:08.445,000 --> 0:15:1,000
What was her favorite dessert?"

302
0:15:12.754,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Fred could not answer any of those questions.

303
0:15:17.337,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I said, "Fred, this story is not about Mabel.

304
0:15:20.852,000 --> 0:15:21,000
This story is about you."

305
0:15:22.883,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I said, "This story made you feel good,

306
0:15:25.874,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but this story is not about Mabel.

307
0:15:28.057,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The reality is,

308
0:15:29.675,000 --> 0:15:31,000
what probably happened was, Mabel was crying,

309
0:15:32.253,000 --> 0:15:34,000
which was not something she customarily did,

310
0:15:34.353,000 --> 0:15:35,000
so she was letting her guard down.

311
0:15:36.637,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And you came into the kitchen,

312
0:15:38.293,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and you caught her at a weak moment where she was letting her guard down.

313
0:15:42.278,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And see, because you thought of yourself as just like one of her children,

314
0:15:45.788,000 --> 0:15:49,000
you didn't recognize that you were in fact the child of her employer.

315
0:15:50.899,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And she'd found herself yelling at you.

316
0:15:53.287,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And then she caught herself,

317
0:15:54.685,000 --> 0:15:56,000
realizing that, 'If I'm yelling at him

318
0:15:57.081,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and he goes back and he tells his dad or he tells mom,

319
0:15:59.682,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I could lose my job.'

320
0:16:02.934,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And so she tempered herself, and she ended up --

321
0:16:05.247,000 --> 0:16:09,000
even though she needed consoling -- she ended up consoling you

322
0:16:09.869,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and sending you on your way,

323
0:16:11.522,000 --> 0:16:14,000
perhaps so she could finish mourning in peace."

324
0:16:16.033,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And Fred was stunned.

325
0:16:17.782,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And he realized that he had actually misread that moment.

326
0:16:22.23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And see, this is what they did to Rosa Parks.

327
0:16:25.614,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Because it's a lot easier to digest an old grandmother with tired feet

328
0:16:31.064,000 --> 0:16:34,000
who doesn't stand up because she wants to fight for inequality,

329
0:16:34.509,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but because her feet and her back are tired,

330
0:16:36.824,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and she's worked all day.

331
0:16:39.269,000 --> 0:16:41,000
See, old grandmothers are not scary.

332
0:16:42.098,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But young, radical black women

333
0:16:44.274,000 --> 0:16:46,000
who don't take any stuff from anybody

334
0:16:46.439,000 --> 0:16:47,000
are very scary,

335
0:16:47.967,000 --> 0:16:48,000
who stand up to power

336
0:16:49.877,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and are willing to die for that --

337
0:16:51.965,000 --> 0:16:53,000
those are not the kind of people

338
0:16:54.264,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that make us comfortable.

339
0:16:59.27,000 --> 0:17:,000
So you say,

340
0:17:01.258,000 --> 0:17:02,000
"What do you want me to do, David?

341
0:17:03.002,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I don't know what to do."

342
0:17:07.159,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Well, what I would say to you is,

343
0:17:09.68,000 --> 0:17:11,000
there was a time in which,

344
0:17:11.749,000 --> 0:17:13,000
if you were Jewish, you were not white,

345
0:17:13.989,000 --> 0:17:15,000
if you were Italian, you were not white,

346
0:17:16.021,000 --> 0:17:17,000
if you were Irish, you were not white

347
0:17:17.943,000 --> 0:17:18,000
in this country.

348
0:17:19.129,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It took a while before the Irish, the Jews and the Italians became white.

349
0:17:24.843,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Right?

350
0:17:26.038,000 --> 0:17:28,000
There was a time in which you were "othered,"

351
0:17:28.213,000 --> 0:17:3,000
when you were the people on the outside.

352
0:17:33.736,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Toni Morrison said,

353
0:17:35.04,000 --> 0:17:38,000
"If, in order for you to be tall, I have to be on my knees,

354
0:17:38.789,000 --> 0:17:39,000
you have a serious problem."

355
0:17:40.187,000 --> 0:17:43,000
She says, "White America has a serious, serious problem."

356
0:17:44.583,000 --> 0:17:49,000
To be honest, I don't know if race relations will improve in America.

357
0:17:50.127,000 --> 0:17:51,000
But I know that if they will improve,

358
0:17:51.946,000 --> 0:17:54,000
we have to take these challenges on head on.

359
0:17:56.619,000 --> 0:17:57,000
The future of my children depends on it.

360
0:17:58.637,000 --> 0:18:,000
The future of my children's children depends on it.

361
0:18:01.731,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And, whether you know it or not,

362
0:18:03.646,000 --> 0:18:07,000
the future of your children and your children's children

363
0:18:07.836,000 --> 0:18:08,000
depends on it, too.

364
0:18:09.632,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Thank you.

365
0:18:10.81,000 --> 0:18:11,000
(Applause)

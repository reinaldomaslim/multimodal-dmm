1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
of youth and age.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The first one is dedicated to

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Spencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
My poem is called "Dirt."

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap;

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
half a long century gone

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and still she comes at me

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with that thick cruel yellow bar.

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
All because of a word I said,

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
not even said really, only repeated.

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But "Open," she says, "open up!"

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
her hand clawing at my head.

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I know now her life was hard;

16
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
she lost three children as babies,

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
then her husband died too,

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
leaving young sons, and no money.

19
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
She'd stand me in the sink to pee

20
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because there was never room in the toilet.

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But oh, her soap!

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Might its bitter burning have been

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
what made me a poet?

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The street she lived on was unpaved,

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen

26
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
where she stalked and caught me.

27
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Dare I admit that after she did it

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I never really loved her again?

29
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
She lived to a hundred,

30
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor,

31
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but I never, until now

32
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
loved her again.

33
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
When that was published in a magazine

34
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I got an irate letter from my uncle.

35
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"You have maligned a great woman."

36
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It took some diplomacy.

37
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is called "The Dress."

38
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's a longer poem.

39
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In those days,

40
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
those days which exist for me only

41
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as the most elusive memory now,

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning

43
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
would be a storm of birdsong,

44
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
then the soft clop of the hooves

45
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block,

46
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the last sound at night as likely as not

47
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
would be your father pulling up in his car,

48
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
having worked late again, always late,

49
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace,

50
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to shake out the ashes and damp the draft

51
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
before he came upstairs to fall into bed --

52
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in those long-ago days,

53
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
women, my mother, my friends' mothers,

54
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
our neighbors, all the women I knew --

55
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
wore, often much of the day,

56
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
what were called housedresses,

57
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
cheap, printed, pulpy,

58
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
seemingly purposefully shapeless

59
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown

60
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and, when you had to go look for a child,

61
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
hang wash on the line,

62
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or run down to the grocery store on the corner,

63
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
under a coat,

64
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the twisted hem of the nightgown

65
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
always lank and yellowed,

66
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
dangling beneath.

67
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
More than the curlers some of the women

68
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
seemed constantly to have in their hair

69
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in preparation for some great event --

70
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a ball, one would think --

71
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that never came to pass;

72
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
more than the way most women's faces

73
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
not only were never made up during the day,

74
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but seemed scraped, bleached,

75
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike;

76
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
more than all that it was those dresses

77
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that made women so unknowable and forbidding,

78
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,

79
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and boys no conception.

80
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Only later would I see the dresses also

81
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
as a proclamation:

82
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that in your dim kitchen, your laundry,

83
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
your bleak concrete yard,

84
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
what you revealed of yourself

85
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
was a fabulation;

86
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
your real sensual nature,

87
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
veiled in those sexless vestments,

88
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
was utterly your dominion.

89
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In those days, one hid much else as well:

90
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
grown men didn't embrace one another,

91
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
unless someone had died,

92
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and not always then; you shook hands

93
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back

94
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection;

95
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
once out of childhood you'd never again know

96
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek,

97
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
not until mores at last had evolved,

98
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment,

99
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
then even kiss (your fathers bristles

100
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
white and stiff now).

101
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What release finally, the embrace:

102
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious --

103
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
how much unspoken joy there was

104
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in that affirmation of equality and communion,

105
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
no matter how much misunderstanding

106
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and pain had passed between you by then.

107
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We knew so little in those days,

108
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
as little as now, I suppose

109
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
about healing those hurts:

110
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
even the women, in their best dresses,

111
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices,

112
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
even in lipstick and mascara,

113
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
their hair aflow,

114
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
could only stand wringing their hands,

115
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
begging for peace,

116
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
while father and son, like thugs,

117
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
like thieves, like Romans,

118
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
simmered and hissed and hated,

119
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
inflicting sorrows that endured,

120
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the worst anyway,

121
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
through the kiss and embrace,

122
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
bleeding from brother to brother,

123
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
into the generations.

124
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
In those days there was still countryside

125
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
close to the city, farms, cornfields, cows;

126
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
even not far from our building

127
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway

128
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you could find tracts with hills and trees

129
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you could pretend were mountains and forests.

130
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Or you could go out by yourself

131
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
even to a half-block-long empty lot,

132
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk,

133
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone;

134
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
already there was wanting to be simpler,

135
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
wanting, when they called you,

136
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
never to go back.

137
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

138
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is another longish one,

139
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
about the old and the young.

140
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
It actually happened right at the time we met.

141
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Part of the poem takes place in

142
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
space we shared and time we shared.

143
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It's called "The Neighbor."

144
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Her five horrid, deformed little dogs

145
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
who incessantly yap on the roof under my window.

146
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Her cats, God knows how many,

147
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
who must piss on her rugs --

148
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
her landing's a sickening reek.

149
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,

150
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
then the door slamming fearfully shut,

151
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
only the barking and the music -- jazz --

152
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
filtering as it does, day and night into the hall.

153
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" --

154
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
how it brought back my college sweetheart,

155
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
my first real love, who -- till I left her --

156
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
played the same record.

157
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh,

158
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions

159
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
she was too young for,

160
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain.

161
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It startled, then bored, then repelled me.

162
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap

163
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in the Village, that my neighbor was her.

164
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,

165
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance.

166
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox.

167
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown,

168
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
her turning away, hiding her ravaged face

169
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi."

170
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell.

171
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
A man shouting, "Shut up!" The dogs frantically snarling,

172
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
claws scrabbling, then her -- her voice

173
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
hoarse, harsh, hollow,

174
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
almost only a tone,

175
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
incoherent, a note, a squawk,

176
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
bone on metal, metal gone molten,

177
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
calling them back,

178
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"Come back darlings, come back dear ones.

179
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
My sweet angels, come back."

180
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Medea she was, next time I saw her.

181
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Sorceress, tranced, ecstatic,

182
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
stock-still on the sidewalk

183
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
ragged coat hanging agape,

184
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
passersby flowing around her,

185
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
her mouth torn suddenly open

186
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
as though in a scream,

187
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
silently though, as though only in her brain

188
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or breast had it erupted.

189
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
A cry so pure, practiced, detached,

190
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
it had no need of a voice,

191
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
or could no longer bear one.

192
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
These invisible links that allure,

193
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us.

194
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The girl, my old love,

195
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the last lost time I saw her

196
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
when she came to find me at a party,

197
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
her drunkenly stumbling, falling,

198
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,

199
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
swollen with tears, her shame,

200
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
her dishonor.

201
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
My ignorant, arrogant coarseness,

202
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
my secret pride, my turning away.

203
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Still life on a rooftop,

204
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
dead trees in barrels, a bench broken,

205
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
dogs, excrement, sky.

206
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
What pathways through pain,

207
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
what junctures of vulnerability,

208
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
what crossings and counterings?

209
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Too many lives in our lives already,

210
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
too many chances for sorrow,

211
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
too many unaccounted-for pasts.

212
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
"Behold me," the god of frenzied,

213
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
inexhaustible love says,

214
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me."

215
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Her making her way

216
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
down the littered vestibule stairs,

217
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
one agonized step at a time.

218
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
My holding the door.

219
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Her crossing the fragmented tiles,

220
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
faltering at the step to the street,

221
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
droning, not looking at me,

222
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
"Can you help me?"

223
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.

224
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Her wavering step into the world.

225
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Her whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.

226
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

227
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I think I'll lighten up a little.

228
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Another, different kind of poem of youth and age.

230
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's called "Gas."

231
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Wouldn't it be nice, I think,

233
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room

234
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
bends over the magazine table

235
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and farts, just a little,

236
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and violently blushes.

237
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas

238
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
came embodied in visible clouds,

239
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop

240
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
had only barely grazed my face

241
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
before it drifted away.

242
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

243
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Besides, for this to have happened now

244
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,

245
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
while we were on our walk,

246
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
my dog was startled by a backfire

247
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and jumped straight up like a horse bucking.

248
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And that brought back to me the stable

249
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I worked on weekends when I was 12,

250
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and a splendid piebald stallion,

251
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,

252
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
though more hugely of course,

253
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
enormous, gleaming, resplendent.

254
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And the woman, her face abashedly buried

255
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in her "Elle" now, reminded me --

256
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe

257
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
consisted of the fact that with every jump he took

258
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the horse would powerfully fart.

259
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Phwap! Phwap! Phwap!

260
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Something never mentioned

261
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
in the dozens of books about horses

262
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and their riders I devoured in those days.

263
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
All that savage grandeur,

264
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
the steely glinting hooves,

265
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards,

266
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared,

267
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him.

268
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

270
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
This is called "Thirst."

271
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Many -- most of my poems actually

272
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
are urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't.

273
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
"Thirst."

274
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter,

275
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
day and night, on a bench

276
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in the 103rd Street subway station,

277
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
until finally one day she vanished.

278
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We regarded each other, scrutinized one another.

279
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Me shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive.

280
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,

281
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty.

282
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I was frightened of her. I felt like a child.

283
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I was afraid some repressed part of myself

284
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
would go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped

285
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
in the shocking seethe of her stench.

286
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Not excrement merely, not merely surface

287
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and orifice going unwashed,

288
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
rediffusion of rum,

289
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
there was will in it,

290
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and intention, power and purpose --

291
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
a social, ethical rage and rebellion --

292
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
despair too, though, grief, loss.

293
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,

294
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
bathe her, comfort her, dress her.

295
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.

296
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Instead, I'd step into my train.

297
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
How rich I would think, is the lexicon

298
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
of our self-absolving.

299
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
How enduring, our bland fatal assurance

300
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that reflection is righteousness being accomplished.

301
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The dance of our glances,

302
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the clash, pulling each other through

303
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
our perceptual punctures,

304
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
then holocaust, holocaust,

305
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
host on host of ill, injured presences,

306
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
squandered, consumed.

307
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Her vigil somewhere I know continues.

308
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance.

309
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,

310
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
effacement, the perfume of our consternation.

311
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
(Applause)

312
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.

313
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The title is "This Happened."

314
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
A student, a young woman

315
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee,

316
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
perched on the ledge of an open window

317
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
chatting with friends between classes;

318
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
a teacher passes and chides her,

319
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
"Be careful, you might fall,"

320
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
almost banteringly chides her,

321
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
"You might fall,"

322
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and the young woman, 18, a girl really,

323
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
though she wouldn't think that,

324
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
as brilliant as she is, first in her class,

325
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and "Beautiful, too," she's often told,

326
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
smiles back, and leans into the open window,

327
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
which wouldn't even be open if it were winter --

328
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") --

329
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
leans into the window, farther, still smiling,

330
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
farther and farther, though it takes less time

331
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
than this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.

332
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Herself fall.

333
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
A casual impulse, a fancy,

334
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ...

335
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
No, more than impulse or fancy,

336
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
the girl knows what she's doing,

337
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the girl means something,

338
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
the girl means to mean,

339
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because it occurs to her in that instant,

340
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
that beautiful or not, bright yes or no,

341
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
she's not who she is,

342
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
she's not the person she is,

343
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and the reason, she suddenly knows,

344
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
is that there's been so much premeditation

345
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
where she is, so much plotting and planning,

346
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
there's hardly a person where she is,

347
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her,

348
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
it's a self inhabited, lived in by her,

349
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and seemingly even as she thinks it

350
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
she knows what's been missing:

351
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
grace,

352
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
not premeditation but grace,

353
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
a kind of being in the world spontaneously,

354
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
with grace.

355
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Weightfully upon me was the world.

356
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Weightfully this self which graced the world

357
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
yet never wholly itself.

358
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Weightfully this self which weighed upon me,

359
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
the release from which is what I desire

360
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and what I achieve.

361
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And the girl remembers, in this infinite instant

362
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
already now so many times divided,

363
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
the sadness she felt once,

364
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
hardly knowing she felt it,

365
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
to merely inhabit herself.

366
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Yes, the girl falls, absurd to fall,

367
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
even the earth with its compulsion

368
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
to take unto itself all that falls

369
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
must know that falling is absurd,

370
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
yet the girl falling isn't myself,

371
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
or she is myself,

372
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.

373
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Forever. With grace.

374
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
This happened.

375
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
(Applause)

376
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.

377
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
I like to just end.

378
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here

379
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and shake his fist at me.

380
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
This is called "Old Man," appropriately enough.

381
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
"Special: big tits,"

382
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine

383
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
on our neighborhood newsstand.

384
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
But forget her breasts.

385
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
A lush, fresh-lipped blond,

386
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
skin glowing gold, sprawls there,

387
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
resplendent.

388
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,

389
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
hardly better than harlots, can still stir me.

390
0:19:41.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Maybe a coming of age in the

391
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
American sensual darkness,

392
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
never seeing an unsmudged nipple,

393
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
an uncensored vagina,

394
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
has left me forever infected

395
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
with an unquenchable lust of the eye.

396
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Always that erotic murmur,

397
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
I'm hardly myself

398
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
if I'm not in a state of incipient desire.

399
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
God knows though,

400
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
there are worse twists your obsessions can take.

401
0:20:08.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
Last year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbi

402
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah

403
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
forbade them to look in one room.

404
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
Because there were images in it he said were licentious.

405
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked,

406
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
some trying to cover their genitals,

407
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:31,000
others too frightened to bother,

408
0:20:31.16,000 --> 0:20:33,000
lined up in snow

409
0:20:33.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch.

410
0:20:36.16,000 --> 0:20:39,000
The girls, to my horror,

411
0:20:39.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
averted their gaze.

412
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:45,000
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them.

413
0:20:45.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Even that though. Another confession:

414
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Once in a book on pre-war Poland,

415
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
a studio portrait, an absolute angel,

416
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes.

417
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
I kept finding myself at her page.

418
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:04,000
That she died in the camps made her --

419
0:21:04.16,000 --> 0:21:07,000
I didn't dare wonder why --

420
0:21:07.16,000 --> 0:21:1,000
more present, more precious.

421
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:13,000
Died in the camps, that too people --

422
0:21:13.16,000 --> 0:21:15,000
or Jews anyway --

423
0:21:15.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
kept from their children back then.

424
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:21,000
But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told.

425
0:21:21.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
Sex and death, how close they can seem.

426
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:29,000
So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,

427
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:32,000
sometimes I think I confound them.

428
0:21:32.16,000 --> 0:21:35,000
My wife's loveliness almost consumes me.

429
0:21:35.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds.

430
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
When we make love, her holding me

431
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:43,000
everywhere all around me,

432
0:21:43.16,000 --> 0:21:45,000
I'm there and not there.

433
0:21:45.16,000 --> 0:21:49,000
My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions,

434
0:21:49.16,000 --> 0:21:54,000
I live my life over, as though I were drowning.

435
0:21:54.16,000 --> 0:21:57,000
Then I am drowning, in despair

436
0:21:57.16,000 --> 0:21:59,000
at having to leave her,

437
0:21:59.16,000 --> 0:22:01,000
this, everything, all,

438
0:22:01.16,000 --> 0:22:04,000
unbearable, awful.

439
0:22:04.16,000 --> 0:22:07,000
Still, to be able to die

440
0:22:07.16,000 --> 0:22:09,000
with no special contrition,

441
0:22:09.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
not having been slaughtered, or enslaved.

442
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:15,000
And not having to know history's next

443
0:22:15.16,000 --> 0:22:17,000
mad rage or regression,

444
0:22:17.16,000 --> 0:22:2,000
it might be a relief.

445
0:22:20.16,000 --> 0:22:22,000
No. Again, no.

446
0:22:22.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
I don't mean that for a moment.

447
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
What I mean is the world holds me so tightly --

448
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:29,000
the good and the bad --

449
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:31,000
my own follies and weakness

450
0:22:31.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
that even this counterfeit Venus

451
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:37,000
with her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped

452
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:4,000
with gel, so moves me

453
0:22:40.16,000 --> 0:22:42,000
my breath catches.

454
0:22:42.16,000 --> 0:22:45,000
Vamp. Siren. Seductress.

455
0:22:45.16,000 --> 0:22:47,000
How much more she reveals

456
0:22:47.16,000 --> 0:22:5,000
in her glare of ink than she knows.

457
0:22:50.16,000 --> 0:22:52,000
How she incarnates

458
0:22:52.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
our desperate human need for regard,

459
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
our passion to live in beauty,

460
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:02,000
to be beauty, to be cherished by glances,

461
0:23:02.16,000 --> 0:23:06,000
if by no more, of something like love,

462
0:23:06.16,000 --> 0:23:08,000
or love.

463
0:23:08.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
Thank you.

464
0:23:10.16,000 --> 0:23:12,000
(Applause)

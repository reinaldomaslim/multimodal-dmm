1
0:00:13.672,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have spent the past 38 years trying to be invisible.

2
0:00:19.83,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm a copy editor.

3
0:00:21.807,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I work at The New Yorker,

4
0:00:23.531,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop

5
0:00:27.729,000 --> 0:00:29,000
for a Major League Baseball team:

6
0:00:29.967,000 --> 0:00:32,000
every little movement gets picked over by the critics --

7
0:00:33.404,000 --> 0:00:35,000
God forbid you should commit an error.

8
0:00:37.086,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose what goes into the magazine.

9
0:00:41.53,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We work at the level of the sentence,

10
0:00:43.932,000 --> 0:00:44,000
maybe the paragraph,

11
0:00:45.644,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the words, the punctuation.

12
0:00:48.175,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Our business is in the details.

13
0:00:50.904,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We put the diaeresis, the double dot, over the "i" in "naïve."

14
0:00:56.591,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We impose house style.

15
0:00:58.542,000 --> 0:01:,000
Every publication has a house style.

16
0:01:01.252,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The New Yorker's is particularly distinctive.

17
0:01:04.503,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We sometimes get teased for our style.

18
0:01:07.307,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Imagine -- we still spell "teen-ager" with a hyphen,

19
0:01:11.671,000 --> 0:01:13,000
as if that word had just been coined.

20
0:01:14.919,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But you see that hyphen in "teen-age"

21
0:01:18.543,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and that diaeresis over "coöperate,"

22
0:01:21.159,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and you know you're reading The New Yorker.

23
0:01:23.85,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Copyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process.

24
0:01:27.372,000 --> 0:01:3,000
There is a related role called query proofreading,

25
0:01:30.595,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or page-OK'ing.

26
0:01:32.959,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Whereas copyediting is mechanical,

27
0:01:35.753,000 --> 0:01:37,000
query proofreading is interpretive.

28
0:01:38.696,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We make suggestions to the author through the editor

29
0:01:42.092,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to improve the emphasis of a sentence

30
0:01:44.737,000 --> 0:01:46,000
or point out unintentional repetitions

31
0:01:47.395,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and supply compelling alternatives.

32
0:01:52.502,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Our purpose is to make the author look good.

33
0:01:55.504,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Note that we give our proofs not directly to the author,

34
0:01:58.857,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but to the editor.

35
0:02:00.4,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This often creates a good cop/bad cop dynamic

36
0:02:04.541,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in which the copy editor -- I'll use that as an umbrella term --

37
0:02:08.089,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is invariably the bad cop.

38
0:02:12.008,000 --> 0:02:14,000
If we do our job well, we're invisible,

39
0:02:14.469,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but as soon as we make a mistake,

40
0:02:16.565,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we copy editors become glaringly visible.

41
0:02:21.426,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door.

42
0:02:25.931,000 --> 0:02:28,000
[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin, the pre-Trump embodiment

43
0:02:29.479,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of populist no-nothingism in the Republican Party,

44
0:02:32.649,000 --> 0:02:33,000
endorsed Trump.]

45
0:02:34.935,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Where were The New Yorker's fabled copy editors?" a reader wrote.

46
0:02:39.167,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"Didn't the writer mean 'know-nothingism'?"

47
0:02:42.789,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Ouch.

48
0:02:44.09,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There's no excuse for this mistake.

49
0:02:46.786,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But I like it: "no-nothingism."

50
0:02:49.899,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It might be American vernacular for "nihilism."

51
0:02:53.881,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:57.112,000 --> 0:03:,000
Here, another reader quotes a passage from the magazine:

53
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained her authoritative bearing;

54
0:03:04.221,000 --> 0:03:07,000
only her unsteady gait belied her age.]

55
0:03:08.77,000 --> 0:03:09,000
He added:

56
0:03:09.945,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied,'

57
0:03:13.052,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and that it is the opposite of how it is used in this sentence.

58
0:03:16.284,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Come on! Get it together."

59
0:03:18.648,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Belie: to give a false impression.

60
0:03:22.18,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It should have been "betrayed."

61
0:03:25.426,000 --> 0:03:27,000
E.B. White once wrote of commas in The New Yorker:

62
0:03:28.325,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body."

63
0:03:33.213,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:34.939,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it's true -- we get a lot of complaints about commas.

65
0:03:38.124,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Are there really two commas in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"

66
0:03:42.746,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There may not be on the sign, but yes, that is New Yorker style for "Jr."

67
0:03:48.192,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One wag wrote:

68
0:03:50.181,000 --> 0:03:53,000
["Please, could you expel, or, at least, restrain,

69
0:03:53.647,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the comma-maniac, on your editorial staff?"]

70
0:03:56.695,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:58.071,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Ah, well.

72
0:03:59.246,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In this case, those commas are well-placed,

73
0:04:01.514,000 --> 0:04:02,000
except that there should not be one

74
0:04:03.409,000 --> 0:04:05,000
between "maniac" and "on."

75
0:04:05.435,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:06.694,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Also, if we must have commas around "at least,"

77
0:04:10.466,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we might change it up by using dashes around that phrase:

78
0:04:14.53,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"... -- or, at least, restrain --"

79
0:04:18.392,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Perfect.

80
0:04:19.586,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

81
0:04:21.188,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Then there's this:

82
0:04:22.547,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"Love you, love your magazine,

83
0:04:24.009,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but can you please stop writing massive numbers as text?"

84
0:04:29.23,000 --> 0:04:3,000
[two and a half million ...]

85
0:04:30.808,000 --> 0:04:31,000
No.

86
0:04:31.991,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:34.053,000 --> 0:04:37,000
One last cri de coeur from a spelling stickler:

88
0:04:37.179,000 --> 0:04:42,000
["Those long stringy things are vocal cords, not chords."]

89
0:04:42.347,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The outraged reader added,

90
0:04:44.52,000 --> 0:04:45,000
"I'm sure I'm not the first to write

91
0:04:46.377,000 --> 0:04:49,000
regarding this egregious proofreading error,

92
0:04:49.622,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.

93
0:04:52.052,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Fie!"

94
0:04:53.296,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:55.541,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I used to like getting mail.

96
0:04:59.222,000 --> 0:05:01,000
There is a pact between writers and editors.

97
0:05:01.842,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The editor never sells out the writer,

98
0:05:04.245,000 --> 0:05:07,000
never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut

99
0:05:07.821,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or stories that went on too long.

100
0:05:10.295,000 --> 0:05:14,000
A great editor saves a writer from her excesses.

101
0:05:15.558,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Copy editors, too, have a code;

102
0:05:17.61,000 --> 0:05:19,000
we don't advertise our oversights.

103
0:05:20.593,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I feel disloyal divulging them here,

104
0:05:23.317,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so let's have look at what we do right.

105
0:05:27.57,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Somehow, I've gotten a reputation for sternness.

106
0:05:31.133,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But I work with writers who know how to have their way with me.

107
0:05:35.741,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy," since the early 80s.

108
0:05:39.913,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And he's one of my favorites,

109
0:05:41.566,000 --> 0:05:43,000
even though he sometimes writes a sentence

110
0:05:44.035,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that gives a copy editor pause.

111
0:05:46.846,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Here is one from a story about Staten Island

112
0:05:49.404,000 --> 0:05:5,000
after Hurricane Sandy:

113
0:05:52.092,000 --> 0:05:56,000
[A dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half

114
0:05:56.125,000 --> 0:05:58,000
sloped down toward the water,

115
0:05:58.533,000 --> 0:06:01,000
its support pipes and wires leaning forward

116
0:06:02.237,000 --> 0:06:05,000
like when you open a box of linguine and it slides out.]

117
0:06:06.072,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:07.35,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore.

119
0:06:12.504,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But what could I do?

120
0:06:13.767,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Technically, the "like" should be an "as,"

121
0:06:16.395,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but it sounds ridiculous,

122
0:06:17.863,000 --> 0:06:2,000
as if the author were about to embark on an extended Homeric simile --

123
0:06:22.211,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"as when you open a box of linguine."

124
0:06:25.395,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:26.728,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy

126
0:06:31.528,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and let the sentence stand.

127
0:06:33.203,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:34.314,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Generally, if I think something is wrong,

129
0:06:36.346,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I query it three times.

130
0:06:37.862,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I told Sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said,

131
0:06:41.741,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"Only three?"

132
0:06:43.276,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So, he has learned to hold out.

133
0:06:45.044,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Recently, he wrote a story for "Talk of the Town,"

134
0:06:47.467,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that's the section at the front of the magazine

135
0:06:49.712,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with short pieces on subjects ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit

136
0:06:52.814,000 --> 0:06:53,000
at the Metropolitan Museum

137
0:06:54.383,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to the introduction of doggie bags in France.

138
0:06:57.578,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Sandy's story was about the return to the Bronx

139
0:07:00.02,000 --> 0:07:02,000
of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

140
0:07:02.711,000 --> 0:07:04,000
There were three things in it that I had to challenge.

141
0:07:05.284,000 --> 0:07:06,000
First, a grammar query.

142
0:07:06.872,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The justice was wearing black and Sandy wrote,

143
0:07:09.491,000 --> 0:07:14,000
[Her face and hands stood out like in an old, mostly dark painting.]

144
0:07:15.043,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, unlike with the hurricane,

145
0:07:17.017,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with this "like," the author didn't have the excuse

146
0:07:19.509,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of describing hurricane damage.

147
0:07:21.34,000 --> 0:07:25,000
"Like" in this sense is a preposition, and a preposition takes an object,

148
0:07:25.66,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which is a noun.

149
0:07:26.877,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This "like" had to be an "as."

150
0:07:29.433,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"As in an old, mostly dark painting."

151
0:07:32.615,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Second, a spelling issue.

152
0:07:34.289,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice:

153
0:07:37.986,000 --> 0:07:38,000
["It will be just a minute.

154
0:07:39.432,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]

155
0:07:43.434,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Mic'ed?

156
0:07:44.982,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The music industry spells it "mic"

157
0:07:47.003,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because that's how it's spelled on the equipment.

158
0:07:49.385,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling,

159
0:07:51.836,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and I was distraught to think that "mic'ed"

160
0:07:54.39,000 --> 0:07:56,000
would get into the magazine on my watch.

161
0:07:56.699,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

162
0:07:57.734,000 --> 0:08:,000
New Yorker style for "microphone" in its abbreviated form is "mike."

163
0:08:02.519,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Finally, there was a sticky grammar and usage issue

164
0:08:05.17,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical number

165
0:08:08.908,000 --> 0:08:09,000
as its antecedent.

166
0:08:11.292,000 --> 0:08:14,000
[everyone in the vicinity held their breath]

167
0:08:15.491,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"Their" is plural and "everyone," its antecedent, is singular.

168
0:08:19.71,000 --> 0:08:21,000
You would never say, "Everyone were there."

169
0:08:22.672,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Everyone was there. Everyone is here.

170
0:08:26.537,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But people say things like, "Everyone held their breath" all the time.

171
0:08:30.175,000 --> 0:08:31,000
To give it legitimacy,

172
0:08:31.418,000 --> 0:08:34,000
copy editors call it "the singular 'their,'"

173
0:08:34.865,000 --> 0:08:37,000
as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural.

174
0:08:37.954,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:39.372,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it.

176
0:08:45.37,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I couldn't make it, "Everyone held her breath,"

177
0:08:47.872,000 --> 0:08:48,000
or "Everyone held his breath,"

178
0:08:49.588,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or "Everyone held his or her breath."

179
0:08:52.174,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Whatever I suggested had to blend in.

180
0:08:55.018,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I asked, through the editor,

181
0:08:56.398,000 --> 0:08:58,000
if the author would consider changing it

182
0:08:58.47,000 --> 0:09:,000
to "All in the vicinity held their breath,"

183
0:09:01.065,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because "all" is plural.

184
0:09:02.931,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Nope.

185
0:09:04.112,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I tried again: "All those present held their breath?"

186
0:09:07.366,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.

187
0:09:09.611,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But the editor pointed out

188
0:09:10.882,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that we could not have "present" and "presence"

189
0:09:13.311,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in the same sentence.

190
0:09:15.108,000 --> 0:09:16,000
When the final proof came back,

191
0:09:16.711,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the author had accepted "as" for "like,"

192
0:09:19.311,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and "miked" for "mic'ed."

193
0:09:21.27,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But on "Everyone held their breath," he stood his ground.

194
0:09:25.49,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Two out of three isn't bad.

195
0:09:28.01,000 --> 0:09:29,000
In the same issue,

196
0:09:29.277,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in that piece on doggie bags in France,

197
0:09:31.823,000 --> 0:09:34,000
there was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a Frenchman.

198
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I wonder, when the mail comes in,

199
0:09:38.888,000 --> 0:09:4,000
which will have offended the readers more.

200
0:09:41.77,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:43.467,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Thank you.

202
0:09:44.642,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Applause)

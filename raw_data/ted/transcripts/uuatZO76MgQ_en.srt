1
0:00:12.929,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I had about five minutes before I was set to deliver a talk

2
0:00:16.19,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to a bunch of business owners

3
0:00:17.617,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about visibility and being on camera.

4
0:00:20.365,000 --> 0:00:22,000
After all, I was the so-called expert there,

5
0:00:23.276,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the former 20-year television news anchor and life and business coach.

6
0:00:28.957,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I happened to take a look down at my cell phone just to catch the time,

7
0:00:32.35,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I noticed that I had a missed call from my ex-husband.

8
0:00:36.585,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I can still hear his voice.

9
0:00:39.553,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Darieth, what is going on?

10
0:00:43.128,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I just got a call from some strange man who told me to go to this website,

11
0:00:47.842,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and now I'm looking at all of these photos of you naked.

12
0:00:52.01,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Your private parts are all over this website.

13
0:00:55.241,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Who's seen this?"

14
0:00:58.479,000 --> 0:01:,000
I couldn't think. I couldn't breathe.

15
0:01:02.223,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I was so humiliated and so embarrassed and so ashamed.

16
0:01:06.211,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I felt like my world was coming to an end.

17
0:01:09.196,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And yet, this began for me months of pain and depression

18
0:01:13.704,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and anger and confusion and silence.

19
0:01:16.992,000 --> 0:01:2,000
My manipulative, jealous, stalker ex-boyfriend

20
0:01:21.47,000 --> 0:01:23,000
did exactly what he said he would do:

21
0:01:23.628,000 --> 0:01:25,000
he put up a website with my name on it,

22
0:01:26.288,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and he posted this.

23
0:01:29.167,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And this.

24
0:01:31.317,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And several explicit photos

25
0:01:33.395,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that he had taken of me while I was asleep,

26
0:01:35.787,000 --> 0:01:36,000
living with him in Jamaica.

27
0:01:37.768,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For months prior to that, he had been sending me

28
0:01:40.109,000 --> 0:01:42,000
threatening text messages like this.

29
0:01:42.553,000 --> 0:01:45,000
He was trying to make me out to be some sleazy, low-life slut.

30
0:01:47.618,000 --> 0:01:48,000
He had even threatened to kill me.

31
0:01:49.341,000 --> 0:01:53,000
He told me that he would shoot me in my head and stab me in my heart,

32
0:01:54.308,000 --> 0:01:57,000
simply because I wanted to end the controlling relationship.

33
0:01:58.977,000 --> 0:02:,000
I couldn't believe this was happening to me.

34
0:02:01.89,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I didn't even know what to call it.

35
0:02:03.803,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You might know it as cyberharassment or cyberbullying.

36
0:02:07.768,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The media calls it "revenge porn."

37
0:02:10.625,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I now call it "digital domestic violence."

38
0:02:14.387,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It typically stems from a relationship gone bad,

39
0:02:17.528,000 --> 0:02:21,000
where a controlling, jilted ex-lover can't handle rejection,

40
0:02:21.657,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so when they can't physically put their hands on you,

41
0:02:24.411,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they use different weapons: cell phones and laptops.

42
0:02:28.212,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The ammunition?

43
0:02:29.395,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Photos, videos, explicit information, content -- all posted online,

44
0:02:35.058,000 --> 0:02:36,000
without your consent.

45
0:02:37.082,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I mean, let's face it -- we all live our lives online.

46
0:02:40.347,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And the internet is a really small world.

47
0:02:43.125,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We show off our baby photos,

48
0:02:45.014,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we start and grow our businesses, we make new relationships,

49
0:02:47.871,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we let the world in, one Facebook like at a time.

50
0:02:53.323,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And you know what I found?

51
0:02:54.863,000 --> 0:02:55,000
An even smaller world.

52
0:02:56.728,000 --> 0:03:,000
One in 25 women say they have been impacted by revenge porn.

53
0:03:01.395,000 --> 0:03:05,000
For women under the age of 30, that number looks like one in 10.

54
0:03:06.186,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And that leaves a few of you in this audience as potential victims.

55
0:03:10.63,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You want to know what's even more alarming?

56
0:03:12.757,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Lack of legislation and laws to adequately protect victims

57
0:03:16.779,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and punish perpetrators.

58
0:03:18.363,000 --> 0:03:2,000
There's only one federal bill pending;

59
0:03:20.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it's called the ENOUGH Act, by Senator Kamala Harris.

60
0:03:24.712,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It would criminalize revenge porn.

61
0:03:27.441,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But that could take years to pass.

62
0:03:29.64,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So what are we left with in the meantime?

63
0:03:31.694,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Flimsy civil misdemeanors.

64
0:03:33.648,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Currently, only 40 states and DC have some laws in place for revenge porn.

65
0:03:40.156,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And those penalties vary -- we're talking $500 fines.

66
0:03:44.061,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Five hundred dollars?

67
0:03:45.288,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Are you kidding me?

68
0:03:46.465,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Women are losing their jobs.

69
0:03:47.845,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They're suffering from damaged relationships

70
0:03:50.176,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and damaged reputations.

71
0:03:51.561,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They're falling into illness and depression.

72
0:03:54.125,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And the suicide rates are climbing.

73
0:03:57.802,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You're looking at a woman who spent 11 months in court,

74
0:04:02.016,000 --> 0:04:04,000
thirteen trips to the courthouse

75
0:04:04.167,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and thousands of dollars in legal fees,

76
0:04:06.657,000 --> 0:04:07,000
just to get two things:

77
0:04:08.315,000 --> 0:04:1,000
a protection from cyberstalking and cyberabuse,

78
0:04:11.236,000 --> 0:04:13,000
otherwise known as a PFA,

79
0:04:13.736,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and language from a judge

80
0:04:15.002,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that would force a third-party internet company

81
0:04:17.284,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to remove the content.

82
0:04:19.815,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's expensive, complicated and confusing.

83
0:04:23.024,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And worse, legal loopholes and jurisdictional issues drag this out

84
0:04:28.494,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for months,

85
0:04:29.802,000 --> 0:04:32,000
while my private parts were on display for months.

86
0:04:34.203,000 --> 0:04:38,000
How would you feel if your naked body was exposed for the world to see,

87
0:04:38.259,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and you waited helplessly for the content to be removed?

88
0:04:42.966,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Eventually, I stumbled upon a private company

89
0:04:45.657,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to issue a DMCA notice to shut the website down.

90
0:04:49.434,000 --> 0:04:52,000
DMCA -- Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

91
0:04:53.154,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's a law that regulates digital material and content.

92
0:04:56.582,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Broadly, the aim of the DMCA is to protect both copyright owners and consumers.

93
0:05:01.654,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So get this:

94
0:05:02.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
people who take and share nude photos own the rights to those selfies,

95
0:05:07.9,000 --> 0:05:11,000
so they should be able to issue a DMCA to have the content removed.

96
0:05:12.876,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But not so fast --

97
0:05:14.237,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because the other fight we're dealing with

98
0:05:16.673,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is noncompliant and nonresponsive third-party internet companies.

99
0:05:21.03,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And oh -- by the way,

100
0:05:22.756,000 --> 0:05:24,000
even in consenting relationships,

101
0:05:24.903,000 --> 0:05:27,000
just because you get a nude photo or a naked pic,

102
0:05:28.276,000 --> 0:05:3,000
does not give you the right to share it,

103
0:05:31.053,000 --> 0:05:33,000
even [without] the intent to do harm.

104
0:05:34.157,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Back to my case,

105
0:05:35.806,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which happens to be further complicated

106
0:05:37.783,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because he was stalking and harassing me from another country,

107
0:05:40.974,000 --> 0:05:43,000
making it nearly impossible to get help here.

108
0:05:45.441,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But wait a minute -- isn't the internet international?

109
0:05:48.458,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Shouldn't we have some sort of policy in place

110
0:05:50.95,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that broadly protects us, regardless to borders or restrictions?

111
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I just couldn’t give up; I had to keep fighting.

112
0:05:59.149,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So I willingly, on three occasions,

113
0:06:02.76,000 --> 0:06:06,000
allowed for the invasion of both my cell phone and my laptop

114
0:06:07.323,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by the Department of Homeland Security and the Jamaican Embassy

115
0:06:11.307,000 --> 0:06:13,000
for thorough forensic investigation,

116
0:06:13.553,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because I had maintained all of the evidence.

117
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I painstakingly shared my private parts with the all-male investigative team.

118
0:06:23.735,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And it was an embarrassing, humiliating additional hoop to jump through.

119
0:06:29.315,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But then something happened.

120
0:06:31.982,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Jamaican authorities actually arrested him.

121
0:06:35.562,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He's now facing charges under their malicious communications act,

122
0:06:40.424,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and if found guilty, could face thousands of dollars in fines

123
0:06:44.741,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and up to 10 years in prison.

124
0:06:46.677,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I've also learned that my case is making history --

125
0:06:49.3,000 --> 0:06:53,000
it is the first international case under this new crime.

126
0:06:54.595,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Wow, finally some justice.

127
0:06:58.273,000 --> 0:07:,000
But this got me to thinking.

128
0:07:00.376,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Nobody deserves this.

129
0:07:02.474,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Nobody deserves this level of humiliation

130
0:07:06.085,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and having to jump through all of these hoops.

131
0:07:10.506,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Our cyber civil rights are at stake.

132
0:07:14.331,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Here in the United States, we need to have clear, tough enforcement;

133
0:07:19.227,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we need to demand the accountability and responsiveness from online companies;

134
0:07:24.107,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we need to promote social responsibilities for posting, sharing and texting;

135
0:07:28.797,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and we need to restore dignity to victims.

136
0:07:33.506,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And what about victims

137
0:07:36.21,000 --> 0:07:39,000
who neither have the time, money or resources to wage war,

138
0:07:39.696,000 --> 0:07:42,000
who are left disempowered, mislabeled and broken?

139
0:07:44.362,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Two things:

140
0:07:46.805,000 --> 0:07:48,000
release the shame and end the silence.

141
0:07:50.212,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Shame is at the core of all of this.

142
0:07:53.474,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And for every silent prisoner of shame,

143
0:07:56.927,000 --> 0:07:59,000
it's the fear of judgment that's holding you hostage.

144
0:08:00.03,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And the price to pay is the stripping away of your self-worth.

145
0:08:05.045,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The day I ended my silence, I freed myself from shame.

146
0:08:09.593,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And I freed myself from the fear of judgment

147
0:08:12.8,000 --> 0:08:14,000
from the one person who I thought would judge me the most --

148
0:08:16.109,000 --> 0:08:17,000
my son,

149
0:08:17.847,000 --> 0:08:18,000
who actually told me,

150
0:08:19.863,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"Mom, you are the strongest person that I know.

151
0:08:24.117,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You can get through this.

152
0:08:26.427,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And besides, mom -- he chose the wrong woman to mess with."

153
0:08:31.188,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:32.928,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:37.568,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It was on that day that I decided to use my platform

156
0:08:41.286,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and my story and my voice.

157
0:08:44.633,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And to get started, I asked myself this one simple question:

158
0:08:48.054,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Who do I need to become now?

159
0:08:50.784,000 --> 0:08:54,000
That question, in the face of everything that I was challenged with,

160
0:08:54.919,000 --> 0:08:58,000
transformed my life and had me thinking about all kinds of possibilities.

161
0:08:59.196,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I now own my story, I speak my truth,

162
0:09:02.482,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and I'm narrating a new chapter in my life.

163
0:09:05.109,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's called "50 Shades of Silence."

164
0:09:08.712,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's a global social justice project,

165
0:09:11.315,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and we're working to film an upcoming documentary

166
0:09:13.673,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to give voice and dignity to victims.

167
0:09:16.871,000 --> 0:09:19,000
If you are a victim or you know someone who is, know this:

168
0:09:21.101,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in order to be empowered, you have to take care of yourself,

169
0:09:24.649,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and you have to love yourself.

170
0:09:26.379,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You have to turn your anger into action,

171
0:09:29.141,000 --> 0:09:3,000
your pain into power

172
0:09:30.728,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and your setback into a setup for what's next for your life.

173
0:09:36.309,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is a process, and it's a journey of self-discovery

174
0:09:40.071,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that might include forgiveness.

175
0:09:42.397,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But it definitely requires bravery, confidence and conviction.

176
0:09:48.136,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I call it:

177
0:09:49.644,000 --> 0:09:52,000
finding your everyday courage.

178
0:09:54.048,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Thank you.

179
0:09:55.231,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

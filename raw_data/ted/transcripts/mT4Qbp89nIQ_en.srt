1
0:00:12.902,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We've had it all wrong.

2
0:00:16.379,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Everybody.

3
0:00:17.96,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We've had it all wrong.

4
0:00:20.508,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The very last thing we need to do

5
0:00:23.515,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is clean the ocean.

6
0:00:26.054,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Very last.

7
0:00:28.007,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Yeah, there is a garbage truck of plastic

8
0:00:32.166,000 --> 0:00:33,000
entering the ocean

9
0:00:34.125,000 --> 0:00:35,000
every minute

10
0:00:35.807,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of every hour of every day.

11
0:00:39.18,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And countless birds and animals

12
0:00:41.323,000 --> 0:00:43,000
are dying just from encountering plastic.

13
0:00:46.037,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We are experiencing the fastest rate of extinction ever,

14
0:00:50.132,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and plastic is in the food chain.

15
0:00:53.672,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I'm still here, standing in front of you,

16
0:00:55.835,000 --> 0:00:57,000
telling you the very last thing we need to do

17
0:00:59.109,000 --> 0:01:,000
is clean the ocean.

18
0:01:01.331,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Very last.

19
0:01:05.564,000 --> 0:01:06,000
If you were to walk into a kitchen,

20
0:01:08.477,000 --> 0:01:09,000
sink overflowing,

21
0:01:10.889,000 --> 0:01:11,000
water spilling all over the floor,

22
0:01:12.897,000 --> 0:01:13,000
soaking into the walls,

23
0:01:14.768,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you had to think fast, you're going to panic;

24
0:01:17.411,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you've got a bucket, a mop or a plunger.

25
0:01:20.474,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What do you do first?

26
0:01:23.531,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Why don't we turn off the tap?

27
0:01:26.92,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It would be pointless to mop

28
0:01:28.896,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or plunge or scoop up the water

29
0:01:31.381,000 --> 0:01:33,000
if we don't turn off the tap first.

30
0:01:35.693,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Why aren't we doing the same for the ocean?

31
0:01:38.986,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Even if the Ocean Cleanup project,

32
0:01:43.846,000 --> 0:01:44,000
beach plastic recycling programs

33
0:01:47.768,000 --> 0:01:48,000
or any well-meaning

34
0:01:50.164,000 --> 0:01:52,000
ocean plastic company

35
0:01:53.442,000 --> 0:01:54,000
was a hundred percent successful,

36
0:01:56.538,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it would still be too little, too late.

37
0:02:01.315,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We're trending to produce over 300 million ton

38
0:02:05.93,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of plastic this year.

39
0:02:09.272,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Roughly eight million ton

40
0:02:12.541,000 --> 0:02:14,000
are racing to flow into the ocean

41
0:02:14.919,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to join the estimated 150 million ton already there.

42
0:02:21.765,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Reportedly, 80 percent of ocean plastic

43
0:02:26.498,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is coming from those countries that have extreme poverty.

44
0:02:31.466,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And if you live in the grips of poverty

45
0:02:34.823,000 --> 0:02:36,000
concerned, always, about food

46
0:02:38.704,000 --> 0:02:39,000
or shelter

47
0:02:40.846,000 --> 0:02:41,000
or a sense of security,

48
0:02:43.75,000 --> 0:02:44,000
recycling --

49
0:02:45.393,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it's beyond your realm of imagination.

50
0:02:50.123,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And that is exactly why

51
0:02:54.155,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I created the Plastic Bank.

52
0:02:58.136,000 --> 0:03:,000
We are the world's largest chain of stores

53
0:03:00.506,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for the ultra-poor,

54
0:03:04.03,000 --> 0:03:07,000
where everything in the store is available to be purchased

55
0:03:07.117,000 --> 0:03:09,000
using plastic garbage.

56
0:03:09.925,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Everything.

57
0:03:11.704,000 --> 0:03:12,000
School tuition.

58
0:03:13.514,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Medical insurance.

59
0:03:15.593,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power.

60
0:03:18.442,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Sustainable cooking fuel, high-efficiency stoves.

61
0:03:23.228,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And we keep wanting to add everything else

62
0:03:25.574,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that the world may need and can't afford.

63
0:03:32.395,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Our chain of stores in Haiti are more like community centers,

64
0:03:38.173,000 --> 0:03:39,000
where one of our collectors,

65
0:03:40.339,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Lise Nasis,

66
0:03:43.791,000 --> 0:03:44,000
has the opportunity to earn a living

67
0:03:46.228,000 --> 0:03:48,000
by collecting material from door to door,

68
0:03:49.72,000 --> 0:03:5,000
from the streets,

69
0:03:51.204,000 --> 0:03:52,000
from business to business.

70
0:03:54.363,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And at the end of her day, she gets to bring the material back to us,

71
0:03:58.236,000 --> 0:04:,000
where we weigh it, we check it for quality,

72
0:04:00.934,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and we transfer the value into her account.

73
0:04:07.704,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Lise now has a steady,

74
0:04:10.386,000 --> 0:04:12,000
reliable source of income.

75
0:04:14.784,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And that value we transfer into an online account for her.

76
0:04:19.879,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And because it's a savings account, it becomes an asset

77
0:04:23.197,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that she can borrow against.

78
0:04:25.768,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And because it's online,

79
0:04:29.498,000 --> 0:04:3,000
she has security against robbery,

80
0:04:32.656,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I think more importantly,

81
0:04:35.442,000 --> 0:04:36,000
she has a new sense of worth.

82
0:04:37.89,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And even the plastic

83
0:04:39.509,000 --> 0:04:41,000
has a new sense of value.

84
0:04:45.921,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Hm.

85
0:04:48.863,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And that plastic we collect,

86
0:04:51.942,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and we add value to,

87
0:04:56.684,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we sort it,

88
0:04:58.072,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we remove labels,

89
0:05:00.009,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we remove caps.

90
0:05:04.303,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We either shred it

91
0:05:06.561,000 --> 0:05:08,000
or we pack it into bales and get it ready for export.

92
0:05:12.37,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, it's no different than walking over acres of diamonds.

93
0:05:17.093,000 --> 0:05:19,000
If Lise was to walk over acres of diamonds

94
0:05:19.8,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but there was no store, no bank,

95
0:05:21.855,000 --> 0:05:23,000
no way to use the diamonds, no way to exchange them,

96
0:05:25.855,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they'd be worthless, too.

97
0:05:29.934,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And Lise was widowed

98
0:05:32.157,000 --> 0:05:34,000
after the 2010 Haitian earthquake,

99
0:05:35.768,000 --> 0:05:36,000
left homeless without an income.

100
0:05:37.339,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And as a result of the program,

101
0:05:40.268,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Lise can afford her two daughters' school tuition

102
0:05:43.736,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and uniforms.

103
0:05:46.911,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, that plastic

104
0:05:49.213,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we sell.

105
0:05:53.276,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We sell it to suppliers of great brands

106
0:05:56.22,000 --> 0:05:57,000
like Marks and Spencer,

107
0:05:57.982,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who have commissioned the use of social plastic

108
0:06:01.815,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in their products.

109
0:06:04.759,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Or like Henkel,

110
0:06:06.172,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the German consumer-goods company,

111
0:06:09.767,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who are using social plastic directly into their manufacturing.

112
0:06:13.377,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We've closed the loop

113
0:06:16.196,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the circular economy.

114
0:06:20.259,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now buy shampoo

115
0:06:23.101,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or laundry detergent

116
0:06:24.95,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that has social plastic packaging,

117
0:06:28.22,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and you are indirectly contributing

118
0:06:30.339,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to the extraction of plastic from ocean-bound waterways

119
0:06:34.187,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and alleviating poverty

120
0:06:36.091,000 --> 0:06:37,000
at the same time.

121
0:06:39.488,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that model

122
0:06:41.083,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is completely replicable.

123
0:06:44.379,000 --> 0:06:45,000
In São Paulo,

124
0:06:46.538,000 --> 0:06:47,000
a church sermon encourages parishioners

125
0:06:48.434,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to not just bring offering on Sunday,

126
0:06:50.68,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but the recycling, too.

127
0:06:53.561,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We then match the church with the poor.

128
0:06:56.577,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Or, I believe more powerfully,

129
0:06:58.053,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we could match a mosque in London with an impoverished church in Cairo.

130
0:07:02.792,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Or like in Vancouver,

131
0:07:04.919,000 --> 0:07:05,000
with our bottle-deposit program:

132
0:07:07.395,000 --> 0:07:08,000
now any individual

133
0:07:09.482,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or any group

134
0:07:11.371,000 --> 0:07:12,000
can now return

135
0:07:12.558,000 --> 0:07:14,000
their deposit-refundable recyclables,

136
0:07:15.3,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and instead of taking back the cash,

137
0:07:18.06,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they have the opportunity to deposit that value

138
0:07:20.434,000 --> 0:07:22,000
into the account of the poor around the world.

139
0:07:24.776,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We can now use our recycling

140
0:07:27.093,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to support and create recyclers.

141
0:07:30.688,000 --> 0:07:32,000
One bottle deposited at home

142
0:07:33.1,000 --> 0:07:35,000
could help extract hundreds around the world.

143
0:07:37.193,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Or, like Shell,

144
0:07:39.518,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the energy company,

145
0:07:41.581,000 --> 0:07:43,000
who's invested in our plastic-neutral program.

146
0:07:44.927,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Plastic neutrality is like carbon-neutral.

147
0:07:48.927,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But plastic neutrality invests in recycling infrastructure

148
0:07:52.608,000 --> 0:07:53,000
where it doesn't exist.

149
0:07:55.379,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And it provides an incentive for the poor

150
0:07:57.886,000 --> 0:07:58,000
by providing a price increase.

151
0:08:00.786,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Or --

152
0:08:02.349,000 --> 0:08:03,000
like in the slums of Manila,

153
0:08:04.888,000 --> 0:08:06,000
where the smallest market

154
0:08:08.929,000 --> 0:08:1,000
with a simple scale and a phone

155
0:08:11.569,000 --> 0:08:12,000
can now accept social plastic

156
0:08:13.886,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as a new form of payment by weight,

157
0:08:16.831,000 --> 0:08:18,000
allowing them to serve more people

158
0:08:20.87,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and have their own greater social impact.

159
0:08:25.267,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And what's common here

160
0:08:29.387,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is that social plastic

161
0:08:31.688,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is money.

162
0:08:33.704,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Social plastic is money,

163
0:08:36.949,000 --> 0:08:39,000
a globally recognizable and tradable currency that, when used,

164
0:08:40.879,000 --> 0:08:42,000
alleviates poverty and cleans the environment

165
0:08:43.604,000 --> 0:08:44,000
at the same time.

166
0:08:47.825,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's not just plastic.

167
0:08:49.904,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's not recycled plastic, it's social plastic,

168
0:08:53.943,000 --> 0:08:55,000
a material whose value is transferred

169
0:08:56.14,000 --> 0:08:58,000
through the lives of the people who encounter it,

170
0:08:59.259,000 --> 0:09:01,000
rich and poor.

171
0:09:04.347,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Humans have produced

172
0:09:05.704,000 --> 0:09:08,000
over eight trillion kilograms of plastic,

173
0:09:08.872,000 --> 0:09:1,000
most of it still here as waste.

174
0:09:12.006,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Eight trillion kilograms.

175
0:09:13.8,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Worth roughly 50 cents a kilo,

176
0:09:17.323,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we're potentially unleashing a four-trillion-dollar value.

177
0:09:23.966,000 --> 0:09:24,000
See, I see social plastic

178
0:09:26.466,000 --> 0:09:27,000
as the Bitcoin for the earth --

179
0:09:28.828,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:29.894,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and available for everyone.

181
0:09:37.908,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now the entire ecosystem is managed and supported

182
0:09:40.807,000 --> 0:09:42,000
through an online banking platform

183
0:09:44.472,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that provides for the safe, authentic transfer of value globally.

184
0:09:49.31,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You can now deposit your recyclables in Vancouver or Berlin,

185
0:09:53.065,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and a family could withdraw building bricks or cell phone minutes

186
0:09:57.152,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in the slums of Manila.

187
0:09:59.398,000 --> 0:10:,000
Or Lise --

188
0:10:02.358,000 --> 0:10:04,000
she could deposit recycling at a center in Port-au-Prince,

189
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and her mother could withdraw cooking fuel or cash

190
0:10:07.747,000 --> 0:10:08,000
across the city.

191
0:10:11.149,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And the app adds rewards,

192
0:10:13.776,000 --> 0:10:14,000
incentives,

193
0:10:15.553,000 --> 0:10:16,000
group prizes,

194
0:10:17.696,000 --> 0:10:18,000
user rating.

195
0:10:20.708,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We've gamified recycling.

196
0:10:23.374,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We add fun and formality

197
0:10:26.566,000 --> 0:10:27,000
into an informal industry.

198
0:10:31.271,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We're operating in Haiti and the Philippines.

199
0:10:34.867,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We've selected staff

200
0:10:36.858,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and partners for Brazil.

201
0:10:39.301,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And this year, we're committing to India and Ethiopia.

202
0:10:44.198,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We're collecting hundreds

203
0:10:46.738,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and hundreds of tons of material.

204
0:10:49.261,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We continue to add partners

205
0:10:51.944,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and customers,

206
0:10:55.332,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and we increase our collection volumes every day.

207
0:10:59.007,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now as a result of our program with Henkel,

208
0:11:02.047,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they've committed to use over 100 million kilograms

209
0:11:06.356,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of material every year.

210
0:11:10.617,000 --> 0:11:12,000
That alone will put hundreds of millions of dollars

211
0:11:13.292,000 --> 0:11:14,000
into the hands of the poor

212
0:11:15.434,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in the emerging economies.

213
0:11:20.759,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And so now,

214
0:11:22.751,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we can all

215
0:11:25.236,000 --> 0:11:26,000
be a part of the solution

216
0:11:27.64,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and not the pollution.

217
0:11:31.145,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And so, OK, maybe cleaning the ocean is futile.

218
0:11:35.407,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It might be.

219
0:11:37.812,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But preventing ocean plastic

220
0:11:40.56,000 --> 0:11:42,000
could be humanity's richest opportunity.

221
0:11:45.084,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thank you.

222
0:11:46.382,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, what I'm going to do is

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
just give you the latest episode of India's --

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which is cricket.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's got love, joy, happiness,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
sadness, tears, laughter,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
lots of deceit, intrigue.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
when the audience interest changes.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And that's exactly what cricket has done.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's jumped 20 years

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
into 20-over game.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And that's what I'm going to talk about,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
how a small change

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
leads to a very big revolution.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But it wasn't always like that.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Cricket wasn't always this

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
speed-driven generations game.

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
There was a time when you played cricket,

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you played timeless test matches,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
when you played on till the game got over.

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And there was this game in March 1939

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that started on the third of March

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and ended on the 14th of March.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And it only ended because the English cricketers

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
had to go from Durban to Cape Town,

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which is a two-hour train journey,

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to catch the ship that left on the 17th,

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So, the match was ended in between.

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Another half an hour and we would have won."

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Another half an hour after 12 days.

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so they all sat around making friends with each other.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because we had about the same pace of life.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
You fought by day, then it was sunset,

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so everyone went back home.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And then you worked out your strategy,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Princes patronize the game,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
not because they love the game,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to the British rulers.

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which was, all you needed was a plank of wood

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and a rubber ball, and any number of people

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
could play it anywhere.

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Take a look:

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You could play it in the dump

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
with some rocks over there,

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you could play it in a little alley --

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
As you can see, you can play anywhere.

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But slowly the game moved on,

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
you know, finally.

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You don't always have five days. So, we moved on,

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and we started playing 50-over cricket.

75
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And then an enormous accident took place.

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In Indian sport we don't make things happen,

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And we won this World Cup in 1983.

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and we played it virtually every day.

81
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.

82
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But there was another big date.

83
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
1983 was when we won the World Cup.

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
1991,'92, we found a finance minister

85
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and a prime minister

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
willing to let the world look at India,

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
rather than be this great country of intrigue

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and mystery in this closed country.

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so we allowed multinationals into India.

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and we got all the multinationals coming in,

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with multinational budgets,

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who looked at per-capita income

94
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and got very excited about the possibilities in India,

95
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
The scripted one is what you see in the movies,

98
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the real one was cricket.

99
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
all over the world.

102
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And so cricket started becoming big;

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
cricket started bringing riches in.

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Television started covering cricket. For a long time

106
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
television said, "We won't cover cricket

107
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
unless you pay us to cover it."

108
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Then they said, "OK,

109
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.

110
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."

111
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So, it's a bit of a curve, that.

112
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And then another big accident happened in our cricket.

113
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
England invented 20 overs cricket,

114
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."

115
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.

116
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Thank God for them.

117
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

118
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.

119
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.

120
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.

121
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And then something very dramatic happened.

122
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We got to the final, and then this moment,

123
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that will remain enshrined forever,

124
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for everybody, take a look.

125
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Crowd cheering)

126
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.

127
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!

128
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What a match for a Twenty20 final.

129
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
India, the world champions.

130
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Cheering)

131
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
India, T20 champions.

132
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni

133
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.

134
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
A massive, massive success:

135
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
India, the world TT champions.

136
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.

137
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman

138
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
thought the bowler was bowling fast.

139
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

140
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,

141
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered

142
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that we could be good at this game.

143
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And what it also did was

144
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.

145
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It was at a time when investment was coming in,

146
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
India was feeling a little more confident about itself.

147
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride

148
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in what we can do.

149
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And thankfully for all of us,

150
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the English are very good at inventing things,

151
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and then the gracious people that they are,

152
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they let the world become very good at it.

153
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And so England invented T20 cricket,

155
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and allowed India to hijack it.

156
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,

157
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we just took it straight away, as is.

158
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

159
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And so, we launched our own T20 league.

160
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Six weeks, city versus city.

161
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --

162
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the only two areas in which India was very proud about

163
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
their country, representing itself on the field.

164
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.

165
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The other was Indian cricket.

166
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.

167
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But the people getting into these city leagues

168
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
were people who were taking their cues from the West.

169
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
America is a home of leagues. And they said,

170
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."

171
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But was India ready for it?

172
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.

173
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.

174
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,

175
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
simple family game.

176
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
All of a sudden, you had that happening.

177
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Music)

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
An opening ceremony to match every other.

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.

180
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
than New Zealand's population twice over.

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So, it was a different India.

183
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India

184
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that was very happy to be modern,

185
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but didn't want to say that to people.

186
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.

187
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.

188
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Music)

189
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.

191
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They were not bureaucrats who were forced

192
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
into sport because they didn't actually love it;

193
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
these were people who ran serious companies.

194
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And so they started promoting cricket big time,

195
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
started promoting clubs big time.

196
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.

197
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars

198
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
before a ball was bowled,

199
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,

200
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises

201
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,

202
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.

203
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But what they were very good at doing

204
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
was making it very localized.

205
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So, just to give you an example of how they did it --

206
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
not Manchester United style promotion,

207
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.

208
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Music)

209
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."

210
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.

212
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,

213
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,

214
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
your own city, and you were very proud

215
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of the system that produced those cricketers.

216
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --

217
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,

218
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they needn't go to Kalbadevi

219
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,

220
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
they could go to Trinidad.

221
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,

222
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where you can source from anywhere

223
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
as long as you get the best product at the best price.

224
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality

225
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that you can source the best product for the best price

226
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
anywhere in the world.

227
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,

228
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
overnight. And when he had to go back to represent

229
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"

230
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."

231
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;

232
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it's about when do you have to reach there?"

233
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."

234
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."

235
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,

236
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,

237
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,

238
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.

239
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Never would India have thought on this scale before.

241
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Never would India have said, "I want a player to play

242
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet

243
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica

244
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to play a game."

245
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And I just thought to myself,

246
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?

247
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."

248
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But what this also did was it started

249
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,

250
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.

251
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
There is cricket and the movies.

252
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And they came together because people in the movies

253
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
now started owning clubs.

254
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.

255
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.

256
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And something very interesting happened.

257
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.

258
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.

259
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --

260
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,

261
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
you got a hug from Preity Zinta.

262
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --

263
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
everyone's watching Preity Zinta.

264
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Music)

265
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.

266
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We'd all seen matches in Kolkata,

267
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but we'd never seen anything like this:

268
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up

269
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.

270
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But take a look at this.

271
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Music)

272
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer

273
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
because they'd won in Kolkata.

274
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Can you imagine?

275
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?

276
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

277
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."

278
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Laughter)

279
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But I thought I'd take this opportunity --

280
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
there's a few people from Pakistan in here.

281
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I'm so happy that you're here

282
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?

283
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We can play cricket together, we can be friends.

284
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.

285
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Applause)

286
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
There was criticism too because they said,

287
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
"Players are being bought and sold?

288
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Are they grain?

289
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Are they cattle?"

290
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Because we had this auction, you see.

291
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
How do you fix a price for a player?

292
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And so the auction that followed

293
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
literally had people saying,

294
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."

295
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
There it is.

296
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
(Music)

297
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.

298
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.

299
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --

300
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
so 250 rupees for a test match,

301
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but if you finish in four days you only got 200.

302
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The best Indian players who played every test match --

303
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
every one of the internationals, the top of the line players --

304
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.

305
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.

306
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England,

307
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,

308
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,

309
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."

310
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.

311
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Could you have imagined that day would come?

312
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.

313
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
That's not bad, is it?

314
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.

315
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
What India was doing, though, was benchmarking

316
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
itself against the best in the world,

317
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and it became a huge brand.

318
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.

319
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
IPL became the biggest brand in India

320
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,

321
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.

322
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.

323
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
But we did it. You know why?

324
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Because no country works as slowly as we do

325
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
till three weeks before an event,

326
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.

327
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Applause)

328
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,

329
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
suddenly became our biggest asset

330
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
because there were more people watching --

331
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the huge consuming class --

332
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
everybody came to watch the cricket.

333
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India,

334
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
which is a pity, but in India every other sport

335
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
pushes cricket to become big,

336
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.

337
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Now, this last minute before I go --

338
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
there's a couple of side effects of all this.

339
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
For a long time, India was this country of poverty,

340
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
dust, beggars,

341
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
snake charmers, filth,

342
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.

343
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.

344
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Cricketers all over the world said,

345
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."

346
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And that felt good, you know?

347
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."

348
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view

349
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.

350
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,

351
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.

352
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Right so, finally,

353
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
an English game that India usurped a little bit,

354
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.

355
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
If you want to take the game around the world,

356
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
it's got to be the shortest form of the game.

357
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,

358
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
or you can't take it all over the world.

359
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So that's what T20 is doing.

360
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger

361
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.

362
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

363
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Applause)

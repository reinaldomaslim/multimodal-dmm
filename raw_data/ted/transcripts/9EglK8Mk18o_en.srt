Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.536,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So I'll be talking about the success of my campus,

3
0:00:16.598,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,

4
0:00:19.348,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in educating students of all types,

5
0:00:22.539,000 --> 0:00:26,000
across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas.

6
0:00:26.666,000 --> 0:00:3,000
What makes our story especially important

7
0:00:30.744,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is that we have learned so much from a group of students

8
0:00:35.952,000 --> 0:00:38,000
who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder --

9
0:00:39.299,000 --> 0:00:42,000
students of color, students underrepresented in selected areas.

10
0:00:43.297,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And what makes the story especially unique

11
0:00:46.148,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students,

12
0:00:50.982,000 --> 0:00:51,000
students from low-income backgrounds,

13
0:00:52.786,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.

14
0:00:56.244,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And so I begin with a story about my childhood.

15
0:00:59.714,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We all are products of our childhood experiences.

16
0:01:02.786,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years

17
0:01:06.964,000 --> 0:01:11,000
since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama,

18
0:01:12.87,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a kid who loved getting A's,

19
0:01:15.037,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a kid who loved math, who loved to read,

20
0:01:17.724,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a kid who would say to the teacher --

21
0:01:20.453,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when the teacher said, "Here are 10 problems," to the class,

22
0:01:23.709,000 --> 0:01:27,000
this little fat kid would say, "Give us 10 more."

23
0:01:27.79,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And the whole class would say, "Shut up, Freeman."

24
0:01:31.102,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And there was a designated kicker every day.

25
0:01:34.716,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And so I was always asking this question:

26
0:01:36.597,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?"

27
0:01:42.554,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And amazingly, one week in church,

28
0:01:45.672,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when I really didn't want to be there

29
0:01:47.754,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems,

30
0:01:52.855,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I heard this man say this:

31
0:01:55.291,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"If we can get the children

32
0:01:57.773,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham,

33
0:02:03.77,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong

34
0:02:09.171,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and that children really do want to get the best possible education."

35
0:02:13.904,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I looked up and said, "Who is that man?"

36
0:02:15.625,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King.

37
0:02:18.754,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And I said to my parents, "I've got to go.

38
0:02:20.685,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I want to go. I want to be a part of this."

39
0:02:22.254,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And they said, "Absolutely not."

40
0:02:24.124,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:25.337,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And we had a rough go of it.

42
0:02:27.255,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And at that time, quite frankly, you really did not talk back to your parents.

43
0:02:30.708,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And somehow I said, "You know, you guys are hypocrites.

44
0:02:32.995,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You make me go to this. You make me listen.

45
0:02:34.972,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The man wants me to go, and now you say no."

46
0:02:37.206,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And they thought about it all night.

47
0:02:38.954,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And they came into my room the next morning.

48
0:02:41.088,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They had not slept.

49
0:02:42.588,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They had been literally crying and praying and thinking,

50
0:02:45.104,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"Will we let our 12-year-old

51
0:02:48.664,000 --> 0:02:52,000
participate in this march and probably have to go to jail?"

52
0:02:52.816,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And they decided to do it.

53
0:02:54.505,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And when they came in to tell me,

54
0:02:55.887,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I was at first elated.

55
0:02:57.672,000 --> 0:03:,000
And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses,

56
0:03:01.604,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I got really scared, I really did.

57
0:03:04.486,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And one of the points I make to people all the time

58
0:03:06.588,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous,

59
0:03:09.823,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it doesn't really mean that they're that courageous.

60
0:03:12.172,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It simply means that they believe it's important to do it.

61
0:03:15.02,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I wanted a better education.

62
0:03:16.771,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books.

63
0:03:20.004,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I wanted to know that the school I attended

64
0:03:22.487,000 --> 0:03:24,000
not only had good teachers, but the resources we needed.

65
0:03:24.912,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And as a result of that experience,

66
0:03:26.588,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in the middle of the week, while I was there in jail,

67
0:03:28.922,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Dr. King came and said with our parents,

68
0:03:31.472,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"What you children do this day

69
0:03:34.437,000 --> 0:03:38,000
will have an impact on children who have not been born."

70
0:03:39.021,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I recently realized that two-thirds of Americans today

71
0:03:43.956,000 --> 0:03:46,000
had not been born at the time of 1963.

72
0:03:47.47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And so for them, when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham,

73
0:03:50.411,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in many ways, if they see it on TV,

74
0:03:52.673,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it's like our looking at the 1863 "Lincoln" movie:

75
0:03:56.087,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's history.

76
0:03:57.521,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And the real question is, what lessons did we learn?

77
0:04:00.494,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well amazingly, the most important for me was this:

78
0:04:03.386,000 --> 0:04:08,000
That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education.

79
0:04:08.686,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They can be taught to be passionate

80
0:04:11.037,000 --> 0:04:15,000
about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions.

81
0:04:15.578,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And so it is especially significant

82
0:04:18.373,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that the university I now lead,

83
0:04:20.459,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,

84
0:04:23.254,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963.

85
0:04:29.04,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And what made that institutional founding especially important

86
0:04:33.21,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is that Maryland is the South, as you know,

87
0:04:37.744,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and, quite frankly, it was the first university in our state

88
0:04:42.326,000 --> 0:04:46,000
founded at a time when students of all races could go there.

89
0:04:46.402,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend.

90
0:04:49.975,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And it has been for 50 years an experiment.

91
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The experiment is this:

92
0:04:55.86,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Is it possible to have institutions in our country, universities,

93
0:04:59.819,000 --> 0:05:01,000
where people from all backgrounds can come and learn

94
0:05:02.756,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and learn to work together and learn to become leaders

95
0:05:06.339,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and to support each other in that experience?

96
0:05:09.912,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this:

97
0:05:14.827,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences.

98
0:05:19.495,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And so we began to work on that, for years in the '60s.

99
0:05:22.051,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And we produced a number of people in law, all the way to the humanities.

100
0:05:25.834,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse.

101
0:05:28.467,000 --> 0:05:29,000
A lot of our students get into theater.

102
0:05:30.004,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It's great work.

103
0:05:31.004,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face --

104
0:05:35.036,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that students in the sciences and engineering,

105
0:05:36.883,000 --> 0:05:38,000
black students were not succeeding.

106
0:05:38.994,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But when I looked at the data,

107
0:05:40.745,000 --> 0:05:43,000
what I found was that, quite frankly, students in general,

108
0:05:44.077,000 --> 0:05:45,000
large numbers were not making it.

109
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And as a result of that,

110
0:05:47.618,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we decided to do something that would help, first of all,

111
0:05:50.952,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the group at the bottom, African-American students, and then Hispanic students.

112
0:05:55.169,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, philanthropists, said, "We'd like to help."

113
0:05:59.5,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Robert Meyerhoff said, "Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys,

114
0:06:02.953,000 --> 0:06:04,000
if it's not about basketball, is not positive?

115
0:06:05.751,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I'd like to make a difference, to do something that's positive."

116
0:06:08.383,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We married those ideas, and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program.

117
0:06:12.05,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And what is significant about the program

118
0:06:14.119,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is that we learned a number of things.

119
0:06:16.6,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And the question is this:

120
0:06:17.952,000 --> 0:06:21,000
How is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans

121
0:06:22.417,000 --> 0:06:26,000
who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D./Ph.D.'s?

122
0:06:27.267,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal.

123
0:06:29.916,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's a big deal. It really is.

124
0:06:32.151,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Applause)

125
0:06:34.727,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You see, most people don't realize

126
0:06:36.671,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering.

127
0:06:40.721,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Quite frankly, you're talking about Americans.

128
0:06:44.338,000 --> 0:06:47,000
If you don't know it, while 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics

129
0:06:47.786,000 --> 0:06:49,000
who begin with a major in science and engineering

130
0:06:50.121,000 --> 0:06:52,000
will actually graduate in science and engineering,

131
0:06:52.273,000 --> 0:06:55,000
only 32 percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas

132
0:06:55.827,000 --> 0:06:57,000
actually succeed and graduate in those areas,

133
0:06:58.485,000 --> 0:07:,000
and only 42 percent of Asian-Americans.

134
0:07:00.59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And so, the real question is, what is the challenge?

135
0:07:03.201,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Well a part of it, of course, is K-12.

136
0:07:05.588,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We need to strengthen K-12.

137
0:07:07.537,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But the other part has to do with the culture

138
0:07:09.833,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of science and engineering on our campuses.

139
0:07:12.493,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Whether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's

140
0:07:16.338,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and large numbers of A.P. credits

141
0:07:17.803,000 --> 0:07:19,000
who go to the most prestigious universities in our country

142
0:07:20.505,000 --> 0:07:24,000
begin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors.

143
0:07:25.336,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And the number one reason, we find, quite frankly,

144
0:07:27.802,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is they did not do well in first year science courses.

145
0:07:30.752,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In fact, we call first year science and engineering, typically around America,

146
0:07:34.535,000 --> 0:07:36,000
weed-out courses or barrier courses.

147
0:07:36.669,000 --> 0:07:37,000
How many of you in this audience know somebody

148
0:07:38.437,000 --> 0:07:39,000
who started off in pre-med or engineering

149
0:07:40.252,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and changed their major within a year or two?

150
0:07:42.137,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It's an American challenge. Half of you in the room.

151
0:07:43.935,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I know. I know. I know.

152
0:07:45.336,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And what is interesting about that

153
0:07:46.994,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is that so many students are smart and can do it.

154
0:07:49.704,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We need to find ways of making it happen.

155
0:07:51.97,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So what are the four things we did to help minority students

156
0:07:54.577,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that now are helping students in general?

157
0:07:56.386,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Number one: high expectations.

158
0:07:58.253,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students --

159
0:08:02.758,000 --> 0:08:04,000
their grades, the rigor of the course work,

160
0:08:05.102,000 --> 0:08:07,000
their test-taking skills, their attitude,

161
0:08:07.553,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the fire in their belly, the passion for the work, to make it.

162
0:08:10.278,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position, very important.

163
0:08:14.519,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But equally important, it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference.

164
0:08:19.618,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are.

165
0:08:22.136,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Smart simply means you're ready to learn.

166
0:08:24.503,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions.

167
0:08:27.745,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I. I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate, said that when he was growing up in New York,

168
0:08:32.032,000 --> 0:08:34,000
all of his friends' parents would ask them

169
0:08:34.578,000 --> 0:08:36,000
"What did you learn in school?" at the end of a day.

170
0:08:37.22,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And he said, in contrast, his Jewish mother would say,

171
0:08:40.757,000 --> 0:08:43,000
"Izzy, did you ask a good question today?"

172
0:08:43.819,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And so high expectations have to do with curiosity

173
0:08:46.518,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and encouraging young people to be curious.

174
0:08:49.036,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And as a result of those high expectations,

175
0:08:50.552,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we began to find students we wanted to work with

176
0:08:53.219,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to see what could we do to help them,

177
0:08:54.912,000 --> 0:08:56,000
not simply to survive in science and engineering,

178
0:08:57.452,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but to become the very best, to excel.

179
0:09:00.386,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Interestingly enough, an example:

180
0:09:02.203,000 --> 0:09:06,000
One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school,

181
0:09:07.105,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we said, "We need to have you retake the course,

182
0:09:09.22,000 --> 0:09:12,000
because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level."

183
0:09:13.004,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Every foundation makes the difference in the next level.

184
0:09:16.035,000 --> 0:09:17,000
He retook the course.

185
0:09:17.176,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That young man went on to graduate from UMBC,

186
0:09:19.605,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.

187
0:09:23.802,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He now works at Harvard.

188
0:09:25.008,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Nice story. Give him a hand for that too.

189
0:09:27.455,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

190
0:09:29.886,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Secondly, it's not about test scores only.

191
0:09:32.381,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Test scores are important, but they're not the most important thing.

192
0:09:34.37,000 --> 0:09:37,000
One young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high.

193
0:09:37.415,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But she had a factor that was very important.

194
0:09:39.464,000 --> 0:09:42,000
She never missed a day of school, K-12.

195
0:09:42.712,000 --> 0:09:43,000
There was fire in that belly.

196
0:09:44.133,000 --> 0:09:48,000
That young woman went on, and she is today with an M.D./Ph.D. from Hopkins.

197
0:09:48.257,000 --> 0:09:52,000
She's on the faculty, tenure track in psychiatry, Ph.D. in neuroscience.

198
0:09:52.475,000 --> 0:09:56,000
She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients.

199
0:09:57.286,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Big hand for her. Big hand for her.

200
0:09:59.771,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Applause)

201
0:10:01.157,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And so high expectations, very important.

202
0:10:03.677,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Secondly, the idea of building community among the students.

203
0:10:06.536,000 --> 0:10:08,000
You all know that so often in science and engineering

204
0:10:09.303,000 --> 0:10:1,000
we tend to think cutthroat.

205
0:10:10.994,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Students are not taught to work in groups.

206
0:10:13.31,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And that's what we work to do with that group

207
0:10:15.202,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to get them to understand each other,

208
0:10:16.705,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to build trust among them, to support each other,

209
0:10:19.328,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to learn how to ask good questions,

210
0:10:21.037,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity.

211
0:10:24.524,000 --> 0:10:26,000
As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself,

212
0:10:26.787,000 --> 0:10:28,000
it's another thing to help someone else do well.

213
0:10:28.912,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world.

214
0:10:32.827,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So building community among those students, very important.

215
0:10:35.774,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Third, the idea of, it takes researchers to produce researchers.

216
0:10:40.578,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Whether you're talking about artists producing artists

217
0:10:43.107,000 --> 0:10:45,000
or you're talking about people getting into the social sciences,

218
0:10:46.022,000 --> 0:10:5,000
whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering, as in art, for example --

219
0:10:50.869,000 --> 0:10:52,000
you need scientists to pull the students into the work.

220
0:10:53.672,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And so our students are working in labs regularly.

221
0:10:56.412,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And one great example that you'll appreciate:

222
0:10:58.786,000 --> 0:11:01,000
During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago,

223
0:11:01.846,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant

224
0:11:05.466,000 --> 0:11:09,000
literally came back to work in his lab after several days,

225
0:11:09.89,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and all these students had refused to leave the lab.

226
0:11:13.183,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They had food they had packed out.

227
0:11:15.267,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They were in the lab working,

228
0:11:16.582,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and they saw the work, not as schoolwork, but as their lives.

229
0:11:20.583,000 --> 0:11:21,000
They knew they were working on AIDS research.

230
0:11:22.495,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They were looking at this amazing protein design.

231
0:11:25.703,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work.

232
0:11:30.036,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And he said, "It doesn't get any better than that."

233
0:11:32.202,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And then finally, if you've got the community

234
0:11:34.287,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers,

235
0:11:37.9,000 --> 0:11:39,000
you have to have people who are willing as faculty

236
0:11:40.788,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to get involved with those students, even in the classroom.

237
0:11:43.851,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying,

238
0:11:46.299,000 --> 0:11:48,000
"I've got this young man in class, a young black guy,

239
0:11:48.744,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and he seems like he's just not excited about the work.

240
0:11:51.784,000 --> 0:11:53,000
He's not taking notes. We need to talk to him."

241
0:11:54.019,000 --> 0:11:57,000
What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student

242
0:11:57.891,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to understand who was really involved and who was not

243
0:12:00.807,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and was saying, "Let me see how I can work with them.

244
0:12:03.174,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Let me get the staff to help me out."

245
0:12:04.411,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It was that connecting.

246
0:12:05.563,000 --> 0:12:09,000
That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D./Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke.

247
0:12:10.495,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Give him a big hand for that.

248
0:12:11.707,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

249
0:12:13.703,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And so the significance is that we have now developed this model

250
0:12:18.523,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that is helping us, not only finally with evaluation, assessing what works.

251
0:12:22.688,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses.

252
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics.

253
0:12:28.661,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences.

254
0:12:32.322,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Because so many students are bored in class.

255
0:12:34.869,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Do you know that?

256
0:12:36.049,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Many students, K-12 and in universities,

257
0:12:37.995,000 --> 0:12:39,000
don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk.

258
0:12:40.5,000 --> 0:12:41,000
They need to be engaged.

259
0:12:41.87,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And so we have done -- if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center,

260
0:12:45.32,000 --> 0:12:46,000
you'll see people coming from all over the country

261
0:12:47.285,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to look at how we are redesigning courses,

262
0:12:49.864,000 --> 0:12:52,000
having an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology,

263
0:12:53.355,000 --> 0:12:56,000
using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus,

264
0:12:56.585,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and not giving students the theories,

265
0:12:58.615,000 --> 0:13:,000
but having them struggle with those theories.

266
0:13:00.847,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland,

267
0:13:04.506,000 --> 0:13:06,000
more and more courses are being redesigned.

268
0:13:06.547,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It's called academic innovation.

269
0:13:08.381,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And what does all of that mean?

270
0:13:09.586,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It means that now, not just in science and engineering,

271
0:13:12.429,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we now have programs in the arts, in the humanities, in the social sciences,

272
0:13:16.537,000 --> 0:13:2,000
in teacher education, even particularly for women in I.T.

273
0:13:21.129,000 --> 0:13:25,000
If you don't know it, there's been a 79-percent decline

274
0:13:25.216,000 --> 0:13:29,000
in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000.

275
0:13:29.334,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And what I'm saying is that what will make the difference

276
0:13:32.647,000 --> 0:13:34,000
will be building community among students,

277
0:13:35.202,000 --> 0:13:37,000
telling young women, young minority students and students in general,

278
0:13:38.198,000 --> 0:13:39,000
you can do this work.

279
0:13:39.447,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And most important, giving them a chance to build that community

280
0:13:42.717,000 --> 0:13:44,000
with faculty pulling them into the work

281
0:13:44.88,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and our assessing what works and what does not work.

282
0:13:47.398,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Most important, if a student has a sense of self,

283
0:13:51.246,000 --> 0:13:53,000
it is amazing how the dreams and the values

284
0:13:54.13,000 --> 0:13:55,000
can make all the difference in the world.

285
0:13:56.119,000 --> 0:13:59,000
When I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham,

286
0:13:59.749,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I kept thinking, "I wonder what my future could be."

287
0:14:03.013,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham

288
0:14:08.798,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries,

289
0:14:13.763,000 --> 0:14:15,000
where students are not there just to survive,

290
0:14:16.119,000 --> 0:14:2,000
where they love learning, where they enjoy being the best,

291
0:14:20.12,000 --> 0:14:22,000
where they will one day change the world.

292
0:14:22.661,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Aristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.

293
0:14:26.036,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.

294
0:14:32.031,000 --> 0:14:35,000
It represents the wisest option among many alternatives."

295
0:14:35.963,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And then he said something that gives me goosebumps.

296
0:14:38.297,000 --> 0:14:43,000
He said, "Choice, not chance, determines your destiny."

297
0:14:43.944,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Choice, not chance, determines your destiny, dreams and values.

298
0:14:51.506,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Thank you all very much.

299
0:14:53.44,000 --> 0:15:03,000
(Applause)

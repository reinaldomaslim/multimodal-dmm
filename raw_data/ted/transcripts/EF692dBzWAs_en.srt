0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which was this very implausible technology

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that technically could have worked,

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This was a perfect introduction.

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it's a story that did work. It did happen,

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the machines are all around us.

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And it was a technology that was inevitable.

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
If the people I'm going to tell you the story about,

12
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
if they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now.

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's the universe in which these machines

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
are now doing all these things, including changing biology.

17
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity,

18
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED:

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
it brought a whole lot of very smart people together.

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And three of the smartest people were

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Stan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb,

23
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
he was working on something much more important than bombs:

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
he's thinking about computers.

25
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
He built this machine,

28
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works,

29
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.

30
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The first person to really explain that

31
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651,

32
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing,

33
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic,

34
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you can do it all with arithmetic.

35
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
He said you needed addition and subtraction.

36
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 --

37
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
showed that you didn't even need subtraction.

38
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You could do the whole thing with addition.

39
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic

40
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that drove the computer revolution.

41
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.

42
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
He talked about doing it with marbles,

43
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
having gates and what we now call shift registers,

44
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.

45
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And that's what all these machines are doing,

46
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
except, instead of doing it with marbles,

47
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
they're doing it with electrons.

48
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945,

49
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.

50
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed

51
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to actually try and build such a machine.

52
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet --

53
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing,

54
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which also goes back to Turing,

55
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this

56
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with a very brainless, little, finite state machine,

57
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.

58
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did

59
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.

60
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people,

61
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
giving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.

62
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will,

63
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but capable of only two ideas.

64
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And that's really the simplest computer.

66
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's basically why you need the qubit,

67
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because it only has two ideas.

68
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And you put lots of those together,

69
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you get the essentials of the modern computer:

70
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory,

71
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the recording medium, the input and the output.

72
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But, there's one catch. This is the fatal -- you know,

73
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we saw it in starting these programs up.

74
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The instructions which govern this operation

75
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.

76
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work.

77
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
If you look at the origins of this,

78
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.

79
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about,

80
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there,

81
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
really should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history,

82
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and give some of these guys more credit than they've had.

83
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Such a computer would open up universes,

84
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.

85
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.

86
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The guy who was supposed to build this machine

87
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.

88
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions

89
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of all time, decided not to go into computers.

90
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.

91
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know,

92
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
televisions are the future, not computers.

93
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The essentials were all there --

94
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
all the things that make these machines run.

95
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army

96
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.

97
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
When RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton,

98
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
where Freeman works at the Institute.

99
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That's where I grew up as a kid.

100
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before,

101
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so we both go back to the birth of this thing.

102
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That's Freeman, a long time ago,

103
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and that was me.

104
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern,

105
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
who wrote the "Theory of Games."

106
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
All these forces came together there, in Princeton.

107
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.

108
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.

109
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And Julian Bigelow, who took

110
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics,

111
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this,

112
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.

113
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.

114
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They didn't fit in at the Institute.

115
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This is a letter from the director, concerned about --

116
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"especially unfair on the matter of sugar."

117
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You can read the text.

119
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time.

121
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter).

122
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
These were not theoretical physicists.

123
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
They were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.

124
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And we take it for granted now, that each of these machines

125
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
has billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.

126
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques

127
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.

128
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
They actually used 6J6, the common radio tube,

129
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.

130
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.

131
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Reports were issued, so that this machine was cloned

132
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
at 15 other places around the world.

133
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it really was. It was the original microprocessor.

134
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
All the computers now are copies of that machine.

135
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The memory was in cathode ray tubes --

136
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube --

137
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.

138
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So, there's 40 of these tubes,

139
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
like a V-40 engine running the memory.

140
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The input and the output was by teletype tape at first.

142
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.

143
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.

144
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Then they switched to a magnetic drum.

145
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is modifying IBM equipment,

146
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.

147
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And this is the beginning of computer graphics.

148
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide,

149
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954.

150
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud,

151
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build

152
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
reliable machines out of unreliable components.

153
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it

154
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all

155
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.

156
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.

157
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."

158
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
This includes a large amount of human error.

159
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?

160
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
What's code, what's hardware?

161
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
That's an engineer gazing at tube number 36,

162
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.

163
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.

164
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running,

165
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
let alone having, you know, software problems.

166
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"No use, went home." (Laughter)

167
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"Impossible to follow the damn thing, where's a directory?"

168
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So, already, they're complaining about the manuals:

169
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"before closing down in disgust ... "

170
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
"The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs."

171
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Burning lots of midnight oil.

172
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"MANIAC," which became the acronym for the machine,

173
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory."

174
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off." "Machine or human?"

175
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
"Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem.

176
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"Found trouble in code, I hope."

177
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"Code error, machine not guilty."

178
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing."

179
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"And the dawn came." So they ran all night.

181
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.

182
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
"Everything up to this point is wasted time." "What's the use? Good night."

183
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
"Master control off. The hell with it. Way off." (Laughter)

184
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"Something's wrong with the air conditioner --

185
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
smell of burning V-belts in the air."

186
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"A short -- do not turn the machine on."

187
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof."

188
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So they really were working under tough conditions.

189
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Here, "A mouse has climbed into the blower

191
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse."

192
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953."

194
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
There's an inside joke someone has penciled in:

196
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"Here lies Marston Mouse."

197
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
If you're a mathematician, you get that,

198
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because Marston was a mathematician who

199
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
objected to the computer being there.

200
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
"Picked a lightning bug off the drum." "Running at two kilocycles."

201
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
That's two thousand cycles per second --

202
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
"yes, I'm chicken" -- so two kilocycles was slow speed.

203
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The high speed was 16 kilocycles.

204
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz,

205
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that's slow speed.

206
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
"I have now duplicated both results.

207
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
How will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?

208
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This now is the third different output.

209
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I know when I'm licked."

210
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

211
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"We've duplicated errors before."

212
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Machine run, fine. Code isn't."

213
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
"Only happens when the machine is running."

214
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And sometimes things are okay.

215
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running."

216
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
"Parting thought: when there's bigger and better errors, we'll have them."

217
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.

218
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook,

219
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
late one night, finally drew a bomb.

220
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So, that was the result. It was Mike,

221
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.

222
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
That was designed on that machine,

223
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in the woods behind the Institute.

224
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos

225
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
from all over the world to work on all these problems.

226
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life,

227
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
trying to see if, in this artificial universe --

228
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.

229
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.

230
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.

231
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Began -- his universe started March 3, '53.

232
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.

233
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And he saw everything in terms of --

234
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
he could read the binary code straight off the machine.

235
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He had a wonderful rapport.

236
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.

237
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
Even errors were duplicated.

238
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

239
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."

240
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So he designed this universe, and ran it.

241
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.

242
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
He would run that thing all night long, running these things,

243
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram,

244
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
who reinvented this stuff.

245
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.

246
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It was published in the literature.

247
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"

248
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So, he decided to give it a try,

249
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to start this artificial biology going in the machines.

250
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And he found all these, sort of --

251
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
it was like a naturalist coming in

252
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe,

253
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and seeing all these things happening

254
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that we see in the outside world, in biology.

255
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
This is some of the generations of his universe.

256
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But they're just going to stay numbers;

257
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
they're not going to become organisms.

258
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They have to have something.

259
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.

260
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that,

261
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with --

262
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
playing chess with other machines and so on.

263
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And they did start to evolve.

264
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And he went around the country after that.

265
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it,

266
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and saw exactly what's happening now.

267
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
That the programs, instead of being turned off -- when you quit the program,

268
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
you'd keep running

269
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing,

270
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines,

271
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
he envisioned all that happening.

272
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.

273
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence,

274
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation

275
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that would have some intelligence.

276
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And he went out of his way to say

277
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that he was not saying this was lifelike,

278
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
or a new kind of life.

279
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It just was another version of the same thing happening.

280
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer

281
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and what nature did billions of years ago.

282
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And could you do it again now?

283
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold,

284
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the archivist came up one day, saying,

285
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
"I think we found another box that had been thrown out."

286
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And it was his universe on punch cards.

287
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there -- sort of suspended animation.

288
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
That's the instructions for running --

289
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
this is actually the source code

290
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for one of those universes,

291
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
with a note from the engineers

292
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
saying they're having some problems.

293
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet."

294
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand

295
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.

296
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
What's the dividing line between

297
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
when that is lifelike and when it really is alive?

298
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
These cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.

299
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And the question is, should we run them or not?

300
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You know, could we get them running?

301
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?

302
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
These machines would think they --

303
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
these organisms, if they came back to life now --

304
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
whether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.

305
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
My laptop is 10 thousand million times

306
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.

307
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
He was thinking far ahead, to

308
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
how this would really grow into a new kind of life.

309
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And that's what's happening!

310
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
When Juan Enriquez told us about

311
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth,

312
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab,

313
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that's what Barricelli imagined:

314
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that this digital code in these machines

315
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
is actually starting to code --

316
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it already is coding from nucleic acids.

317
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR

318
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and synthesizing small strings of DNA.

319
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins,

320
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.

321
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.

322
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
This was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes

323
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
on self-reproducing machines,

324
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started

325
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to where they begin to reproduce.

326
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It took really three people:

327
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing;

328
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines --

329
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that now, last count, four million

330
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours;

331
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago --

332
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
this is John Markoff's obituary for him --

333
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
he was the important missing link,

334
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
the engineer who came in

335
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.

336
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And all our computers have, inside them,

337
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
the copies of the architecture that he had to just design

338
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
one day, sort of on pencil and paper.

339
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.

340
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And he explained, in a very generous way,

341
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
the spirit that brought all these different people to

342
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project,

343
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions,

344
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.

345
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
That's the last entry in the logbook

346
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
when the machine was shut down, July 1958.

347
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight

348
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
when the machine was officially turned off.

349
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And that's the end.

350
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Thank you very much.

351
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause)

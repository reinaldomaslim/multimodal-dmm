1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
if you've ever watched a James Bond movie --

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It was great.

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, I've got a little sheet of paper here,

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'll talk for like two hours.

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I just want to say good afternoon, good evening.

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's been an incredible few days.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.

15
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED

16
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that you just see flitting around the whole place

17
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.

18
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's really amazing.

19
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I've been in the audience.

20
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows

21
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit

22
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.

23
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Like, what have I got to say about all this?

25
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,

26
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I thought it was really great, and I was watching

27
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
those incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,

28
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?"

29
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."

30
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?"

31
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I guess there goes my green card.

32
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.

34
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And what's become increasingly clear to me is that

35
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we're talking about news stories about Africa;

36
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we're not really talking about African narratives.

37
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,

38
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insurance

39
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or have the most inadequate health insurance,

40
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and have a president who, despite the protest

41
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress --

42
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
continues to prosecute a senseless war.

43
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So if news is anything to go by,

44
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?

45
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Which it isn't really, is it?

46
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt

47
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity."

48
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

49
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The truth is, everything we know about America,

50
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
everything Americans come to know about being American,

51
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
isn't from the news.

52
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I live there.

53
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We don't go home at the end of the day and think,

54
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"Well, I really know who I am now

55
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange

56
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
closed at this many points."

57
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.

58
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.

59
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It comes from popular culture.

60
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In other words, it's the agents of our imagination

61
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,

62
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
because in Africa

63
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the complicated questions we want to ask about

64
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
what all of this means has been asked

65
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from the rock paintings of the San people,

66
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.

67
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
If you want to know about Africa, read our literature --

68
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,

69
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."

70
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
That's very important.

71
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart."

72
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
He says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,

73
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
they were thought to be business records.

74
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But what if they were poems and psalms?

75
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats

76
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
standing still in the morning light.

77
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.

78
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Giraffes are this desire in the dark."

79
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is important.

80
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's important because misreading is really the chance

81
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for complication and opportunity.

82
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The first Igbo Bible was translated from English

83
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,

84
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
who was a Yoruba.

85
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,

86
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":

87
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,"

88
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and one means "bicycle" or "iron."

89
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels"

90
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
was translated as --

91
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
[Igbo].

92
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried

93
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,

94
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they chose the Igbo version.

95
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I'm not going to give you the patois translation;

96
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm going to make it standard English.

97
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Basically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels."

98
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is good, because language complicates things.

99
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
You know, we often think that language mirrors

100
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the world in which we live, and I find that's not true.

101
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The language actually makes the world in which we live.

102
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Language is not -- I mean, things don't have

103
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.

104
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And language can't be understood in its abstraction.

105
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It can only be understood in the context of story,

106
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and everything, all of this is story.

107
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And it's important to remember that,

108
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because if we don't, then we become ahistorical.

109
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here.

110
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But these are not new to Africa.

111
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Nigeria got its independence in 1960.

112
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The first time the possibility for independence was discussed

113
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
was in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.

114
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,

115
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.

116
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So, you know, the thing is to remember that

117
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because otherwise, 10 years from now,

118
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we'll be back here trying to tell this story again.

119
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So, what it says to me then is that it's not really --

120
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the problem isn't really the stories that are being told

121
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or which stories are being told,

122
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the problem really is the terms of humanity

123
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that we're willing to bring to complicate every story,

124
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and that's really what it's all about.

125
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Let me tell you a Nigerian joke.

126
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Well, it's just a joke, anyway.

127
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.

128
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,

129
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
and he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,

130
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
my wife has been packing rice for lunch.

131
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself

132
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
off this building and kill myself."

133
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And Dick and Harry repeat this.

134
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,

135
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so he throws himself off and kills himself,

136
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and Tom, Dick and Harry follow.

137
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wife

138
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and Dick's wife are distraught.

139
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They wished they'd not packed rice.

140
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,

141
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."

142
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
This seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,

144
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,

145
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
with the Hausa being Harry.

146
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry

147
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.

148
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.

149
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
In fact, every time I read in Ireland,

150
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
people get me all mistaken and they say,

151
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."

152
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
But he was also in Oxford in the '50s,

153
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,

154
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
my father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drink

155
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you."

156
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It makes sense now when I think about it,

157
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because if you'd known my father,

158
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
you would've wanted to poison him too.

159
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

160
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So I was born in 1966, at the beginning

161
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.

162
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And I was growing up in school and the federal government

163
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
didn't want us taught about the history of the war,

164
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
because they thought it probably would make us

165
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
generate a new generation of rebels.

166
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,

167
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
who wanted to teach us about this.

168
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,

169
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,

170
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I learned the melancholic history of my people

171
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
through the melancholic history of another people.

172
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I mean, picture this -- really picture this.

173
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history

174
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to young Igbo children.

175
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Story is powerful.

176
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody.

177
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And it should come as no surprise

178
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis

179
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.

180
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It makes perfect sense.

181
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And they were to blow up strategic targets

182
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and take over the country, and they were foiled

183
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,

184
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and a Jewish Nazi hunter.

185
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And it happened over four continents.

186
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer

187
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.

188
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused

189
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.

190
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.

191
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I grew up very privileged, and it's important

192
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.

193
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
A lot of us are very privileged.

194
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.

195
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story

196
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.

197
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I was completely terrified, completely broken,

198
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and kept trying to find a new language,

199
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
a new way to make sense of all of this.

200
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Six months after that, with no explanation,

201
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they let me go.

202
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know

203
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.

204
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

205
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,

206
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and not just me -- millions of Nigerians

207
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
grew up with books and libraries.

208
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In fact, we were talking last night about how all

209
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins

210
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa

211
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
than any sex education programs ever had.

212
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
All of those are gone.

213
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We are squandering the most valuable resource

214
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we have on this continent: the valuable resource

215
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of the imagination.

216
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
In the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,

217
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,

218
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend --

219
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi --

220
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
played by Fraser James.

221
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,

222
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and he's crying.

223
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
He's sniveling.

224
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's a pitiful sight.

225
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And as we watch it, we are ashamed.

226
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And we want to say to Idris, "Chop him up.

227
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Shut him up."

228
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!

229
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Please stop!"

230
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Idris pauses, then he moves again,

231
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and Fraser says, "Please!

232
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Please stop!"

233
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;

234
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
it's the look in Fraser's eyes.

235
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's one that says, "Don't do this.

236
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And I'm not saying this to save myself,

237
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,

238
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because if you do this, you will be lost."

239
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
To be so afraid that you're standing in the face

240
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself

241
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and crying, but to say in that moment,

242
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
as Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her."

243
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
In that moment, Fraser says,

244
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
"I am lost already, but not you ... not you."

245
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
This is a redemption we can all aspire to.

246
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
African narratives in the West, they proliferate.

247
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I really don't care anymore.

248
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves --

249
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
how as a writer, I find that African writers

250
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.

251
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful

252
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
with narratives of wounds and self-loathing?

253
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And this is the difficulty that I face.

254
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric

255
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to a place of ethical questioning.

256
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I am asking us to balance the idea

257
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion

258
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
of transformation of what is possible.

259
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
As a young middle-class Nigerian activist,

260
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I launched myself along with a whole generation of us

261
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
into the campaign to stop the government.

262
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And I asked millions of people,

263
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
without questioning my right to do so,

264
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to go up against the government.

265
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.

266
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.

267
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Have I not myself been imprisoned?

268
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Have I not myself been beaten?"

269
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,

270
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that I understood the real meaning of torture,

271
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and how easy your humanity can be taken from you,

272
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
for the time I was engaged in war,

273
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
righteous, righteous war.

274
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Excuse me.

275
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Sometimes I can stand before the world --

276
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and when I say this, transformation

277
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
is a difficult and slow process --

278
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
sometimes I can stand before the world and say,

279
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
"My name is Chris Abani.

280
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I have been human six days, but only sometimes."

281
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
But this is a good thing.

282
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It's never going to be easy.

283
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
There are no answers.

284
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,

285
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that I had challenged my students in America --

286
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."

287
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani."

288
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.

289
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?

290
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
There are no essential Africans,

291
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else

292
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
about the continent we come from,

293
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and yet we want to make profound statements about it.

294
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying

295
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to approximate the truth of our own communities,

296
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
it will make for a much more nuanced

297
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and a much more interesting conversation.

298
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,

299
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that we can rise above all of this.

300
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
When I was 10, I read James Baldwin's "Another Country,"

301
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and that book broke me.

302
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love

303
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
for the first time, but because the way James wrote about it

304
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.

305
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
"Here," Jimmy said.

306
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
"Here is love, all of it."

307
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
The fact that it happens in "Another Country"

308
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
takes you quite by surprise.

309
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:

310
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
those who can count, and those who can't.

311
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Laughter)

312
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
He also says that the cause of all our trouble

313
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
is the belief in an essential, pure identity:

314
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
religious, ethnic, historical, ideological.

315
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa

316
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that speaks to transformation.

317
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it

318
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.

319
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,

320
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
for how easy it is to be nailed to a board

321
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
weathered raw as white butcher paper.

322
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.

323
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.

324
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Weeks ago, you broke me as a woman

325
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
once shattered me into a song beneath her weight,

326
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
before you slouched into that grassy hush.

327
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,

328
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
shaped like five bowstrings.

329
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.

330
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.

331
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Pressure can make everything whole again.

332
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood,

333
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
your face has been carved five times.

334
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
I have to drive trouble in the hills.

335
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Trouble in the valley,

336
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and trouble by the river too.

337
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.

338
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.

339
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Ka-doooom.

340
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Now I have beaten a song back into you.

341
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Rise and walk away like a panther."

342
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Thank you.

343
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
(Applause)

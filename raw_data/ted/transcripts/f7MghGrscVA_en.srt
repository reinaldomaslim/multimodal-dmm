Greg Gage: The octopus is a rather strange-looking animal

3
0:00:14.731,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that exhibits amazingly complex behaviors.

4
0:00:17.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
They have the most impressive nervous system in the entire invertebrate world.

5
0:00:21.36,000 --> 0:00:22,000
They have about a half a billion neurons

6
0:00:23.32,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that are distributed throughout their body,

7
0:00:25.36,000 --> 0:00:28,000
such that two-thirds of the neurons are actually in its legs.

8
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now mix this in with camouflaging cells, jet propulsion and a razor-sharp beak,

9
0:00:33.04,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and you have all the makings of a formidable predator.

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And then throw in the fact that the octopus is a solitary creature,

11
0:00:39.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and suddenly, we have ourselves a real cephalopod fight.

0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We know that almost all animals fight -- for food, for territory, for mates.

15
0:00:51.32,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The octopus is no different, and knowing their fighting behavior

16
0:00:54.4,000 --> 0:00:56,000
could help us better understand these fascinating creatures

17
0:00:57.2,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and how they interact.

18
0:00:58.44,000 --> 0:01:,000
My friend Ilya has been observing the classic fighting behavior

19
0:01:01.44,000 --> 0:01:03,000
between California two-spot octopuses.

20
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Ilya Chugunov: Most people think that it's "octopi,"

21
0:01:05.96,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but that's actually incorrect.

22
0:01:07.44,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The correct plurals are either "octopuses" or "octopodes"

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
if you want to be very Greek about it.

24
0:01:12.04,000 --> 0:01:13,000
GG: So how do you do your experiment?

25
0:01:13.88,000 --> 0:01:15,000
IC: First, I like to set up the chamber just so it's ready,

26
0:01:16.68,000 --> 0:01:18,000
so I get a jug of water, I aerate it by shaking the jug.

27
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It seems that if the water is well-aerated, they're a lot more active.

28
0:01:22.68,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This gives the octopuses some room to breathe.

29
0:01:24.88,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I get the first octopus --

30
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Here, buddy. Here, pal.

31
0:01:28.6,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Put it in, set up my GoPro,

32
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
put the second octopus in, cover it up and leave it alone.

33
0:01:34.28,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Bell ringing)

34
0:01:35.08,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Rule 1: There's always an aggressor.

35
0:01:36.84,000 --> 0:01:38,000
There's always one octopus on defense, one on offense.

36
0:01:39.44,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Usually the one that's taking up more space, that's more boastful,

37
0:01:42.8,000 --> 0:01:45,000
definitely the aggressor, most likely the winner of the fight.

38
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The loser's pretty obvious.

39
0:01:47.44,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They get pushed around, they curl up, hide in a corner.

40
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:53,000
A lot of the time, when there's initial contact,

41
0:01:53.96,000 --> 0:01:56,000
if one of them is too much on the defensive side,

42
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
the second one will sort of poke at it, grab at its tentacle and see,

43
0:02:00.76,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Hey, do you want to fight me, do you want to turn around?

44
0:02:03.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Do you want to start a wrestling match?"

45
0:02:05.48,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So it'll just poke and run away. Come back, poke and run away.

46
0:02:09.818,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Bell ringing)

47
0:02:10.58,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Rule 2: Avoid eye contact.

48
0:02:13.64,000 --> 0:02:16,000
When the octopuses come towards each other to begin the fight,

49
0:02:17.44,000 --> 0:02:19,000
they don't actually face each other.

50
0:02:19.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They approach sideways.

51
0:02:21.32,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The defensive octopus tries to face away from the attacker

52
0:02:26.92,000 --> 0:02:29,000
until it's the critical moment it knows there's no way to avoid a fight.

53
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:32,000
GG: Really, the one who's waiting to the last moment

54
0:02:33.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is the defensive octopus.

55
0:02:34.77,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Bell ringing)

56
0:02:35.51,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Rule 3: Flash your colors.

57
0:02:37.56,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The aggressor in a fight will quickly and sharply flash bright black on his arms

58
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
when he's about to initiate a fight.

59
0:02:48.2,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Bell ringing)

60
0:02:49.8,000 --> 0:02:5,000
GG: Ooh, and already --

61
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:52,000
IC: We're seeing some action.

62
0:02:53.64,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Looks like they've spotted each other.

63
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:59,000
GG: Right. So now he's going to come -- He's approaching, but not directly at him.

64
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
IC: Yeah, they're like almost completely antiparallel.

65
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:05,000
GG: And then right there --

66
0:03:06.48,000 --> 0:03:09,000
IC: Yeah. They contact, and then their arms clash together.

67
0:03:10.44,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(String music)

68
0:03:20.044,000 --> 0:03:23,000
GG: So we've taken the first steps in understanding fighting in the octopus.

69
0:03:23.64,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And you might be asking yourself: Why does this even matter?

70
0:03:26.52,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Well, these types of curiosity-based research questions can often lead

71
0:03:29.96,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to some unexpected insights and discoveries.

72
0:03:32.72,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We've learned a lot about ourselves from studying marine animals.

73
0:03:35.8,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Squid have taught us about how our neurons communicate,

74
0:03:38.68,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and the horseshoe crab has taught us about how our eyes work.

75
0:03:41.6,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So it's not too far of a stretch to say that some of these behaviors

76
0:03:44.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that we're seeing in the California two-spot octopus are similar to ours.

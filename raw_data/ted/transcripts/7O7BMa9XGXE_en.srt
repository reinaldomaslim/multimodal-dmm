1
0:00:12.826,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to talk to you about my kids.

2
0:00:15.743,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, I know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic,

3
0:00:20.415,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the most beautiful kid that ever lived.

4
0:00:23.352,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But mine really are.

5
0:00:24.625,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.956,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I have 696 kids,

7
0:00:28.354,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and they are the most intelligent, inventive, innovative,

8
0:00:32.83,000 --> 0:00:35,000
brilliant and powerful kids that you'll ever meet.

9
0:00:37.263,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Any student I've had the honor of teaching in my classroom is my kid.

10
0:00:42.702,000 --> 0:00:45,000
However, because their "real" parents aren't rich

11
0:00:46.545,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and, I argue, because they are mostly of color,

12
0:00:49.445,000 --> 0:00:51,000
they will seldom get to see in themselves

13
0:00:51.975,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the awesomeness that I see in them.

14
0:00:54.839,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Because what I see in them is myself --

15
0:00:57.896,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or what would have been myself.

16
0:01:01.645,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I am the daughter of two hardworking,

17
0:01:04.062,000 --> 0:01:06,000
college-educated, African-American parents

18
0:01:06.704,000 --> 0:01:08,000
who chose careers as public servants:

19
0:01:09.442,000 --> 0:01:12,000
my father, a minister; my mother, an educator.

20
0:01:13.078,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Wealth was never the primary ambition in our house.

21
0:01:16.981,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Because of this lack of wealth,

22
0:01:18.761,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we lived in a neighborhood that lacked wealth,

23
0:01:20.995,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and henceforth a school system that lacked wealth.

24
0:01:24.307,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Luckily, however, we struck the educational jackpot

25
0:01:28.171,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in a voluntary desegregation program

26
0:01:30.566,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that buses inner-city kids -- black and brown --

27
0:01:33.958,000 --> 0:01:35,000
out to suburban schools -- rich and white.

28
0:01:37.288,000 --> 0:01:4,000
At five years old, I had to take an hour-long bus ride

29
0:01:41.073,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to a faraway place

30
0:01:43.158,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to get a better education.

31
0:01:45.522,000 --> 0:01:49,000
At five years old, I thought everyone had a life just like mine.

32
0:01:50.621,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I thought everyone went to school

33
0:01:52.675,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and were the only ones using the brown crayons

34
0:01:55.058,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to color in their family portraits,

35
0:01:56.75,000 --> 0:01:59,000
while everyone else was using the peach-colored ones.

36
0:02:00.559,000 --> 0:02:03,000
At five years old, I thought everyone was just like me.

37
0:02:04.792,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But as I got older, I started noticing things, like:

38
0:02:08.948,000 --> 0:02:1,000
How come my neighborhood friend don't have to wake up

39
0:02:11.534,000 --> 0:02:12,000
at five o'clock in the morning,

40
0:02:13.096,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and go to a school that's an hour away?

41
0:02:16.278,000 --> 0:02:18,000
How come I'm learning to play the violin

42
0:02:18.552,000 --> 0:02:21,000
while my neighborhood friends don't even have a music class?

43
0:02:23.04,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Why were my neighborhood friends learning and reading material

44
0:02:26.608,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that I had done two to three years prior?

45
0:02:29.882,000 --> 0:02:31,000
See, as I got older,

46
0:02:32.762,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I started to have this unlawful feeling in my belly,

47
0:02:36.715,000 --> 0:02:39,000
like I was doing something that I wasn't supposed to be doing;

48
0:02:40.647,000 --> 0:02:42,000
taking something that wasn't mine;

49
0:02:43.819,000 --> 0:02:44,000
receiving a gift,

50
0:02:45.544,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but with someone else's name on it.

51
0:02:47.929,000 --> 0:02:5,000
All these amazing things that I was being exposed to

52
0:02:51.457,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and experiencing,

53
0:02:53.179,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.

54
0:02:57.189,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I wasn't supposed to have a library, fully equipped athletic facilities,

55
0:03:01.24,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or safe fields to play in.

56
0:03:04.208,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I wasn't supposed to have theatre departments

57
0:03:06.479,000 --> 0:03:08,000
with seasonal plays and concerts --

58
0:03:08.868,000 --> 0:03:1,000
digital, visual, performing arts.

59
0:03:11.603,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I wasn't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs,

60
0:03:16.283,000 --> 0:03:18,000
school buses that brought me door-to-door,

61
0:03:19.109,000 --> 0:03:21,000
freshly prepared school lunches

62
0:03:21.561,000 --> 0:03:22,000
or even air conditioning.

63
0:03:24.127,000 --> 0:03:25,000
These are things my kids don't get.

64
0:03:26.661,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You see, as I got older,

65
0:03:28.222,000 --> 0:03:31,000
while I was grateful for this amazing opportunity

66
0:03:31.263,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that I was being given,

67
0:03:32.933,000 --> 0:03:34,000
there was this ever-present pang of:

68
0:03:36.21,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But what about everyone else?

69
0:03:39.137,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There are thousands of other kids just like me,

70
0:03:42.531,000 --> 0:03:43,000
who deserve this, too.

71
0:03:44.291,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Why doesn't everyone get this?

72
0:03:46.453,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Why is a high-quality education only exclusive to the rich?

73
0:03:51.634,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It was like I had some sort of survivor's remorse.

74
0:03:55.222,000 --> 0:03:57,000
All of my neighborhood friends were experiencing

75
0:03:57.978,000 --> 0:03:58,000
an educational train wreck

76
0:03:59.827,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that I was saved from through a bus ride.

77
0:04:04.067,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was like an educational Moses screaming,

78
0:04:06.585,000 --> 0:04:07,000
"Let my people go ...

79
0:04:08.218,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to high-quality schools!"

80
0:04:10.079,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:11.52,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I'd seen firsthand how the other half was being treated and educated.

82
0:04:16.104,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I'd seen the educational promised land,

83
0:04:19.067,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I could not for the life of me justify the disparity.

84
0:04:25.55,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I now teach in the very same school system from which I sought refuge.

85
0:04:30.87,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student,

86
0:04:35.431,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and now as a teacher, I don't have access to those same tools

87
0:04:39.378,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to give my students.

88
0:04:41.451,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There have been countless nights when I've cried in frustration,

89
0:04:46.05,000 --> 0:04:47,000
anger

90
0:04:47.35,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and sorrow,

91
0:04:48.765,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because I can't teach my kids the way that I was taught,

92
0:04:52.581,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because I don't have access to the same resources or tools

93
0:04:56.796,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that were used to teach me.

94
0:04:59.393,000 --> 0:05:01,000
My kids deserve so much better.

95
0:05:02.27,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We sit and we keep banging our heads against this term:

96
0:05:05.157,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"Achievement gap, achievement gap!"

97
0:05:08.462,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Is it really that hard to understand

98
0:05:11.418,000 --> 0:05:14,000
why these kids perform well and these kids don't?

99
0:05:14.667,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I mean, really.

100
0:05:16.664,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I think we've got it all wrong.

101
0:05:18.955,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I think we,

102
0:05:20.14,000 --> 0:05:22,000
as Gloria Ladson-Billings says,

103
0:05:22.246,000 --> 0:05:26,000
should flip our paradigm and our language and call it what it really is.

104
0:05:27.516,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's not an achievement gap;

105
0:05:29.878,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it's an education debt,

106
0:05:32.417,000 --> 0:05:37,000
for all of the foregone schooling resources that were never invested

107
0:05:37.719,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in the education of the black and brown child over time.

108
0:05:42.82,000 --> 0:05:45,000
A little-known secret in American history

109
0:05:45.87,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is that the only American institution created specifically for people of color

110
0:05:51.714,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is the American slave trade --

111
0:05:53.866,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and some would argue the prison system,

112
0:05:55.839,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but that's another topic for another TED Talk.

113
0:05:58.089,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:59.654,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The public school system of this country was built, bought and paid for

115
0:06:03.971,000 --> 0:06:07,000
using commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor.

116
0:06:08.651,000 --> 0:06:11,000
While African-Americans were enslaved and prohibited from schooling,

117
0:06:12.638,000 --> 0:06:15,000
their labor established the very institution

118
0:06:15.821,000 --> 0:06:16,000
from which they were excluded.

119
0:06:18.042,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Ever since then, every court case, educational policy, reform,

120
0:06:23.145,000 --> 0:06:26,000
has been an attempt to retrofit the design,

121
0:06:26.423,000 --> 0:06:28,000
rather than just stopping and acknowledging:

122
0:06:29.107,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we've had it all wrong from the beginning.

123
0:06:33.243,000 --> 0:06:37,000
An oversimplification of American educational history.

124
0:06:37.31,000 --> 0:06:38,000
All right, just bear with me.

125
0:06:39.681,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Blacks were kept out -- you know, the whole slavery thing.

126
0:06:43.256,000 --> 0:06:45,000
With the help of philanthropic white people,

127
0:06:45.357,000 --> 0:06:46,000
they built their own schools.

128
0:06:46.935,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Separate but equal was OK.

129
0:06:49.729,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But while we all know things were indeed separate,

130
0:06:52.483,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they were in no ways equal.

131
0:06:54.571,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Enter Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954;

132
0:06:59.76,000 --> 0:07:02,000
legal separation of the races is now illegal.

133
0:07:03.9,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But very few people pay attention to all of the court cases since then,

134
0:07:10.153,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that have undone the educational promised land for every child

135
0:07:15.45,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that Brown v. Board intended.

136
0:07:18.438,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Some argue that today our schools are now more segregated

137
0:07:22.18,000 --> 0:07:26,000
than they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place.

138
0:07:27.963,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Teaching my kids about desegregation, the Little Rock Nine,

139
0:07:31.58,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the Civil Rights Movement,

140
0:07:32.907,000 --> 0:07:35,000
is a real awkward moment in my classroom,

141
0:07:36.261,000 --> 0:07:38,000
when I have to hear the voice of a child ask,

142
0:07:39.94,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"If schools were desegregated in 1954,

143
0:07:43.267,000 --> 0:07:45,000
how come there are no white kids here?"

144
0:07:45.588,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:47.072,000 --> 0:07:48,000
These kids aren't dumb.

146
0:07:49.292,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They know exactly what's happening,

147
0:07:51.542,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and what's not.

148
0:07:53.526,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They know that when it comes to schooling,

149
0:07:56.67,000 --> 0:07:57,000
black lives don't matter

150
0:07:59.081,000 --> 0:08:,000
and they never have.

151
0:08:02.316,000 --> 0:08:08,000
For years, I tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading.

152
0:08:09.416,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I'd amassed a modest classroom library

153
0:08:12.304,000 --> 0:08:15,000
of books I'd accumulated from secondhand shops,

154
0:08:15.625,000 --> 0:08:17,000
thrift stores, attics -- you know.

155
0:08:18.112,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But whenever I said those dreadful words,

156
0:08:20.596,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"Take out a book and read,"

157
0:08:22.816,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you'd think I'd just declared war.

158
0:08:25.273,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It was torture.

159
0:08:27.693,000 --> 0:08:28,000
One day,

160
0:08:29.184,000 --> 0:08:32,000
after I'd heard about this website called DonorsChoose,

161
0:08:32.338,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where classroom teachers create wish lists

162
0:08:34.678,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of items they need for their classroom

163
0:08:36.806,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and anonymous donors fulfill them,

164
0:08:39.357,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I figured I'd go out on a limb and just make a wish list

165
0:08:43.382,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of the teenager's dream library.

166
0:08:47.698,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Over 200 brand-new books were sent to my room piece by piece.

167
0:08:52.672,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Every day there were new deliveries and my kids would exclaim with glee,

168
0:08:57.269,000 --> 0:08:58,000
"This feels like Christmas!"

169
0:08:59.25,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:00.354,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Then they'd say,

171
0:09:01.543,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"Ms. Sumner, where did these books come from?"

172
0:09:04.439,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And then I'd reply,

173
0:09:05.679,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"Strangers from all over the country wanted you to have these."

174
0:09:10.274,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And then they'd say, almost suspiciously,

175
0:09:14.474,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"But they're brand-new."

176
0:09:16.225,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

177
0:09:17.251,000 --> 0:09:18,000
To which I'd reply,

178
0:09:18.854,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"You deserve brand-new books."

179
0:09:22.137,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls,

180
0:09:25.584,000 --> 0:09:28,000
as she peeled open a crisp paperback said,

181
0:09:29.582,000 --> 0:09:33,000
"Ms. Sumner -- you know, I figured you bought these books,

182
0:09:33.984,000 --> 0:09:35,000
'cause you teachers are always buying us stuff.

183
0:09:37.158,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But to know that a stranger, someone I don't even know,

184
0:09:41.211,000 --> 0:09:42,000
cares this much about me

185
0:09:43.48,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is pretty cool."

186
0:09:45.87,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Knowing that strangers will take care of you

187
0:09:48.519,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is a privilege my kids aren't afforded.

188
0:09:52.342,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Ever since the donation,

189
0:09:53.808,000 --> 0:09:56,000
there has been a steady stream of kids signing out books to take home,

190
0:09:57.69,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and then returning them with the exclamation,

191
0:10:00.374,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"This one was good!"

192
0:10:01.986,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

193
0:10:03.058,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now when I say, "Take out a book and read,"

194
0:10:05.384,000 --> 0:10:07,000
kids rush to my library.

195
0:10:08.849,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It wasn't that they didn't want to read,

196
0:10:10.92,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but instead, they'd gladly read if the resources were there.

197
0:10:17.579,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Institutionally speaking,

198
0:10:19.255,000 --> 0:10:23,000
our public school system has never done right by the black and brown child.

199
0:10:24.068,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We keep focusing on the end results

200
0:10:26.64,000 --> 0:10:27,000
or test results,

201
0:10:28.029,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and getting frustrated.

202
0:10:29.899,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We get to a catastrophe and we wonder,

203
0:10:32.06,000 --> 0:10:34,000
"How did it get so bad? How did we get here?"

204
0:10:35.89,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Really?

205
0:10:37.439,000 --> 0:10:39,000
If you neglect a child long enough,

206
0:10:39.538,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you no longer have the right to be surprised

207
0:10:42.652,000 --> 0:10:43,000
when things don't turn out well.

208
0:10:45.319,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Stop being perplexed

209
0:10:47.077,000 --> 0:10:48,000
or confused

210
0:10:48.727,000 --> 0:10:49,000
or befuddled

211
0:10:50.68,000 --> 0:10:51,000
by the achievement gap,

212
0:10:52.63,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the income gap,

213
0:10:53.877,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the incarceration rates,

214
0:10:55.52,000 --> 0:11:,000
or whatever socioeconomic disparity is the new "it" term for the moment.

215
0:11:01.248,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The problems we have as a country

216
0:11:03.714,000 --> 0:11:05,000
are the problems we created as a country.

217
0:11:06.74,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The quality of your education is directly proportionate

218
0:11:10.302,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to your access to college,

219
0:11:12.184,000 --> 0:11:13,000
your access to jobs,

220
0:11:13.936,000 --> 0:11:14,000
your access to the future.

221
0:11:17.594,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Until we live in a world where every kid can get a high-quality education

222
0:11:22.888,000 --> 0:11:23,000
no matter where they live,

223
0:11:24.448,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or the color of their skin,

224
0:11:26.352,000 --> 0:11:3,000
there are things we can do on a macro level.

225
0:11:31.389,000 --> 0:11:34,000
School funding should not be decided by property taxes

226
0:11:34.977,000 --> 0:11:36,000
or some funky economic equation

227
0:11:37.232,000 --> 0:11:4,000
where rich kids continue to benefit from state aid,

228
0:11:40.292,000 --> 0:11:44,000
while poor kids are continuously having food and resources

229
0:11:44.401,000 --> 0:11:45,000
taken from their mouths.

230
0:11:46.75,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Governors, senators, mayors, city council members --

231
0:11:50.535,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if we're going to call public education public education,

232
0:11:53.423,000 --> 0:11:54,000
then it should be just that.

233
0:11:55.555,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Otherwise, we should call it what it really is:

234
0:11:58.562,000 --> 0:11:59,000
poverty insurance.

235
0:12:01.211,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"Public education:

236
0:12:02.677,000 --> 0:12:05,000
keeping poor kids poor since 1954."

237
0:12:05.789,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Laughter)

238
0:12:08.733,000 --> 0:12:13,000
If we really, as a country, believe that education is the "great equalizer,"

239
0:12:13.855,000 --> 0:12:16,000
then it should be just that: equal and equitable.

240
0:12:18.158,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Until then, there's no democracy in our democratic education.

241
0:12:23.493,000 --> 0:12:24,000
On a mezzo level:

242
0:12:25.64,000 --> 0:12:28,000
historically speaking, the education of the black and brown child

243
0:12:28.866,000 --> 0:12:31,000
has always depended on the philanthropy of others.

244
0:12:32.361,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And unfortunately, today it still does.

245
0:12:35.77,000 --> 0:12:39,000
If your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor

246
0:12:40.159,000 --> 0:12:41,000
or little Timmy down the street

247
0:12:42.253,000 --> 0:12:44,000
goes to an affluent school,

248
0:12:44.58,000 --> 0:12:47,000
challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school

249
0:12:47.778,000 --> 0:12:49,000
or an impoverished classroom.

250
0:12:49.841,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Close the divide by engaging in communication

251
0:12:53.262,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and relationships that matter.

252
0:12:56.05,000 --> 0:12:57,000
When resources are shared,

253
0:12:58.028,000 --> 0:12:59,000
they're not divided;

254
0:12:59.744,000 --> 0:13:,000
they're multiplied.

255
0:13:01.871,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And on a micro level:

256
0:13:03.734,000 --> 0:13:04,000
if you're a human being,

257
0:13:05.985,000 --> 0:13:06,000
donate.

258
0:13:07.524,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Time, money, resources, opportunities --

259
0:13:11.611,000 --> 0:13:13,000
whatever is in your heart.

260
0:13:14.847,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There are websites like DonorsChoose

261
0:13:17.075,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that recognize the disparity

262
0:13:19.153,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and actually want to do something about it.

263
0:13:23.748,000 --> 0:13:25,000
What is a carpenter with no tools?

264
0:13:26.35,000 --> 0:13:28,000
What is an actress with no stage?

265
0:13:28.99,000 --> 0:13:3,000
What is a scientist with no laboratory?

266
0:13:31.859,000 --> 0:13:33,000
What is a doctor with no equipment?

267
0:13:35.27,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I'll tell you:

268
0:13:36.97,000 --> 0:13:37,000
they're my kids.

269
0:13:39.219,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Shouldn't they be your kids, too?

270
0:13:41.893,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Thank you.

271
0:13:43.068,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The substance of things unseen.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Cities, past and future.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and look in the looking glass that is New York City

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to try and see our true selves,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or perhaps pass through to another world.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"As the moon rose higher,

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the inessential houses began to melt away

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
until gradually I became aware of the old island

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes,

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a fresh green breast of the new world."

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to rediscover this lost world

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in a project we call The Mannahatta Project.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
when he sailed into New York harbor.

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts,

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and if I have time still, an epilogue.

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So, Act I: A Map Found.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So, I didn't grow up in New York.

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the Red Rock Canyon.

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And from these early experiences as a child

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I learned to love landscapes.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies,

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology.

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Landscape ecology concerns itself

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
make habitats for plants and animals.

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This experience and this training

33
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society,

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And over the last decade,

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I traveled to over 40 countries

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to see jaguars and bears and elephants

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and tigers and rhinos.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists,

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to the top of the Empire State Building,

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems,

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
work to make habitat for plants and animals?

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall,

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them.

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
come up against the abrupt and sheer

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
topography of midtown Manhattan.

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City.

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I read that New York City was the first mega-city,

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950.

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I started seeing paintings like this.

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
For those of you who are from New York,

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
this is 125th street under the West Side Highway.

57
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It was once a beach. And this painting

59
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village.

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University --

64
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill,

66
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree.

67
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What's that palm tree doing there?

68
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And it's this map you see here.

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's held in a geographic information system

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which allows me to zoom in.

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution,

74
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
170 years later, made by British military cartographers

75
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
during the occupation of New York City.

76
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.

77
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan

79
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you can see the extent of New York City as it was,

80
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
right at the end of the American Revolution.

81
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.

82
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And this is City Hall Park.

83
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So the city basically extended to City Hall Park.

84
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And just beyond it you can see features

85
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that have vanished, things that have disappeared.

86
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City

87
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for its first 200 years,

88
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that.

89
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You can see the Lispenard Meadows

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now,

91
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and the beaches that come up from the Battery,

92
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
all the way to 42nd St.

93
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
This map was made for military reasons.

94
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications

95
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that they built.

96
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But they're also mapping things of ecological interest,

97
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
also military interest: the hills,

98
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the marshes, the streams.

99
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water,

100
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which used to run its way through Greenwich Village.

101
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Here is Times Square,

105
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
the two streams that came together to make a wetland

106
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.

107
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.

108
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map,

109
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
if I could place this map in the grid of the city today,

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I could find these lost features

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the city,

112
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in the block-by-block geography that people know,

113
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live,

114
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and where they like to eat."

115
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, after some work we were able to georeference it,

116
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which allows us to put the modern streets on the city,

117
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and the buildings, and the open spaces,

118
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.

119
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams,

120
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today.

121
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So this is fun for finding where things are

122
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
relative to the old topography.

123
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But I had another idea about this map.

124
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings,

125
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and if we take away the open spaces,

126
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
then we could take this map.

127
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
If we pull off the 18th century features

128
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we could drive it back in time.

129
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals:

130
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to the hills, to the streams,

131
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches,

132
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.

133
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Then, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology,

134
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave,

135
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
if we make the soil map,

136
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
with the 17 soil classes,

137
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that are defined by the National Conservation Service,

138
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
if we make a digital elevation model

139
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of the topography that tells us how high the hills were,

140
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
then we can calculate the slopes.

141
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We can calculate the aspect.

142
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We can calculate the winter wind exposure --

143
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape.

144
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.

145
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.

146
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And we built a probability map of where they might have been.

147
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So, the red areas on this map indicate the places

148
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan,

149
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
places that are close to water,

150
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
places that are near the harbor to fish,

151
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
places protected from the winter winds.

152
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We know that there was a Lenape settlement

153
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
down here by the Collect Pond.

154
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture,

155
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash,

156
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the "Three Sisters" garden.

157
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been.

158
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And the old fields, the successional fields that go.

159
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And we might think of these as abandoned.

160
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But, in fact, they're grassland habitats

161
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
for grassland birds and plants.

162
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And they have become successional shrub lands,

163
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.

164
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.

165
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
You can think of these as neighborhoods,

166
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood --

167
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that these are the forest and the wetlands

168
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and the marine communities, the beaches.

169
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,

170
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Manhattan had more ecological communities

171
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
per acre than Yosemite does,

172
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.

173
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It was really an extraordinary landscape

174
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.

175
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.

176
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees,

177
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan,

178
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore,

179
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the beavers on all the streams, the black bears,

180
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the Native Americans, to study how they used

181
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and thought about their landscape.

182
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did

183
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
was we mapped their habitat needs.

184
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Where do they get their food?

185
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Where do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter?

186
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Where do they get their reproductive resources?

187
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat,

188
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but to most people, the intersection of these is their home.

189
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides

190
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
that maybe you have on your shelves,

191
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you know, what beavers need is, "A slowly meandering stream

192
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with aspen trees and alders and willows,

193
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
near the water." That's the best thing for a beaver.

194
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So we just started making a list.

195
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Here is the beaver. And here is the stream,

196
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and the aspen and the alder and the willow.

197
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
As if these were the maps that we would need

198
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to predict where you would find the beaver.

199
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.

200
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites.

201
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be

202
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
something that a bobcat needs.

203
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But a beaver also needs things. And that having it

204
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
on either side means that we can link it together,

205
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that we can create the network

206
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of the habitat relationships for these species.

207
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Moreover, we realized that you can start out

208
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
as being a beaver specialist,

209
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but you can look up what an aspen needs.

210
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.

211
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And you can look at what a wet meadow needs.

212
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And it need beavers to create the wetlands,

213
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and maybe some other things.

214
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But you can also talk about sunny places.

215
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se.

216
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But what are the conditions that make it possible?

217
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Or fire. Or dry soils.

218
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long

219
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.

220
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And then we can visualize this data like a network,

221
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
like a social network.

222
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And this is the network of all the habitat relationships

223
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
of all the plants and animals on Manhattan,

224
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and everything they needed,

225
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
going back to the geology,

226
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
going back to time and space at the very core of the web.

227
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.

228
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Each point is a different species

229
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
or a different stream or a different soil type.

230
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.

231
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They are the connections that actually make nature resilient.

232
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And the structure of this is what makes nature work,

233
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
seen with all its parts.

234
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist

235
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
John Muir, who said, "When we try to pick out anything by itself,

236
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords

237
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."

238
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps.

239
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,

240
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and Lex and Third,

241
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
maybe there was a stream in that block.

242
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there,

243
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses,

244
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the butterflies, the fish in the stream,

245
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the birds in the trees.

246
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.

247
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there.

248
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And then we took this data.

249
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
You can see this for yourself on our website.

250
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan,

251
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and see what might have been there 400 years ago.

252
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape

253
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
here in Act III.

254
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We used the tools they use in Hollywood

255
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.

256
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.

257
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.

258
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape.

259
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities.

260
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And feed into that the map of the species.

261
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So that we would actually take a photograph,

262
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River,

263
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
waiting for Hudson to come.

264
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Using this technology, we can make these

265
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
fantastic georeferenced views.

266
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We can basically take a picture out of any window

267
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.

268
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill

269
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
at where the United Nations is today.

270
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
This is the view looking down the Hudson River,

271
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right,

272
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.

273
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This is the view over Times Square,

274
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east.

275
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind.

276
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made.

277
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And we can see this in the geography of the city today.

278
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So when you're watching "Law and Order," and the lawyers walk up the steps

279
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
they could have walked back down those steps

280
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond,

281
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
400 years ago.

282
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So these images are the work of my friend and colleague,

283
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today.

284
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand,

285
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to call out for his fine work.

286
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Applause)

287
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
There is such power in bringing science and visualization together,

288
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that we can create images like this,

289
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.

290
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And even though I've only had a brief time to speak,

291
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.

292
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
The place that you see here on the left side

293
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.

294
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.

295
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place

296
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
on the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city

297
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and its kind of diversity, and its resilience,

298
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and its dependence on density and how we're connected together.

299
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other,

300
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
much as Lewis Carroll did in "Through the Looking Glass."

301
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time,

302
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that they really are the same place,

303
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that there is no way that cities can escape from nature.

304
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.

305
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past,

306
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but about 400 years from now,

307
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
what we're realizing is that

308
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
cities are habitats for people,

309
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and need to supply what people need:

310
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
a sense of home, food, water, shelter,

311
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning.

312
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.

313
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning,

314
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
about bringing meaning to our lives

315
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
in all kinds of different ways, through technology,

316
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
through art, through science,

317
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
so much so that I think we focus so much on

318
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough

319
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
attention to the food and the water and the shelter,

320
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and what we need to raise the kids.

321
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So, how can we envision the city of the future?

322
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park,

323
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and we imagine it without all the cars,

324
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and bicycles instead

325
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains?

326
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
What if we imagined the Upper East Side

327
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
with green roofs, and streams winding through the city,

328
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and windmills supplying the power we need?

329
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area,

330
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
currently home to 12 million people,

331
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan,

332
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
in only 36 percent of the area,

333
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
with the areas in between covered by farmland,

334
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
covered by wetlands,

335
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
covered by the marshes we need.

336
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
This is the kind of future I think we need,

337
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
is a future that has the same diversity

338
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,

339
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but that learns from the sustainability of the past,

340
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts.

341
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thank you very much.

342
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000

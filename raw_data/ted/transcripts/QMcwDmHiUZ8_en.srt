1
0:00:13.785,000 --> 0:00:16,000
These two Kenyan ladies were best friends

2
0:00:17.583,000 --> 0:00:18,000
from neighboring villages,

3
0:00:19.511,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but they'd stopped seeing each other, literally, for 10 years,

4
0:00:23.308,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because both had gone blind from a curable condition called cataracts.

5
0:00:27.778,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They hadn't been aware they'd been sat together for over an hour

6
0:00:30.881,000 --> 0:00:32,000
when we offered them surgery at the nearest hospital.

7
0:00:33.636,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Mama Jane, on the right, told me

8
0:00:35.806,000 --> 0:00:38,000
her biggest fear was that she would poison her grandson,

9
0:00:39.067,000 --> 0:00:4,000
whom she'd never seen,

10
0:00:40.889,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because she couldn't see what she was cooking for him.

11
0:00:43.767,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Her arms were covered in burns from cooking on a charcoal stove,

12
0:00:47.606,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and she despaired that she was robbing her six-year-old grandson of his childhood

13
0:00:51.734,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because he was effectively her eyes.

14
0:00:55.24,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The effect of her blindness was going through the generations.

15
0:00:59.082,000 --> 0:01:02,000
He wasn't able to go to school or break the cycle of poverty.

16
0:01:03.262,000 --> 0:01:06,000
All of this, despite cost-effective solutions existing.

17
0:01:06.902,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Cataract surgery can be done in under 10 minutes

18
0:01:09.765,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for just a hundred dollars.

19
0:01:11.582,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Four in every five people who are blind don't need to be;

20
0:01:15.088,000 --> 0:01:18,000
curative or preventive treatments already exist.

21
0:01:19.108,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Fortunately for Mama Jane and her friend,

22
0:01:21.585,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a donor had provided treatment

23
0:01:23.436,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so that we could take them to the nearest hospital

24
0:01:25.794,000 --> 0:01:26,000
three hours away.

25
0:01:27.362,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But in that very same clinic,

26
0:01:29.2,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I met Theresa,

27
0:01:30.899,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a shy young woman who couldn't look me in the eyes,

28
0:01:34.01,000 --> 0:01:35,000
not because she couldn't see,

29
0:01:35.915,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but the appearance of the growth on her eyes called pterygium

30
0:01:39.093,000 --> 0:01:4,000
meant she'd lost her confidence,

31
0:01:40.892,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and with it, her place in her community.

32
0:01:43.282,000 --> 0:01:45,000
She had no prospects for marriage or children

33
0:01:45.862,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and had been completely ostracized.

34
0:01:48.381,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I knew how to treat her condition; it was pretty straightforward.

35
0:01:51.547,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But we had strict instructions that the funds we had

36
0:01:54.316,000 --> 0:01:55,000
were for people with cataracts.

37
0:01:56.945,000 --> 0:01:57,000
What was I supposed to do?

38
0:01:58.865,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Ignore her?

39
0:02:01.071,000 --> 0:02:04,000
My wife and I managed to raise the funds to cover her treatment,

40
0:02:04.22,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but situations like Theresa were common every day,

41
0:02:07.076,000 --> 0:02:09,000
where people had the wrong diseases.

42
0:02:10.068,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And by the "wrong diseases,"

43
0:02:11.687,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I mean conditions for which funding hadn't been earmarked.

44
0:02:17.055,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Earmarking may seem like smart business or smart philanthropy on paper,

45
0:02:21.473,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but it doesn't make any sense when you're looking the person in the eye.

46
0:02:24.979,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Yet, this is how we deliver health care to millions of people the world over.

47
0:02:31.513,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I've been thinking about this problem for a very long time.

48
0:02:35.466,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Things happened to me at the age of 12 that completely transformed my life.

49
0:02:39.839,000 --> 0:02:42,000
My teachers insisted that I would go for an eye test.

50
0:02:43.28,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I resisted it for as many years as I could

51
0:02:45.363,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because as the only brown boy in the school,

52
0:02:47.599,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I already felt like a chocolate chip in rice pudding,

53
0:02:50.448,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and the idea of looking more different was not particularly appealing.

54
0:02:54.447,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You see, I'd associated an eye test with wearing glasses

55
0:02:57.134,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and looking different,

56
0:02:58.531,000 --> 0:02:59,000
not with seeing differently.

57
0:03:00.708,000 --> 0:03:02,000
When eventually I was persuaded to go,

58
0:03:02.87,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the optometrist fitted me with the trial lenses

59
0:03:05.242,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and was shocked at just how poor my sight was.

60
0:03:08.014,000 --> 0:03:1,000
He sent me outside to report what I could see.

61
0:03:10.666,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I remember looking up and seeing trees had leaves on them.

62
0:03:15.498,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I had never known this.

63
0:03:18.068,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Later that week, for the first time, I saw stars in the night sky.

64
0:03:22.122,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It was breathtaking.

65
0:03:24.163,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In fact, the entire trajectory of my life changed.

66
0:03:27.524,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I went from a failing child at school who was constantly told I was lazy

67
0:03:31.113,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and not paying attention

68
0:03:32.352,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to suddenly being a child with opportunity and potential.

69
0:03:36.34,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But I soon realized that this opportunity was not universal.

70
0:03:39.722,000 --> 0:03:4,000
That same summer, in Egypt,

71
0:03:41.639,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the home where my parents are originally from,

72
0:03:43.971,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I was with children that looked a lot more like me

73
0:03:46.758,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but couldn't have been more different.

74
0:03:48.974,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What separated us was opportunity.

75
0:03:51.74,000 --> 0:03:54,000
How is it that I had this life and they had theirs?

76
0:03:54.962,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It still makes no sense to me.

77
0:03:57.306,000 --> 0:03:58,000
How is it we've --

78
0:03:58.489,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in a world where glasses, that completely changed my life

79
0:04:02.224,000 --> 0:04:04,000
have been around for 700 years,

80
0:04:04.557,000 --> 0:04:07,000
yet two and a half billion people still can't access them.

81
0:04:08.503,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This deep sense of injustice drove me to become a doctor,

82
0:04:12.199,000 --> 0:04:13,000
eventually an eye surgeon,

83
0:04:13.9,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and in 2012, my wife and I packed our bags and moved to Kenya

84
0:04:18.455,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to try and give something back.

85
0:04:20.797,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We started by setting up a hundred eye clinics

86
0:04:23.106,000 --> 0:04:24,000
across the Great Rift Valley,

87
0:04:24.577,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where we met people like Mama Jane and Theresa.

88
0:04:27.855,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We founded a new organization called Peek Vision,

89
0:04:30.377,000 --> 0:04:33,000
a social enterprise where we built smartphone technology

90
0:04:34.029,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that makes it possible for people in the community

91
0:04:36.65,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to find people in their homes,

92
0:04:38.401,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the most vulnerable groups who are being missed,

93
0:04:41.12,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and created new tools that made it easier to diagnose them

94
0:04:43.989,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and connect them to services.

95
0:04:45.862,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Inspired by the challenges I'd had as a child,

96
0:04:48.182,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we equipped teachers, 25 of them, with smartphones

97
0:04:51.098,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to screen children in schools.

98
0:04:52.989,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Our first program resulted in 21,000 children

99
0:04:55.411,000 --> 0:04:57,000
being screened in just nine days.

100
0:04:58.149,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That same program was replicated to reach 200,000 children,

101
0:05:01.593,000 --> 0:05:02,000
covering the entire district.

102
0:05:03.462,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Soon we were able to repeat this in six new programs

103
0:05:06.055,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in different countries.

104
0:05:08.106,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But now, I was faced with the very same problems I had with Theresa

105
0:05:12.048,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of earmarked funds,

106
0:05:13.86,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but now as an organization.

107
0:05:16.374,000 --> 0:05:19,000
People wanted to fund specific projects

108
0:05:19.794,000 --> 0:05:2,000
or particular diseases

109
0:05:21.573,000 --> 0:05:22,000
or subsets of the population.

110
0:05:24.178,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But it didn't make sense,

111
0:05:25.797,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because what we needed to do was build an incredible team

112
0:05:28.501,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who could create the systems that would change the lives

113
0:05:31.238,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of millions of people, whatever their needs were.

114
0:05:34.385,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But it didn't work that way.

115
0:05:38.166,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Soon, we were able to align ourselves with partners who understood,

116
0:05:43.213,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because I understand the challenge.

117
0:05:45.294,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Ultimately, you need to trust where your money's going,

118
0:05:48.593,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and that trust usually manifests through the requirement

119
0:05:51.237,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to create detailed plans -- lots of paperwork.

120
0:05:53.712,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But what happens if the dynamic needs of people

121
0:05:56.076,000 --> 0:05:58,000
don't fit with the plan that you created,

122
0:05:58.142,000 --> 0:06:,000
and your funding is dependent on delivering the plan?

123
0:06:01.095,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You end up with a choice:

124
0:06:03.079,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Do you serve the plan, the funder,

125
0:06:05.587,000 --> 0:06:06,000
or do you serve the need?

126
0:06:07.482,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is not a choice we should have to make,

127
0:06:09.933,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because ultimately, we can only serve one master.

128
0:06:14.633,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The measure of our humanity

129
0:06:16.764,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is how we serve the most vulnerable amongst us.

130
0:06:20.033,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Currently, the system is not working, and too many people are being left behind.

131
0:06:25.245,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We've been fortunate to find incredible supporters and partners,

132
0:06:28.742,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which led to a new program in Botswana,

133
0:06:31.536,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in which every single schoolchild is being screened and treated

134
0:06:34.902,000 --> 0:06:36,000
by the end of 2021,

135
0:06:37.28,000 --> 0:06:39,000
meaning an entire generation of children

136
0:06:39.368,000 --> 0:06:41,000
will have the opportunity that good vision affords.

137
0:06:42.423,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But this took years of work.

138
0:06:44.526,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It took multiple feasibility studies,

139
0:06:46.644,000 --> 0:06:48,000
engaging different partners and stakeholders,

140
0:06:49.262,000 --> 0:06:51,000
business cases, economic analyses,

141
0:06:51.548,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to persuade the government to eventually come on board.

142
0:06:54.365,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But they're now leading and funding this in their own national budget.

143
0:06:58.305,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But we did not have the resources to do this.

144
0:07:01.937,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Our visionary funders and partners came alongside us,

145
0:07:05.341,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and the key ingredients were we were aligned on mission,

146
0:07:08.69,000 --> 0:07:09,000
on the why we were doing it.

147
0:07:11.071,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We agreed on the outcome, what had to be done.

148
0:07:14.895,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But critically, they were flexible and gave us autonomy

149
0:07:18.956,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to work out how we got there,

150
0:07:21.228,000 --> 0:07:24,000
giving us the space to be creative, ambitious and take risk.

151
0:07:25.795,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What if all health care looked like this?

152
0:07:28.183,000 --> 0:07:32,000
What would it mean for all the social causes we're trying to solve?

153
0:07:33.171,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Business knows this.

154
0:07:34.862,000 --> 0:07:36,000
By taking a long-term, ambitious view

155
0:07:37.465,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and giving people the autonomy to be creative

156
0:07:39.768,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to solve our world's biggest challenges,

157
0:07:41.8,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we've disrupted entire industries.

158
0:07:43.896,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Look at Amazon, Google.

159
0:07:46.071,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Surely, we need the same level of ambition

160
0:07:48.226,000 --> 0:07:5,000
if we're going to serve the most vulnerable in our societies.

161
0:07:51.574,000 --> 0:07:53,000
As a planet, we've set a target,

162
0:07:53.942,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the Sustainable Development Goals,

163
0:07:56.362,000 --> 0:08:,000
yet we're spending less than half the amount on tackling the global goals

164
0:08:00.517,000 --> 0:08:01,000
than we are on conflict resolution,

165
0:08:02.476,000 --> 0:08:05,000
which mostly arises from the very inequalities we're not serving.

166
0:08:07.14,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's time for change.

167
0:08:09.015,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's not just common sense as well -- it makes business sense.

168
0:08:12.771,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Our work in Botswana showed

169
0:08:14.556,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for a modest investment, the economy would gain 1.3 billion dollars

170
0:08:18.5,000 --> 0:08:19,000
over the lifetime of the children.

171
0:08:20.388,000 --> 0:08:22,000
That was 150 times return on investment.

172
0:08:23.681,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But part of the problem is that value is generated in the future,

173
0:08:27.254,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but we need the money now to deliver it.

174
0:08:30.424,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Turns out, this is not a new problem.

175
0:08:32.8,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Banks have been solving it for centuries.

176
0:08:35.056,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Simply put, it's called financing.

177
0:08:38.192,000 --> 0:08:39,000
If you want to buy a house

178
0:08:39.552,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but you can't afford to pay for it up front,

179
0:08:41.942,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the bank financiers, you see, can realize that future value now.

180
0:08:45.337,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In other words, you can live in the house straightaway.

181
0:08:48.369,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But what if you couldn't?

182
0:08:49.648,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What if you had to wait until you'd raised all of the money to move into the house,

183
0:08:53.774,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and you were kept homeless whilst trying to save the money

184
0:08:56.588,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to get there in the first place?

185
0:08:58.159,000 --> 0:09:,000
You'd end up in an impossible cycle, never able to get there,

186
0:09:01.11,000 --> 0:09:03,000
yet that's this very same bind we've put on ourselves.

187
0:09:04.694,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Inspired by the change in Botswana

188
0:09:06.691,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and by the visionary support of our funders and partners,

189
0:09:09.669,000 --> 0:09:11,000
we've come together -- two world-leading banks,

190
0:09:12.565,000 --> 0:09:15,000
for-profit and private, not-for-profit organizations,

191
0:09:15.956,000 --> 0:09:16,000
foundations and philanthropists --

192
0:09:17.854,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to launch the Vision Catalyst Fund,

193
0:09:20.297,000 --> 0:09:22,000
a fund which will have trust built in by design.

194
0:09:23.693,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It will make funding available now

195
0:09:26.264,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to the organizations that can serve the need of the most vulnerable.

196
0:09:30.151,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It will ensure that those organizations can work together in partnership,

197
0:09:34.09,000 --> 0:09:36,000
rather than competing for limited funds,

198
0:09:36.55,000 --> 0:09:38,000
serving the priority needs of an entire population,

199
0:09:39.377,000 --> 0:09:4,000
whatever they are,

200
0:09:40.933,000 --> 0:09:42,000
so that ultimately the individuals affected

201
0:09:43.476,000 --> 0:09:45,000
can receive the care that they deserve.

202
0:09:46.176,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And as we've shown,

203
0:09:47.902,000 --> 0:09:49,000
it doesn't make just a health and social difference,

204
0:09:50.665,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it creates huge economic benefit.

205
0:09:53.07,000 --> 0:09:55,000
This benefit in itself will create sustainability

206
0:09:55.959,000 --> 0:10:,000
to perpetuate a virtuous, catalytic cycle of improvement and change.

207
0:10:01.749,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Because when we do this,

208
0:10:03.643,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the individual needs of people like myself can be met.

209
0:10:07.979,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And this coalition has come together this year

210
0:10:12.162,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to make a commitment with 53 heads of government,

211
0:10:14.974,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who have now committed to take action

212
0:10:17.04,000 --> 0:10:19,000
towards achieving access to quality eye care for all.

213
0:10:20.417,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We've had incredible commitments

214
0:10:22.21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
of 200 million pairs of glasses to the fund

215
0:10:25.031,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and millions of dollars,

216
0:10:27.807,000 --> 0:10:3,000
so that the dynamic and individual needs of people --

217
0:10:30.976,000 --> 0:10:32,000
like my own issues that I had as child,

218
0:10:33.551,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and like Theresa, who just required simple surgery --

219
0:10:36.557,000 --> 0:10:37,000
can be met.

220
0:10:38.475,000 --> 0:10:42,000
For Theresa, it meant her place back in society,

221
0:10:42.501,000 --> 0:10:44,000
now with her own family and children.

222
0:10:45.506,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And for Mama Jane, it wasn't just restoring her sight,

223
0:10:50.181,000 --> 0:10:53,000
it meant the opportunity to restore hope,

224
0:10:53.209,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to restore joy

225
0:10:55.002,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and to restore dignity.

226
0:10:57.457,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Music)

227
0:11:09.23,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Thank you.

228
0:11:10.453,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Applause)

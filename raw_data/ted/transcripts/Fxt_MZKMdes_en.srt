1
0:00:13.008,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am failing as a woman,

2
0:00:14.832,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I am failing as a feminist.

3
0:00:17.452,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I have passionate opinions about gender equality,

4
0:00:20.229,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I worry that to freely accept the label of "feminist,"

5
0:00:24.314,000 --> 0:00:26,000
would not be fair to good feminists.

6
0:00:27.184,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.

7
0:00:29.581,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.

8
0:00:32.469,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Or at least, I wrote an essay,

9
0:00:34.826,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and then I wrote a book called "Bad Feminist,"

10
0:00:37.025,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and then in interviews, people started calling me The Bad Feminist.

11
0:00:40.485,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:41.675,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So, what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself

13
0:00:45.736,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and a willful provocation,

14
0:00:47.441,000 --> 0:00:48,000
has become a thing.

15
0:00:49.996,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Let me take a step back.

16
0:00:52.076,000 --> 0:00:53,000
When I was younger,

17
0:00:53.336,000 --> 0:00:54,000
mostly in my teens and 20s,

18
0:00:55.273,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I had strange ideas about feminists

19
0:00:57.702,000 --> 0:01:,000
as hairy, angry, man-hating, sex-hating women --

20
0:01:01.502,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as if those are bad things.

21
0:01:03.105,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:06.978,000 --> 0:01:09,000
These days, I look at how women are treated the world over,

23
0:01:10.44,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.

24
0:01:14.75,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But back then,

25
0:01:16.519,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I worried about the tone people used

26
0:01:18.322,000 --> 0:01:21,000
when suggesting I might be a feminist.

27
0:01:21.322,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The feminist label was an accusation,

28
0:01:23.904,000 --> 0:01:25,000
it was an "F" word, and not a nice one.

29
0:01:26.762,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules,

30
0:01:29.682,000 --> 0:01:3,000
who expects too much,

31
0:01:31.327,000 --> 0:01:32,000
who thinks far too highly of myself,

32
0:01:33.344,000 --> 0:01:37,000
by daring to believe I'm equal -- (Coughs) -- superior to a man.

33
0:01:38.04,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You don't want to be that rebel woman,

34
0:01:39.909,000 --> 0:01:41,000
until you realize that you very much are that woman,

35
0:01:42.418,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and cannot imagine being anyone else.

36
0:01:45.344,000 --> 0:01:47,000
As I got older, I began to accept

37
0:01:47.388,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that I am, indeed, a feminist, and a proud one.

38
0:01:50.745,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I hold certain truths to be self-evident:

39
0:01:53.563,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Women are equal to men.

40
0:01:56.039,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We deserve equal pay for equal work.

41
0:01:58.844,000 --> 0:02:,000
We have the right to move through the world as we choose,

42
0:02:01.852,000 --> 0:02:02,000
free from harassment or violence.

43
0:02:04.233,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We have the right to easy, affordable access to birth control,

44
0:02:07.811,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and reproductive services.

45
0:02:09.732,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We have the right to make choices about our bodies,

46
0:02:12.327,000 --> 0:02:16,000
free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine.

47
0:02:16.504,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We have the right to respect.

48
0:02:18.679,000 --> 0:02:19,000
There's more.

49
0:02:19.909,000 --> 0:02:21,000
When we talk about the needs of women,

50
0:02:22.148,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we have to consider the other identities we inhabit.

51
0:02:25.577,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We are not just women.

52
0:02:27.518,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We are people with different bodies,

53
0:02:29.389,000 --> 0:02:32,000
gender expressions, faiths, sexualities,

54
0:02:32.428,000 --> 0:02:34,000
class backgrounds, abilities, and so much more.

55
0:02:35.708,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We need to take into account

56
0:02:37.129,000 --> 0:02:39,000
these differences and how they affect us,

57
0:02:39.589,000 --> 0:02:41,000
as much as we account for what we have in common.

58
0:02:42.68,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.

59
0:02:47.22,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I hold these truths to be self-evident, but let me be clear:

60
0:02:50.895,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I'm a mess.

61
0:02:52.056,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I am full of contradictions.

62
0:02:54.337,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong.

63
0:02:57.876,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I have another confession.

64
0:02:59.416,000 --> 0:03:03,000
When I drive to work, I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.

65
0:03:03.776,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:05.307,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Even though the lyrics are degrading to women --

67
0:03:07.66,000 --> 0:03:09,000
these lyrics offend me to my core --

68
0:03:10.479,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the classic Yin Yang Twins song "Salt Shaker" --

69
0:03:13.503,000 --> 0:03:14,000
it is amazing.

70
0:03:14.979,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:17.469,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.

72
0:03:20.421,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Bitch, you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt!"

73
0:03:24.205,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:25.387,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Think about it.

75
0:03:26.436,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:29.348,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Poetry, right?

77
0:03:30.69,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I am utterly mortified by my music choices.

78
0:03:34.374,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:36.31,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I firmly believe in man work,

80
0:03:38.618,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which is anything I don't want to do, including --

81
0:03:41.051,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter) --

82
0:03:42.956,000 --> 0:03:44,000
all domestic tasks,

83
0:03:45.134,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but also: bug killing, trash removal, lawn care and vehicle maintenance.

84
0:03:50.014,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I want no part of any of that.

85
0:03:51.905,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:53.002,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Pink is my favorite color.

87
0:03:54.923,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things.

88
0:03:57.975,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I watch "The Bachelor" and romantic comedies,

89
0:04:00.302,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true.

90
0:04:04.121,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Some of my transgressions are more flagrant.

91
0:04:06.914,000 --> 0:04:08,000
If a woman wants to take her husband's name,

92
0:04:09.304,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that is her choice, and it is not my place to judge.

93
0:04:12.622,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children,

94
0:04:15.622,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I embrace that choice, too.

95
0:04:17.737,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice;

96
0:04:21.832,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the problem is that our society is set up

97
0:04:24.002,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to make women economically vulnerable when they choose.

98
0:04:26.982,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Let's deal with that.

99
0:04:29.601,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Applause)

100
0:04:35.413,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I reject the mainstream feminism

101
0:04:37.508,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that has historically ignored or deflected the needs

102
0:04:40.159,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women,

103
0:04:44.571,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women.

104
0:04:47.968,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I am a very bad feminist.

105
0:04:51.648,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:52.762,000 --> 0:04:53,000
There is also this:

107
0:04:54.238,000 --> 0:04:56,000
As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.

108
0:04:56.984,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal.

109
0:05:00.677,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We expect them to pose perfectly.

110
0:05:03.287,000 --> 0:05:04,000
When they disappoint us,

111
0:05:04.471,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on.

112
0:05:07.957,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Like I said, I am a mess --

113
0:05:10.016,000 --> 0:05:11,000
consider me knocked off that pedestal

114
0:05:11.846,000 --> 0:05:13,000
before you ever try to put me up there.

115
0:05:13.867,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:15.374,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Too many women,

117
0:05:16.458,000 --> 0:05:19,000
particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders,

118
0:05:19.507,000 --> 0:05:21,000
are afraid to be labeled as feminists.

119
0:05:21.869,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a feminist,"

120
0:05:25.599,000 --> 0:05:27,000
for fear of what that label means,

121
0:05:27.868,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations.

122
0:05:32.569,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Take, for example, Beyoncé, or as I call her, The Goddess.

123
0:05:36.365,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:38.325,000 --> 0:05:41,000
She has emerged, in recent years, as a visible feminist.

125
0:05:41.781,000 --> 0:05:43,000
At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,

126
0:05:44.622,000 --> 0:05:47,000
she performed in front of the word "feminist" 10 feet high.

127
0:05:48.412,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It was a glorious spectacle to see

128
0:05:50.643,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this pop star openly embracing feminism

129
0:05:53.643,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and letting young women and men know

130
0:05:55.396,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that being a feminist is something to celebrate.

131
0:05:58.985,000 --> 0:06:01,000
As the moment faded, cultural critics began endlessly debating

132
0:06:02.668,000 --> 0:06:04,000
whether or not Beyoncé was, indeed, a feminist.

133
0:06:05.693,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They graded her feminism,

134
0:06:07.598,000 --> 0:06:11,000
instead of simply taking a grown, accomplished woman at her word.

135
0:06:11.89,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:14.552,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Applause)

137
0:06:17.25,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We demand perfection from feminists,

138
0:06:19.791,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because we are still fighting for so much,

139
0:06:22.172,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we want so much,

140
0:06:23.493,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we need so damn much.

141
0:06:25.395,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We go far beyond reasonable, constructive criticism,

142
0:06:28.599,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to dissecting any given woman's feminism,

143
0:06:31.372,000 --> 0:06:33,000
tearing it apart until there's nothing left.

144
0:06:34.253,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We do not need to do that.

145
0:06:36.452,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive feminism -- is a starting point.

146
0:06:40.583,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But what happens next?

147
0:06:42.592,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability,

148
0:06:46.098,000 --> 0:06:49,000
or walking the walk, and being a little bit brave.

149
0:06:49.888,000 --> 0:06:51,000
If I listen to degrading music,

150
0:06:52.216,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy

151
0:06:55.742,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to contribute a limitless supply.

152
0:06:58.12,000 --> 0:06:59,000
These artists are not going to change

153
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:01,000
how they talk about women in their songs

154
0:07:01.955,000 --> 0:07:04,000
until we demand that change by affecting their bottom line.

155
0:07:05.998,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Certainly, it is difficult.

156
0:07:08.149,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Why must it be so catchy?

157
0:07:10.561,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:14.291,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It's hard to make the better choice,

159
0:07:16.344,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and it is so easy to justify a lesser one.

160
0:07:19.164,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But --

161
0:07:20.226,000 --> 0:07:21,000
when I justify bad choices,

162
0:07:22.005,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I make it harder for women to achieve equality,

163
0:07:24.948,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the equality that we all deserve,

164
0:07:26.836,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and I need to own that.

165
0:07:28.533,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I think of my nieces, ages three and four.

166
0:07:31.826,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They are gorgeous and headstrong, brilliant girls,

167
0:07:34.289,000 --> 0:07:35,000
who are a whole lot of brave.

168
0:07:36.284,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued

169
0:07:39.225,000 --> 0:07:41,000
for the powerful creatures they are.

170
0:07:41.577,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I think of them,

171
0:07:42.656,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and suddenly, the better choice becomes far easier to make.

172
0:07:46.775,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We can all make better choices.

173
0:07:49.333,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We can change the channel when a television show

174
0:07:51.83,000 --> 0:07:53,000
treats sexual violence against women like sport,

175
0:07:54.548,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Game of Thrones.

176
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We can change the radio station

177
0:07:57.834,000 --> 0:08:,000
when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.

178
0:08:01.063,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere

179
0:08:03.77,000 --> 0:08:04,000
when movies don't treat women

180
0:08:05.32,000 --> 0:08:07,000
as anything more than decorative objects.

181
0:08:07.743,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We can stop supporting professional sports

182
0:08:10.008,000 --> 0:08:13,000
where the athletes treat their partners like punching bags.

183
0:08:14.171,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

184
0:08:19.595,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In other ways, men -- and especially straight white men --

185
0:08:22.566,000 --> 0:08:25,000
can say, "No, I will not publish with your magazine,

186
0:08:25.677,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or participate in your project, or otherwise work with you,

187
0:08:28.987,000 --> 0:08:3,000
until you include a fair number of women,

188
0:08:31.408,000 --> 0:08:33,000
both as participants and decision makers.

189
0:08:34.67,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I won't work with you until your publication,

190
0:08:36.821,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or your organization, is more inclusive of all kinds of difference."

191
0:08:41.225,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Those of us who are underrepresented

192
0:08:43.542,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and invited to participate in such projects,

193
0:08:45.735,000 --> 0:08:47,000
can also decline to be included

194
0:08:48.128,000 --> 0:08:51,000
until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling,

195
0:08:51.155,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and we are tokens no more.

196
0:08:53.553,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Without these efforts,

197
0:08:55.251,000 --> 0:08:56,000
without taking these stands,

198
0:08:57.077,000 --> 0:08:59,000
our accomplishments are going to mean very little.

199
0:09:00.365,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We can commit these small acts of bravery

200
0:09:03.002,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power --

201
0:09:06.929,000 --> 0:09:08,000
editors, movie and music producers,

202
0:09:09.564,000 --> 0:09:11,000
CEOs, lawmakers --

203
0:09:11.961,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the people who can make bigger, braver choices

204
0:09:14.198,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to create lasting, meaningful change.

205
0:09:17.678,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We can also boldly claim our feminism --

206
0:09:20.225,000 --> 0:09:22,000
good, bad, or anywhere in between.

207
0:09:23.329,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The last line of my book "Bad Feminist" says,

208
0:09:25.805,000 --> 0:09:28,000
"I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all."

209
0:09:30.24,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is true for so many reasons,

210
0:09:32.304,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but first and foremost, I say this because once upon a time,

211
0:09:35.888,000 --> 0:09:36,000
my voice was stolen from me,

212
0:09:37.741,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and feminism helped me to get my voice back.

213
0:09:41.455,000 --> 0:09:42,000
There was an incident.

214
0:09:42.915,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened.

215
0:09:46.724,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Some boys broke me,

216
0:09:48.136,000 --> 0:09:49,000
when I was so young, I did not know

217
0:09:49.95,000 --> 0:09:51,000
what boys can do to break a girl.

218
0:09:52.4,000 --> 0:09:54,000
They treated me like I was nothing.

219
0:09:54.566,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I began to believe I was nothing.

220
0:09:57.064,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They stole my voice, and in the after,

221
0:09:59.127,000 --> 0:10:,000
I did not dare to believe

222
0:10:00.508,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that anything I might say could matter.

223
0:10:02.948,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But --

224
0:10:03.981,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I had writing.

225
0:10:05.377,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And there, I wrote myself back together.

226
0:10:08.242,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself.

227
0:10:11.653,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I read the words of women

228
0:10:13.028,000 --> 0:10:15,000
who might understand a story like mine,

229
0:10:15.384,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and women who looked like me,

230
0:10:17.179,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin.

231
0:10:21.303,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing.

232
0:10:25.602,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I learned to write like them,

233
0:10:27.308,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and then I learned to write as myself.

234
0:10:29.856,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I found my voice again,

235
0:10:31.024,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure.

236
0:10:36.048,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Through writing and feminism,

237
0:10:37.61,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I also found that if I was a little bit brave,

238
0:10:40.388,000 --> 0:10:43,000
another woman might hear me and see me and recognize

239
0:10:44.013,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are.

240
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
In one hand,

241
0:10:49.692,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I hold the power to accomplish anything.

242
0:10:52.74,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And in my other,

243
0:10:53.765,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman.

244
0:10:57.918,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I am a bad feminist,

245
0:10:59.621,000 --> 0:11:,000
I am a good woman,

246
0:11:01.287,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I am trying to become better in how I think,

247
0:11:03.686,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and what I say, and what I do,

248
0:11:05.97,000 --> 0:11:07,000
without abandoning everything that makes me human.

249
0:11:09.152,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I hope that we can all do the same.

250
0:11:11.7,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I hope that we can all be a little bit brave,

251
0:11:13.967,000 --> 0:11:15,000
when we most need such bravery.

252
0:11:16.856,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

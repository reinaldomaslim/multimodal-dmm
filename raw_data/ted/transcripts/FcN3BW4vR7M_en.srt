1
0:00:12.904,000 --> 0:00:14,000
At age four, I found a garden,

2
0:00:15.849,000 --> 0:00:17,000
living underneath the kitchen floor.

3
0:00:18.778,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It was hiding behind leftover patches of linoleum

4
0:00:22.276,000 --> 0:00:25,000
on the worn-out floor my mother was having removed.

5
0:00:26.061,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The workman was busy when the garden caught my attention.

6
0:00:29.919,000 --> 0:00:34,000
My eyes became glued to the patterns of embroidered roses

7
0:00:35.394,000 --> 0:00:37,000
blooming across my childhood landscape.

8
0:00:38.164,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I saw them and felt a sense of joy and adventure.

9
0:00:44.085,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This excitement felt like a feeling to go forward

10
0:00:46.598,000 --> 0:00:48,000
into something I knew nothing about.

11
0:00:50.196,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My passion and connection to garden started at that exact moment.

12
0:00:55.427,000 --> 0:00:57,000
When spring arrived, I ran so fast through the house,

13
0:00:58.419,000 --> 0:00:59,000
speeding ahead of my mother's voice.

14
0:01:00.498,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I pulled on my red corduroy jumper and my grey plaid wool hat

15
0:01:05.379,000 --> 0:01:07,000
before my mother could get her jacket on.

16
0:01:07.982,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I catapulted out of the front screen door

17
0:01:10.901,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and threw myself on a fresh carpet of grass.

18
0:01:14.411,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Excited, I bounced to my feet and flipped three more cartwheels

19
0:01:19.022,000 --> 0:01:2,000
before landing by her side.

20
0:01:21.934,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Mother dear was in the garden

21
0:01:24.609,000 --> 0:01:26,000
busy breaking up the soil,

22
0:01:26.895,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I sat beside her,

23
0:01:29.061,000 --> 0:01:31,000
playing with mud pies in the flower bed.

24
0:01:33.18,000 --> 0:01:34,000
When her work was done,

25
0:01:34.863,000 --> 0:01:38,000
she rewarded me with an ice-cold glass of bittersweet lemonade

26
0:01:40.236,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and then lined my shoes with sprigs of mint

27
0:01:43.07,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to cool off my feet.

28
0:01:46.069,000 --> 0:01:49,000
My mother cooked with the colors and textures of her garden.

29
0:01:50.538,000 --> 0:01:53,000
She baked yams and squash

30
0:01:54.338,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and heirloom tomatoes and carrots.

31
0:01:58.171,000 --> 0:02:01,000
She fed love to a generation of people

32
0:02:02.188,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with purple hull peas and greens.

33
0:02:07.347,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It seems that during my childhood,

34
0:02:09.744,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the blooms from my mother's gardens have healed all the way from her halo

35
0:02:14.546,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to the roots on the soles of our feet.

36
0:02:18.427,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In our last conversation before her death,

37
0:02:21.704,000 --> 0:02:24,000
she encouraged me to go anywhere in the world

38
0:02:25.077,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that would make me happy.

39
0:02:28.076,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Since then, I have planted her gardens

40
0:02:32.621,000 --> 0:02:34,000
through art installations throughout the world,

41
0:02:35.177,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in countries of the people that I meet.

42
0:02:38.386,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now they are lining parks and courtyards,

43
0:02:42.561,000 --> 0:02:45,000
painted on walls and even in blighted lots off the street.

44
0:02:47.509,000 --> 0:02:49,000
If you were in Berlin, Germany,

45
0:02:49.632,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you would have seen my garden at Stilwerk Design Center,

46
0:02:53.966,000 --> 0:02:57,000
where rosemary and lavender, hydrangea and lemon balm

47
0:02:58.505,000 --> 0:03:01,000
trailed up the glass elevators to all six floors.

48
0:03:03.18,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In 2009, I planted "Philosophers Garden,"

49
0:03:07.426,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a garden mural,

50
0:03:08.648,000 --> 0:03:11,000
blooming at the historic Frederick Douglass High School

51
0:03:11.955,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in Memphis, Tennessee.

52
0:03:14.483,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This school’s garden fed an entire community

53
0:03:17.664,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and was honored by Eleanor Roosevelt during the Great Depression.

54
0:03:22.419,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Again, in 2011, I planted at Court Square Park --

55
0:03:28.719,000 --> 0:03:29,000
six entry gardens

56
0:03:30.584,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with 80 varieties of deliciously fragrant floribunda

57
0:03:36.132,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and hybrid tea roses.

58
0:03:39.188,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Gardening has taught me that planting and growing a garden

59
0:03:43.998,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is the same process as creating our lives.

60
0:03:48.228,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This process of creation begins in the spring,

61
0:03:50.902,000 --> 0:03:52,000
when you break up the soil and start anew.

62
0:03:54.764,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Then it's time to clear out the dead leaves,

63
0:03:58.833,000 --> 0:04:,000
debris and roots of the winter.

64
0:04:02.635,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The gardener must then make sure

65
0:04:05.41,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that a good disposition and the proper nutrients

66
0:04:09.529,000 --> 0:04:1,000
are correctly mixed in the soil.

67
0:04:12.713,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Then it's important to aerate the topsoil

68
0:04:16.983,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and leave it loosely packed on the surface.

69
0:04:19.89,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You won't get those beautiful blooms in life

70
0:04:22.228,000 --> 0:04:25,000
until you first do the work just right.

71
0:04:26.292,000 --> 0:04:28,000
When our gardens are balanced with care,

72
0:04:29.196,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we can harvest the beauty of living a life of grace.

73
0:04:34.646,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In the forests,

74
0:04:36.317,000 --> 0:04:4,000
when trees realize through their roots that another tree is sick,

75
0:04:41.277,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they will send a portion of their nutrients to that tree

76
0:04:44.03,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to help them to heal.

77
0:04:46.188,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They never think about what will happen to them

78
0:04:48.688,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or feel vulnerable when they do.

79
0:04:51.149,000 --> 0:04:52,000
When a tree is dying,

80
0:04:52.919,000 --> 0:04:56,000
it releases all of its nutrients to other trees that need it the most.

81
0:04:59.163,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Below the surface, we are all connected by our roots

82
0:05:02.551,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and sharing nutrients with each other.

83
0:05:05.758,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's only when we come together that we can honestly grow.

84
0:05:12.839,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's the same for humans in the garden of hardship.

85
0:05:16.499,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In this garden,

86
0:05:18.15,000 --> 0:05:21,000
when the caterpillar transforms into a chrysalis,

87
0:05:22.518,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this involves some struggle.

88
0:05:24.367,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But it's a challenge with a purpose.

89
0:05:26.756,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Without this painful fight

90
0:05:28.875,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to break free from the confines of the cocoon,

91
0:05:32.077,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the newly formed butterfly can't strengthen its wings.

92
0:05:36.228,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Without the battle, the butterfly dies without ever taking flight.

93
0:05:42.425,000 --> 0:05:43,000
My life's work

94
0:05:44.835,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is to illustrate how to integrate human connectivity into the garden.

95
0:05:51.286,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Gardens are full of magical wisdom for this transformation.

96
0:05:57.817,000 --> 0:06:,000
Mother Nature is creative energy waiting to be born.

97
0:06:03.084,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Gardens are a mirror

98
0:06:04.719,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that cast their own reflection into our waking lives.

99
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So nurture your talents and strengths

100
0:06:11.736,000 --> 0:06:13,000
while you appreciate all you've been given.

101
0:06:15.331,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Remain humble to healing.

102
0:06:17.807,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And maintain compassion for others.

103
0:06:22.092,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Cultivate your garden for giving

104
0:06:24.886,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and plant those seeds for the future.

105
0:06:27.633,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The garden is the world living deep inside of you.

106
0:06:33.411,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Thank you.

107
0:06:34.601,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Applause)

108
0:06:35.776,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Cheers)

109
0:06:36.982,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.841,000 --> 0:00:14,000
For the last 50 years,

2
0:00:15.047,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a lot of smart, well-resourced people -- some of you, no doubt --

3
0:00:20.662,000 --> 0:00:23,000
have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty

4
0:00:23.988,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the United States.

5
0:00:26.18,000 --> 0:00:29,000
People have created and invested millions of dollars

6
0:00:30.168,000 --> 0:00:32,000
into non-profit organizations

7
0:00:32.409,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with the mission of helping people who are poor.

8
0:00:36.249,000 --> 0:00:37,000
They've created think tanks

9
0:00:38.159,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that study issues like education, job creation and asset-building,

10
0:00:43.437,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities.

11
0:00:48.736,000 --> 0:00:51,000
They've written books and columns and given passionate speeches,

12
0:00:52.394,000 --> 0:00:55,000
decrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people

13
0:00:56.189,000 --> 0:00:59,000
entrenched at the bottom end of the income scale.

14
0:01:00.069,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And that effort has helped.

15
0:01:02.161,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But it's not enough.

16
0:01:04.101,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Our poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last 50 years,

17
0:01:07.858,000 --> 0:01:09,000
since the War on Poverty was launched.

18
0:01:10.576,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm here to tell you

19
0:01:12.751,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource.

20
0:01:18.775,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Here it is:

21
0:01:20.509,000 --> 0:01:21,000
people who are poor.

22
0:01:23.382,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Up in the left-hand corner is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.

23
0:01:27.925,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They met when they all had small children,

24
0:01:29.958,000 --> 0:01:31,000
through a parenting class at a family resource center

25
0:01:32.819,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in San Francisco.

26
0:01:34.8,000 --> 0:01:37,000
As they grew together as parents and friends,

27
0:01:38.443,000 --> 0:01:4,000
they talked a lot about how hard it was

28
0:01:40.483,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to make money when your kids are little.

29
0:01:42.729,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Child care is expensive,

30
0:01:44.435,000 --> 0:01:45,000
more than they'd earn in a job.

31
0:01:46.214,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Their husbands worked,

32
0:01:47.398,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but they wanted to contribute financially, too.

33
0:01:49.898,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So they hatched a plan.

34
0:01:51.661,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They started a cleaning business.

35
0:01:54.091,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They plastered neighborhoods with flyers

36
0:01:56.459,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and handed business cards out to their families and friends,

37
0:01:59.356,000 --> 0:02:,000
and soon, they had clients calling.

38
0:02:01.597,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Two of them would clean the office or house

39
0:02:04.686,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and one of them would watch the kids.

40
0:02:06.576,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids.

41
0:02:09.515,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughs) It's awesome, right?

42
0:02:11.752,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:12.99,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And they split the money three ways.

44
0:02:14.866,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It was not a full-time gig,

45
0:02:16.191,000 --> 0:02:18,000
no one could watch the little ones all day.

46
0:02:18.446,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But it made a difference for their families.

47
0:02:22.049,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Extra money to pay for bills when a husband's work hours were cut.

48
0:02:27.1,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing.

49
0:02:30.402,000 --> 0:02:31,000
A little extra money in their pockets

50
0:02:32.345,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to make them feel some independence.

51
0:02:34.863,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Up in the top-right corner is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.

52
0:02:39.016,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Brianna is one of those kids

53
0:02:40.955,000 --> 0:02:44,000
with this sparkly, infectious, outgoing personality.

54
0:02:45.789,000 --> 0:02:46,000
For example, when Rosie,

55
0:02:47.525,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a little girl who spoke only Spanish, moved in next door,

56
0:02:50.705,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Brianna, who spoke only English,

57
0:02:52.877,000 --> 0:02:55,000
borrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app

58
0:02:56.486,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so the two of them could communicate.

59
0:02:58.29,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:59.416,000 --> 0:03:,000
I know, right?

61
0:03:00.622,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Rosie's family credits Brianna with helping Rosie to learn English.

62
0:03:05.192,000 --> 0:03:06,000
A few years ago,

63
0:03:07.101,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Brianna started to struggle academically.

64
0:03:10.312,000 --> 0:03:14,000
She was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn

65
0:03:14.751,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and acting out in class.

66
0:03:17.023,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And her mother was heartbroken over what was happening.

67
0:03:21.697,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade

68
0:03:24.983,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and Brianna was devastated.

69
0:03:27.02,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Her mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone

70
0:03:32.215,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed,

71
0:03:35.743,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and she did not know how to help her.

72
0:03:37.705,000 --> 0:03:4,000
One afternoon, Theresa was catching up with a group of friends,

73
0:03:41.293,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and one of them said,

74
0:03:42.876,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"Theresa, how are you?"

75
0:03:45.344,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And she burst into tears.

76
0:03:47.804,000 --> 0:03:5,000
After she shared her story, one of her friends said,

77
0:03:51.169,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"I went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago."

78
0:03:54.47,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And in that moment,

79
0:03:55.645,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Theresa realized that so much of her struggle

80
0:03:57.926,000 --> 0:03:59,000
was not having anybody to talk with about it.

81
0:04:00.984,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So she created a support group for parents like her.

82
0:04:05.101,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The first meeting was her and two other people.

83
0:04:08.459,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But word spread, and soon 20 people, 30 people

84
0:04:11.524,000 --> 0:04:14,000
were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together.

85
0:04:14.923,000 --> 0:04:16,000
She went from feeling helpless

86
0:04:17.164,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter,

87
0:04:20.817,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle.

88
0:04:24.522,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And Brianna is doing fantastic -- she's doing great academically

89
0:04:27.583,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and socially.

90
0:04:29.834,000 --> 0:04:32,000
That in the middle is my man Baakir,

91
0:04:33.244,000 --> 0:04:35,000
standing in front of BlackStar Books and Caffe,

92
0:04:36.113,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which he runs out of part of his house.

93
0:04:38.722,000 --> 0:04:39,000
As you walk in the door,

94
0:04:40.321,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Baakir greets you with a "Welcome black home."

95
0:04:43.729,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:46.531,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Once inside, you can order some Algiers jerk chicken,

97
0:04:50.598,000 --> 0:04:52,000
perhaps a vegan walnut burger,

98
0:04:53.145,000 --> 0:04:55,000
or jive turkey sammich.

99
0:04:55.519,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And that's sammich -- not sandwich.

100
0:04:58.436,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop,

101
0:05:02.691,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which is several steps above a donut hole

102
0:05:05.073,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and made from a very secret family recipe.

103
0:05:08.197,000 --> 0:05:1,000
For real, it's very secret, he won't tell you about it.

104
0:05:11.464,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But BlackStar is much more than a café.

105
0:05:15.046,000 --> 0:05:16,000
For the kids in the neighborhood,

106
0:05:16.675,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it's a place to go after school to get help with homework.

107
0:05:19.704,000 --> 0:05:2,000
For the grown-ups, it's where they go

108
0:05:21.521,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to find out what's going on in the neighborhood

109
0:05:23.748,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and catch up with friends.

110
0:05:25.129,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's a performance venue.

111
0:05:26.63,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's a home for poets, musicians and artists.

112
0:05:30.424,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Baakir and his partner Nicole,

113
0:05:32.632,000 --> 0:05:34,000
with their baby girl strapped to her back,

114
0:05:34.796,000 --> 0:05:35,000
are there in the mix of it all,

115
0:05:36.374,000 --> 0:05:38,000
serving up a cup of coffee,

116
0:05:38.469,000 --> 0:05:4,000
teaching a child how to play Mancala,

117
0:05:40.633,000 --> 0:05:43,000
or painting a sign for an upcoming community event.

118
0:05:44.182,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I have worked with and learned from people just like them

119
0:05:48.452,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for more than 20 years.

120
0:05:50.117,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I have organized against the prison system,

121
0:05:52.984,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which impacts poor folks,

122
0:05:55.341,000 --> 0:05:57,000
especially black, indigenous and Latino folks,

123
0:05:57.909,000 --> 0:05:58,000
at an alarming rate.

124
0:05:59.758,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise,

125
0:06:03.297,000 --> 0:06:07,000
despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools,

126
0:06:07.73,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and police violence in their communities.

127
0:06:10.605,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I have learned from families

128
0:06:12.515,000 --> 0:06:15,000
who are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity

129
0:06:16.221,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to collectively create their own solutions.

130
0:06:18.435,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And they're not just focused on money.

131
0:06:20.911,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They're addressing education, housing, health, community --

132
0:06:24.631,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the things that we all care about.

133
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Everywhere I go,

134
0:06:29.667,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I see people who are broke but not broken.

135
0:06:33.263,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas,

136
0:06:37.106,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so that they can create a better life for themselves,

137
0:06:39.698,000 --> 0:06:41,000
their families, their communities.

138
0:06:43.316,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa and Baakir are the rule,

139
0:06:49.828,000 --> 0:06:5,000
not the shiny exception.

140
0:06:51.923,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I am the exception.

141
0:06:54.54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in Rochester, New York.

142
0:06:59.625,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I was bussed to a school in the suburbs, from a neighborhood

143
0:07:02.591,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous.

144
0:07:06.502,000 --> 0:07:07,000
At eight, I was a latchkey kid.

145
0:07:08.933,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores,

146
0:07:13.365,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and wait for my mother to come home.

147
0:07:15.375,000 --> 0:07:17,000
After school, I'd go to the corner store

148
0:07:17.591,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,

149
0:07:20.117,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which I'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack.

150
0:07:23.145,000 --> 0:07:25,000
If I had a little extra money, I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.

151
0:07:25.976,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:27.001,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Cherry.

153
0:07:28.176,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Not as good as a buttermilk drop.

154
0:07:29.854,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:30.879,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We were poor when I was a kid.

156
0:07:32.597,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But now, I own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood

157
0:07:36.414,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in Oakland, California.

158
0:07:38.363,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I've built a career.

159
0:07:40.375,000 --> 0:07:42,000
My husband is a business owner.

160
0:07:43.605,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I have a retirement account.

161
0:07:46.305,000 --> 0:07:48,000
My daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove

162
0:07:48.906,000 --> 0:07:49,000
unless there's a grown-up at home

163
0:07:50.509,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and she doesn't have to,

164
0:07:51.691,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because she does not have to have the same kind of self-reliance

165
0:07:54.978,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that I had to at her age.

166
0:07:56.795,000 --> 0:07:58,000
My kids' raviolis are organic

167
0:07:59.023,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and full of things like spinach and ricotta,

168
0:08:01.954,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because I have the luxury of choice

169
0:08:04.301,000 --> 0:08:05,000
when it comes to what my children eat.

170
0:08:06.243,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I am the exception,

171
0:08:08.367,000 --> 0:08:1,000
not because I'm more talented than Baakir

172
0:08:10.723,000 --> 0:08:13,000
or my mother worked any harder than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,

173
0:08:14.629,000 --> 0:08:15,000
or cared any more than Theresa.

174
0:08:17.395,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Marginalized communities are full of smart, talented people,

175
0:08:22.525,000 --> 0:08:24,000
hustling and working and innovating,

176
0:08:24.863,000 --> 0:08:27,000
just like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs.

177
0:08:28.828,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They are full of people tapping into their resilience

178
0:08:31.485,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to get up every day, get the kids off to school

179
0:08:34.011,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and go to jobs that don't pay enough,

180
0:08:36.021,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or get educations that are putting them in debt.

181
0:08:38.85,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They are full of people applying their savvy intelligence

182
0:08:43.678,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to stretch a minimum wage paycheck,

183
0:08:46.089,000 --> 0:08:49,000
or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet.

184
0:08:49.627,000 --> 0:08:52,000
They are full of people doing for themselves and for others,

185
0:08:53.426,000 --> 0:08:56,000
whether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor,

186
0:08:56.954,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill,

187
0:09:00.712,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or just watching out for the neighborhood kids

188
0:09:02.979,000 --> 0:09:03,000
from the front stoop.

189
0:09:05.259,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I am the exception because of luck and privilege,

190
0:09:08.67,000 --> 0:09:09,000
not hard work.

191
0:09:09.979,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And I'm not being modest or self-deprecating --

192
0:09:12.341,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I am amazing.

193
0:09:13.516,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:14.758,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But most people work hard.

195
0:09:16.83,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Hard work is the common denominator in this equation,

196
0:09:21.023,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and I'm tired of the story we tell

197
0:09:23.416,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that hard work leads to success,

198
0:09:26.048,000 --> 0:09:27,000
because that allows --

199
0:09:27.609,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Thank you.

200
0:09:28.823,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Applause)

201
0:09:33.509,000 --> 0:09:37,000
... because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it,

202
0:09:38.146,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and by implication,

203
0:09:39.403,000 --> 0:09:41,000
those who don't make it don't deserve it.

204
0:09:42.175,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We tell ourselves, in the back of our minds,

205
0:09:44.402,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and sometimes in the front of our mouths,

206
0:09:46.701,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"There must be something a little wrong with those poor people."

207
0:09:49.762,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We have a wide range of beliefs

208
0:09:51.278,000 --> 0:09:53,000
about what that something wrong is.

209
0:09:53.487,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Some people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders

210
0:09:56.795,000 --> 0:09:59,000
who would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day's work.

211
0:10:00.287,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Others prefer the story that poor people are helpless

212
0:10:03.224,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough,

213
0:10:06.529,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and if they were just told what to do

214
0:10:08.762,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and shown the right path,

215
0:10:10.043,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they could make it.

216
0:10:11.917,000 --> 0:10:17,000
For every story I hear demonizing low-income single mothers

217
0:10:18.08,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or absentee fathers,

218
0:10:19.453,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which is how people might think of my parents,

219
0:10:22.219,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I've got 50 that tell a different story about the same people,

220
0:10:27.105,000 --> 0:10:29,000
showing up every day and doing their best.

221
0:10:30.491,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren't true,

222
0:10:34.231,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but those stories allow us to not really see who people really are,

223
0:10:40.619,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because they don't paint a full picture.

224
0:10:43.249,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The quarter-truths and limited plot lines have us convinced

225
0:10:47.122,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that poor people are a problem that needs fixing.

226
0:10:51.57,000 --> 0:10:55,000
What if we recognized that what's working is the people

227
0:10:55.863,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and what's broken is our approach?

228
0:10:58.441,000 --> 0:11:01,000
What if we realized that the experts we are looking for,

229
0:11:01.99,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the experts we need to follow,

230
0:11:03.81,000 --> 0:11:04,000
are poor people themselves?

231
0:11:05.755,000 --> 0:11:08,000
What if, instead of imposing solutions,

232
0:11:08.782,000 --> 0:11:1,000
we just added fire

233
0:11:10.905,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to the already-burning flame that they have?

234
0:11:13.873,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Not directing --

235
0:11:16.054,000 --> 0:11:18,000
not even empowering --

236
0:11:18.668,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but just fueling their initiative.

237
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Just north of here,

238
0:11:23.381,000 --> 0:11:26,000
we have an example of what this could look like:

239
0:11:26.572,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Silicon Valley.

240
0:11:28.497,000 --> 0:11:32,000
A whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief

241
0:11:32.695,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them,

242
0:11:37.007,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we should give them lots and lots and lots of money.

243
0:11:41.028,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

244
0:11:42.174,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Right? But where is our strategy for Theresa and Baakir?

245
0:11:47.127,000 --> 0:11:49,000
There are no incubators for them,

246
0:11:49.447,000 --> 0:11:51,000
no accelerators, no fellowships.

247
0:11:52.577,000 --> 0:11:55,000
How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha really all that different

248
0:11:56.276,000 --> 0:11:58,000
from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?

249
0:11:58.938,000 --> 0:12:,000
Baakir has experience and a track record.

250
0:12:01.946,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I'd put my money on him.

251
0:12:04.649,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So, consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy.

252
0:12:12.19,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Let's grasp this opportunity

253
0:12:14.984,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to let go of a tired, faulty narrative

254
0:12:18.825,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and listen and look for true stories,

255
0:12:21.886,000 --> 0:12:23,000
more beautifully complex stories,

256
0:12:23.923,000 --> 0:12:27,000
about who marginalized people and families and communities are.

257
0:12:31.149,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I'm going to take a minute to speak to my people.

258
0:12:39.986,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We cannot wait

259
0:12:41.47,000 --> 0:12:43,000
for somebody else to get it right.

260
0:12:45.136,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Let us remember what we are capable of;

261
0:12:48.316,000 --> 0:12:51,000
all that we have built with blood, sweat and dreams;

262
0:12:52.209,000 --> 0:12:53,000
all the cogs that keep turning;

263
0:12:54.012,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work.

264
0:12:57.708,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Let us remember that we are magic.

265
0:13:00.677,000 --> 0:13:02,000
If you need some inspiration to jog your memory,

266
0:13:03.621,000 --> 0:13:05,000
read Octavia Butler's "Parable of the Sower."

267
0:13:06.615,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Listen to Reverend King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail."

268
0:13:10.028,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Listen to Suheir Hammad recite "First Writing Since,"

269
0:13:14.672,000 --> 0:13:17,000
or Esperanza Spalding perform "Black Gold."

270
0:13:17.745,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Set your gaze upon the art of Kehinde Wiley

271
0:13:20.417,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or Favianna Rodriguez.

272
0:13:22.914,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Look at the hands of your grandmother

273
0:13:28.523,000 --> 0:13:3,000
or into the eyes of someone who loves you.

274
0:13:32.386,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We are magic.

275
0:13:35.087,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Individually, we don't have a lot of wealth and power,

276
0:13:37.981,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but collectively, we are unstoppable.

277
0:13:42.114,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And we spend a lot of our time and energy

278
0:13:44.409,000 --> 0:13:5,000
organizing our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us.

279
0:13:51.489,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Instead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways,

280
0:13:55.094,000 --> 0:13:57,000
let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.

281
0:13:58.355,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Let's use some of our substantial collective power

282
0:14:01.869,000 --> 0:14:02,000
toward inventing and bringing to life

283
0:14:03.865,000 --> 0:14:05,000
new ways of being that work for us.

284
0:14:07.423,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Desmond Tutu talks about the concept of ubuntu,

285
0:14:12.382,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation process

286
0:14:16.061,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that they embarked on after apartheid.

287
0:14:18.378,000 --> 0:14:2,000
He says it means,

288
0:14:20.737,000 --> 0:14:25,000
"My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours;

289
0:14:26.287,000 --> 0:14:3,000
we belong to a bundle of life."

290
0:14:32.381,000 --> 0:14:34,000
A bundle of life.

291
0:14:36.019,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The Truth and Reconciliation process

292
0:14:37.831,000 --> 0:14:4,000
started by elevating the voices of the unheard.

293
0:14:42.068,000 --> 0:14:47,000
If this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all,

294
0:14:48.033,000 --> 0:14:51,000
then we need to elevate the voices of our unheard,

295
0:14:51.146,000 --> 0:14:54,000
of people like Jobana, Sintia and Bertha,

296
0:14:54.651,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Theresa and Baakir.

297
0:14:57.809,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We must leverage their solutions and their ideas.

298
0:15:01.437,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We must listen to their true stories,

299
0:15:04.591,000 --> 0:15:06,000
their more beautifully complex stories.

300
0:15:07.956,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Thank you.

301
0:15:09.14,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.927,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to talk to you about one thing

2
0:00:15.108,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and just one thing only,

3
0:00:16.864,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and this has to do with when people ask me,

4
0:00:20.62,000 --> 0:00:23,000
what do you do?

5
0:00:23.867,000 --> 0:00:24,000
To which I usually respond,

6
0:00:25.767,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I do computer music.

7
0:00:28.907,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now, a number of people

8
0:00:30.852,000 --> 0:00:32,000
just stop talking to me right then and there,

9
0:00:33.089,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the rest who are left usually have

10
0:00:35.502,000 --> 0:00:37,000
this blank look in their eye,

11
0:00:37.75,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as if to say, what does that mean?

12
0:00:39.919,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I feel like I'm actually depriving them

13
0:00:42.137,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of information by telling them this,

14
0:00:45.342,000 --> 0:00:46,000
at which point I usually panic

15
0:00:47.07,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind,

16
0:00:48.66,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which is, I have no idea what I'm doing.

17
0:00:52.442,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Which is true.

18
0:00:54.054,000 --> 0:00:56,000
That's usually followed by a second thought,

19
0:00:56.91,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which is, whatever it is that I'm doing,

20
0:01:00.21,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I love it.

21
0:01:01.902,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And today, I want to, well,

22
0:01:05.699,000 --> 0:01:07,000
share with you something I love,

23
0:01:07.87,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and also why.

24
0:01:09.354,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I think we'll begin with just this question:

25
0:01:13.283,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What is computer music?

26
0:01:14.62,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And I'm going to try to do my best to provide a definition,

27
0:01:18.4,000 --> 0:01:19,000
maybe by telling you a story

28
0:01:20.131,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that goes through some of the stuff

29
0:01:21.778,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I've been working on.

30
0:01:23.704,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And the first thing, I think, in our story

31
0:01:25.516,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is going to be something called ChucK.

32
0:01:28.064,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, ChucK is a programming language for music,

33
0:01:33.437,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it's open-source, it's freely available,

34
0:01:36.146,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I like to think that it crashes equally well

35
0:01:38.066,000 --> 0:01:4,000
on all modern operating systems.

36
0:01:40.41,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And instead of telling you more about it,

37
0:01:43.37,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'm just going to give you a demo.

38
0:01:45.196,000 --> 0:01:46,000
By the way, I'm just going to nerd out

39
0:01:46.352,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for just a few minutes here,

40
0:01:47.981,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so I would say, don't freak out.

41
0:01:50.779,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In fact, I would invite all of you to join me

42
0:01:52.85,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in just geeking out.

43
0:01:54.034,000 --> 0:01:57,000
If you've never written a line of code before in your life,

44
0:01:57.096,000 --> 0:01:58,000
do not worry.

45
0:01:58.282,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this.

46
0:02:01.799,000 --> 0:02:02,000
First thing I'm going to do is to make

47
0:02:03.218,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a sine wave oscillator,

48
0:02:05.051,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and we're going to called the sine wave generator

49
0:02:08.085,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"Ge."

50
0:02:10.847,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And then we're going to connect "Ge" to the DAC.

51
0:02:12.937,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now this is kind of the abstraction

52
0:02:14.091,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for the sound output on my computer. Okay?

53
0:02:16.699,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I've connected myself into the speaker.

54
0:02:19.899,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Next, I'm going to say my frequency

55
0:02:21.491,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is 440 hertz,

56
0:02:23.459,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and I'm going to let time advance

57
0:02:27.278,000 --> 0:02:29,000
by two seconds through this operation.

58
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:34,000
All right, so if I were to play this --

59
0:02:34.068,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Tone) —

60
0:02:36.74,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you would hear a sine wave at 440 hertz for two seconds.

61
0:02:39.161,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,

62
0:02:42.187,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and then just change some of these numbers,

63
0:02:43.931,000 --> 0:02:46,000
220.5, 440 I shall leave it as that,

64
0:02:47.891,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and .5 and 880.

65
0:02:50.331,000 --> 0:02:51,000
By doubling the frequency,

66
0:02:51.693,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we're actually going up in successive octaves,

67
0:02:54.21,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and then we have this sequence --

68
0:02:55.547,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Tones) — of tones.

69
0:02:57.674,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Okay, great, now I can imagine creating

70
0:02:59.58,000 --> 0:03:,000
all kinds of really horrible

71
0:03:01.022,000 --> 0:03:03,000
single sine wave pieces of music with this,

72
0:03:03.42,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but I'm going to do something that computers are really good at,

73
0:03:06.332,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which is repetition.

74
0:03:08.156,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'm going to put this all in a while loop,

75
0:03:09.86,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and you actually don't need to indent,

76
0:03:11.156,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but this is purely for aesthetic reasons.

77
0:03:13.28,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's good practice.

78
0:03:14.884,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And when we do this —

79
0:03:16.464,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Tones) —

80
0:03:20.961,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that's going to go on for a while.

81
0:03:22.134,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In fact, it's probably not going to stop

82
0:03:23.628,000 --> 0:03:24,000
until this computer disintegrates.

83
0:03:25.411,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I can't really empirically prove that to you,

84
0:03:28.11,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but I hope you'll believe me when I say that.

85
0:03:31.779,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Next, I'm going to replace this 220

86
0:03:33.655,000 --> 0:03:35,000
by math.random2f.

87
0:03:36.461,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I'm going to generate a random number

88
0:03:37.739,000 --> 0:03:4,000
between 30 and 1,000 and send that

89
0:03:40.879,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to the frequency of me.

90
0:03:42.965,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And I'm going to do this every half a second.

91
0:03:45.065,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Tones)

92
0:03:48.007,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Let's do this every 200 milliseconds.

93
0:03:50.668,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Tones)

94
0:03:55.29,000 --> 0:03:56,000
One hundred.

95
0:03:56.745,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Tones)

96
0:03:58.357,000 --> 0:03:59,000
All right.

97
0:03:59.591,000 --> 0:04:,000
At this point, we've reached something

98
0:04:01.535,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that I would like to think of as

99
0:04:02.605,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the canonical computer music.

100
0:04:06.626,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This is, to me, the sound that mainframes

101
0:04:10.443,000 --> 0:04:11,000
are supposed to be making

102
0:04:11.565,000 --> 0:04:14,000
when they're thinking really hard.

103
0:04:14.807,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's this sound, it's like,

104
0:04:16.9,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the square root of five million.

105
0:04:22.427,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So is this computer music?

106
0:04:26.211,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Yeah, I guess by definition,

107
0:04:28.19,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it's kind of computer music.

108
0:04:29.395,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to

109
0:04:32.403,000 --> 0:04:33,000
cruising down the highway,

110
0:04:33.891,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but it's a foundation of computer-generated music,

111
0:04:38.907,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and using ChucK,

112
0:04:41.11,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we've actually been building instruments

113
0:04:42.803,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,

114
0:04:44.699,000 --> 0:04:48,000
based right here at Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.

115
0:04:48.9,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops,

116
0:04:51.683,000 --> 0:04:53,000
humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.

117
0:04:54.312,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now the reason we have these

118
0:04:55.909,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is so that for the instruments that we create

119
0:04:58.379,000 --> 0:05:,000
out of the laptop, we want the sound to come

120
0:05:00.603,000 --> 0:05:02,000
out of somewhere near the instrument

121
0:05:03.123,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and the performer,

122
0:05:04.491,000 --> 0:05:06,000
kind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument.

123
0:05:07.193,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Like, if I were to play a violin here,

124
0:05:09.079,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the sound would naturally not come out of

125
0:05:11.19,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.

126
0:05:13.964,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So these speakers are meant to emulate that.

127
0:05:17.171,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In fact, I'm going to show you

128
0:05:18.5,000 --> 0:05:2,000
how we actually built them.

129
0:05:21.243,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The first step is to go to IKEA

130
0:05:23.307,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and buy a salad bowl.

131
0:05:24.687,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.

132
0:05:27.917,000 --> 0:05:28,000
That's the actual name,

133
0:05:29.415,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I actually use one of these

134
0:05:30.837,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to make salad at home as well, I kid you not.

135
0:05:33.065,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And the first step is you turn it upside down,

136
0:05:36.236,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and then you drill holes in them,

137
0:05:38.711,000 --> 0:05:4,000
six holes per hemi,

138
0:05:41.22,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and then make a base plate,

139
0:05:42.934,000 --> 0:05:44,000
put car speaker drivers in them

140
0:05:45.614,000 --> 0:05:47,000
along with amplifiers in the enclosure,

141
0:05:48.205,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and you put that all together and you have

142
0:05:49.559,000 --> 0:05:5,000
these hemispherical speaker arrays.

143
0:05:51.333,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Add people, add laptops,

144
0:05:52.896,000 --> 0:05:54,000
you have a laptop orchestra.

145
0:05:55.584,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And what might a laptop orchestra sound like?

146
0:05:59.114,000 --> 0:06:,000
Well, let me give you a demonstration

147
0:06:01.033,000 --> 0:06:04,000
of about 200 instruments we've created so far

148
0:06:04.268,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for the Laptop Orchestra.

149
0:06:07.511,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And what I'm going to do is actually come over to this thing.

150
0:06:09.938,000 --> 0:06:11,000
This thing I have in front of me

151
0:06:12.143,000 --> 0:06:15,000
actually used to be a commodity gaming controller

152
0:06:15.355,000 --> 0:06:16,000
called a Gametrak.

153
0:06:17.145,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands.

154
0:06:19.021,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's tethered to the base,

155
0:06:20.581,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and this will track the position of your hands

156
0:06:23.11,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in real time.

157
0:06:24.163,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It was originally designed as a golfing controller

158
0:06:27.537,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to detect the motion of your swing.

159
0:06:29.453,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That turned out to be a rather large

160
0:06:31.984,000 --> 0:06:32,000
commercial non-success,

161
0:06:33.688,000 --> 0:06:36,000
at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars,

162
0:06:37.442,000 --> 0:06:39,000
at which point computer music researchers

163
0:06:39.45,000 --> 0:06:41,000
said, "This is awesome!

164
0:06:41.508,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We can prototype instruments out of this."

165
0:06:44.257,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So let me show you one instrument we've created,

166
0:06:47.201,000 --> 0:06:48,000
one of many, and this instrument

167
0:06:49.113,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is called "Twilight,"

168
0:06:50.682,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and it's meant to go with this metaphor

169
0:06:53.368,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of pulling a sound out of the ground.

170
0:06:56.401,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So let me see if this will work.

171
0:06:59.752,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Music)

172
0:07:08.968,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And put it back.

173
0:07:10.791,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And then if you go to the left,

174
0:07:14.886,000 --> 0:07:16,000
right,

175
0:07:21.427,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it sounds like an elephant in pain.

176
0:07:25.231,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This is a slightly metallic sound.

177
0:07:28.259,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Turn it just a bit.

178
0:07:31.613,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Music)

179
0:07:37.211,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's like a hovering car.

180
0:07:44.406,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Okay.

181
0:07:45.799,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This third one is a ratchet-like interaction, so

182
0:07:51.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
let me turn it up.

183
0:07:56.915,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Music)

184
0:08:02.068,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So it's a slightly different interaction.

185
0:08:03.948,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The fourth one is a drone.

186
0:08:07.583,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Music)

187
0:08:20.613,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And finally, let's see,

188
0:08:23.319,000 --> 0:08:24,000
this is a totally different interaction,

189
0:08:25.13,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I think you have to imagine that there's

190
0:08:26.94,000 --> 0:08:28,000
this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage,

191
0:08:29.872,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and I'm going to bang it.

192
0:08:34.255,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Drum)

193
0:08:36.902,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

194
0:08:40.241,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So there we go, so that's one of many instruments

195
0:08:42.685,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in the Laptop Orchestra.

196
0:08:44.455,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Applause)

197
0:08:48.009,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Thank you.

198
0:08:50.29,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And when you put that together,

199
0:08:52.396,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you get something that sounds like this.

200
0:08:56.464,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Music)

201
0:09:45.47,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Okay, and so, I think from the experience

202
0:09:47.82,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of building a lot of instruments for the Laptop Orchestra,

203
0:09:50.343,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and I think from the curiosity of wondering,

204
0:09:52.847,000 --> 0:09:53,000
what if we took these

205
0:09:54.35,000 --> 0:09:55,000
hopefully expressive instruments

206
0:09:55.942,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and we brought it to a lot of people,

207
0:09:58.575,000 --> 0:10:,000
plus then a healthy bout of insanity —

208
0:10:00.982,000 --> 0:10:01,000
put those three things together —

209
0:10:02.471,000 --> 0:10:05,000
led to me actually co-founding a startup company

210
0:10:05.987,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in 2008 called Smule.

211
0:10:08.446,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Now Smule's mission is to create

212
0:10:10.366,000 --> 0:10:13,000
expressive, mobile music things,

213
0:10:14.223,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and one of the first musical instruments

214
0:10:18.985,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we created is called Ocarina.

215
0:10:20.845,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick.

216
0:10:27.234,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So Ocarina —

217
0:10:29.65,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Music) —

218
0:10:33.248,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is based on this ancient flute-like instrument

219
0:10:36.371,000 --> 0:10:37,000
called the ocarina,

220
0:10:37.78,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and this one is the four-hole English pendant configuration,

221
0:10:41.163,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and you're literally blowing into the microphone

222
0:10:44.566,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to make the sound.

223
0:10:47.492,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And there's actually a little ChucK script

224
0:10:49.125,000 --> 0:10:5,000
running in here that's detecting

225
0:10:50.293,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the strength of your blowing

226
0:10:51.775,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and also synthesizing the sound.

227
0:10:53.893,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Music)

228
0:10:57.478,000 --> 0:11:,000
And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer,

229
0:11:00.808,000 --> 0:11:01,000
so you can get —

230
0:11:02.461,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Music)

231
0:11:05.79,000 --> 0:11:08,000
All right. So let me play a little ditty for you,

232
0:11:11.533,000 --> 0:11:12,000
a little Bach.

233
0:11:13.349,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And here, you'll hear a little accompaniment with the melody.

234
0:11:15.941,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The accompaniment actually follows the melody,

235
0:11:18.509,000 --> 0:11:21,000
not the other way around.

236
0:11:22.29,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Music)

237
0:11:35.132,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And this was designed

238
0:11:36.789,000 --> 0:11:37,000
to let you take your time

239
0:11:38.065,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and figure out where your expressive space is,

240
0:11:41.27,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and you can just hang out here

241
0:11:43.077,000 --> 0:11:46,000
for a while, for a really dramatic effect, if you want,

242
0:11:46.139,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and whenever you're ready —

243
0:11:49.205,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Music)

244
0:12:04.981,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And on these longer notes,

245
0:12:06.089,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I'm going to use more vibrato

246
0:12:08.19,000 --> 0:12:08,000
towards the end of the notes

247
0:12:09.082,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality.

248
0:12:12.134,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Music)

249
0:12:19.473,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Huh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on.

250
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

251
0:12:26.581,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Thank you.

252
0:12:31.75,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is,

253
0:12:35.746,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is this a toy or it an instrument? Maybe it's both,

254
0:12:40.493,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but for me, I think the more important question is,

255
0:12:42.502,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is it expressive?

256
0:12:44.043,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And at the same time, I think

257
0:12:46.117,000 --> 0:12:47,000
creating these types of instruments

258
0:12:47.421,000 --> 0:12:5,000
asks a question about the role of technology,

259
0:12:50.783,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and its place for how we make music.

260
0:12:52.477,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Apparently, for example,

261
0:12:54.214,000 --> 0:12:55,000
not that long ago, like only a hundred years ago —

262
0:12:56.12,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that's not that long in the course of human history —

263
0:12:57.64,000 --> 0:12:58,000
families back then

264
0:12:59.621,000 --> 0:13:,000
used to make music together

265
0:13:01.509,000 --> 0:13:04,000
as a common form of entertainment.

266
0:13:04.557,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I don't think that's really happening

267
0:13:05.802,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that much anymore.

268
0:13:07.337,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You know, this is before radio, before recording.

269
0:13:09.007,000 --> 0:13:11,000
In the last hundred years, with all this technology,

270
0:13:11.214,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we now have more access to music

271
0:13:13.388,000 --> 0:13:14,000
as listeners and consumers,

272
0:13:15.021,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but somehow, I think we're making less music

273
0:13:18.084,000 --> 0:13:19,000
than ever before.

274
0:13:19.77,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I'm not sure why that would be.

275
0:13:21.401,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play.

276
0:13:24.05,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And while listening to music is wonderful,

277
0:13:26.509,000 --> 0:13:29,000
there's a special joy to making music

278
0:13:29.918,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that's all its own.

279
0:13:31.573,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And I think that's one part

280
0:13:32.836,000 --> 0:13:34,000
of the goal of why I do what I do

281
0:13:34.926,000 --> 0:13:38,000
is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right?

282
0:13:39.682,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now, if that's one goal, the other goal

283
0:13:41.462,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is to look to the future and think about

284
0:13:42.892,000 --> 0:13:44,000
what kind of new musical things can we make

285
0:13:45.229,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that we don't perhaps yet have names for

286
0:13:47.822,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that's enabled by technology, but ultimately

287
0:13:50.685,000 --> 0:13:52,000
might change the way that humans make music.

288
0:13:53.126,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And I'll just give you one example here,

289
0:13:55.498,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and this is Ocarina's other feature.

290
0:14:01.723,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This is a globe,

291
0:14:03.91,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and here you're actually listening

292
0:14:06.683,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to other users of Ocarina

293
0:14:08.735,000 --> 0:14:11,000
blow into their iPhones to play something.

294
0:14:12.715,000 --> 0:14:16,000
This is "G.I.R." from Texas,

295
0:14:17.568,000 --> 0:14:22,000
"R.I.K." I don't know why it's these three-letter names today, Los Angeles.

296
0:14:23.501,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They're all playing pretty,

297
0:14:28.519,000 --> 0:14:31,000
somewhat minimal music here.

298
0:14:31.879,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Music)

299
0:14:37.327,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And the idea with this is that, well,

300
0:14:39.933,000 --> 0:14:42,000
technology should not be foregrounded here,

301
0:14:43.85,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and — (Laughter) —

302
0:14:45.933,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we've actually opened this up.

303
0:14:48.646,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The first thought is that, hey, you know

304
0:14:50.153,000 --> 0:14:53,000
there's somebody somewhere out there

305
0:14:53.343,000 --> 0:14:54,000
playing some music,

306
0:14:54.613,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and this is a small but I think important

307
0:14:56.393,000 --> 0:14:57,000
human connection to make

308
0:14:57.613,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that perhaps the technology affords.

309
0:15:00.611,000 --> 0:15:02,000
As a final example,

310
0:15:03.435,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and perhaps my favorite example,

311
0:15:04.79,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is that in the wake of the 2011 earthquake

312
0:15:07.941,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and tsunami disaster in Japan,

313
0:15:10.427,000 --> 0:15:12,000
a woman reached out in one of our singing apps

314
0:15:13.27,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to try to get people to join in to sing with her

315
0:15:16.157,000 --> 0:15:17,000
on a version of "Lean on Me."

316
0:15:17.762,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Now, in these apps, there's this thing that allows

317
0:15:20.81,000 --> 0:15:21,000
any user to add their voice

318
0:15:22.511,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to an existing performance by any other user

319
0:15:25.309,000 --> 0:15:26,000
or group of users,

320
0:15:26.363,000 --> 0:15:28,000
so in some sense, she's created this kind of

321
0:15:28.388,000 --> 0:15:31,000
global ad hoc corral of strangers,

322
0:15:31.772,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and within weeks, thousands of people

323
0:15:33.98,000 --> 0:15:34,000
joined in on this,

324
0:15:35.612,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and you can kind of see people coming from all around the world

325
0:15:37.991,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and all these lines converging on the origin

326
0:15:40.272,000 --> 0:15:42,000
where the first rendition of the song was sung,

327
0:15:42.62,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and that's in Tokyo.

328
0:15:44.254,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And this is what it sounds like when there's 1,000 people.

329
0:15:47.686,000 --> 0:15:48,000
This is 1,000 voices.

330
0:15:49.663,000 --> 0:15:53,000

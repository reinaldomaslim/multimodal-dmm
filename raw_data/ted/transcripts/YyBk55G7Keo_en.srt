1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Can any of you

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
remember what you wanted to be

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when you were 17?

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Do you know what I wanted to be?

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I wanted to be a biker chick.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I wanted to race cars,

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I wanted to be a cowgirl,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book."

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Because they were all about being free,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the wind in your hair -- just to be free.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And on my seventeenth birthday,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
my parents, knowing how much I loved speed,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
gave me one driving lesson

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
for my seventeenth birthday.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Not that we could have afforded I drive,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but to give me the dream of driving.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And on my seventeenth birthday,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I accompanied my little sister

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in complete innocence,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as I always had all my life --

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
my visually impaired sister --

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to go to see an eye specialist.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Because big sisters

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
are always supposed to support their little sisters.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And my little sister wanted to be a pilot --

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
God help her.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So I used to get my eyes tested

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
just for fun.

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And on my seventeenth birthday,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
after my fake eye exam,

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?"

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I took that driving lesson,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive."

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And then there was a silence --

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
one of those awful silences

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when you know something's wrong.

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And he turned to my mother,

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and he said, "You haven't told her yet?"

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
On my seventeenth birthday,

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as Janis Ian would best say,

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I learned the truth at 17.

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I am, and have been since birth,

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
legally blind.

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And you know,

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
how on earth did I get to 17

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and not know that?

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,

50
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
let me tell you this:

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I got there

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because my father's passion for Johnny Cash

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and a song, "A Boy Named Sue."

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And very shortly after my birth,

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And what the hell does that mean to you?

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,

60
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter)

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I might buy some more time.

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But more importantly, let me tell you --

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Hey.

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
See this hand?

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.

67
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Every man in this room, even you, Steve,

68
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is George Clooney.

69
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And every woman, you are so beautiful.

71
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face

73
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
from all the squinting I've done all my life

74
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
from all the dark lights.

75
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The really strange part is

76
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
my parents made a bizarre, unusual

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and incredibly brave decision.

79
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
No special needs schools.

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
No labels.

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
No limitations.

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
My ability and my potential.

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And they decided to tell me

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that I could see.

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So just like Johnny Cash's Sue,

86
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a boy given a girl's name,

87
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I would grow up and learn from experience

88
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
how to be tough and how to survive,

89
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
when they were no longer there to protect me,

90
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or just take it all away.

91
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But more significantly,

92
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they gave me the ability

93
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to believe,

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
totally, to believe that I could.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And so when I heard that eye specialist

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
tell me all the things, a big fat "no,"

97
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
everybody imagines I was devastated.

98
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it --

99
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
aside from the fact that I thought he was insane --

100
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I got that thump in my chest,

101
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
just that "huh?"

102
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But very quickly I recovered. It was like that.

103
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The first thing I thought about was my mom,

104
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
who was crying over beside me.

105
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I swear to God, I walked out of his office,

106
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"I will drive. I will drive.

107
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."

108
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And with the same dogged determination

109
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that my father had bred into me since I was such a child --

110
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
he taught me how to sail,

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,

112
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.

113
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But he told me to believe

114
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and feel the wind in my face.

115
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And that wind in my face made me believe

116
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that he was mad and I would drive.

117
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And for the next 11 years,

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because I didn't want to be a failure,

120
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I didn't want to be weak.

121
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And I believed I could do it.

122
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.

123
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.

124
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.

125
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.

126
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And then I went to business school.

127
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.

128
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.

129
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And they didn't even know.

130
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And it's extraordinary

131
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
how far belief can take you.

132
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In 1999,

133
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
two and a half years into that job,

134
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
something happened.

135
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.

136
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And temporarily,

137
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
very unexpectedly,

138
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they dropped.

139
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,

140
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.

141
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And two years in,

142
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I really could see very little.

143
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And I found myself in front of an HR manager

144
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in 1999,

145
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
saying something I never imagined that I would say.

146
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I was 28 years old.

147
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.

148
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I simply said,

149
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"I'm sorry.

150
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I can't see, and I need help."

151
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.

152
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.

153
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We all know how hard it is

154
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to admit weakness and failure.

155
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And it's frightening, isn't it?

156
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But all that belief had fueled me so long.

157
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,

158
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it's kind of difficult -- it really is.

159
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.

160
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Oh, for the love of God.

161
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And please, any designers out there?

162
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.

163
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I always end up in the gents' toilets.

164
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.

165
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But can I just tell you,

166
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet

167
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is determined by a triangle.

168
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Have you ever tried to see that

169
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?

170
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's such a small thing, right?

171
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And you know how exhausting it can be

172
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to try to be perfect when you're not,

173
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or to be somebody that you aren't?

174
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,

175
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
they sent me off to an eye specialist.

176
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.

177
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But before I got to him, I was so lost.

178
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I had no idea who I was anymore.

179
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.

180
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
God no, it was therapy.

181
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And he asked me several questions,

182
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of which many were, "Why?

183
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Why are you fighting so hard

184
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
not to be yourself?

185
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And do you love what you do, Caroline?"

186
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,

187
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
they put a chip in your head, and you're like,

188
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.

189
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter)

190
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
To leave would be failure.

191
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And he said, "Do you love it?"

192
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up.

193
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I just was so -- how do I tell him?

194
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?"

195
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes."

196
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time.

197
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
He thought I was mad enough anyway.

198
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And as I left his office,

199
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
he called me back

200
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and he said, "I think it's time.

201
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I think it's time

202
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to stop fighting and do something different."

203
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And that door closed.

204
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And that silence just outside a doctor's office,

205
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that many of us know.

206
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And my chest ached.

207
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.

208
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But I did know the game was up.

209
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,

210
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I thought, "I'll go out for a run."

211
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Really not a very sensible thing to do.

212
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I went on a run that I know so well.

213
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I know this run so well, by the back of my hand.

214
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I always run it perfectly fine.

215
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things

216
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.

217
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And there was a rock that I always missed.

218
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I'd never fallen on it, never.

219
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And there I was crying away,

220
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and smash, bash on my rock.

221
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Broken, fallen over

222
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
on this rock

223
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in the middle of March in 2000,

224
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
typical Irish weather on a Wednesday --

225
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
gray, snot, tears everywhere,

226
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
ridiculously self-pitying.

227
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I was floored, and I was broken,

228
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and I was angry.

229
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And I didn't know what to do.

230
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And I sat there for quite some time going,

231
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?

232
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Because who am I going to be?

233
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
What am I going to be?"

234
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I thought about my dad,

235
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now."

236
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I kept thinking over and over in my mind,

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?

238
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And you know, the extraordinary part of it

239
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is I just simply had no answers.

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I had lost my belief.

241
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Look where my belief had brought me to.

242
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.

243
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I was crumpled.

244
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist

245
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
asking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?

246
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?

247
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Do something different. What do you want to be?

248
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Do something different. What do you want to be?"

249
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And really slowly, slowly, slowly,

250
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
it happened.

251
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And it did happen this way.

252
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And then the minute it came,

253
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it blew up in my head

254
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and bashed in my heart --

255
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
something different.

256
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?

257
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You don't get more different than that."

258
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the moment, and I mean the moment,

259
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the moment that hit me,

260
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I swear to God,

261
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in.

262
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And nobody can tell me no.

263
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.

264
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?

265
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.

266
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.

267
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.

268
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.

269
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,

270
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand -- I don't know if any of you know it.

271
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch

272
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
going, "I know what I'm going to do.

273
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I know how to be Mowgli.

274
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I'm going to go across India

275
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
on the back of an elephant.

276
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I'm going to be an elephant handler."

277
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And I had no idea

278
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
how I was going to be an elephant handler.

279
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
From global management consultant to elephant handler.

280
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.

281
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.

282
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But I knew I would.

283
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,

284
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
God, that universe makes it happen for you.

285
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Nine months later, after that day on snot rock,

286
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I had the only blind date in my life

287
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.

288
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers

289
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
across India.

290
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

291
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The most powerful thing of all,

292
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.

293
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.

294
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Because I wasn't believing in me,

295
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
really me, all the bits of me --

296
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
all the bits of all of us.

297
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?

298
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,

299
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
it's extraordinary what happens.

300
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,

301
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.

302
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Six thousand people got to see because of that.

303
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
When I came home off that elephant,

304
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
do you know what the most amazing part was?

305
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I chucked in my job at Accenture.

306
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I left, and I became a social entrepreneur,

307
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,

308
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
which deals with Asian elephant conservation.

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And I set up Kanchi,

310
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,

311
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
because disability is like the elephant in the room.

312
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way --

313
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
no charity, no pity.

314
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But I wanted to work only and truly

315
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
with business and media leadership

316
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to totally reframe disability

317
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in a way that was exciting and possible.

318
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It was extraordinary.

319
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
That's what I wanted to do.

320
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,

321
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
or any of that kind of nothing.

322
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It just seemed that it was possible.

323
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And you know, the oddest part is,

324
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
when I was on my way traveling here to TED,

325
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I'll be honest, I was petrified.

326
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And I speak,

327
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but this is an amazing audience,

328
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and what am I doing here?

329
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But as I was traveling here,

330
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
you'll be very happy to know,

331
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I did use my white symbol stick cane,

332
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
because it's really good to skip queues in the airport.

333
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I got my way here

334
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
being happily proud that I couldn't see.

335
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,

336
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.

337
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Even though I present confident, I was scared.

338
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
He said, "Be you."

339
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And so here I am.

340
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
This is me, all of me.

341
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

342
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And I have learned, you know what,

343
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
cars and motorbikes and elephants,

344
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that's not freedom.

345
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom.

346
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And I never needed eyes to see -- never.

347
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I simply needed vision and belief.

348
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And if you truly believe --

349
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart --

350
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
you can make change happen.

351
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And we need to make it happen,

352
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
because every single one of us --

353
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
woman, man, gay, straight,

354
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
disabled, perfect,

355
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
normal, whatever --

356
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
everyone of us

357
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
must be the very best of ourselves.

358
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I no longer want anybody to be invisible.

359
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We all have to be included.

360
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And stop with the labels, the limiting.

361
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Losing of labels,

362
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
because we are not jam jars.

363
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.

364
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Thank you.

365
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Applause)

Hello everyone.

2
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And this is the piece of paper it will be made from,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
on his custom, five-string electric cello,

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and it's very exciting to listen to him.

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Are you ready to go? OK.

10
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Just to make it a little bit more exciting.

11
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
All right. Take it away, Rufus.

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Music)

13
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
All right. There you go.

14
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

15
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Applause)

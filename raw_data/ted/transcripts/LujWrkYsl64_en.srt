1
0:00:12.937,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The work of a transportation commissioner

2
0:00:15.096,000 --> 0:00:18,000
isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.

3
0:00:18.59,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It involves the design of cities

4
0:00:20.764,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and the design of city streets.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Streets are some of the most valuable resources

6
0:00:26.131,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that a city has, and yet it's an asset

7
0:00:28.909,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that's largely hidden in plain sight.

8
0:00:31.765,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And the lesson from New York

9
0:00:33.346,000 --> 0:00:34,000
over the past six years

10
0:00:35.004,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is that you can update this asset.

11
0:00:37.3,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively,

12
0:00:40.998,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it can provide immediate benefits,

13
0:00:43.736,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and it can be quite popular.

14
0:00:46.337,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You just need to look at them a little differently.

15
0:00:49.829,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This is important because we live in an urban age.

16
0:00:53.577,000 --> 0:00:55,000
For the first time in history,

17
0:00:55.656,000 --> 0:00:57,000
most people live in cities,

18
0:00:58.421,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,

19
0:01:01.984,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the population is going to double on the planet.

20
0:01:04.885,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So the design of cities is a key issue for our future.

21
0:01:09.328,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Mayor Bloomberg recognized this

22
0:01:10.913,000 --> 0:01:13,000
when he launched PlaNYC in 2007.

23
0:01:14.152,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The plan recognized that cities

24
0:01:16.865,000 --> 0:01:18,000
are in a global marketplace,

25
0:01:18.987,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive

26
0:01:21.712,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and to attract the million more people

27
0:01:25.015,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that are expected to move here,

28
0:01:26.615,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we need to focus on the quality of life

29
0:01:29.866,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and the efficiency of our infrastructure.

30
0:01:33.534,000 --> 0:01:34,000
For many cities, our streets have been

31
0:01:35.177,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in a kind of suspended animation for generations.

32
0:01:39.286,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,

33
0:01:42.862,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and despite all of the technological innovation,

34
0:01:46.841,000 --> 0:01:48,000
cultural changes, political changes,

35
0:01:49.29,000 --> 0:01:51,000
this is Times Square in 2008.

36
0:01:51.545,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Not much has changed in those 50 years.

37
0:01:55.918,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda,

38
0:01:58.981,000 --> 0:02:,000
to maximize efficient mobility,

39
0:02:01.596,000 --> 0:02:04,000
providing more room for buses, more room for bikes,

40
0:02:05.177,000 --> 0:02:08,000
more room for people to enjoy the city,

41
0:02:08.236,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and to make our streets as safe as they can be

42
0:02:10.471,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for everybody that uses them.

43
0:02:13.579,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We set out a clear action plan

44
0:02:16.067,000 --> 0:02:18,000
with goals and benchmarks.

45
0:02:18.763,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Having goals is important,

46
0:02:20.981,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because if you want to change and steer the ship

47
0:02:25.102,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of a big city in a new direction,

48
0:02:27.725,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you need to know where you're going and why.

49
0:02:31.921,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The design of a street can tell you everything

50
0:02:34.174,000 --> 0:02:36,000
about what's expected on it.

51
0:02:36.523,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In this case, it's expected that you shelter in place.

52
0:02:40.524,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The design of this street is really

53
0:02:42.461,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to maximize the movement of cars

54
0:02:45.121,000 --> 0:02:46,000
moving as quickly as possible

55
0:02:46.849,000 --> 0:02:47,000
from point A to point B,

56
0:02:48.672,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and it misses all the other ways

57
0:02:50.564,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that a street is used.

58
0:02:52.991,000 --> 0:02:54,000
When we started out, we did some early surveys

59
0:02:55.942,000 --> 0:02:57,000
about how our streets were used,

60
0:02:57.987,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and we found that New York City was largely

61
0:02:59.983,000 --> 0:03:01,000
a city without seats.

62
0:03:02.114,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Pictures like this, people perched

63
0:03:04.498,000 --> 0:03:08,000
on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.

64
0:03:08.671,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:10.959,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's not great for parents with kids.

66
0:03:13.435,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.

67
0:03:16.671,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's probably not good for the fire hydrants.

68
0:03:19.712,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Certainly not good for the police department.

69
0:03:22.764,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So we worked hard to change that balance,

70
0:03:25.773,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and probably the best example of our new approach

71
0:03:29.108,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is in Times Square.

72
0:03:30.743,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day

73
0:03:34.573,000 --> 0:03:35,000
walk through Times Square,

74
0:03:36.283,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and people had tried for years to make changes.

75
0:03:38.773,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They changed signals, they changed lanes,

76
0:03:41.161,000 --> 0:03:43,000
everything they could do to make Times Square work better.

77
0:03:44.064,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It was dangerous, hard to cross the street.

78
0:03:46.986,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It was chaotic.

79
0:03:48.707,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And so, none of those approaches worked,

80
0:03:51.489,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so we took a different approach, a bigger approach,

81
0:03:53.538,000 --> 0:03:54,000
looked at our street differently.

82
0:03:55.207,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And so we did a six-month pilot.

83
0:03:58.78,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street

84
0:04:03.036,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and created two and a half acres

85
0:04:05.57,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of new pedestrian space.

86
0:04:08.346,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And the temporary materials are an important part

87
0:04:11.513,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of the program, because we were able to show

88
0:04:14.938,000 --> 0:04:15,000
how it worked.

89
0:04:16.307,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.

90
0:04:19.286,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So it was all about the data.

91
0:04:21.122,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,

92
0:04:24.295,000 --> 0:04:26,000
if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,

93
0:04:26.648,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,

94
0:04:29.379,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we could put it back the way that it was,

95
0:04:31.269,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because these were temporary materials.

96
0:04:32.53,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And that was a very big part of the buy-in,

97
0:04:35.439,000 --> 0:04:37,000
much less anxiety when you think that something

98
0:04:37.582,000 --> 0:04:38,000
can be put back.

99
0:04:39.453,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But the results were overwhelming.

100
0:04:41.607,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Traffic moved better. It was much safer.

101
0:04:44.527,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Five new flagship stores opened.

102
0:04:46.934,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's been a total home run.

103
0:04:48.807,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Times Square is now one of the top 10

104
0:04:51.39,000 --> 0:04:53,000
retail locations on the planet.

105
0:04:54.021,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And this is an important lesson,

106
0:04:56.455,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game

107
0:04:59.553,000 --> 0:05:03,000
between moving traffic and creating public space.

108
0:05:04.078,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Every project has its surprises,

109
0:05:06.893,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and one of the big surprises with Times Square

110
0:05:09.546,000 --> 0:05:12,000
was how quickly people flocked to the space.

111
0:05:13.226,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We put out the orange barrels,

112
0:05:15.284,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and people just materialized immediately into the street.

113
0:05:18.892,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It was like a Star Trek episode, you know?

114
0:05:20.933,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!

115
0:05:23.262,000 --> 0:05:24,000
All the people arrived.

116
0:05:24.64,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.

117
0:05:27.398,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,

118
0:05:30.542,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because the street furniture had not yet arrived.

119
0:05:34.058,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So we went to a hardware store

120
0:05:36.68,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and bought hundreds of lawn chairs,

121
0:05:39.027,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and we put those lawn chairs out on the street.

122
0:05:42.219,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.

123
0:05:46.115,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars.

124
0:05:48.999,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It was about those lawn chairs.

125
0:05:50.358,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"What did you think about the lawn chairs?"

126
0:05:51.889,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?"

127
0:05:53.566,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So if you've got a big, controversial project,

128
0:05:57.332,000 --> 0:05:58,000
think about lawn chairs.

129
0:05:59.043,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:01.953,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is the final design for Times Square,

131
0:06:04.45,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and it will create a level surface,

132
0:06:06.99,000 --> 0:06:07,000
sidewalk to sidewalk,

133
0:06:08.674,000 --> 0:06:1,000
beautiful pavers that have studs in them

134
0:06:10.902,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to reflect the light from the billboards,

135
0:06:12.94,000 --> 0:06:14,000
creating a great new energy on the street,

136
0:06:15.653,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we think it's going to really create

137
0:06:17.77,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a great place, a new crossroads of the world

138
0:06:19.928,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that is worthy of its name.

139
0:06:21.451,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And we will be cutting the ribbon on this,

140
0:06:22.952,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the first phase, this December.

141
0:06:26.554,000 --> 0:06:28,000
With all of our projects, our public space projects,

142
0:06:29.011,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we work closely with local businesses

143
0:06:31.224,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and local merchant groups

144
0:06:32.755,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who maintain the spaces, move the furniture,

145
0:06:36.071,000 --> 0:06:37,000
take care of the plants.

146
0:06:37.492,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is in front of Macy's, and they were

147
0:06:39.511,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a big supporter of this new approach,

148
0:06:41.625,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because they understood that more people on foot

149
0:06:46.472,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is better for business.

150
0:06:48.453,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And we've done these projects all across the city

151
0:06:51.123,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in all kinds of neighborhoods.

152
0:06:52.735,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,

153
0:06:54.861,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and you can see the short leg that was there,

154
0:06:56.953,000 --> 0:06:58,000
used for cars, that's not really needed.

155
0:06:59.203,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So what we did is we painted over the street,

156
0:07:02.792,000 --> 0:07:05,000
put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle

157
0:07:06.123,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to the storefronts on Grand Avenue,

158
0:07:08.118,000 --> 0:07:09,000
created a great new public space,

159
0:07:10.116,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and it's been great for businesses

160
0:07:12.13,000 --> 0:07:13,000
along Grand Avenue.

161
0:07:13.713,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn,

162
0:07:16.869,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and this is one of our first projects that we did,

163
0:07:19.297,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and we took an underutilized,

164
0:07:21.892,000 --> 0:07:23,000
pretty dingy-looking parking lot

165
0:07:24.573,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and used some paint and planters

166
0:07:27.825,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to transform it over a weekend.

167
0:07:30.711,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And in the three years since we've implemented the project,

168
0:07:33.669,000 --> 0:07:37,000
retail sales have increased 172 percent.

169
0:07:38.423,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood.

170
0:07:43.295,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We've moved very, very quickly

171
0:07:45.444,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with paint and temporary materials.

172
0:07:47.693,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Instead of waiting

173
0:07:48.95,000 --> 0:07:5,000
through years of planning studies

174
0:07:51.773,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and computer models to get something done,

175
0:07:54.151,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we've done it with paint and temporary materials.

176
0:07:56.886,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And the proof is not in a computer model.

177
0:07:59.236,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It is in the real-world performance of the street.

178
0:08:02.201,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You can have fun with paint.

179
0:08:05.197,000 --> 0:08:09,000
All told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas

180
0:08:09.43,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in all five boroughs across the city.

181
0:08:12.205,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes

182
0:08:17.011,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and turned them into new pedestrian space.

183
0:08:21.007,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I think one of the successes is in its emulation.

184
0:08:24.448,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You're seeing this kind of approach,

185
0:08:25.989,000 --> 0:08:26,000
since we've painted Times Square,

186
0:08:27.544,000 --> 0:08:3,000
you've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,

187
0:08:30.574,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in San Francisco, in Mexico City,

188
0:08:33.073,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Buenos Aires, you name it.

189
0:08:34.636,000 --> 0:08:36,000
This is actually in Los Angeles,

190
0:08:36.985,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and they actually copied even the green dots

191
0:08:40.608,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that we had on the streets.

192
0:08:42.633,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But I can't underscore enough

193
0:08:44.743,000 --> 0:08:46,000
how much more quickly this enables you to move

194
0:08:47.32,000 --> 0:08:5,000
over traditional construction methods.

195
0:08:50.442,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We also brought this quick-acting approach

196
0:08:52.602,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to our cycling program,

197
0:08:54.15,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and in six years turned cycling

198
0:08:56.666,000 --> 0:08:59,000
into a real transportation option in New York.

199
0:08:59.905,000 --> 0:09:,000
I think it's fair to say --

200
0:09:01.602,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause) --

201
0:09:06.841,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,

202
0:09:10.305,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and now New York has become

203
0:09:11.863,000 --> 0:09:15,000
one of the cycling capitals in the United States.

204
0:09:15.908,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected

205
0:09:19.904,000 --> 0:09:21,000
network of lanes.

206
0:09:22.339,000 --> 0:09:24,000
You can see the map in 2007.

207
0:09:24.7,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is how it looked in 2013

208
0:09:26.894,000 --> 0:09:3,000
after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.

209
0:09:31.49,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I love this because it looks so easy.

210
0:09:33.507,000 --> 0:09:36,000
You just click it, and they're there.

211
0:09:37.406,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We also brought new designs to the street.

212
0:09:40.417,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We created the first parking-protected bike lane

213
0:09:43.754,000 --> 0:09:44,000
in the United States.

214
0:09:45.326,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

215
0:09:46.853,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We protected bikers by floating parking lanes,

216
0:09:50.124,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and it's been great.

217
0:09:51.637,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Bike volumes have spiked.

218
0:09:53.364,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,

219
0:09:55.998,000 --> 0:09:56,000
are all down 50 percent.

220
0:09:57.789,000 --> 0:10:,000
And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,

221
0:10:01.052,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and now you're seeing them pop up

222
0:10:02.591,000 --> 0:10:03,000
all over the country.

223
0:10:04.46,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And you can see here that this strategy has worked.

224
0:10:07.317,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The blue line is the number of cyclists,

225
0:10:08.969,000 --> 0:10:09,000
soaring.

226
0:10:09.973,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The green line is the number of bike lanes.

227
0:10:11.916,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And the yellow line is the number of injuries,

228
0:10:14.412,000 --> 0:10:16,000
which has remained essentially flat.

229
0:10:16.897,000 --> 0:10:18,000
After this big expansion, you've seen

230
0:10:19.765,000 --> 0:10:2,000
no net increase in injuries,

231
0:10:21.615,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and so there is something to that axiom

232
0:10:24.271,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that there is safety in numbers.

233
0:10:27.518,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Not everybody liked the new bike lanes,

234
0:10:30.65,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and there was a lawsuit and somewhat

235
0:10:32.922,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of a media frenzy a couple years ago.

236
0:10:35.894,000 --> 0:10:37,000
One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane

237
0:10:38.141,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that we have on Prospect Park West

238
0:10:40.595,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"the most contested piece of land

239
0:10:42.483,000 --> 0:10:43,000
outside of the Gaza Strip."

240
0:10:44.455,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

241
0:10:47.834,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And this is what we had done.

242
0:10:49.754,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So if you dig below the headlines, though,

243
0:10:54.76,000 --> 0:10:56,000
you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,

244
0:10:57.653,000 --> 0:10:59,000
far ahead of the politicians.

245
0:10:59.901,000 --> 0:11:01,000
In fact, I think most politicians would be happy

246
0:11:02.089,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to have those kind of poll numbers.

247
0:11:04.24,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes.

248
0:11:07.318,000 --> 0:11:08,000
This summer, we launched Citi Bike,

249
0:11:09.297,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the largest bike share program in the United States,

250
0:11:11.88,000 --> 0:11:12,000
with 6,000 bikes

251
0:11:13.764,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and 330 stations located next to one another.

252
0:11:17.326,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Since we've launched the program,

253
0:11:19.334,000 --> 0:11:2,000
three million trips have been taken.

254
0:11:21.002,000 --> 0:11:23,000
People have ridden seven million miles.

255
0:11:23.771,000 --> 0:11:25,000
That's 280 times around the globe.

256
0:11:26.633,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And so with this little blue key,

257
0:11:28.704,000 --> 0:11:3,000
you can unlock the keys to the city

258
0:11:31.337,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and this brand new transportation option.

259
0:11:33.893,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And daily usage just continues to soar.

260
0:11:36.252,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What has happened is the average daily ridership

261
0:11:38.997,000 --> 0:11:4,000
on the streets of New York is 36,000 people.

262
0:11:41.703,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.

263
0:11:44.735,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.

264
0:11:48.624,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The bikes are being used six times a day.

265
0:11:50.586,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders

266
0:11:53.367,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that are on the streets.

267
0:11:54.722,000 --> 0:11:56,000
In the past, it looked like the guy on the left,

268
0:11:57.096,000 --> 0:12:,000
ninja-clad bike messenger.

269
0:12:00.101,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And today, cyclists look

270
0:12:03.938,000 --> 0:12:05,000
like New York City looks.

271
0:12:06.109,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's diverse -- young, old, black, white,

272
0:12:09.291,000 --> 0:12:12,000
women, kids, all getting on a bike.

273
0:12:12.309,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.

274
0:12:15.326,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Quite radical.

275
0:12:17.416,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We've also brought this approach to our buses,

276
0:12:20.558,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,

277
0:12:23.995,000 --> 0:12:24,000
the slowest bus speeds.

278
0:12:25.436,000 --> 0:12:26,000
As everybody knows,

279
0:12:26.515,000 --> 0:12:28,000
you can walk across town faster

280
0:12:28.917,000 --> 0:12:29,000
than you can take the bus.

281
0:12:30.137,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And so we focused on the most congested areas

282
0:12:32.939,000 --> 0:12:33,000
of New York City,

283
0:12:34.364,000 --> 0:12:36,000
built out six bus rapid transit lines,

284
0:12:37.295,000 --> 0:12:4,000
57 miles of new speedy bus lanes.

285
0:12:40.588,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.

286
0:12:43.318,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out

287
0:12:45.704,000 --> 0:12:47,000
because they get ticketed by a camera

288
0:12:47.83,000 --> 0:12:48,000
if they use that lane,

289
0:12:49.343,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and it's been a huge success.

290
0:12:52.985,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I think one of my very favorite moments

291
0:12:55.025,000 --> 0:12:57,000
as transportation commissioner was the day

292
0:12:57.311,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that we launched Citi Bike,

293
0:12:58.808,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue

294
0:13:01.858,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in my protected bike lane,

295
0:13:03.218,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and I looked over and I saw pedestrians

296
0:13:05.594,000 --> 0:13:07,000
standing safely on the pedestrian islands,

297
0:13:08.222,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and the traffic was flowing,

298
0:13:10.586,000 --> 0:13:11,000
birds were singing --

299
0:13:12.536,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter) --

300
0:13:13.891,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.

301
0:13:16.977,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It was just fantastic.

302
0:13:20.675,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And this is how it looked six years ago.

303
0:13:23.546,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And so, I think that the lesson that we have

304
0:13:26.99,000 --> 0:13:29,000
from New York is that it's possible

305
0:13:30.469,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to change your streets quickly,

306
0:13:33.177,000 --> 0:13:36,000
it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,

307
0:13:37.171,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and it can be quite popular.

308
0:13:39.525,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You just need to reimagine your streets.

309
0:13:42.804,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They're hidden in plain sight.

310
0:13:44.869,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Thank you.

311
0:13:46.267,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Applause)

0:00:13.066,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Twenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web.

2
0:00:18.174,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Since then, the Internet has transformed the way we communicate,

3
0:00:22.083,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the way we do business, and even the way we live.

4
0:00:25.545,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In many ways,

5
0:00:27.717,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the ideas that gave birth to Google, Facebook, Twitter, and so many others,

6
0:00:32.542,000 --> 0:00:34,000
have now really transformed our lives,

7
0:00:35.146,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society.

8
0:00:39.433,000 --> 0:00:41,000
However, there are also some downsides to this.

9
0:00:43.134,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Today, the average person has an astounding amount

10
0:00:45.967,000 --> 0:00:47,000
of personal information online,

11
0:00:48.08,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook,

12
0:00:51.737,000 --> 0:00:53,000
each time we search on Google,

13
0:00:53.939,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and each time we send an email.

14
0:00:56.341,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, many of us probably think,

15
0:00:58.343,000 --> 0:01:01,000
well, one email, there's nothing in there, right?

16
0:01:01.453,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But if you consider a year's worth of emails,

17
0:01:04.659,000 --> 0:01:06,000
or maybe even a lifetime of email,

18
0:01:07.561,000 --> 0:01:09,000
collectively, this tells a lot.

19
0:01:09.907,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It tells where we have been, who we have met,

20
0:01:13.47,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and in many ways, even what we're thinking about.

21
0:01:16.709,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever,

22
0:01:21.086,000 --> 0:01:24,000
so your data can and will outlive you.

23
0:01:24.093,000 --> 0:01:27,000
What has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data

24
0:01:27.622,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and also our privacy.

25
0:01:29.944,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So this year, as the web turns 25,

26
0:01:33.474,000 --> 0:01:35,000
it's very important for us to take a moment

27
0:01:35.772,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and think about the implications of this.

28
0:01:38.304,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We have to really think.

29
0:01:40.006,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We've lost privacy, yes,

30
0:01:41.796,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself.

31
0:01:45.995,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If you think about it,

32
0:01:47.749,000 --> 0:01:51,000
most of us here today probably remember what life was like before the Internet,

33
0:01:51.763,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but today, there's a new generation

34
0:01:54.305,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online,

35
0:01:57.725,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and this is a generation that is not going to remember when data was private.

36
0:02:02.204,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So we keep going down this road, 20 years from now,

37
0:02:05.592,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning

38
0:02:08.688,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from what it means to you and I.

39
0:02:10.973,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So, it's time for us to take a moment and think,

40
0:02:13.413,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is there anything we can do about this?

41
0:02:16.22,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I believe there is.

42
0:02:18.705,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Let's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication

43
0:02:22.266,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in the world today: email.

44
0:02:24.533,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Before the invention of email, we largely communicated using letters,

45
0:02:28.294,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and the process was quite simple.

46
0:02:30.616,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper,

47
0:02:33.728,000 --> 0:02:35,000
then you would place it into a sealed envelope,

48
0:02:36.132,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and from there, you would go ahead and send it

49
0:02:38.387,000 --> 0:02:39,000
after you put a stamp and address on it.

50
0:02:40.345,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Unfortunately, today,

51
0:02:41.825,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when we actually send an email, we're not sending a letter.

52
0:02:44.642,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What you are sending, in many ways, is actually a postcard,

53
0:02:47.417,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it

54
0:02:51.064,000 --> 0:02:54,000
from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient

55
0:02:54.699,000 --> 0:02:56,000
can actually read the entire contents.

56
0:02:57.319,000 --> 0:03:,000
So, the solution to this has been known for some time,

57
0:03:00.778,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and there's many attempts to do it.

58
0:03:02.621,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The most basic solution is to use encryption,

59
0:03:05.77,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and the idea is quite simple.

60
0:03:07.697,000 --> 0:03:08,000
First, you encrypt the connection

61
0:03:09.466,000 --> 0:03:11,000
between your computer and the email server.

62
0:03:12.074,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Then, you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself.

63
0:03:15.7,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But there's a problem with this,

64
0:03:17.646,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and that is, the email servers also hold the encryption keys,

65
0:03:20.595,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it.

66
0:03:24.98,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But not only that, any government could lawfully ask for

67
0:03:28.211,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and get the key to your data,

68
0:03:30.441,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and this is all without you being aware of it.

69
0:03:33.064,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy, in principle:

70
0:03:38.337,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You give everybody their own keys,

71
0:03:40.739,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys.

72
0:03:44.012,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This seems like common sense, right?

73
0:03:46.148,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So the question that comes up is, why hasn't this been done yet?

74
0:03:50.261,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well, if we really think about it,

75
0:03:52.796,000 --> 0:03:54,000
we see that the business model of the Internet today

76
0:03:55.721,000 --> 0:03:57,000
really isn't compatible with privacy.

77
0:03:57.788,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web,

78
0:04:00.574,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and you see that advertising plays a huge role.

79
0:04:03.501,000 --> 0:04:07,000
In fact, this year alone, advertising is 137 billion dollars,

80
0:04:08.329,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and to optimize the ads that are shown to us,

81
0:04:10.5,000 --> 0:04:12,000
companies have to know everything about us.

82
0:04:12.633,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They need to know where we live,

83
0:04:14.552,000 --> 0:04:17,000
how old we are, what we like, what we don't like,

84
0:04:18.207,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and anything else they can get their hands on.

85
0:04:20.369,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And if you think about it,

86
0:04:22.098,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy.

87
0:04:26.246,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy.

88
0:04:29.437,000 --> 0:04:3,000
If we want to have privacy online,

89
0:04:31.252,000 --> 0:04:34,000
what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves.

90
0:04:34.795,000 --> 0:04:36,000
For many years, when it came to email,

91
0:04:37.063,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the only solution was something known as PGP,

92
0:04:39.978,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech-savvy.

93
0:04:43.192,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Here's a diagram that basically shows

94
0:04:45.61,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the process for encrypting and decrypting messages.

95
0:04:48.345,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So needless to say, this is not a solution for everybody,

96
0:04:51.231,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and this actually is part of the problem,

97
0:04:54.363,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because if you think about communication,

98
0:04:56.825,000 --> 0:05:,000
by definition, it involves having someone to communicate with.

99
0:05:01.18,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do,

100
0:05:04.394,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for the people out there who can't understand how to use it,

101
0:05:07.215,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the option to communicate privately simply does not exist.

102
0:05:10.117,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And this is a problem that we need to solve.

103
0:05:13.125,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So if we want to have privacy online,

104
0:05:15.123,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board,

105
0:05:18.442,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry.

106
0:05:21.693,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community.

107
0:05:25.222,000 --> 0:05:29,000
What we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible.

108
0:05:29.285,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So last summer, when the Edward Snowden story came out,

109
0:05:32.281,000 --> 0:05:35,000
several colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen.

110
0:05:35.896,000 --> 0:05:39,000
At that time, we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research

111
0:05:40.883,000 --> 0:05:43,000
at the world's largest particle collider, which collides protons, by the way.

112
0:05:44.614,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We were all scientists, so we used our scientific creativity

113
0:05:48.059,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and came up with a very creative name for our project:

114
0:05:51.293,000 --> 0:05:53,000
ProtonMail. (Laughter)

115
0:05:53.389,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Many startups these days actually begin in people's garages

116
0:05:56.257,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or people's basements.

117
0:05:57.941,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We were a bit different.

118
0:05:59.438,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We started out at the CERN cafeteria,

119
0:06:02.081,000 --> 0:06:04,000
which actually is great, because look,

120
0:06:04.537,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you have all the food and water you could ever want.

121
0:06:07.01,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But even better than this is that every day

122
0:06:09.49,000 --> 0:06:12,000
between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m., free of charge,

123
0:06:13.461,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers,

124
0:06:17.71,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and these guys basically know the answers to everything.

125
0:06:20.496,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So it was in this environment that we began working.

126
0:06:23.283,000 --> 0:06:26,000
What we actually want to do is we want to take your email

127
0:06:26.394,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and turn it into something that looks more like this,

128
0:06:29.854,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but more importantly, we want to do it in a way

129
0:06:32.129,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that you can't even tell that it's happened.

130
0:06:34.274,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So to do this, we actually need a combination of technology

131
0:06:37.261,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and also design.

132
0:06:38.848,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So how do we go about doing something like this?

133
0:06:42.018,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Well, it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server.

134
0:06:46.172,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer,

135
0:06:50.07,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and we don't generate a single key, but actually a pair of keys,

136
0:06:53.858,000 --> 0:06:56,000
so there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key,

137
0:06:57.563,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and these keys are mathematically connected.

138
0:07:00.191,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So let's have a look and see how this works

139
0:07:02.396,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when multiple people communicate.

140
0:07:04.787,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So here we have Bob and Alice, who want to communicate privately.

141
0:07:09.232,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So the key challenge is to take Bob's message

142
0:07:12.794,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.

143
0:07:17.103,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it

144
0:07:19.516,000 --> 0:07:21,000
before it even leaves Bob's computer,

145
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and one of the tricks is, we encrypt it using the public key from Alice.

146
0:07:26.141,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice,

147
0:07:31.333,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key,

148
0:07:35.613,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice,

149
0:07:39.901,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key.

150
0:07:44.616,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So we've now accomplished the objective,

151
0:07:47.284,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which is to get the message from Bob to Alice

152
0:07:49.451,000 --> 0:07:51,000
without the server being able to read what's going on.

153
0:07:52.143,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Actually, what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture.

154
0:07:55.1,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The reality is much more complex

155
0:07:57.105,000 --> 0:08:,000
and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this.

156
0:08:00.819,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And that's actually the key design challenge:

157
0:08:03.259,000 --> 0:08:06,000
How do we take all this complexity, all this software,

158
0:08:06.78,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it.

159
0:08:10.898,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I think with ProtonMail, we have gotten pretty close to doing this.

160
0:08:14.496,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So let's see how it works in practice.

161
0:08:16.958,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Here, we've got Bob and Alice again,

162
0:08:19.975,000 --> 0:08:2,000
who also want to communicate securely.

163
0:08:21.945,000 --> 0:08:23,000
They simply create accounts on ProtonMail,

164
0:08:24.132,000 --> 0:08:26,000
which is quite simple and takes a few moments,

165
0:08:26.542,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and all the key encryption and generation

166
0:08:28.964,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is happening automatically in the background

167
0:08:31.354,000 --> 0:08:32,000
as Bob is creating his account.

168
0:08:33.06,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Once his account is created, he just clicks "compose,"

169
0:08:35.602,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and now he can write his email like he does today.

170
0:08:38.589,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So he fills in his information,

171
0:08:40.456,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and then after that, all he has to do is click "send,"

172
0:08:43.74,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and just like that, without understanding cryptography,

173
0:08:47.281,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and without doing anything different from how he writes email today,

174
0:08:50.834,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Bob has just sent an encrypted message.

175
0:08:53.481,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What we have here is really just the first step,

176
0:08:57.593,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but it shows that with improving technology,

177
0:08:59.89,000 --> 0:09:03,000
privacy doesn't have to be difficult, it doesn't have to be disruptive.

178
0:09:04.065,000 --> 0:09:08,000
If we change the goal from maximizing ad revenue to protecting data,

179
0:09:08.512,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we can actually make it accessible.

180
0:09:11.008,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now, I know a question on everybody's minds is,

181
0:09:13.468,000 --> 0:09:15,000
okay, protecting privacy, this is a great goal,

182
0:09:15.858,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but can you actually do this

183
0:09:18.298,000 --> 0:09:2,000
without the tons of money that advertisements give you?

184
0:09:21.09,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I think the answer is actually yes,

185
0:09:23.476,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because today, we've reached a point

186
0:09:25.706,000 --> 0:09:28,000
where people around the world really understand how important privacy is,

187
0:09:29.652,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and when you have that, anything is possible.

188
0:09:32.625,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Earlier this year,

189
0:09:33.789,000 --> 0:09:36,000
ProtonMail actually had so many users that we ran out of resources,

190
0:09:37.454,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and when this happened, our community of users got together

191
0:09:40.283,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and donated half a million dollars.

192
0:09:42.399,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So this is just an example of what can happen

193
0:09:44.83,000 --> 0:09:46,000
when you bring the community together towards a common goal.

194
0:09:47.643,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We can also leverage the world.

195
0:09:49.449,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Right now,

196
0:09:50.597,000 --> 0:09:53,000
we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail,

197
0:09:54.023,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and these people come from everywhere,

198
0:09:55.832,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and this really shows that privacy

199
0:09:57.464,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is not just an American or a European issue,

200
0:09:59.716,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it's a global issue that impacts all of us.

201
0:10:02.061,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward.

202
0:10:05.521,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So what do we have to do to solve this problem?

203
0:10:08.517,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Well, first of all,

204
0:10:10.514,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we need to support a different business model for the Internet,

205
0:10:13.508,000 --> 0:10:15,000
one that does not rely entirely on advertisements

206
0:10:15.841,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for revenue and for growth.

207
0:10:18.175,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We actually need to build a new Internet

208
0:10:20.684,000 --> 0:10:25,000
where our privacy and our ability to control our data is first and foremost.

209
0:10:26.377,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But even more importantly,

210
0:10:28.122,000 --> 0:10:32,000
we have to build an Internet where privacy is no longer just an option

211
0:10:32.99,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but is also the default.

212
0:10:35.923,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We have done the first step with ProtonMail,

213
0:10:38.493,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but this is really just the first step in a very, very long journey.

214
0:10:42.074,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The good news I can share with you guys today,

215
0:10:44.997,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the exciting news, is that we're not traveling alone.

216
0:10:47.525,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online

217
0:10:50.375,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is really gaining momentum,

218
0:10:51.861,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and today, there are dozens of projects from all around the world

219
0:10:55.455,000 --> 0:10:58,000
who are working together to improve our privacy.

220
0:10:58.966,000 --> 0:11:01,000
These projects protect things from our chat to voice communications,

221
0:11:02.612,000 --> 0:11:04,000
also our file storage, our online search,

222
0:11:05.416,000 --> 0:11:08,000
our online browsing, and many other things.

223
0:11:08.457,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising,

224
0:11:11.986,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but they've found support really from the people,

225
0:11:14.309,000 --> 0:11:17,000
from private individuals like you and I from all over the world.

226
0:11:17.356,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This really matters, because ultimately,

227
0:11:20.473,000 --> 0:11:23,000
privacy depends on each and every one of us,

228
0:11:23.944,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and we have to protect it now because our online data

229
0:11:26.777,000 --> 0:11:28,000
is more than just a collection of ones and zeros.

230
0:11:29.541,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's actually a lot more than that.

231
0:11:31.397,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's our lives, our personal stories,

232
0:11:33.743,000 --> 0:11:35,000
our friends, our families,

233
0:11:36.041,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and in many ways, also our hopes and our aspirations.

234
0:11:39.547,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We need to spend time now to really protect our right

235
0:11:42.651,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to share this only with people that we want to share this with,

236
0:11:45.601,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because without this, we simply can't have a free society.

237
0:11:48.341,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So now's the time for us to collectively stand up and say,

238
0:11:51.194,000 --> 0:11:54,000
yes, we do want to live in a world with online privacy,

239
0:11:54.687,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and yes, we can work together to turn this vision into a reality.

240
0:11:59.215,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Thank you.

241
0:12:01.35,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

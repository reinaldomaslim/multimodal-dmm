1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the future of the world was bleak.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The population explosion was unstoppable.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Global famine was inevitable.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
was going to shorten our lives.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The acid rain was falling on the forests.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The oil was running out,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and a nuclear winter would finish us off.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
None of those things happened,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the average per-capita income

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of the average person on the planet,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in real terms, adjusted for inflation,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
has tripled.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Child mortality is down by two-thirds.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Per-capita food production

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is up by a third.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And all this at a time when the population has doubled.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
How did we achieve that?

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
How did we become

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the only species

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that becomes more prosperous

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as it becomes more populous?

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and the level of the graph

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
represents GDP per capita.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I think to answer that question

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
you need to understand

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
how human beings bring together their brains

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and enable their ideas to combine and recombine,

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to meet and, indeed, to mate.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In other words, you need to understand

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
how ideas have sex.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I want you to imagine

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
how we got from making objects like this

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to making objects like this.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
These are both real objects.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of the kind made by Homo erectus.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The other is obviously a computer mouse.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I've tried to work out which is bigger,

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and it's almost impossible.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The differences are what interest me,

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
for about a million years --

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Homo erectus made the same tool

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
for 30,000 generations.

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Of course there were a few changes,

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
There was no progress, no innovation.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And there's another difference too,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which is the object on the left is made from one substance.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The object on the right is made from

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a confection of different substances,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the idea of transistors.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They've all been combined together in this technology.

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And it's this combination,

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because I think it's the secret to understanding

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
what's happening in the world.

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
My body's an accumulation of ideas too:

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They've come together.

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,

82
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a green one and a red one,

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
then one has to be better than the other.

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
One goes extinct for the other to survive.

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But if you have a sexual species,

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
then it's possible for an individual

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to inherit both mutations

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
from different lineages.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So what sex does is it enables the individual

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to draw upon

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the genetic innovations of the whole species.

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's not confined to its own lineage.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What's the process that's having the same effect

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in cultural evolution

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
as sex is having in biological evolution?

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I think the answer is exchange,

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the habit of exchanging one thing for another.

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's a unique human feature.

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
No other animal does it.

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But the exchange of one object for another never happens.

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You can have culture without exchange.

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You can have, as it were, asexual culture.

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They teach each other traditions

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which are handed down from parent to offspring.

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
how to crack nuts with rocks.

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But the difference is

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that these cultures never expand, never grow,

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
never accumulate, never become combinatorial,

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and the reason is because

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
there is no sex, as it were,

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
there is no exchange of ideas.

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
There's no exchange of ideas between them.

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And why does exchange raise living standards?

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And here is a Stone Age version of his story,

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
although he told it in terms of trade between countries.

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
He doesn't need Adam.

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
He can make his own spears and axes.

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Well no, because if you think about it,

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and then they trade,

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
then they will each have saved an hour of work.

134
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And this is one of the beauties of exchange,

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is it actually creates the momentum

140
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
for more specialization,

141
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That is prosperity, the saving of time

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in satisfying your needs.

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Ask yourself how long you would have to work

146
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to provide for yourself

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.

152
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
How long do you actually have to work

153
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to earn an hour of reading light

154
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
if you're on the average wage in Britain today?

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And the answer is about half a second.

156
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Back in 1950,

157
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage

158
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to acquire that much light.

159
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
since 1950, as it were,

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,

162
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or you can acquire another good or service.

163
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And back in 1880,

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it would have been 15 minutes

165
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to earn that amount of light on the average wage.

166
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Back in 1800,

167
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
you'd have had to work six hours

168
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.

169
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
In other words, the average person on the average wage

170
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
could not afford a candle in 1800.

171
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse,

172
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"

173
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The stone axe was made by someone for himself.

174
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It was self-sufficiency.

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We call that poverty these days.

176
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But the object on the right

177
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
was made for me by other people.

178
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
How many other people?

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
You know, I think it's probably millions.

181
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,

182
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.

184
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They were all working for me,

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to make a mouse for me.

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And that's the way society works.

187
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
That's what we've achieved as a species.

188
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In the old days, if you were rich,

189
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
you literally had people working for you.

190
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.

191
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.

192
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
They made his silly outfits, like this,

193
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

194
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
He had 498 people

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to prepare his dinner every night.

197
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles

198
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and looking at Louis XIV's pictures,

199
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.

200
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants

201
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and shops all over Paris,

202
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal

203
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that's probably got higher quality

204
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
than Louis XIV even had.

205
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.

206
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange

207
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to raise each other's living standards.

208
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.

209
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But there's a big difference,

211
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is that it only happens within the colony.

212
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There's no working for each other across the colonies.

213
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.

214
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.

215
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The queen does it all.

216
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In our species, we don't like doing that.

217
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.

218
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

219
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.

220
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Applause)

221
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So when did this habit start?

222
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?

223
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this

224
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is probably the sexual division of labor.

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But I've got no evidence for that.

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It just looks like the first thing we did

227
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
was work male for female and female for male.

228
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
In all hunter-gatherer societies today,

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
there's a foraging division of labor

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It isn't always quite that simple,

232
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but there's a distinction between

233
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
specialized roles for males and females.

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And the beauty of this system

235
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is that it benefits both sides.

236
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The woman knows

237
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that, in the Hadzas' case here --

238
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat --

239
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.

241
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt

242
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and try and kill a warthog.

243
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging

244
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to get roots.

245
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog

246
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
it's big enough to share some.

247
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And so both sides raise each other's standards of living

248
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
through the sexual division of labor.

249
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible

250
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that Neanderthals didn't do this.

251
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They were a highly cooperative species.

252
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They were a highly intelligent species.

253
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine

254
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in this room today.

255
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
They were imaginative. They buried their dead.

256
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They had language, probably,

257
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,

258
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
which was discovered here in Oxford.

259
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.

260
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.

261
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But there's no evidence

262
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of a sexual division of labor.

263
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.

264
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.

265
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And the other thing there's no evidence for

266
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is exchange between groups,

267
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,

268
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the tools they made,

269
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
are always made from local materials.

270
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
For example, in the Caucasus

271
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.

272
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They're always made from local chert.

273
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In the same valley there are modern human remains

274
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
from about the same date, 30,000 years ago,

275
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and some of those are from local chert,

276
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but more -- but many of them are made

277
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
from obsidian from a long way away.

278
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And when human beings began

279
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
moving objects around like this,

280
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.

281
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Trade is 10 times as old as farming.

282
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.

283
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Exchange between groups has been going on

284
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
for a hundred thousand years.

285
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And the earliest evidence for it crops up

286
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,

287
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
when you see obsidian and jasper and other things

288
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
moving long distances in Ethiopia.

289
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You also see seashells --

290
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
as discovered by a team here in Oxford --

291
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
moving 125 miles inland

292
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
from the Mediterranean in Algeria.

293
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And that's evidence that people

294
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
have started exchanging between groups.

295
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And that will have led to specialization.

296
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
How do you know that long-distance movement

297
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
means trade rather than migration?

298
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,

299
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,

300
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.

301
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They traded them with their neighbors

302
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
for things like stingray barbs,

303
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and the consequence was that stone axes

304
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
ended up over a large part of Australia.

305
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So long-distance movement of tools

306
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is a sign of trade, not migration.

307
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
What happens when you cut people off from exchange,

308
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
from the ability to exchange and specialize?

309
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And the answer is that

310
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
not only do you slow down technological progress,

311
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
you can actually throw it into reverse.

312
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
An example is Tasmania.

313
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,

314
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the people on it not only experienced

315
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
slower progress than people on the mainland,

316
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
they actually experienced regress.

317
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
They gave up the ability to make stone tools

318
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and fishing equipment and clothing

319
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because the population of about 4,000 people

320
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
was simply not large enough

321
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to maintain the specialized skills

322
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
necessary to keep the technology they had.

323
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.

324
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
How many of the things in our pockets

325
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
could we continue to make after 10,000 years?

326
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego --

327
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
similar island, similar people.

328
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The reason: because Tierra del Fuego

329
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is separated from South America by a much narrower straight,

330
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and there was trading contact across that straight

331
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
throughout 10,000 years.

332
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The Tasmanians were isolated.

333
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Go back to this image again

334
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,

335
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but who knew how to make it.

336
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.

337
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But who knows how to make a computer mouse?

338
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Nobody, literally nobody.

339
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.

340
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I mean this quite seriously.

341
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.

342
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
He just knows how to run a company.

343
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The person on the assembly line doesn't know

344
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well

345
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.

346
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.

347
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I am of course quoting from a famous essay

348
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,

349
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
called "I, Pencil"

350
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,

351
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,

352
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,

353
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.

354
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And what we've done in human society,

355
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
through exchange and specialization,

356
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is we've created

357
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
the ability to do things that we don't even understand.

358
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
It's not the same with language.

359
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
With language we have to transfer ideas

360
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that we understand with each other.

361
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But with technology,

362
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.

363
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind

364
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to an extraordinary degree.

365
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And by the way,

366
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested

367
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in the debate about I.Q.,

368
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.

369
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It's completely irrelevant.

370
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
What's relevant to a society

371
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is how well people are communicating their ideas,

372
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and how well they're cooperating,

373
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
not how clever the individuals are.

374
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So we've created something called the collective brain.

375
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We're just the nodes in the network.

376
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We're the neurons in this brain.

377
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
It's the interchange of ideas,

378
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
the meeting and mating of ideas between them,

379
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
that is causing technological progress,

380
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
incrementally, bit by bit.

381
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
However, bad things happen.

382
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And in the future, as we go forward,

383
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
we will, of course, experience terrible things.

384
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
There will be wars; there will be depressions;

385
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
there will be natural disasters.

386
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.

387
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,

388
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and the ability of ideas

389
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
to meet and to mate

390
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
as never before,

391
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I'm also sure

392
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that technology will advance,

393
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and therefore living standards will advance.

394
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Because through the cloud,

395
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
through crowd sourcing,

396
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
through the bottom-up world that we've created,

397
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
where not just the elites but everybody

398
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
is able to have their ideas

399
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and make them meet and mate,

400
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.

401
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you.

402
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Applause)

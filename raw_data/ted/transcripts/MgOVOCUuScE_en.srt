2
0:00:12.928,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Everything is interconnected.

3
0:00:16.012,000 --> 0:00:19,000
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.

4
0:00:19.538,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We are a small fishing tribe

5
0:00:21.561,000 --> 0:00:24,000
situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island

6
0:00:24.745,000 --> 0:00:27,000
near the town of Southampton in New York.

7
0:00:27.91,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When I was a little girl,

8
0:00:30.38,000 --> 0:00:35,000
my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.

9
0:00:35.728,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There were no clouds in the sky.

10
0:00:39.282,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And after a while I began to perspire.

11
0:00:42.453,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said,

12
0:00:45.979,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Look, do you see that?

13
0:00:48.827,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That's part of you up there.

14
0:00:50.946,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That's your water that helps to make the cloud

15
0:00:53.861,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that becomes the rain that feeds the plants

16
0:00:58.134,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that feeds the animals."

17
0:01:01.92,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In my continued exploration of subjects in nature

18
0:01:04.912,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,

19
0:01:09.328,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I started storm chasing in 2008

20
0:01:12.029,000 --> 0:01:15,000
after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."

21
0:01:15.897,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And so three days later, driving very fast,

22
0:01:22.108,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,

23
0:01:29.368,000 --> 0:01:33,000
capable of producing grapefruit-size hail

24
0:01:33.819,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and spectacular tornadoes,

25
0:01:35.812,000 --> 0:01:41,000
although only two percent actually do.

26
0:01:42.118,000 --> 0:01:47,000
These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide

27
0:01:47.262,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.

28
0:01:51.328,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They can grow so big, blocking all daylight,

29
0:01:53.702,000 --> 0:01:58,000
making it very dark and ominous standing under them.

30
0:01:58.826,000 --> 0:02:,000
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.

31
0:02:01.728,000 --> 0:02:05,000
There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back

32
0:02:05.995,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.

33
0:02:12.697,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And then there are the colors in the clouds

34
0:02:16.094,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.

35
0:02:21.284,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I've learned to respect the lightning.

36
0:02:24.562,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My hair used to be straight.

37
0:02:26.696,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:28.12,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I'm just kidding.

39
0:02:29.744,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:31.886,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What really excites me about these storms

41
0:02:35.062,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,

42
0:02:39.279,000 --> 0:02:43,000
with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.

43
0:02:43.297,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They become lovely monsters.

44
0:02:46.029,000 --> 0:02:48,000
When I'm photographing them,

45
0:02:48.562,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.

46
0:02:52.295,000 --> 0:02:53,000
As I stand under them,

47
0:02:54.287,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I see not just a cloud,

48
0:02:56.494,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but understand that what I have the privilege to witness

49
0:02:59.377,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version

50
0:03:03.827,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun

51
0:03:10.145,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and even this very planet.

52
0:03:14.703,000 --> 0:03:16,000
All my relations. Thank you.

53
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Applause)

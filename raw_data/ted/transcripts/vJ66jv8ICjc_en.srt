2
0:00:15.92,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor,

3
0:00:20.041,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and you may think that sculptors,

4
0:00:22.096,000 --> 0:00:27,000
well, they deal with meta, they deal with objects,

5
0:00:27.385,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they deal with bodies,

6
0:00:30.343,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but I think, really, what I care about most

7
0:00:34.886,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is making space, and that's what I've called this talk:

8
0:00:38.934,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Making Space.

9
0:00:41.541,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Space that exists within us,

10
0:00:45.949,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and without us.

11
0:00:48.018,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So, when I was a child,

12
0:00:52.187,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s,

13
0:00:54.198,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest. (Laughter)

14
0:00:59.61,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know,

15
0:01:02.957,000 --> 0:01:05,000
you're six, and you want to go and climb a tree.

16
0:01:06.037,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But I had to go upstairs, this tiny little room

17
0:01:07.926,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that was actually made out of an old balcony,

18
0:01:09.701,000 --> 0:01:14,000
so it was incredibly hot, small and light,

19
0:01:14.856,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I had to lie there. It was ridiculous.

20
0:01:18.271,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But anyway, for some reason, I promised myself

21
0:01:20.879,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that I wasn't going to move,

22
0:01:23.132,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that I was going to do this thing that Mummy

23
0:01:25.069,000 --> 0:01:26,000
wanted me to do.

24
0:01:26.996,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And there I was, lying there in this tiny space,

25
0:01:30.669,000 --> 0:01:36,000
hot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox-sized, behind my eyes,

26
0:01:37.059,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but it was really weird, like, after this went on

27
0:01:41.124,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger

28
0:01:47.837,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and darker and cooler

29
0:01:51.501,000 --> 0:01:55,000
until I really looked forward to that half an hour

30
0:01:56.371,000 --> 0:02:,000
of enforced immobility and rest,

31
0:02:00.478,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I really looked forward to going to that place

32
0:02:05.132,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of darkness.

33
0:02:07.694,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Do you mind if we do something completely different?

34
0:02:10.15,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Can we all just close our eyes for a minute?

35
0:02:12.186,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, this isn't going to be freaky.

36
0:02:13.834,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It isn't some cultic thing. (Laughter)

37
0:02:15.456,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's just, it's just, I just would like us all to go there.

38
0:02:18.704,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together.

39
0:02:20.852,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So close your eyes for a minute.

40
0:02:24.687,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Here we are, in a space,

41
0:02:27.797,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.

42
0:02:35.269,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I think of this as the place of imagination,

43
0:02:39.324,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of potential,

44
0:02:42.624,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but what are its qualities?

45
0:02:45.524,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It is objectless. There are no things in it.

46
0:02:50.821,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It is dimensionless. It is limitless.

47
0:02:56.772,000 --> 0:03:,000
It is endless.

48
0:03:01.362,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Okay, open your eyes.

49
0:03:03.908,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That's the space that I think sculpture --

50
0:03:08.117,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which is a bit of a paradox, sculpture that is about

51
0:03:11.185,000 --> 0:03:14,000
making material propositions --

52
0:03:14.529,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but I think that's the space

53
0:03:16.65,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that sculpture can connect us with.

54
0:03:21.318,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So, imagine we're in the middle of America.

55
0:03:25.503,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You're asleep. You wake up,

56
0:03:28.375,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and without lifting your head from the earth

57
0:03:31.722,000 --> 0:03:36,000
on your sleeping bag, you can see for 70 miles.

58
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is a dry lake bed.

59
0:03:40.411,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I was young. I'd just finished art school.

60
0:03:44.653,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I wanted to do something that was working

61
0:03:46.825,000 --> 0:03:51,000
directly with the world, directly with place.

62
0:03:51.977,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This was a wonderful place, because it was a place

63
0:03:55.04,000 --> 0:03:57,000
where you could imagine that you were the

64
0:03:57.257,000 --> 0:03:59,000
first person to be there.

65
0:03:59.591,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It was a place where nothing very much had happened.

66
0:04:04.5,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Anyway, bear with me.

67
0:04:07.745,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I picked up a hand-sized stone,

68
0:04:11.53,000 --> 0:04:13,000
threw it as far as I was able,

69
0:04:13.623,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it was about 22 meters.

70
0:04:15.694,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I then cleared all the stones within that radius

71
0:04:22.032,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and made a pile.

72
0:04:25.834,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And that was the pile, by the way.

73
0:04:28.238,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And then, I stood on the pile,

74
0:04:31.735,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and threw all of those rocks out again,

75
0:04:35.604,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and here is rearranged desert.

76
0:04:40.822,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You could say, well, it doesn't look very different

77
0:04:42.8,000 --> 0:04:44,000
from when he started.

78
0:04:44.919,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:46.122,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What's all the fuss about?

80
0:04:47.756,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In fact, Chris was worried and said,

81
0:04:49.124,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"Look, don't show them that slide,

82
0:04:50.518,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because they're just going to think you're another one of

83
0:04:52.477,000 --> 0:04:54,000
those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.

84
0:04:55.143,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:57.513,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But the fact is, this is evidence

86
0:05:04.222,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of a living body on other bodies,

87
0:05:07.757,000 --> 0:05:12,000
rocks that have been the subject of geological formation,

88
0:05:13.596,000 --> 0:05:18,000
erosion, the action of time on objects.

89
0:05:18.61,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This is a place, in a way, that I just

90
0:05:21.132,000 --> 0:05:24,000
would like you to, in a way, look at differently

91
0:05:24.613,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because of this event that has happened in it,

92
0:05:28.284,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a human event,

93
0:05:30.339,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and in general, it just asks us to look again

94
0:05:33.891,000 --> 0:05:35,000
at this world, so different from, in a way,

95
0:05:36.45,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the world that we have been sharing with each other,

96
0:05:39.721,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the technological world,

97
0:05:42.147,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to look again at the elemental world.

98
0:05:46.841,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The elemental world that we all live in is that space

99
0:05:52.55,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that we all visited together, the darkness of the body.

100
0:05:56.938,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I wanted to start again with that environment,

101
0:06:00.603,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the environment of the intimate, subjective space

102
0:06:04.273,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that each of us lives in, but from the other side

103
0:06:08.099,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of appearance.

104
0:06:10.707,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So here is a daily activity of the studio.

105
0:06:13.131,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there,

106
0:06:16.77,000 --> 0:06:18,000
again with my eyes closed, and other people

107
0:06:19.497,000 --> 0:06:23,000
are molding me, evidential.

108
0:06:24.024,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This is an indexical register of a lived moment

109
0:06:27.672,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of a body in time.

110
0:06:30.855,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Can we map that space, using the language of neutrinos

111
0:06:36.578,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or cosmic rays, taking the bounding condition of the body

112
0:06:41.364,000 --> 0:06:46,000
as its limit, but in complete reversal of, in a way,

113
0:06:46.839,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the most traditional Greek idea of pointing?

114
0:06:49.462,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble

115
0:06:53.25,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin,

116
0:06:57.908,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the appearance,

117
0:06:59.36,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what Aristotle defined as the distinction

118
0:07:02.621,000 --> 0:07:04,000
between substance and appearance,

119
0:07:04.644,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the thing that makes things visible,

120
0:07:07.711,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but here we're working from the other side.

121
0:07:10.766,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane?

122
0:07:14.811,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is a lead case made around the space

123
0:07:20.769,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that my body occupied, but it's now void.

124
0:07:24.234,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This is a work called "Learning To See."

125
0:07:28.108,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's a bit of, well, we could call it night,

126
0:07:34.392,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we could call it the 96 percent of gravity

127
0:07:38.842,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that we don't know about, dark matter,

128
0:07:42.403,000 --> 0:07:45,000
placed in space, anyway, another version of a human space

129
0:07:45.948,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in space at large, but I don't know if you can see,

130
0:07:48.861,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the eyes are indicated, they're closed.

131
0:07:54.93,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's called "Learning To See" because it's about an object

132
0:07:58.393,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that

133
0:08:02.725,000 --> 0:08:05,000
vision or connection with the darkness of the body

134
0:08:06.544,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that I see as a space of potential.

135
0:08:11.517,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Can we do it another way, using the language

136
0:08:14.592,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of particles around a nucleus, and talk about the body

137
0:08:17.778,000 --> 0:08:18,000
as an energy center?

138
0:08:19.708,000 --> 0:08:22,000
No longer about statues, no longer having to take that

139
0:08:22.766,000 --> 0:08:25,000
duty of standing, the standing of a human body,

140
0:08:25.827,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or the standing of a statue, release it,

141
0:08:29.157,000 --> 0:08:33,000
allow it to be an energy field, a space in space

142
0:08:33.415,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that talks about human life, between becoming an entropy

143
0:08:40.236,000 --> 0:08:44,000
as a sort of concentration of attention,

144
0:08:44.98,000 --> 0:08:49,000
a human place of possibility in space at large.

145
0:08:50.049,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Is there another way?

146
0:08:53.825,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Dark matter now placed against a horizon.

147
0:08:59.924,000 --> 0:09:03,000
If minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes,

148
0:09:03.959,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and then in rooms, and then in buildings,

149
0:09:07.089,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then in cities, do they also have a final skin,

150
0:09:12.791,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and is that skin perceptual?

151
0:09:15.424,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The horizon.

152
0:09:18.046,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And is art about

153
0:09:20.547,000 --> 0:09:25,000
trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon?

154
0:09:26.491,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Can we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst

155
0:09:35.112,000 --> 0:09:39,000
for a kind of empathy with the experience

156
0:09:39.863,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here

157
0:09:45.211,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in front of you trying to feel and make a connection

158
0:09:50.605,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in this space-time that we are sharing,

159
0:09:53.911,000 --> 0:09:56,000
can we use, at it were, the memory of a body,

160
0:09:57.467,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of a human space in space to catalyze

161
0:10:00.291,000 --> 0:10:03,000
an experience, again, firsthand experience,

162
0:10:04.014,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of elemental time.

163
0:10:07.021,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Human time, industrial time, tested against

164
0:10:11.545,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the time of the tides, in which these memories

165
0:10:14.541,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of a particular body, that could be any body,

166
0:10:19.5,000 --> 0:10:23,000
multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction,

167
0:10:24.39,000 --> 0:10:28,000
many times, placed over three square miles,

168
0:10:28.775,000 --> 0:10:31,000
a mile out to sea,

169
0:10:32.429,000 --> 0:10:36,000
disappearing, in different conditions of day and night.

170
0:10:36.784,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey,

171
0:10:40.053,000 --> 0:10:43,000
just outside Liverpool.

172
0:10:43.21,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like

173
0:10:46.675,000 --> 0:10:48,000
on a typical afternoon.

174
0:10:49.501,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The pieces appear and disappear,

175
0:10:52.203,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but maybe more importantly --

176
0:10:54.266,000 --> 0:10:57,000
this is just looking north from the center of the installation --

177
0:10:58.199,000 --> 0:11:02,000
they create a field, a field that involves

178
0:11:02.536,000 --> 0:11:07,000
living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation,

179
0:11:08.298,000 --> 0:11:12,000
a relation with each other and a relation with that limit,

180
0:11:13.259,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the edge, the horizon.

181
0:11:17.005,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Just moving on, is it possible,

182
0:11:19.507,000 --> 0:11:23,000
taking that idea of mind, body, body-building,

183
0:11:24.19,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to supplant the first body,

184
0:11:27.595,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the biological body, with the second,

185
0:11:29.575,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the body of architecture and the built environment.

186
0:11:32.493,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is a work called "Room for the Great Australian Desert."

187
0:11:37.084,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's in an undefined location

188
0:11:38.702,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and I've never published where it is.

189
0:11:41.783,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It's an object for the mind.

190
0:11:43.673,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I think of it as a 21st-century Buddha.

191
0:11:47.094,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Again, the darkness of the body,

192
0:11:49.024,000 --> 0:11:52,000
now held within this bunker shape

193
0:11:52.087,000 --> 0:11:55,000
of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy,

194
0:11:55.571,000 --> 0:11:57,000
a crouching body.

195
0:11:57.687,000 --> 0:11:59,000
There's a hole at the anus, penis level.

196
0:12:00.674,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes.

197
0:12:03.411,000 --> 0:12:07,000
There's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick,

198
0:12:07.665,000 --> 0:12:09,000
concrete with a void interior.

199
0:12:10.004,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Again, a site found with a completely flat

200
0:12:14.187,000 --> 0:12:18,000
360-degree horizon.

201
0:12:18.883,000 --> 0:12:22,000
This is just simply asking, again,

202
0:12:23.207,000 --> 0:12:27,000
as if we had arrived for the first time,

203
0:12:27.795,000 --> 0:12:31,000
what is the relationship of the human project

204
0:12:31.931,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to time and space?

205
0:12:36.044,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Taking that idiom of, as it were,

206
0:12:39.617,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the darkness of the body transferred to architecture,

207
0:12:44.61,000 --> 0:12:47,000
can you use architectural space not for living

208
0:12:48.185,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but as a metaphor,

209
0:12:49.898,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and use its systolic, diastolic

210
0:12:53.675,000 --> 0:12:57,000
smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of

211
0:12:58.494,000 --> 0:13:03,000
firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space,

212
0:13:04.166,000 --> 0:13:07,000
light and darkness?

213
0:13:07.462,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This is a work of some proportion and some weight

214
0:13:12.984,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells

215
0:13:17.87,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that are all interconnected

216
0:13:20.282,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and that allow certain visual access

217
0:13:25.114,000 --> 0:13:27,000
at certain places.

218
0:13:27.913,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The last work that I just wanted to share with you

219
0:13:34.616,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is "Blind Light," which is perhaps

220
0:13:38.418,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the most open work,

221
0:13:41.678,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and in a conference of radical openness,

222
0:13:43.813,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I think maybe this is as radical as I get,

223
0:13:47.821,000 --> 0:13:51,000
using light and water vapor as my materials.

224
0:13:52.084,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Here is a box

225
0:13:54.47,000 --> 0:13:57,000
filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure,

226
0:13:58.012,000 --> 0:14:02,000
with a cloud and with very bright light.

227
0:14:02.051,000 --> 0:14:05,000
As you walk towards the ever-open threshold,

228
0:14:05.472,000 --> 0:14:12,000
you disappear, both to yourselves and to others.

229
0:14:13.384,000 --> 0:14:15,000
If you hold your hand out in front of you,

230
0:14:15.54,000 --> 0:14:16,000
you can't see it.

231
0:14:17.394,000 --> 0:14:2,000
If you look down, you can't see your feet.

232
0:14:20.66,000 --> 0:14:27,000
You are now consciousness without an object,

233
0:14:27.662,000 --> 0:14:3,000
freed from the dimensionful

234
0:14:31.555,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and measured way in which life links us

235
0:14:37.441,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to the obligatory.

236
0:14:40.531,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But this is a space that is actually filled with people,

237
0:14:45.508,000 --> 0:14:46,000
disembodied voices,

238
0:14:47.478,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and out of that ambient environment,

239
0:14:51.592,000 --> 0:14:54,000
when people come close to your own body zone,

240
0:14:55.522,000 --> 0:14:59,000
very close, they appear to you as representations.

241
0:14:59.585,000 --> 0:15:01,000
When they appear close to the edge,

242
0:15:01.805,000 --> 0:15:05,000
they are representations, representations in which

243
0:15:06.389,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the viewers have become the viewed.

244
0:15:10.257,000 --> 0:15:15,000
For me, art is not about objects of high monetary exchange.

245
0:15:16.108,000 --> 0:15:21,000
It's about reasserting our firsthand experience

246
0:15:21.513,000 --> 0:15:23,000
in present time.

247
0:15:24.404,000 --> 0:15:27,000
As John Cage said,

248
0:15:27.845,000 --> 0:15:32,000
"We are not moving towards some kind of goal.

249
0:15:32.932,000 --> 0:15:36,000
We are at the goal, and it is changing with us.

250
0:15:37.613,000 --> 0:15:43,000
If art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact."

251
0:15:44.049,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Thank you very much.

252
0:15:46.086,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

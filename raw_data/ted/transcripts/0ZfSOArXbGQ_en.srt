0:00:12.631,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Why do people deliberately destroy cultural heritage?

3
0:00:18.209,000 --> 0:00:19,000
By doing so,

4
0:00:19.545,000 --> 0:00:22,000
do they believe they're erasing our history?

5
0:00:23.163,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Our cultural memory?

6
0:00:26.39,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion

7
0:00:31.091,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and natural disasters,

8
0:00:32.924,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid.

9
0:00:36.696,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm here to show you today how we can use pictures --

10
0:00:40.826,000 --> 0:00:41,000
your pictures --

11
0:00:42.708,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to reclaim the history that is being lost

12
0:00:45.852,000 --> 0:00:47,000
using innovative technology

13
0:00:48.099,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the effort of volunteers.

14
0:00:52.002,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In the early 20th century,

15
0:00:54.047,000 --> 0:00:57,000
archaeologists discovered hundreds of statues and artifacts

16
0:00:58.059,000 --> 0:00:59,000
at the ancient city of Hatra,

17
0:00:59.817,000 --> 0:01:,000
in northern Iraq.

18
0:01:01.796,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Statues like this one were found in fragments,

19
0:01:05.601,000 --> 0:01:08,000
some of them missing their heads or arms,

20
0:01:08.762,000 --> 0:01:1,000
yet the clothing that they are wearing

21
0:01:11.299,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and their pose

22
0:01:12.769,000 --> 0:01:14,000
can still tell us their story.

23
0:01:16.059,000 --> 0:01:17,000
For example,

24
0:01:17.233,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we believe that by wearing a knee-length tunic

25
0:01:20.991,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and open bare feet,

26
0:01:22.515,000 --> 0:01:24,000
this was representative of a priest.

27
0:01:25.782,000 --> 0:01:28,000
However, with a closer look at this particular piece,

28
0:01:29.627,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we can see that this tunic being worn was elaborately decorated,

29
0:01:34.073,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which has led many researchers to believe

30
0:01:36.919,000 --> 0:01:39,000
this was actually a statue of a king performing his religious functions.

31
0:01:42.946,000 --> 0:01:48,000
When the Mosul Cultural Museum opened in 1952 in northern Iraq,

32
0:01:49.041,000 --> 0:01:51,000
this statue, as well as others,

33
0:01:51.312,000 --> 0:01:54,000
were placed there to preserve them for future generations.

34
0:01:56.085,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003,

35
0:02:00.048,000 --> 0:02:03,000
a few statues and artifacts were relocated to Baghdad,

36
0:02:03.937,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but this statue remained.

37
0:02:07.266,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Then in February of last year, a video was released,

38
0:02:11.05,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and it instantly went viral.

39
0:02:13.895,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Maybe some of you remember seeing it.

40
0:02:16.19,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Here's a short clip.

41
0:02:17.747,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Video) (Singing in Arabic)

42
0:02:43.393,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Singing ends)

43
0:02:45.927,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Not a very pleasant sight, right?

44
0:02:49.499,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Did you notice anything familiar in the video?

45
0:02:53.372,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There it is.

46
0:02:54.899,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There is that very statue,

47
0:02:57.595,000 --> 0:02:58,000
as it was toppled over,

48
0:02:59.362,000 --> 0:03:,000
breaking into pieces.

49
0:03:01.796,000 --> 0:03:03,000
When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video,

50
0:03:04.681,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we were shocked.

51
0:03:06.879,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Since we are archaeologists using innovative technology

52
0:03:10.331,000 --> 0:03:11,000
for digital preservation,

53
0:03:12.145,000 --> 0:03:13,000
an idea sprung to mind.

54
0:03:14.322,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Maybe we can crowdsource the images that were taken of these artifacts

55
0:03:19.159,000 --> 0:03:2,000
before they were destroyed,

56
0:03:20.998,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to create digital reconstructions.

57
0:03:23.585,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If we can do that,

58
0:03:24.759,000 --> 0:03:26,000
maybe we can put them into a virtual museum

59
0:03:26.874,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to tell that story.

60
0:03:31.85,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so two weeks after we saw this video,

61
0:03:35.378,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we started the project called Project Mosul.

62
0:03:40.148,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Remember the pictures of the statue I showed you before?

63
0:03:43.291,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This is actually the crowdsourced reconstruction of it

64
0:03:47.692,000 --> 0:03:48,000
before it was destroyed.

65
0:03:50.596,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, many of you may be wondering,

66
0:03:52.743,000 --> 0:03:53,000
how exactly does this work?

67
0:03:54.786,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Well, the key to this technology is called photogrammetry,

68
0:03:58.185,000 --> 0:04:,000
and it was invented here, in Germany.

69
0:04:01.71,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It is the technology that allows us to use two-dimensional images

70
0:04:05.14,000 --> 0:04:07,000
taken of the same object from different angles

71
0:04:08.113,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to create a 3D model.

72
0:04:11.089,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I know you may be thinking this sounds like magic -- but it's not.

73
0:04:15.312,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Let me show you how it works.

74
0:04:16.867,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Here are two crowdsourced images of the same statue.

75
0:04:20.748,000 --> 0:04:21,000
What the computer can do

76
0:04:22.167,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is it can detect similar features between the photographs --

77
0:04:26.406,000 --> 0:04:28,000
similar features of the object.

78
0:04:29.389,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Then, by using multiple photos,

79
0:04:32.389,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in this case, it can begin to reconstruct the object in 3D.

80
0:04:36.635,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In this case,

81
0:04:37.809,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you have the position of the cameras when each image was taken,

82
0:04:41.265,000 --> 0:04:42,000
shown in blue.

83
0:04:44.102,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, this is a partial reconstruction, I admit,

84
0:04:47.54,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but why would I say partial?

85
0:04:49.437,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Well, simply because the statue was positioned against a wall.

86
0:04:54.691,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We don't have photographs taken of it from the back.

87
0:04:58.159,000 --> 0:05:02,000
If I wanted to complete a full digital reconstruction of this statue,

88
0:05:03.135,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I would need a proper camera,

89
0:05:04.868,000 --> 0:05:05,000
tripods, proper lighting,

90
0:05:06.637,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but we simply can't do that with crowdsourced images.

91
0:05:09.969,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Think about it:

92
0:05:11.143,000 --> 0:05:13,000
How many of you, when you visit a museum,

93
0:05:13.4,000 --> 0:05:15,000
take photographs of all parts of the statue,

94
0:05:15.665,000 --> 0:05:16,000
even the back side of it?

95
0:05:18.226,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Well, maybe if some of you find Michelangelo's David interesting,

96
0:05:21.847,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I guess --

97
0:05:23.022,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:24.988,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But the thing is,

99
0:05:26.501,000 --> 0:05:29,000
if we can find more images of this object,

100
0:05:29.665,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we can improve the 3D model.

101
0:05:32.953,000 --> 0:05:34,000
When we started the project,

102
0:05:35.151,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we started it with the Mosul Museum in mind.

103
0:05:37.324,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We figured we may get a few images,

104
0:05:39.015,000 --> 0:05:4,000
some people interested,

105
0:05:40.285,000 --> 0:05:42,000
make one or two virtual reconstructions,

106
0:05:42.788,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but we had no idea that we had sparked something that would grow so quickly.

107
0:05:48.096,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Before we knew it,

108
0:05:49.673,000 --> 0:05:51,000
we realized it was obvious:

109
0:05:51.728,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we could apply this same idea to lost heritage anywhere.

110
0:05:56.379,000 --> 0:06:,000
And so, we decided to change the name of the project to Rekrei.

111
0:06:01.827,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Then, in the summer of last year,

112
0:06:04.371,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"The Economist" magazine's media lab reached out to us.

113
0:06:08.493,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They asked us,

114
0:06:09.691,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"Hey, would you like us to build a virtual museum

115
0:06:12.482,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to put the reconstructions back inside,

116
0:06:14.371,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to tell the story?"

117
0:06:16.018,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Can you imagine us saying no?

118
0:06:17.812,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Of course not.

119
0:06:19.137,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We said yes!

120
0:06:20.312,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We were so excited.

121
0:06:21.493,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This was exactly the initial dream of that project.

122
0:06:25.482,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so now,

123
0:06:26.693,000 --> 0:06:29,000
any of you can experience RecoVR Mosul on your phone,

124
0:06:30.331,000 --> 0:06:31,000
using Google Cardboard

125
0:06:31.648,000 --> 0:06:33,000
or a tablet or even YouTube 360.

126
0:06:34.864,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Here is a screenshot from the virtual museum.

127
0:06:38.344,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And there it is ...

128
0:06:40.131,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the partial reconstruction of the statue,

129
0:06:42.653,000 --> 0:06:44,000
as well as the Lion of Mosul,

130
0:06:45.544,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the first reconstruction completed by our project.

131
0:06:49.359,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Although the video doesn't explicitly show the Lion of Mosul being destroyed,

132
0:06:54.173,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we have many other examples of large artifacts being destroyed

133
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that were simply too large to have been stolen.

134
0:07:01.992,000 --> 0:07:02,000
For example,

135
0:07:03.379,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.

136
0:07:06.477,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is a digital reconstruction from before,

137
0:07:09.36,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and this is actually during the destruction.

138
0:07:13.226,000 --> 0:07:16,000

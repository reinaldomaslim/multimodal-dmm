1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Mountain biking in Israel

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is something that I do with great passion

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and commitment.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And when I'm on my bike,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I feel that I connect

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with the profound beauty of Israel,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I feel that I'm united

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with this country's history

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and biblical law.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And also, for me,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
biking is a matter of empowerment.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When I reach the summit

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I feel young,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
invincible, eternal.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
or with some energy

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
far greater than myself.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You can see my fellow riders

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
at the end of the picture,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
looking at me with some concern.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And here is another picture of them.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
neither can I disclose their true names,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and that's because my fellow riders

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
are juvenile inmates,

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
offenders

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
spending time in a correction facility

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
about 20 minutes' ride from here --

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
well, like everything in Israel.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I've been riding with these kids once a week,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and by now, they've become a very big part of my life.

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This story began four years ago.

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The correction facility where they are locked up

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
happens to be right in the middle

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of one of my usual trips,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and it's surrounded by barbed wires

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and electric gates and armed guards.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So on one of these rides,

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I talked my way into the compound

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and went to see the warden.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I told the warden

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and that basically I wanted to take the kids

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
from here to there.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I told him, "Let's find a way

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to ride with in the summer in the country."

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the warden was quite amused,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and he told me he thought that I was a nut

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and he told me,

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They are supposed to be locked up.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They aren't supposed to be out at large."

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And yet, we began to talk about it,

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and one thing led to another.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I can't see myself

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
going into a state prison in New Jersey

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and making such a proposition,

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but this being Israel,

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the warden somehow made it happen.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And so two months later,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we found ourselves "at large" --

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
myself,

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
10 juvenile inmates

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and a wonderful fellow named Russ,

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
who became a very good friend of mine

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and my partner in this project.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of introducing these kids

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to the world of total freedom,

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a world consisting of magnificent vistas

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
like these --

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
everything you see here is obviously in Israel --

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as well as close encounters

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
with all sorts of small creatures

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
coming in all sorts of sizes,

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
colors, shapes, forms

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and so on.

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In spite of all this splendor,

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the beginning was extremely frustrating.

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Every small obstacle,

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
every slight uphill,

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
would cause these fellows

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to stop in their tracks and give up.

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So we had a lot of this going on.

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I found out that they had a very hard time

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
dealing with frustration and difficulties --

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
not because they were physically unfit.

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But that's one reason why they ended up where they were.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And I became increasingly more and more agitated,

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
because I was there

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
not only to be with them,

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but also to ride and create a team

96
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and I didn't know what to do.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, let me give you an example.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain,

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and the front tire of Alex

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
gets caught in one of these crevasses here.

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So he crashes down,

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and he gets slightly injured,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but this does not prevent him from jumping up

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and then starting to jump up and down on his bike

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and curse violently.

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Then he throws his helmet in the air.

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And then he runs to the nearest tree

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and starts to break branches and throw rocks

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and curse like I've never heard.

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I'm just standing there,

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
watching this scene

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with a complete disbelief,

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
not knowing what to do.

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I'm used to algorithms

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and data structures

117
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and super motivated students,

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and nothing in my background

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
prepared me to deal

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with a raging, violent adolescent

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in the middle of nowhere.

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And you have to realize that these incidents

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
did not happen in convenient locations.

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They happened in places like this,

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in the Judean Desert,

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
20 kilometers away from the nearest road.

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And what you don't see in this picture

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is that somewhere between these riders there,

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
there's a teenager sitting on a rock,

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
saying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it.

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I've had it."

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Well, that's a problem

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
because it's getting dark soon and dangerous.

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
At the beginning, it was a disaster.

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I tried harsh words and threats

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and they took me nowhere.

139
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
That's what they had all their lives.

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And at some point I found out,

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when a kid like this gets into a fit,

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the best thing that you can possibly do

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
is stay as close as possible to this kid,

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
which is difficult,

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because what you really want to do is go away.

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But that's what he had all his life,

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
people walking away from him.

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So what you have to do is stay close

149
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and try to reach in

150
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and pet his shoulder

151
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
or give him a piece of chocolate.

152
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.

153
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Why don't you rest for a few minutes

154
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and then we'll go on."

155
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
"Go away you maniac-psychopath.

156
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?"

157
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I would say, "Relax, Alex.

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Here's a piece of chocolate."

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Because you have to understand

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that on these rides we are constantly hungry --

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and after the rides also.

163
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?

164
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
He's a 17-year-old.

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
When he was eight,

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
someone put him on a boat in Odessa

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and sent him, shipped him to Israel

168
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
on his own.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And he ended up in south Tel Aviv

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and did not have the good luck

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to be picked up by a [unclear]

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and roamed the streets

173
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and became a prominent gang member.

174
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And he spent the last 10 years of his life

175
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in two places only,

176
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the slums and the state prison,

177
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
where he spent the last two years

178
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
before he ended up sitting on this rock there.

179
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And so this kid

180
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was probably abused,

181
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
abandoned, ignored, betrayed

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
by almost every adult along the way.

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So, for such a kid,

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and doesn't walk away from him

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in any situation,

187
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
irrespective of how he behaves,

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
it's a tremendous healing experience.

189
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's an act of unconditional acceptance,

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
something that he never had.

191
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I want to say a few words about vision.

192
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
When I started this program four years ago,

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I had this original plan

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
of creating a team

195
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of winning underdogs.

196
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I had an image of Lance Armstrong

197
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in my mind.

198
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And it took me exactly two months

199
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
of complete frustration

200
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to realize that this vision

201
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
was misplaced,

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and that there was another vision

203
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
supremely more important

204
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and more readily available.

205
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,

206
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that the purpose of these rides

207
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
should actually be

208
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to expose the kids

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to one thing only: love.

210
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Love to the country, to the uphill

211
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and the downhill,

212
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to all the incredible creatures that surround us --

213
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the animals, the plants,

214
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the insects --

215
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
love and respect

216
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to other fellow members in your team,

217
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in your biking team,

218
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and most importantly,

219
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
love and respect to yourself,

220
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
which is something

221
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that they badly miss.

222
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Together with the kids,

223
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I also went through a remarkable transformation.

224
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now, I come from a cutthroat world

225
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of science and high technology.

226
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I used to think that reason and logic

227
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and relentless drive

228
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
were the only ways to make things happen.

229
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And before I worked with the kids,

230
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
anything that I did with them,

231
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or anything that I did with myself,

232
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
was supposed to be perfect,

233
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
ideal, optimal,

234
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but after working with them for some time,

235
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I discovered the great virtues of empathy

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and flexibility

237
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and being able to start with some vision,

238
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.

239
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and come up with something that does help, that does work.

241
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So right now, I feel more

242
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
like these are my principles,

243
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and if you don't like them,

244
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I have others.

245
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

246
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Applause)

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And one of these principles

248
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is focus.

249
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Before each ride

250
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we sit together with the kids,

251
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and we give them one word

252
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to think about during the ride.

253
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
You have to focus their attention on something

254
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
because so many things happen.

255
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So these are words like "teamwork"

256
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
or "endurance"

257
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or even complicated concepts

258
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
like "resource allocation"

259
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
or "perspective," a word that they don't understand.

260
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
You know, perspective

261
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is one of these critically important

262
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
life-coping strategies

263
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that mountain biking can really teach you.

264
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I tell kids

265
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
when they struggle through some uphill

266
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and feel like they cannot take it anymore,

267
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles

268
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and raise your head and look around

269
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and see how the vista around you grows.

270
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It literally propels you upwards.

271
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
That's what perspective is all about.

272
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Or you can also look back in time

273
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and realize that you've already conquered

274
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
steeper mountains before.

275
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And that's how they develop self-esteem.

276
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Now, let me give you an example of how it works.

277
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
You stand with your bike at the beginning of February.

278
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,

279
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and it's drizzling

280
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and cold and chilly,

281
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.

282
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds

283
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka --

284
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that's where you're supposed to climb now --

285
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there."

286
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And yet, two hours later

287
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,

288
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
smeared with mud,

289
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
blood and sweat.

290
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And you look down at Yokneam;

291
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
everything is so small and tiny.

292
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.

293
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's that big.

294
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I can't believe that I did it."

295
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
And that's the point

296
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
when you start loving yourself.

297
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And so we talked about

298
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
these special words that we teach them.

299
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And at the end of each ride, we sit together

300
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and share moments

301
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in which those special words of the day

302
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
popped up and made a difference,

303
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and these discussions

304
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
can be extremely inspiring.

305
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
In one of them, one of the kids once said,

306
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"When we were riding on this ridge

307
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
overlooking the Dead Sea --

308
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and he's talking about this spot here --

309
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
"I was reminded

310
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia

311
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and went away together with my brother.

312
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We walked 120 kilometers

313
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
until we reached Sudan.

314
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies."

315
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,

316
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
probably for the first time in his life.

317
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me,

318
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
adults, who are sitting there

319
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
listening to him --

320
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and he says, "And this was just the beginning

321
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
of our ordeal

322
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
until we ended up in Israel.

323
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And only now," he says,

324
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
"I'm beginning to understand where I am,

325
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and I actually like it."

326
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Now I remember, when he said it,

327
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I felt goosebumps on my body,

328
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.

329
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
That's where Joshua descended

330
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and crossed the Jordan

331
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan

332
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
3,000 years ago

333
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in this final leg

334
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
of the journey from Africa.

335
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And so, perspective

336
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and context and history

337
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
play key roles

338
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
in the way I plan my rides

339
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
with the kids.

340
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We visit Kibbutzim

341
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that were established by Holocaust survivors.

342
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We explore ruins

343
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
of Palestinian villages,

344
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and we discuss how they became ruins.

345
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And we go through numerous remnants

346
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,

347
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Canaanite settlements --

348
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
three-, four, five-thousand years old.

349
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And through this tapestry,

350
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
which is the history of this country,

351
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
the kids acquire

352
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
what is probably the most important

353
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
value in education,

354
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and that is the understanding that life is complex,

355
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and there's no black and white.

356
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And by appreciating complexity,

357
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
they become more tolerant,

358
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and tolerance leads to hope.

359
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I ride with these kids once a week,

360
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
every Tuesday.

361
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago --

362
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and I ride with them tomorrow also.

363
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
In every one of these rides

364
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,

365
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
taking in this incredible landscape around me,

366
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and I feel blessed and fortunate

367
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that I'm alive,

368
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and that I sense every fiber

369
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in my aching body.

370
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And I feel blessed and fortunate

371
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that 15 years ago

372
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I had the courage to resign

373
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
my tenured position at NYU

374
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and return to my home country

375
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
where I can do these incredible rides

376
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
with this group of troubled kids

377
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
coming from Ethiopia

378
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and Morocco and Russia.

379
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And I feel blessed and fortunate

380
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that every week, every Tuesday --

381
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and actually every Friday also --

382
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I can once again celebrate

383
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
in the marrow of my bones

384
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.

385
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Thank you.

386
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Applause)

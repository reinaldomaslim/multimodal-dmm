0:00:13.212,000 --> 0:00:14,000
(Guitar music starts)

2
0:01:32.149,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I've been looking

3
0:01:33.713,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Several days now

4
0:01:35.596,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Where did they go?

5
0:01:37.38,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Where did they go?

6
0:01:40.802,000 --> 0:01:42,000
My mama told me long ago

7
0:01:46.053,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I've lost so many precious things, I know

8
0:01:49.633,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They won't be back

9
0:01:51.365,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Where did they go?

10
0:01:54.989,000 --> 0:01:56,000
My mama told me long ago

11
0:01:59.95,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me to abandon my old friend

12
0:02:03.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Happy days, walking on the shore

13
0:02:07.212,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Happy days, walking on the shore

14
0:02:10.752,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Happy days, walking on the shore

15
0:02:15.806,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me to abandon my good memories at all

16
0:02:26.362,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I've seen so many pretty things

17
0:02:29.189,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They don't mean a thing now

18
0:02:31.8,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Listen to the song

19
0:02:35.514,000 --> 0:02:37,000
My mama told me long ago

20
0:03:00.933,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me to doubt my good old days

21
0:03:04.715,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Happy days, walking on the shore

22
0:03:08.309,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Happy days, walking on the shore

23
0:03:11.889,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Happy days, walking on the shore

24
0:03:17.065,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me to abandon my good memories at all

25
0:03:22.347,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Abandon my good memories at all

26
0:03:25.919,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Abandon my good memories at all

27
0:03:48.191,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Music ends)

28
0:03:49.663,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Applause)

29
0:03:51.704,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Thank you.

30
0:03:52.879,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Applause)

31
0:03:58.527,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to perform tonight at TED New York.

32
0:04:04.442,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I've been a dedicated TED fan and viewer,

33
0:04:07.934,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and also, I actually used to live in Manhattan when I was younger,

34
0:04:12.673,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so New York is like a second home to me, and it's great to be back.

35
0:04:18.333,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The song I just performed was called "my mama,"

36
0:04:21.046,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and the next song I'm going to perform

37
0:04:23.251,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is another original song of mine called "BLACK BANANA."

38
0:04:28.24,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This song I wrote about the importance of being patient with your dreams.

39
0:04:34.568,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Because I think commitment will always be rewarded.

40
0:04:39.601,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Just like fruit ripens when the time is right.

41
0:04:42.988,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So it's my interpretation of building the future.

42
0:04:49.852,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Guitar music starts)

43
0:05:07.972,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Clap your hands.

44
0:05:37.032,000 --> 0:05:38,000
One!

45
0:05:38.827,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Two!

46
0:05:40.606,000 --> 0:05:43,000
One, two, one, two, three, four.

47
0:05:57.941,000 --> 0:06:,000
Sitting here, killing time, I've been doing it all day

48
0:06:01.318,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I've been always smart when it comes to gettin' away

49
0:06:04.831,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Got a soda pop fizzin' hard in my empty brain

50
0:06:08.379,000 --> 0:06:11,000
When the time is right I'll move alright so don't get too uptight

51
0:06:12.497,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Silly girls in bathing suits cleaning cars on Sundays

52
0:06:15.572,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They're living a lie don't make as fool of yourself too soon

53
0:06:19.567,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Lining my bananas on the window sill to ripen

54
0:06:22.714,000 --> 0:06:25,000
When the time is right I'll move alright so don't get too uptight

55
0:06:27.222,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Bananananana sekasanaide

56
0:06:30.888,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Bananananana-ri yuki makase

57
0:06:34.543,000 --> 0:06:37,000

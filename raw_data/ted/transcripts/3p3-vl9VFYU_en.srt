1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So as a fashion designer,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've always tended to think of materials

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
something like this,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or this,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or maybe this.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But then I met a biologist,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and now I think of materials like this --

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
green tea, sugar,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
a few microbes and a little time.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which is a symbiotic mix

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
which spin cellulose

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in a fermentation process.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Over time, these tiny threads

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
form in the liquid into layers

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and produce a mat on the surface.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So we start by brewing the tea.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time,

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and then pour it into a growth bath.

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We need to check that the temperature

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
has cooled to below 30 degrees C.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And then we're ready to add the living organism.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And along with that, some acetic acid.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And once you get this process going,

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you can actually recycle

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
your previous fermented liquid.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and a thermostat to regulate it.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So this is my mini fabric farm.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
After about three days,

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And the bacteria are feeding

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of pure cellulose.

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And they're sticking together, forming layers

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and giving us a sheet on the surface.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
After about two to three weeks,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So the bath on the left is after five days,

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and on the right, after 10.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this is a static culture.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You don't have to do anything to it;

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you just literally watch it grow.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It doesn't need light.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and you wash it in cold, soapy water.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
At this point, it's really heavy.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's over 90 percent water,

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
so we need to let that evaporate.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Again, you can do that outside

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and just let it dry in the air.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And as it's drying, it's compressing,

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so what you're left with, depending on the recipe,

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is something that's either

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
like a really light-weight, transparent paper,

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And then you can either cut that out

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and sew it conventionally,

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or you can use the wet material

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to form it around a three-dimensional shape.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And as it evaporates,

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it will knit itself together, forming seams.

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin,

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which intrigues me.

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Since it's organic,

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I can make it change color without using dye

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
by a process of iron oxidation.

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Using fruit and vegetable staining,

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
create organic patterning.

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And using indigo,

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
make it anti-microbial.

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And in fact, cotton

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
would take up to 18 dips in indigo

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to achieve a color this dark.

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose,

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
it just takes one, and a really short one at that.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So if I was to walk outside in the rain

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
wearing this dress today,

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I would immediately start to absorb

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
huge amounts of water.

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The dress would get really heavy,

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and eventually the seams would probably fall apart --

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
leaving me feeling rather naked.

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Possibly a good performance piece,

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What I'm looking for

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is a way to give the material

99
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the qualities that I need.

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So what I want to do is say to a future bug,

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"Spin me a thread.

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Align it in this direction.

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Make it hydrophobic.

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And while you're at it,

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
just form it around this 3D shape."

106
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing,

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and possibly in the future

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for biocompatible blood vessels,

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
possibly even replacement bone tissue.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But with synthetic biology,

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to produce something

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that gives us the quality,

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
quantity and shape

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of material that we desire.

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because then I start to think, wow,

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we could actually imagine

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
growing consumable products.

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
What excites me about using microbes

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is their efficiency.

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So we only grow what we need.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
There's no waste.

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream --

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so for example,

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a waste sugar stream

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
from a food processing plant.

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally

129
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
along with your vegetable peelings.

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is going to be a replacement

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for cotton, leather or other textile materials.

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to our increasingly precious natural resources.

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
where we see these microbes have their impact.

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We could, for example, imagine

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
growing a lamp, a chair,

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a car or maybe even a house.

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So I guess what my question to you is:

141
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in the future, what would you choose to grow?

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Thank you very much.

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Applause)

144
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity,

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.)

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This is one of the jackets you grew?

147
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
SL: Yes, it is.

148
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because this one

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.)

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Applause)

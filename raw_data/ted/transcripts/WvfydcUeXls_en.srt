1
0:00:13.802,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Simone George: I met Mark when he was just blind.

2
0:00:17.389,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I had returned home to live in Dublin

3
0:00:19.413,000 --> 0:00:22,000
after the odyssey that was my 20s,

4
0:00:22.839,000 --> 0:00:26,000
educating my interest in human rights and equality in university,

5
0:00:27.18,000 --> 0:00:3,000
traveling the world, like my nomad grandmother.

6
0:00:30.831,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And during a two-year stint working in Madrid,

7
0:00:34.538,000 --> 0:00:37,000
dancing many nights till morning in salsa clubs.

8
0:00:39.903,000 --> 0:00:41,000
When I met Mark, he asked me to teach him to dance.

9
0:00:43.188,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I did.

10
0:00:45.515,000 --> 0:00:47,000
They were wonderful times, long nights talking,

11
0:00:48.395,000 --> 0:00:51,000
becoming friends and eventually falling for each other.

12
0:00:53.203,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Mark had lost his sight when he was 22,

13
0:00:55.942,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and the man that I met eight years later was rebuilding his identity,

14
0:01:00.768,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the cornerstone of which was this incredible spirit

15
0:01:04.741,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that had taken him to the Gobi Desert, where he ran six marathons in seven days.

16
0:01:09.918,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And to marathons at the North Pole, and from Everest Base Camp.

17
0:01:15.312,000 --> 0:01:18,000
When I asked him what had led to this high-octane life,

18
0:01:19.043,000 --> 0:01:21,000
he quoted Nietzsche:

19
0:01:21.185,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"He, who has a Why to live, can bear with almost any How."

20
0:01:27.009,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He had come across the quote in a really beautiful book

21
0:01:30.026,000 --> 0:01:33,000
called "Man's Search for Meaning," by Viktor Frankl,

22
0:01:33.633,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a neurologist and psychiatrist

23
0:01:35.863,000 --> 0:01:38,000
who survived years in a Nazi concentration camp.

24
0:01:39.561,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Frankl used this Nietzsche quote to explain to us

25
0:01:43.816,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that when we can no longer change our circumstances,

26
0:01:47.204,000 --> 0:01:5,000
we are challenged to change ourselves.

27
0:01:52.188,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Mark Pollock: Eventually, I did rebuild my identity,

28
0:01:55.427,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and the Why for me was about competing again,

29
0:01:58.506,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because pursuing success and risking failure

30
0:02:02.149,000 --> 0:02:04,000
was simply how I felt normal.

31
0:02:05.957,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I finished the rebuild

32
0:02:08.393,000 --> 0:02:1,000
on the 10th anniversary of losing my sight.

33
0:02:11.861,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I took part in a 43-day expedition race

34
0:02:15.911,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in the coldest, most remote, most challenging place on earth.

35
0:02:20.783,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It was the first race to the South Pole

36
0:02:22.866,000 --> 0:02:28,000
since Shackleton, Scott and Amundsen set foot in Antarctica, 100 years before.

37
0:02:30.18,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And putting the demons of blindness behind me

38
0:02:32.987,000 --> 0:02:34,000
with every step towards the pole,

39
0:02:35.794,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it offered me a long-lasting sense of contentment.

40
0:02:41.736,000 --> 0:02:44,000
As it turned out, I would need that in reserve,

41
0:02:44.998,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because one year after my return,

42
0:02:49.125,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in, arguably, the safest place on earth,

43
0:02:52.181,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a bedroom at a friend's house,

44
0:02:55.537,000 --> 0:03:,000
I fell from a third-story window onto the concrete below.

45
0:03:02.164,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I don't know how it happened.

46
0:03:04.133,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I think I must have got up to go to the bathroom.

47
0:03:07.005,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And because I'm blind, I used to run my hand along the wall

48
0:03:12.466,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to find my way.

49
0:03:14.704,000 --> 0:03:19,000
That night, my hand found an open space where the closed window should have been.

50
0:03:21.252,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And I cartwheeled out.

51
0:03:23.657,000 --> 0:03:25,000
My friends who found me thought I was dead.

52
0:03:26.053,000 --> 0:03:29,000
When I got to hospital, the doctors thought I was going to die,

53
0:03:29.927,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and when I realized what was happening to me,

54
0:03:32.285,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I thought that dying might have been ...

55
0:03:37.157,000 --> 0:03:39,000
might have been the best outcome.

56
0:03:40.125,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And lying in intensive care,

57
0:03:42.648,000 --> 0:03:46,000
facing the prospect of being blind and paralyzed,

58
0:03:47.482,000 --> 0:03:51,000
high on morphine, I was trying to make sense of what was going on.

59
0:03:53.139,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And one night, lying flat on my back,

60
0:03:55.926,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I felt for my phone to write a blog,

61
0:04:02.543,000 --> 0:04:04,000
trying to explain how I should respond.

62
0:04:04.927,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It was called "Optimist, Realist or Something Else?"

63
0:04:08.863,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it drew on the experiences of Admiral Stockdale,

64
0:04:12.046,000 --> 0:04:14,000
who was a POW in the Vietnam war.

65
0:04:16.092,000 --> 0:04:2,000
He was incarcerated, tortured, for over seven years.

66
0:04:21.021,000 --> 0:04:24,000
His circumstances were bleak, but he survived.

67
0:04:25.513,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The ones who didn't survive were the optimists.

68
0:04:29.084,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They said, "We'll be out by Christmas,"

69
0:04:31.084,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and Christmas would come and Christmas would go,

70
0:04:33.916,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and then it would be Christmas again,

71
0:04:36.165,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and when they didn't get out, they became disappointed, demoralized

72
0:04:41.594,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and many of them died in their cells.

73
0:04:46.323,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Stockdale was a realist.

74
0:04:49.474,000 --> 0:04:52,000
He was inspired by the stoic philosophers,

75
0:04:52.804,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and he confronted the brutal facts of his circumstances

76
0:04:59.284,000 --> 0:05:03,000
while maintaining a faith that he would prevail in the end.

77
0:05:04.053,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And in that blog, I was trying to apply his thinking as a realist

78
0:05:08.065,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to my increasingly bleak circumstances.

79
0:05:11.609,000 --> 0:05:14,000
During the many months of heart infections and kidney infections

80
0:05:15.077,000 --> 0:05:19,000
after my fall, at the very edge of survival,

81
0:05:20.172,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Simone and I faced the fundamental question:

82
0:05:25.891,000 --> 0:05:29,000
How do you resolve the tension between acceptance and hope?

83
0:05:30.828,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And it's that that we want to explore with you now.

84
0:05:35.228,000 --> 0:05:38,000
SG: After I got the call, I caught the first flight to England

85
0:05:38.419,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and arrived into the brightly lit intensive care ward,

86
0:05:42.252,000 --> 0:05:45,000
where Mark was lying naked, just under a sheet,

87
0:05:45.561,000 --> 0:05:48,000
connected to machines that were monitoring if he would live.

88
0:05:50.085,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I said, "I'm here, Mark."

89
0:05:53.18,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And he cried tears he seemed to have saved just for me.

90
0:05:58.641,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I wanted to gather him in my arms, but I couldn't move him,

91
0:06:03.068,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and so I kissed him the way you kiss a newborn baby,

92
0:06:07.187,000 --> 0:06:08,000
terrified of their fragility.

93
0:06:10.673,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Later that afternoon, when the bad news had been laid out for us --

94
0:06:14.863,000 --> 0:06:18,000
fractured skull, bleeds on his brain, a possible torn aorta

95
0:06:19.18,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and a spine broken in two places, no movement or feeling below his waist --

96
0:06:25.212,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Mark said to me, "Come here.

97
0:06:29.109,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You need to get yourself as far away from this as possible."

98
0:06:35.577,000 --> 0:06:37,000
As I tried to process what he was saying,

99
0:06:38.3,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I was thinking, "What the hell is wrong with you?"

100
0:06:41.839,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:43.577,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"We can't do this now."

102
0:06:45.99,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So I asked him, "Are you breaking up with me?"

103
0:06:49.038,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:52.578,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And he said, "Look, you signed up for the blindness, but not this."

105
0:06:58.477,000 --> 0:07:,000
And I answered, "We don't even know what this is,

106
0:07:01.342,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but what I do know is what I can't handle right now

107
0:07:04.032,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is a breakup while someone I love is in intensive care."

108
0:07:07.076,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

109
0:07:09.463,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So I called on my negotiation skills and suggested we make a deal.

110
0:07:14.178,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I said, "I will stay with you as long as you need me,

111
0:07:17.995,000 --> 0:07:19,000
as long as your back needs me.

112
0:07:20.085,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And when you no longer need me, then we talk about our relationship."

113
0:07:24.577,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Like a contract with the possibility to renew in six months.

114
0:07:28.339,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

115
0:07:31.458,000 --> 0:07:33,000
He agreed and I stayed.

116
0:07:34.339,000 --> 0:07:38,000
In fact, I refused to go home even to pack a bag, I slept by his bed,

117
0:07:38.879,000 --> 0:07:4,000
when he could eat, I made all his food,

118
0:07:41.387,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and we cried, one or other or both of us together, every day.

119
0:07:47.482,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I made all the complicated decisions with the doctors,

120
0:07:50.919,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I climbed right into that raging river over rapids that was sweeping Mark along.

121
0:08:00.371,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And at the first bend in that river, Mark's surgeon told us

122
0:08:04.768,000 --> 0:08:08,000
what movement and feeling he doesn't get back in the first 12 weeks,

123
0:08:08.911,000 --> 0:08:1,000
he's unlikely to get back at all.

124
0:08:13.046,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So, sitting by his bed, I began to research why,

125
0:08:16.132,000 --> 0:08:18,000
after this period they call spinal shock,

126
0:08:19.07,000 --> 0:08:23,000
there's no recovery, there's no therapy, there's no cure, there's no hope.

127
0:08:25.111,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And the internet became this portal to a magical other world.

128
0:08:29.523,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I emailed scientists,

129
0:08:31.722,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and they broke through paywalls

130
0:08:33.252,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and sent me their medical journal and science journal articles directly.

131
0:08:37.569,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I read everything that "Superman" actor Christopher Reeve had achieved,

132
0:08:40.991,000 --> 0:08:41,000
after a fall from a horse

133
0:08:42.379,000 --> 0:08:45,000
left him paralyzed from the neck down and ventilated.

134
0:08:46.553,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Christopher had broken this 12-week spell;

135
0:08:49.11,000 --> 0:08:53,000
he had regained some movement and feeling years after his accident.

136
0:08:54.489,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He dreamed of a world of empty wheelchairs.

137
0:08:59.117,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And Christopher and the scientists he worked with fueled us with hope.

138
0:09:06.363,000 --> 0:09:08,000
MP: You see, spinal cord injury

139
0:09:08.523,000 --> 0:09:11,000
strikes at the very heart of what it means to be human.

140
0:09:12.347,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And it had turned me from my upright, standing, running form,

141
0:09:17.318,000 --> 0:09:2,000
into a seated compromise of myself.

142
0:09:21.128,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And it's not just the lack of feeling and movement.

143
0:09:24.919,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Paralysis also interferes with the body's internal systems,

144
0:09:28.061,000 --> 0:09:3,000
which are designed to keep us alive.

145
0:09:31.204,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Multiple infections, nerve pain, spasms, shortened life spans are common.

146
0:09:36.656,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And these are the things that exhaust even the most determined

147
0:09:39.823,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of the 60 million people around the world who are paralyzed.

148
0:09:45.71,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Over 16 months in hospital,

149
0:09:48.179,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Simone and I were presented with the expert view

150
0:09:51.204,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that hoping for a cure had proven to be psychologically damaging.

151
0:09:55.434,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It was like the formal medical system was canceling hope

152
0:09:59.196,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in favor of acceptance alone.

153
0:10:02.815,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But canceling hope ran contrary to everything that we believed in.

154
0:10:09.5,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Yes, up to this point in history,

155
0:10:12.607,000 --> 0:10:14,000
it had proven to be impossible to find a cure for paralysis,

156
0:10:15.445,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but history is filled with the kinds of the impossible made possible

157
0:10:20.165,000 --> 0:10:21,000
through human endeavor.

158
0:10:22.006,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The kind of human endeavor that took explorers to the South Pole

159
0:10:25.164,000 --> 0:10:27,000
at the start of the last century.

160
0:10:27.212,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And the kind of human endeavor

161
0:10:29.196,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that will take adventurers to Mars in the early part of this century.

162
0:10:34.641,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So we started asking,

163
0:10:36.728,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"Why can't that same human endeavor cure paralysis in our lifetime?"

164
0:10:42.528,000 --> 0:10:45,000
SG: Well, we really believed that it can.

165
0:10:45.75,000 --> 0:10:46,000
My research taught us

166
0:10:47.029,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that we needed to remind Mark's damaged and dormant spinal cord

167
0:10:52.355,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of its upright, standing, running form,

168
0:10:54.656,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and we found San Francisco-based engineers at Ekso Bionics,

169
0:10:59.283,000 --> 0:11:03,000
who created this robotic exoskeleton that would allow Mark to stand and walk

170
0:11:03.857,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in the lab that we started to build in Dublin.

171
0:11:07.911,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Mark became the first person to personally own an exo,

172
0:11:11.831,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and since then, he and the robot have walked over one million steps.

173
0:11:17.395,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Applause)

174
0:11:22.846,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It was bit of an early celebration, because actually it wasn't enough,

175
0:11:26.187,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the robot was doing all of the work,

176
0:11:29.007,000 --> 0:11:31,000
so we needed to plug Mark in.

177
0:11:31.934,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So we connected the San Francisco engineers

178
0:11:34.657,000 --> 0:11:38,000
with a true visionary in UCLA, Dr. Reggie Edgerton,

179
0:11:39.665,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the most beautiful man

180
0:11:41.53,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and his team's life work had resulted in a scientific breakthrough.

181
0:11:46.704,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Using electrical stimulation of the spinal cord,

182
0:11:49.864,000 --> 0:11:51,000
a number of subjects have been able to stand,

183
0:11:52.707,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and because of that, regain some movement and feeling

184
0:11:55.912,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and most importantly,

185
0:11:57.539,000 --> 0:12:,000
to regain some of the body's internal functions

186
0:12:00.87,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that are designed to keep us alive and to make that life a pleasure.

187
0:12:06.903,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord,

188
0:12:09.887,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we think, is the first meaningful therapy ever for paralyzed people.

189
0:12:16.692,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now, of course, the San Francisco engineers

190
0:12:18.752,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and the scientists in UCLA

191
0:12:20.631,000 --> 0:12:22,000
knew about each other, knew about each other's work.

192
0:12:23.424,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But as so often happens

193
0:12:25.419,000 --> 0:12:31,000
when we're busy creating groundbreaking scientific research,

194
0:12:32.355,000 --> 0:12:34,000
they hadn't quite yet got together.

195
0:12:35.442,000 --> 0:12:37,000
That seemed to be our job now.

196
0:12:38.609,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So we created our first collaboration,

197
0:12:41.546,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and the moment when we combined

198
0:12:43.174,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the electrical stimulation of Mark's spinal cord,

199
0:12:46.093,000 --> 0:12:48,000
as he walked in his robotic exoskeleton,

200
0:12:48.641,000 --> 0:12:52,000
was like that moment when Iron Man plugs the mini arc reactor into his chest

201
0:12:53.053,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and suddenly he and his suit become something else altogether.

202
0:12:59.466,000 --> 0:13:04,000
MP: Simone, my robot and I moved into the lab at UCLA for three months.

203
0:13:04.974,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And every day, Reggie and his team

204
0:13:07.419,000 --> 0:13:1,000
put electrodes onto the skin on my lower back,

205
0:13:10.807,000 --> 0:13:14,000
pushed electricity into my spinal cord to excite my nervous system,

206
0:13:15.307,000 --> 0:13:17,000
as I walked in my exo.

207
0:13:18.538,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And for the first time since I was paralyzed,

208
0:13:20.863,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I could feel my legs underneath me.

209
0:13:24.347,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Not normally --

210
0:13:25.539,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

211
0:13:27.45,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Thank you.

212
0:13:28.718,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Applause)

213
0:13:30.553,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It wasn't a normal feeling, but with the stimulator turned on,

214
0:13:33.776,000 --> 0:13:36,000
upright in my exo, my legs felt substantial.

215
0:13:37.546,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I could feel the meat of my muscles on the bones of my legs,

216
0:13:43.173,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and as I walked, because of the stimulation,

217
0:13:46.363,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I was able to voluntarily move my paralyzed legs.

218
0:13:49.887,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And as I did more, the robot intelligently did less.

219
0:13:54.783,000 --> 0:13:57,000
My heart rate got a normal running, training zone

220
0:13:58.212,000 --> 0:14:,000
of 140 to 160 beats per minute,

221
0:14:01.006,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and my muscles, which had almost entirely disappeared,

222
0:14:05.776,000 --> 0:14:06,000
started to come back.

223
0:14:07.514,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And during some standard testing throughout the process,

224
0:14:11.141,000 --> 0:14:12,000
flat on my back,

225
0:14:12.911,000 --> 0:14:16,000
twelve weeks, six months and three whole years

226
0:14:16.951,000 --> 0:14:19,000
after I fell out that window and became paralyzed,

227
0:14:20.29,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the scientists turned the stimulator on

228
0:14:24.069,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and I pulled my knee to my chest.

229
0:14:28.704,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Video) Man: OK, start, go, go, go, go, go.

230
0:14:32.014,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Good, good, good.

231
0:14:33.188,000 --> 0:14:36,000
SG: Yeah, yeah, go on, Mark, go on, go, go, go, go, go, wow!

232
0:14:37.188,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Applause)

233
0:14:38.363,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Laughter)

234
0:14:40.339,000 --> 0:14:41,000
SG: Well done!

235
0:14:41.514,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Applause)

236
0:14:45.183,000 --> 0:14:47,000
MP: Do you know, this week, I've been saying to Simone,

237
0:14:47.779,000 --> 0:14:49,000
if we could forget about the paralysis,

238
0:14:50.414,000 --> 0:14:53,000
you know, the last few years have been incredibly exciting.

239
0:14:53.458,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

240
0:14:56.18,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Now, the problem is, we can't quite forget about the paralysis just yet.

241
0:15:01.323,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And clearly, we're not finished,

242
0:15:02.903,000 --> 0:15:04,000
because when we left that pilot study and went back to Dublin,

243
0:15:05.847,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I rolled home in my wheelchair

244
0:15:07.593,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and I'm still paralyzed and I'm still blind

245
0:15:10.302,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and we're primarily focusing on the paralysis at the moment,

246
0:15:13.173,000 --> 0:15:14,000
but being at this conference,

247
0:15:14.705,000 --> 0:15:17,000
we're kind of interested if anyone does have a cure for blindness,

248
0:15:17.847,000 --> 0:15:18,000
we'll take that as well.

249
0:15:19.472,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Laughter)

250
0:15:21.594,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Applause)

251
0:15:27.569,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But if you remember the blog that I mentioned,

252
0:15:30.697,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it posed a question of how we should respond,

253
0:15:33.371,000 --> 0:15:35,000
optimist, realist or something else?

254
0:15:36.045,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And I think we have come to understand that the optimists rely on hope alone

255
0:15:40.569,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and they risk being disappointed and demoralized.

256
0:15:44.479,000 --> 0:15:46,000
The realists, on the other hand,

257
0:15:48.129,000 --> 0:15:53,000
they accept the brutal facts and they keep hope alive, as well.

258
0:15:54.034,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The realists have managed to resolve the tension between acceptance and hope

259
0:15:59.988,000 --> 0:16:01,000
by running them in parallel.

260
0:16:02.376,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And that's what Simone and I have been trying to do

261
0:16:04.782,000 --> 0:16:05,000
over the last number of years.

262
0:16:06.283,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Look, I accept the wheelchair --

263
0:16:08.742,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I mean, it's almost impossible not to.

264
0:16:11.091,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And we're sad, sometimes, for what we've lost.

265
0:16:14.623,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I accept that I, and other wheelchair users, can and do live fulfilling lives,

266
0:16:20.026,000 --> 0:16:23,000
despite the nerve pain and the spasms and the infections

267
0:16:23.534,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and the shortened life spans.

268
0:16:25.765,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And I accept that it is way more difficult

269
0:16:28.006,000 --> 0:16:3,000
for people who are paralyzed from the neck down.

270
0:16:30.617,000 --> 0:16:32,000
For those who rely on ventilators to breathe,

271
0:16:33.511,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and for those who don't have access to adequate, free health care.

272
0:16:38.967,000 --> 0:16:43,000
So, that is why we also hope for another life.

273
0:16:44.467,000 --> 0:16:47,000
A life where we have created a cure through collaboration.

274
0:16:48.636,000 --> 0:16:52,000
A cure that we are actively working to release from university labs

275
0:16:53.312,000 --> 0:16:54,000
around the world

276
0:16:54.621,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and share with everyone who needs it.

277
0:16:59.988,000 --> 0:17:01,000
SG: I met Mark when he was just blind.

278
0:17:04.171,000 --> 0:17:07,000
He asked me to teach him to dance, and I did.

279
0:17:08.125,000 --> 0:17:09,000
One night, after dance classes,

280
0:17:09.871,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I turned to say goodnight to him at his front door,

281
0:17:12.353,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and to his gorgeous guide dog, Larry.

282
0:17:15.752,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I realized, that in switching all the lights off in the apartment

283
0:17:19.085,000 --> 0:17:2,000
before I left,

284
0:17:20.276,000 --> 0:17:21,000
that I was leaving him in the dark.

285
0:17:23.49,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I burst into uncontrollable tears and tried to hide it, but he knew.

286
0:17:30.284,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And he hugged me and said,

287
0:17:33.188,000 --> 0:17:34,000
"Ah, poor Simone.

288
0:17:35.046,000 --> 0:17:37,000
You're back in 1998, when I went blind.

289
0:17:39.585,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Don't worry, it turns out OK in the end."

290
0:17:44.649,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Acceptance is knowing that grief is a raging river.

291
0:17:51.187,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And you have to get into it.

292
0:17:53.647,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Because when you do, it carries you to the next place.

293
0:17:58.133,000 --> 0:18:,000
It eventually takes you to open land,

294
0:18:00.847,000 --> 0:18:03,000
somewhere where it will turn out OK in the end.

295
0:18:06.959,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And it truly has been a love story,

296
0:18:09.65,000 --> 0:18:14,000
an expansive, abundant, deeply satisfying kind of love

297
0:18:15.452,000 --> 0:18:2,000
for our fellow humans and everyone in this act of creation.

298
0:18:22.331,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Science is love.

299
0:18:25.149,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Everyone we've met in this field

300
0:18:26.776,000 --> 0:18:3,000
just wants to get their work from the bench and into people's lives.

301
0:18:31.548,000 --> 0:18:33,000
And it's our job to help them to do that.

302
0:18:35.381,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Because when we do, we and everyone with us

303
0:18:39.649,000 --> 0:18:4,000
in this act of creation

304
0:18:41.561,000 --> 0:18:43,000
will be able to say,

305
0:18:43.832,000 --> 0:18:44,000
"We did it.

306
0:18:45.53,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And then we danced."

307
0:18:49.242,000 --> 0:18:55,000
(Video) (Music)

308
0:18:56.797,000 --> 0:18:57,000

1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"Judge, I want to tell you something. I want to tell you something.

2
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I been watching you

3
0:00:18.72,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and you're not two-faced.

4
0:00:20.64,000 --> 0:00:22,000
You treat everybody the same."

5
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That was said to me by a transgender prostitute

6
0:00:27.12,000 --> 0:00:29,000
who before I had gotten on the bench

7
0:00:29.4,000 --> 0:00:31,000
had fired her public defender,

8
0:00:31.96,000 --> 0:00:32,000
insulted the court officer

9
0:00:33.96,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and yelled at the person sitting next to her,

10
0:00:36.12,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"I don't know what you're looking at. I look better than the girl you're with."

11
0:00:39.88,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:41.6,000 --> 0:00:42,000
She said this to me

13
0:00:43.52,000 --> 0:00:45,000
after I said her male name low enough

14
0:00:46.08,000 --> 0:00:48,000
so that it could be picked up by the record,

15
0:00:49.04,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but I said her female name loud enough

16
0:00:51.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so that she could walk down the aisle towards counselor's table with dignity.

17
0:00:56.28,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is procedural justice, also known as procedural fairness,

18
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:01,000
at its best.

19
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You see, I am the daughter of an African-American garbageman

20
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:06,000
who was born in Harlem

21
0:01:06.6,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and spent his summers in the segregated South.

22
0:01:09.64,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Soy la hija de una peluquera dominicana.

23
0:01:12.44,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I do that to make sure you're still paying attention.

24
0:01:14.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:16.319,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm the daughter of a Dominican beautician

26
0:01:18.6,000 --> 0:01:21,000
who came to this country for a better life for her unborn children.

27
0:01:22.44,000 --> 0:01:26,000
My parents taught me, you treat everyone you meet with dignity and respect,

28
0:01:26.48,000 --> 0:01:28,000
no matter how they look, no matter how they dress,

29
0:01:28.92,000 --> 0:01:3,000
no matter how they spoke.

30
0:01:31.2,000 --> 0:01:33,000
You see, the principles of fairness

31
0:01:33.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
were taught to me at an early age,

32
0:01:37.6,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and unbeknownst to me, it would be the most important lesson

33
0:01:40.56,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that I carried with me to the Newark Municipal Court bench.

34
0:01:44.4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And because I was dragged off the playground

35
0:01:47.24,000 --> 0:01:5,000
at the early age of 10 to translate for family members

36
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
as they began to migrate to the United States,

37
0:01:54.4,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I understand how daunting it can be for a person, a novice,

38
0:01:59.56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to navigate any government system.

39
0:02:02.92,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Every day across America and around the globe,

40
0:02:05.84,000 --> 0:02:07,000
people encounter our courts,

41
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and it is a place that is foreign, intimidating

42
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and often hostile towards them.

43
0:02:15.24,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They are confused about the nature of their charges,

44
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
annoyed about their encounters with the police

45
0:02:22.4,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and facing consequences that might impact their relationships, their finances

46
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and even their liberty.

47
0:02:29.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Let me paint a picture for you

48
0:02:30.84,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of what it's like for the average person who encounters our courts.

49
0:02:35.52,000 --> 0:02:39,000
First, they're annoyed as they're probed going through court security.

50
0:02:40.4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They finally get through court security, they walk around the building,

51
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they ask different people the same question

52
0:02:46.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and get different answers.

53
0:02:49.2,000 --> 0:02:51,000
When they finally get to where they're supposed to be,

54
0:02:51.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it gets really bad when they encounter the courts.

55
0:02:55.28,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What would you think if I told you

56
0:02:56.96,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that you could improve people's court experience,

57
0:03:00.12,000 --> 0:03:02,000
increase their compliance with the law

58
0:03:03.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and court orders,

59
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
all the while increasing the public's trust

60
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in the justice system

61
0:03:09.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with a simple idea?

62
0:03:11.52,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Well, that simple idea is procedural justice

63
0:03:15.96,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and it's a concept that says

64
0:03:17.48,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that if people perceive they are treated fairly

65
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and with dignity and respect,

66
0:03:22.2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
they'll obey the law.

67
0:03:24.32,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Well, that's what Yale professor Tom Tyler found

68
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when he began to study as far back in the '70s

69
0:03:30.4,000 --> 0:03:31,000
why people obey the law.

70
0:03:33.08,000 --> 0:03:35,000
He found that if people see the justice system

71
0:03:35.96,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as a legitimate authority to impose rules and regulations,

72
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they would follow them.

73
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:42,000
His research concluded

74
0:03:43.84,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that people would be satisfied

75
0:03:47.36,000 --> 0:03:48,000
with the judge's rulings,

76
0:03:49.32,000 --> 0:03:51,000
even when the judge ruled against them,

77
0:03:51.36,000 --> 0:03:53,000
if they perceived that they were treated fairly

78
0:03:53.96,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and with dignity and respect.

79
0:03:56.44,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And that perception of fairness begins with what?

80
0:03:59.48,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Begins with how judges speak to court participants.

81
0:04:04.96,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, being a judge

82
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is sometimes like having a reserve seat to a tragic reality show

83
0:04:12.36,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that has no commercial interruptions

84
0:04:14.52,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and no season finale.

85
0:04:17.48,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's true.

86
0:04:18.92,000 --> 0:04:2,000
People come before me handcuffed,

87
0:04:21.6,000 --> 0:04:24,000
drug-sick, depressed, hungry

88
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and mentally ill.

89
0:04:28.12,000 --> 0:04:31,000
When I saw that their need for help

90
0:04:31.24,000 --> 0:04:34,000
was greater than my fear of appearing vulnerable on the bench,

91
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I realized that not only did I need to do something,

92
0:04:38.08,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but that in fact I could do something.

93
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The good news is is that the principles of procedural justice are easy

94
0:04:45.12,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and can be implemented as quickly as tomorrow.

95
0:04:48.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The even better news, that it can be done for free.

96
0:04:50.64,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The first principle is voice.

98
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Give people an opportunity to speak,

99
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:57,000
even when you're not going to let them speak.

100
0:04:58.04,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Explain it.

101
0:04:59.32,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"Sir, I'm not letting you speak right now.

102
0:05:01.92,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You don't have an attorney.

103
0:05:03.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I don't want you to say anything that's going to hurt your case."

104
0:05:06.36,000 --> 0:05:07,000
For me, assigning essays to defendants

105
0:05:08.24,000 --> 0:05:1,000
has been a tremendous way of giving them voice.

106
0:05:12.44,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I recently gave an 18-year-old college student an essay.

107
0:05:16.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He lamented his underage drinking charge.

108
0:05:20.12,000 --> 0:05:22,000
As he stood before me reading his essay,

109
0:05:22.2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
his voice cracking and his hands trembling,

110
0:05:24.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
he said that he worried that he had become an alcoholic like his mom,

111
0:05:28.88,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who had died a couple of months prior due to alcohol-related liver disease.

112
0:05:34.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You see, assigning a letter to my father, a letter to my son,

113
0:05:38.36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"If I knew then what I know now ..."

114
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"If I believed one positive thing about myself,

115
0:05:43.32,000 --> 0:05:44,000
how would my life be different?"

116
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
gives the person an opportunity to be introspective,

117
0:05:48.88,000 --> 0:05:49,000
go on the inside,

118
0:05:50.2,000 --> 0:05:52,000
which is where all the answers are anyway.

119
0:05:52.6,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But it also gives them an opportunity

120
0:05:54.44,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to share something with the court that goes beyond their criminal record

121
0:05:58.44,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and their charges.

122
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The next principle is neutrality.

123
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:06,000
When increasing public trust in the justice system,

124
0:06:07.12,000 --> 0:06:08,000
neutrality is paramount.

125
0:06:08.92,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The judge cannot be perceived to be favoring one side over the other.

126
0:06:13.84,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The judge has to make a conscious decision not to say things like,

127
0:06:17.84,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"my officer," "my prosecutor," "my defense attorney."

128
0:06:21.72,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And this is challenging when we work in environments

129
0:06:24.52,000 --> 0:06:26,000
where you have people assigned to your courts,

130
0:06:27.08,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the same people coming in and out of your courts as well.

131
0:06:31.12,000 --> 0:06:32,000
When I think of neutrality,

132
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I'm reminded of when I was a new Rutgers Law grad

133
0:06:36.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and freshly minted attorney,

134
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and I entered an arbitration and I was greeted by two grey-haired men

135
0:06:43.32,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who were joking about the last game of golf they played together

136
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and planning future social outings.

137
0:06:49.48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I knew my client couldn't get a fair shot in that forum.

138
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The next principle is understand.

139
0:06:57.44,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It is critical that court participants understand the process,

140
0:07:02.72,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the consequences of the process

141
0:07:05.12,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and what's expected of them.

142
0:07:07.2,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I like to say that legalese is the language we use to confuse.

143
0:07:12.52,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:13.6,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I am keenly aware that the people who appear before me,

145
0:07:16.36,000 --> 0:07:18,000
many of them have very little education

146
0:07:18.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and English is often their second language.

147
0:07:21.52,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So I speak plain English in court.

148
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
A great example of this was when I was a young judge --

149
0:07:26.64,000 --> 0:07:27,000
oh no, I mean younger judge.

150
0:07:28.56,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:29.6,000 --> 0:07:31,000
When I was a younger judge, a senior judge comes to me,

152
0:07:32.24,000 --> 0:07:33,000
gives me a script and says,

153
0:07:33.6,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"If you think somebody has mental health issues,

154
0:07:35.88,000 --> 0:07:37,000
ask them these questions and you can get your evaluation."

155
0:07:38.64,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So the first time I saw someone

156
0:07:40.2,000 --> 0:07:42,000
who had what I thought was a mental health issue,

157
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I went for my script and I started to ask questions.

158
0:07:45.04,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"Um, sir, do you take psycho -- um, psychotrop --

159
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
psychotropic medication?"

160
0:07:50.48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
"Nope."

161
0:07:52.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"Uh, sir, have you treated with a psychiatrist before?"

162
0:07:56.56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"Nope."

163
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But it was obvious that the person was suffering from mental illness.

164
0:08:01.84,000 --> 0:08:04,000
One day, in my frustration, I decided to scrap the script and ask one question.

165
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"Ma'am, do you take medication to clear your mind?"

166
0:08:08.04,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"Yeah, judge, I take Haldol for my schizophrenia,

167
0:08:10.68,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Xanax for my anxiety."

168
0:08:13.24,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The question works even when it doesn't.

169
0:08:15.92,000 --> 0:08:17,000
"Mr. L, do you take medication to clear your mind?"

170
0:08:18.68,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"No, judge, I don't take no medication to clear my mind.

171
0:08:21.36,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I take medication to stop the voices in my head,

172
0:08:23.8,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but my mind is fine."

173
0:08:25.08,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:26.68,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You see, once people understand the question,

175
0:08:29.76,000 --> 0:08:3,000
they can give you valuable information

176
0:08:31.64,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that allows the court to make meaningful decisions

177
0:08:34.04,000 --> 0:08:35,000
about the cases that are before them.

178
0:08:36.92,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The last principle is respect,

179
0:08:39.56,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that without it none of the other principles can work.

180
0:08:43.44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now, respect can be as simple as,

181
0:08:46.2,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"Good afternoon, sir." "Good morning, ma'am."

182
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's looking the person in the eye who is standing before you,

183
0:08:52.4,000 --> 0:08:53,000
especially when you're sentencing them.

184
0:08:55.159,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's when I say, "Um, how are you doing today?

185
0:08:57.36,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And what's going on with you?"

186
0:08:58.84,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And not as a greeting,

187
0:09:00.12,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but as someone who is actually interested in the response.

188
0:09:03.84,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Respect is the difference between saying,

189
0:09:06.76,000 --> 0:09:07,000
"Ma'am, are you having difficulty

190
0:09:08.4,000 --> 0:09:1,000
understanding the information in the paperwork?"

191
0:09:10.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
versus, "You can read and write, can't you?"

192
0:09:13.28,000 --> 0:09:16,000
when you've realized there's a literacy issue.

193
0:09:16.52,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And the good thing about respect is that it's contagious.

194
0:09:19.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
People see you being respectful to other folks

195
0:09:21.56,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and they impute that respect to themselves.

196
0:09:23.96,000 --> 0:09:26,000
You see, that's what the transgender prostitute was telling me.

197
0:09:27.68,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I'm judging you just as much as you think you may be judging me.

198
0:09:31.48,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now, I am not telling you what I think,

199
0:09:33.92,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I am telling you what I have lived,

200
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
using procedural justice to change the culture at my courthouse

201
0:09:40.56,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and in the courtroom.

202
0:09:42.64,000 --> 0:09:45,000
After sitting comfortably for seven months

203
0:09:45.72,000 --> 0:09:46,000
as a traffic court judge,

204
0:09:47.68,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I was advised that I was being moved to the criminal court,

205
0:09:51.84,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Part Two, criminal courtroom.

206
0:09:55.04,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now, I need you to understand,

207
0:09:56.68,000 --> 0:09:58,000
this was not good news.

208
0:09:58.92,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:59.96,000 --> 0:10:,000
It was not.

210
0:10:01.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Part Two was known as the worst courtroom in the city,

211
0:10:04.64,000 --> 0:10:06,000
some folks would even say in the state.

212
0:10:07.2,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It was your typical urban courtroom with revolving door justice,

213
0:10:11.88,000 --> 0:10:13,000
you know, your regular lineup of low-level offenders --

214
0:10:14.52,000 --> 0:10:16,000
you know, the low-hanging fruit,

215
0:10:16.76,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the drug-addicted prostitute,

216
0:10:19.2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the mentally ill homeless person with quality-of-life tickets,

217
0:10:23.36,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the high school dropout petty drug dealer and the misguided young people --

218
0:10:28.64,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you know, those folks doing a life sentence

219
0:10:31.12,000 --> 0:10:32,000
30 days at a time.

220
0:10:34.12,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Fortunately, the City of Newark decided that Newarkers deserved better,

221
0:10:37.92,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and they partnered with the Center for Court Innovation

222
0:10:40.68,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and the New Jersey Judiciary

223
0:10:42.12,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to create Newark Community Solutions,

224
0:10:44.72,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a community court program

225
0:10:46.84,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that provided alternative sanctions.

226
0:10:49.88,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This means now a judge

227
0:10:52.36,000 --> 0:10:55,000
can sentence a defendant to punishment with assistance.

228
0:10:56.2,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So a defendant who would otherwise get a jail sentence

229
0:10:58.8,000 --> 0:11:,000
would now be able to get individual counseling sessions,

230
0:11:01.48,000 --> 0:11:03,000
group counseling sessions as well as community giveback,

231
0:11:04.2,000 --> 0:11:05,000
which is what we call community service.

232
0:11:06.92,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The only problem is that this wonderful program

233
0:11:09.56,000 --> 0:11:11,000
was now coming to Newark and was going to be housed where?

234
0:11:12.52,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Part Two criminal courtroom.

235
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And the attitudes there were terrible.

236
0:11:17.8,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And the reason that the attitudes were terrible there

237
0:11:20.32,000 --> 0:11:21,000
was because everyone who was sent there

238
0:11:22.24,000 --> 0:11:24,000
understood they were being sent there as punishment.

239
0:11:24.72,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The officers who were facing disciplinary actions at times,

240
0:11:28.36,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the public defender and prosecutor

241
0:11:30.84,000 --> 0:11:34,000
felt like they were doing a 30-day jail sentence on their rotation,

242
0:11:35.04,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the judges understood they were being hazed

243
0:11:37.96,000 --> 0:11:39,000
just like a college sorority or fraternity.

244
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I was once told that an attorney who worked there

245
0:11:44.52,000 --> 0:11:48,000
referred to the defendants as "the scum of the earth"

246
0:11:48.96,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and then had to represent them.

247
0:11:51.24,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I would hear things from folks like,

248
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
"Oh, how could you work with those people? They're so nasty.

249
0:11:55.88,000 --> 0:11:57,000
You're a judge, not a social worker."

250
0:11:58.2,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But the reality is that as a society, we criminalize social ills,

251
0:12:02.68,000 --> 0:12:04,000
then sent people to a judge and say, "Do something."

252
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I decided that I was going to lead by example.

253
0:12:08.84,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So my first foray into the approach came when a 60-something-year-old man

254
0:12:12.88,000 --> 0:12:14,000
appeared before me handcuffed.

255
0:12:14.96,000 --> 0:12:18,000
His head was lowered and his body was showing the signs of drug withdrawal.

256
0:12:19.76,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I asked him how long he had been addicted, and he said, "30 years."

257
0:12:23.6,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And I asked him, "Do you have any kids?"

258
0:12:26.6,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And he said, "Yeah, I have a 32-year-old son."

259
0:12:29.12,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And I said, "Oh, so you've never had the opportunity

260
0:12:32.24,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to be a father to your son because of your addiction."

261
0:12:36.56,000 --> 0:12:37,000
He began to cry.

262
0:12:38.8,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I said, "You know what, I'm going to let you go home,

263
0:12:41.32,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and you'll come back in two weeks,

264
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and when you come back, we'll give you some assistance for your addiction."

265
0:12:46.56,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Surprisingly, two weeks passed and he was sitting the courtroom.

266
0:12:50.48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
When he came up, he said, "Judge, I came back to court

267
0:12:53.08,000 --> 0:12:56,000
because you showed me more love than I had for myself."

268
0:12:56.56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I thought, my God, he heard love from the bench?

269
0:13:00.24,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I could do this all day.

270
0:13:01.68,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter)

271
0:13:02.72,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Because the reality is that when the court behaves differently,

272
0:13:05.88,000 --> 0:13:07,000
then naturally people respond differently.

273
0:13:08.6,000 --> 0:13:11,000
The court becomes a place you can go to for assistance,

274
0:13:11.68,000 --> 0:13:14,000
like the 60-something-year-old schizophrenic homeless woman

275
0:13:15.44,000 --> 0:13:16,000
who was in distress

276
0:13:16.88,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and fighting with the voices in her head,

277
0:13:18.88,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and barges into court, and screams, "Judge!

278
0:13:21.28,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I just came by to see how you were doing."

279
0:13:24.28,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I had been monitoring her case for a couple of months,

280
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
her compliance with her medication,

281
0:13:29.04,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and had just closed out her case a couple of weeks ago.

282
0:13:32.04,000 --> 0:13:34,000
On this day she needed help,

283
0:13:34.68,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and she came to court.

284
0:13:35.96,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And after four hours of coaxing by the judge,

285
0:13:39.4,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the police officers and the staff,

286
0:13:41.72,000 --> 0:13:43,000
she is convinced to get into the ambulance

287
0:13:44.56,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that will take her to crisis unit

288
0:13:46.68,000 --> 0:13:47,000
so that she can get her medication.

289
0:13:49.4,000 --> 0:13:51,000
People become connected to their community

290
0:13:52.04,000 --> 0:13:54,000
when the court changes,

291
0:13:54.2,000 --> 0:13:56,000
like the 50-something-year-old man

292
0:13:56.64,000 --> 0:13:58,000
who told me, "Community service was terrible, Judge.

293
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I had to clean the park, and it was full of empty heroin envelopes,

294
0:14:02.36,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and the kids had to play there."

295
0:14:04.6,000 --> 0:14:07,000
As he wrung his hands, he confessed,

296
0:14:07.72,000 --> 0:14:09,000
"Judge, I realized that it was my fault,

297
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
because I used that same park to get high,

298
0:14:13.32,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and before you sent me there to do community service,

299
0:14:15.84,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I had never gone to the park when I wasn't high,

300
0:14:18.24,000 --> 0:14:21,000
so I never noticed the children playing there."

301
0:14:22.12,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Every addict in the courtroom lowered their head.

302
0:14:25.12,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Who better to teach that lesson?

303
0:14:28.6,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It helps the court reset its relationship with the community,

304
0:14:33.84,000 --> 0:14:35,000
like with the 20-something-year-old guy

305
0:14:36.12,000 --> 0:14:39,000
who gets a job interview through the court program.

306
0:14:39.8,000 --> 0:14:41,000
He gets a job interview at an office cleaning company,

307
0:14:42.4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and he comes back to court to proudly say,

308
0:14:44.64,000 --> 0:14:48,000
"Judge, I even worked in my suit after the interview,

309
0:14:49.36,000 --> 0:14:52,000
because I wanted the guy to see how bad I wanted the job."

310
0:14:54.4,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's what happens when a person in authority

311
0:14:58.08,000 --> 0:15:,000
treats you with dignity and respect,

312
0:15:00.48,000 --> 0:15:03,000
like the 40-something-year-old guy who struts down the aisle

313
0:15:03.8,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and says, "Judge, do you notice anything different?"

314
0:15:06.6,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And when I look up,

315
0:15:07.96,000 --> 0:15:09,000
he's pointing at his new teeth

316
0:15:10.4,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that he was able to get after getting a referral from the program,

317
0:15:13.76,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but he was able to get them to replace the old teeth

318
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that he lost as a result of years of heroin addiction.

319
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:22,000
When he looks in the mirror,

320
0:15:22.6,000 --> 0:15:25,000
now he sees somebody who is worth saving.

321
0:15:25.68,000 --> 0:15:26,000
You see, I have a dream

322
0:15:27.68,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and that dream is that judges will use these tools

323
0:15:31.8,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to revolutionize the communities that they serve.

324
0:15:35.04,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Now, these tools are not miracle cure-alls,

325
0:15:37.8,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but they get us light-years closer to where we want to be,

326
0:15:41.12,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and where we want to be is a place that people enter our halls of justice

327
0:15:45.56,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and believe they will be treated with dignity and respect

328
0:15:48.4,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and know that justice will be served there.

329
0:15:52.04,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Imagine that, a simple idea.

330
0:15:55.2,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thank you.

331
0:15:56.44,000 --> 0:16:02,000

1
0:00:12.719,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'd like to talk today

2
0:00:14.209,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about a powerful and fundamental aspect

3
0:00:17.136,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of who we are: our voice.

4
0:00:20.734,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Each one of us has a unique voiceprint

5
0:00:23.48,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that reflects our age, our size,

6
0:00:25.769,000 --> 0:00:28,000
even our lifestyle and personality.

7
0:00:29.006,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In the words of the poet Longfellow,

8
0:00:31.148,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"the human voice is the organ of the soul."

9
0:00:35.018,000 --> 0:00:37,000
As a speech scientist, I'm fascinated

10
0:00:37.765,000 --> 0:00:38,000
by how the voice is produced,

11
0:00:39.594,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I have an idea for how it can be engineered.

12
0:00:43.252,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That's what I'd like to share with you.

13
0:00:45.462,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'm going to start by playing you a sample

14
0:00:47.276,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of a voice that you may recognize.

15
0:00:49.147,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Recording) Stephen Hawking: "I would have thought

16
0:00:50.451,000 --> 0:00:52,000
it was fairly obvious what I meant."

17
0:00:53.2,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Rupal Patel: That was the voice

18
0:00:54.48,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of Professor Stephen Hawking.

19
0:00:56.566,000 --> 0:00:59,000
What you may not know is that same voice

20
0:01:00.415,000 --> 0:01:02,000
may also be used by this little girl

21
0:01:02.893,000 --> 0:01:03,000
who is unable to speak

22
0:01:04.59,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because of a neurological condition.

23
0:01:07.187,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In fact, all of these individuals

24
0:01:09.255,000 --> 0:01:11,000
may be using the same voice,

25
0:01:11.267,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and that's because there's only a few options available.

26
0:01:14.824,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans

27
0:01:19.141,000 --> 0:01:2,000
who are unable to speak,

28
0:01:20.751,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and many of whom use computerized devices

29
0:01:23.373,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to communicate.

30
0:01:24.895,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now that's millions of people worldwide

31
0:01:28.374,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who are using generic voices,

32
0:01:30.026,000 --> 0:01:31,000
including Professor Hawking,

33
0:01:31.472,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who uses an American-accented voice.

34
0:01:36.305,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice

35
0:01:39.633,000 --> 0:01:4,000
really hit home

36
0:01:41.049,000 --> 0:01:43,000
when I was at an assistive technology conference

37
0:01:43.521,000 --> 0:01:44,000
a few years ago,

38
0:01:45.371,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I recall walking into an exhibit hall

39
0:01:48.975,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and seeing a little girl and a grown man

40
0:01:52.019,000 --> 0:01:54,000
having a conversation using their devices,

41
0:01:54.935,000 --> 0:01:58,000
different devices, but the same voice.

42
0:01:59.219,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I looked around and I saw this happening

43
0:02:01.128,000 --> 0:02:05,000
all around me, literally hundreds of individuals

44
0:02:05.318,000 --> 0:02:07,000
using a handful of voices,

45
0:02:08.056,000 --> 0:02:11,000
voices that didn't fit their bodies

46
0:02:11.147,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or their personalities.

47
0:02:13.229,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl

48
0:02:15.956,000 --> 0:02:18,000
with the prosthetic limb of a grown man.

49
0:02:19.352,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So why then the same prosthetic voice?

50
0:02:22.656,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It really struck me,

51
0:02:23.947,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and I wanted to do something about this.

52
0:02:27.098,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'm going to play you now a sample

53
0:02:29.051,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of someone who has, two people actually,

54
0:02:32.339,000 --> 0:02:33,000
who have severe speech disorders.

55
0:02:34.107,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I want you to take a listen to how they sound.

56
0:02:37.337,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They're saying the same utterance.

57
0:02:39.694,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(First voice)

58
0:02:42.126,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Second voice)

59
0:02:45.743,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You probably didn't understand what they said,

60
0:02:48.155,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but I hope that you heard

61
0:02:50.009,000 --> 0:02:54,000
their unique vocal identities.

62
0:02:54.292,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So what I wanted to do next is,

63
0:02:57.105,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I wanted to find out how we could harness

64
0:02:59.489,000 --> 0:03:,000
these residual vocal abilities

65
0:03:01.31,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and build a technology

66
0:03:03.326,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that could be customized for them,

67
0:03:05.469,000 --> 0:03:07,000
voices that could be customized for them.

68
0:03:07.898,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell.

69
0:03:10.583,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis,

70
0:03:13.646,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and what he'd been doing is building

71
0:03:15.679,000 --> 0:03:16,000
personalized voices for people

72
0:03:17.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
by putting together

73
0:03:19.657,000 --> 0:03:21,000
pre-recorded samples of their voice

74
0:03:21.807,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and reconstructing a voice for them.

75
0:03:24.686,000 --> 0:03:25,000
These are people who had lost their voice

76
0:03:26.398,000 --> 0:03:27,000
later in life.

77
0:03:28.309,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We didn't have the luxury

78
0:03:29.703,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of pre-recorded samples of speech

79
0:03:31.477,000 --> 0:03:33,000
for those born with speech disorder.

80
0:03:33.769,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But I thought, there had to be a way

81
0:03:36.306,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to reverse engineer a voice

82
0:03:38.25,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from whatever little is left over.

83
0:03:40.541,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So we decided to do exactly that.

84
0:03:43.255,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation,

85
0:03:46.658,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to create custom-crafted voices that captured

86
0:03:50.223,000 --> 0:03:51,000
their unique vocal identities.

87
0:03:51.759,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D.,

88
0:03:54.962,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for vocal identity.

89
0:03:56.995,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now before I get into the details of how

90
0:03:59.669,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the voice is made and let you listen to it,

91
0:04:01.717,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay?

92
0:04:05.067,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So first, we know that the voice is changing

93
0:04:08.226,000 --> 0:04:1,000
dramatically over the course of development.

94
0:04:11.08,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Children sound different from teens

95
0:04:13.17,000 --> 0:04:14,000
who sound different from adults.

96
0:04:14.633,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We've all experienced this.

97
0:04:17.275,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Fact number two is that speech

98
0:04:20.638,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is a combination of the source,

99
0:04:23.191,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which is the vibrations generated by your voice box,

100
0:04:26.67,000 --> 0:04:27,000
which are then pushed through

101
0:04:28.609,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the rest of the vocal tract.

102
0:04:31.046,000 --> 0:04:33,000
These are the chambers of your head and neck

103
0:04:33.53,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that vibrate,

104
0:04:34.769,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they actually filter that source sound

105
0:04:36.879,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to produce consonants and vowels.

106
0:04:39.416,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So the combination of source and filter

107
0:04:43.276,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is how we produce speech.

108
0:04:45.906,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And that happens in one individual.

109
0:04:48.932,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now I told you earlier that I'd spent

110
0:04:51.558,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a good part of my career

111
0:04:53.583,000 --> 0:04:55,000
understanding and studying

112
0:04:56.036,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the source characteristics of people

113
0:04:57.994,000 --> 0:04:59,000
with severe speech disorder,

114
0:05:00.295,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and what I've found

115
0:05:01.76,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is that even though their filters were impaired,

116
0:05:05.126,000 --> 0:05:07,000
they were able to modulate their source:

117
0:05:08.087,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.

118
0:05:11.349,000 --> 0:05:14,000
These are called prosody, and I've been documenting for years

119
0:05:14.717,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that the prosodic abilities of these individuals

120
0:05:16.994,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are preserved.

121
0:05:18.569,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So when I realized that those same cues

122
0:05:22.656,000 --> 0:05:24,000
are also important for speaker identity,

123
0:05:25.425,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I had this idea.

124
0:05:27.44,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Why don't we take the source

125
0:05:29.956,000 --> 0:05:31,000
from the person we want the voice to sound like,

126
0:05:32.169,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because it's preserved,

127
0:05:33.632,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and borrow the filter

128
0:05:35.767,000 --> 0:05:38,000
from someone about the same age and size,

129
0:05:39.011,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because they can articulate speech,

130
0:05:41.418,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and then mix them?

131
0:05:43.209,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Because when we mix them,

132
0:05:44.996,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we can get a voice that's as clear

133
0:05:46.694,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as our surrogate talker --

134
0:05:48.448,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that's the person we borrowed the filter from—

135
0:05:51.043,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and is similar in identity to our target talker.

136
0:05:55.692,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's that simple.

137
0:05:57.119,000 --> 0:05:59,000
That's the science behind what we're doing.

138
0:06:00.053,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So once you have that in mind,

139
0:06:03.586,000 --> 0:06:05,000
how do you go about building this voice?

140
0:06:05.844,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Well, you have to find someone

141
0:06:07.324,000 --> 0:06:09,000
who is willing to be a surrogate.

142
0:06:09.724,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's not such an ominous thing.

143
0:06:11.988,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Being a surrogate donor

144
0:06:13.511,000 --> 0:06:15,000
only requires you to say a few hundred

145
0:06:16.299,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to a few thousand utterances.

146
0:06:18.541,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The process goes something like this.

147
0:06:20.544,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs.

148
0:06:22.734,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I love to sleep.

149
0:06:24.659,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The sky is blue without clouds.

150
0:06:28.541,000 --> 0:06:3,000
RP: Now she's going to go on like this

151
0:06:30.543,000 --> 0:06:31,000
for about three to four hours,

152
0:06:32.462,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the idea is not for her to say everything

153
0:06:35.467,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that the target is going to want to say,

154
0:06:37.512,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but the idea is to cover all the different combinations

155
0:06:40.907,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of the sounds that occur in the language.

156
0:06:44.178,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The more speech you have,

157
0:06:45.816,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the better sounding voice you're going to have.

158
0:06:48.121,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Once you have those recordings,

159
0:06:49.794,000 --> 0:06:5,000
what we need to do

160
0:06:51.207,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is we have to parse these recordings

161
0:06:53.925,000 --> 0:06:55,000
into little snippets of speech,

162
0:06:56.374,000 --> 0:06:58,000
one- or two-sound combinations,

163
0:06:58.711,000 --> 0:06:59,000
sometimes even whole words

164
0:07:00.594,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that start populating a dataset or a database.

165
0:07:05.11,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We're going to call this database a voice bank.

166
0:07:08.827,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now the power of the voice bank

167
0:07:10.923,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is that from this voice bank,

168
0:07:12.937,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we can now say any new utterance,

169
0:07:14.948,000 --> 0:07:15,000
like, "I love chocolate" --

170
0:07:16.372,000 --> 0:07:17,000
everyone needs to be able to say that—

171
0:07:18.111,000 --> 0:07:19,000
fish through that database

172
0:07:19.942,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and find all the segments necessary

173
0:07:21.882,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to say that utterance.

174
0:07:23.811,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Video) Voice: I love chocolate.

175
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:26,000
RP: So that's speech synthesis.

176
0:07:26.991,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's called concatenative synthesis, and that's what we're using.

177
0:07:29.564,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That's not the novel part.

178
0:07:31.097,000 --> 0:07:33,000
What's novel is how we make it sound

179
0:07:33.318,000 --> 0:07:34,000
like this young woman.

180
0:07:34.775,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This is Samantha.

181
0:07:36.299,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I met her when she was nine,

182
0:07:38.645,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and since then, my team and I

183
0:07:40.542,000 --> 0:07:42,000
have been trying to build her a personalized voice.

184
0:07:43.256,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We first had to find a surrogate donor,

185
0:07:46.355,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and then we had to have Samantha

186
0:07:48.173,000 --> 0:07:49,000
produce some utterances.

187
0:07:50.102,000 --> 0:07:52,000
What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds,

188
0:07:52.481,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but that's enough for us to extract

189
0:07:54.96,000 --> 0:07:56,000
her source characteristics.

190
0:07:57.245,000 --> 0:08:,000
What happens next is best described

191
0:08:00.516,000 --> 0:08:02,000
by my daughter's analogy. She's six.

192
0:08:03.283,000 --> 0:08:08,000
She calls it mixing colors to paint voices.

193
0:08:08.705,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's beautiful. It's exactly that.

194
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample

195
0:08:14.12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of red food dye which we can infuse

196
0:08:16.729,000 --> 0:08:18,000
into the recordings of her surrogate

197
0:08:19.269,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to get a pink voice just like this.

198
0:08:23.656,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah.

199
0:08:28.147,000 --> 0:08:3,000
RP: So now, Samantha can say this.

200
0:08:30.955,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Video) Samantha: This voice is only for me.

201
0:08:34.024,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends.

202
0:08:40.329,000 --> 0:08:46,000
RP: Thank you. (Applause)

203
0:08:46.746,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I'll never forget the gentle smile

204
0:08:49.079,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that spread across her face

205
0:08:50.981,000 --> 0:08:53,000
when she heard that voice for the first time.

206
0:08:54.63,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now there's millions of people

207
0:08:56.512,000 --> 0:08:58,000
around the world like Samantha, millions,

208
0:08:59.345,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and we've only begun to scratch the surface.

209
0:09:02.785,000 --> 0:09:03,000
What we've done so far is we have

210
0:09:04.427,000 --> 0:09:07,000
a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.

211
0:09:08.286,000 --> 0:09:09,000
who have donated their voices,

212
0:09:09.793,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and we have been using those

213
0:09:11.721,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to build our first few personalized voices.

214
0:09:16.193,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But there's so much more work to be done.

215
0:09:17.949,000 --> 0:09:19,000
For Samantha, her surrogate

216
0:09:20.137,000 --> 0:09:23,000
came from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger

217
0:09:23.183,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who gave her the gift of voice.

218
0:09:27.024,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And as a scientist, I'm so excited

219
0:09:29.177,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to take this work out of the laboratory

220
0:09:31.112,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and finally into the real world

221
0:09:32.912,000 --> 0:09:35,000
so it can have real-world impact.

222
0:09:36.077,000 --> 0:09:37,000
What I want to share with you next

223
0:09:37.659,000 --> 0:09:39,000
is how I envision taking this work

224
0:09:39.834,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to that next level.

225
0:09:42.545,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors

226
0:09:46.432,000 --> 0:09:49,000
from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages,

227
0:09:49.692,000 --> 0:09:52,000
coming together in this voice drive

228
0:09:52.75,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to give people voices

229
0:09:55.02,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that are as colorful as their personalities.

230
0:09:58.819,000 --> 0:10:,000
To do that as a first step,

231
0:10:01.119,000 --> 0:10:04,000
we've put together this website, VocaliD.org,

232
0:10:04.394,000 --> 0:10:05,000
as a way to bring together those

233
0:10:06.018,000 --> 0:10:08,000
who want to join us as voice donors,

234
0:10:08.693,000 --> 0:10:09,000
as expertise donors,

235
0:10:10.465,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in whatever way to make this vision a reality.

236
0:10:15.804,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They say that giving blood can save lives.

237
0:10:19.957,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Well, giving your voice can change lives.

238
0:10:24.939,000 --> 0:10:27,000
All we need is a few hours of speech

239
0:10:27.989,000 --> 0:10:28,000
from our surrogate talker,

240
0:10:29.48,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and as little as a vowel from our target talker,

241
0:10:34.213,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to create a unique vocal identity.

242
0:10:37.924,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So that's the science behind what we're doing.

243
0:10:40.55,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I want to end by circling back to the human side

244
0:10:45.005,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that is really the inspiration for this work.

245
0:10:49.107,000 --> 0:10:52,000
About five years ago, we built our very first voice

246
0:10:52.806,000 --> 0:10:54,000
for a little boy named William.

247
0:10:55.307,000 --> 0:10:57,000
When his mom first heard this voice,

248
0:10:57.664,000 --> 0:10:59,000
she said, "This is what William

249
0:11:00.009,000 --> 0:11:01,000
would have sounded like

250
0:11:01.555,000 --> 0:11:03,000
had he been able to speak."

251
0:11:04.004,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And then I saw William typing a message

252
0:11:06.422,000 --> 0:11:07,000
on his device.

253
0:11:07.784,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I wondered, what was he thinking?

254
0:11:11.077,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Imagine carrying around someone else's voice

255
0:11:14.667,000 --> 0:11:16,000
for nine years

256
0:11:16.86,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and finally finding your own voice.

257
0:11:21.704,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Imagine that.

258
0:11:23.081,000 --> 0:11:25,000
This is what William said:

259
0:11:25.878,000 --> 0:11:29,000
"Never heard me before."

260
0:11:32.417,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Thank you.

261
0:11:34.036,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

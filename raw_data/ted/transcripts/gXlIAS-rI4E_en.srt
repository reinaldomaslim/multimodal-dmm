1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is my niece, Stella.

2
0:00:15.561,000 --> 0:00:17,000
She's just turned one and started to walk.

3
0:00:18.057,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And she's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do,

4
0:00:21.057,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.

5
0:00:26.273,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It is absolutely gorgeous.

6
0:00:28.762,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And one of her favorite things to do at the moment

7
0:00:31.38,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is to stare at herself in the mirror.

8
0:00:33.844,000 --> 0:00:36,000
She absolutely loves her reflection.

9
0:00:36.999,000 --> 0:00:42,000
She giggles and squeals, and gives herself these big, wet kisses.

10
0:00:43.371,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It is beautiful.

11
0:00:45.384,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Apparently, all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this,

12
0:00:50.676,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and it got me thinking:

13
0:00:52.191,000 --> 0:00:55,000
When did I stop doing this?

14
0:00:55.648,000 --> 0:01:,000
When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look?

15
0:01:00.951,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Because apparently we don't.

16
0:01:03.636,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Ten thousand people every month google,

17
0:01:07.065,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Am I ugly?"

18
0:01:09.211,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she lives in Denver.

19
0:01:13.734,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And like any teenager, she just wants to be liked and to fit in.

20
0:01:17.708,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's Sunday night.

21
0:01:19.517,000 --> 0:01:21,000
She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.

22
0:01:22.211,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And she's slightly dreading it, and she's a bit confused because

23
0:01:24.497,000 --> 0:01:26,000
despite her mom telling her all the time

24
0:01:27.106,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that she's beautiful,

25
0:01:29.452,000 --> 0:01:34,000
every day at school, someone tells her that she's ugly.

26
0:01:35.364,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends

27
0:01:38.629,000 --> 0:01:41,000
at school, or her peers at school are telling her,

28
0:01:41.653,000 --> 0:01:43,000
she doesn't know who to believe.

29
0:01:44.018,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So, she takes a video of herself. She posts it to YouTube

30
0:01:47.967,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and she asks people to please leave a comment:

31
0:01:50.293,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"Am I pretty or am I ugly?"

32
0:01:52.41,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Well, so far, Faye has received over 13,000 comments.

33
0:01:57.415,000 --> 0:02:,000
Some of them are so nasty, they don't bear thinking about.

34
0:02:01.019,000 --> 0:02:06,000
This is an average, healthy-looking teenage girl receiving this feedback

35
0:02:06.95,000 --> 0:02:1,000
at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life.

36
0:02:11.184,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Thousands of people are posting videos like this,

37
0:02:15.081,000 --> 0:02:18,000
mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.

38
0:02:18.918,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But what's leading them to do this?

39
0:02:20.867,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.

40
0:02:24.774,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They're under pressure to be online and available at all times,

41
0:02:29.604,000 --> 0:02:33,000
talking, messaging, liking, commenting, sharing, posting —

42
0:02:34.145,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it never ends.

43
0:02:36.062,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Never before have we been so connected,

44
0:02:39.012,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.

45
0:02:43.772,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night.

46
0:02:48.632,000 --> 0:02:51,000
There's simply no privacy.

47
0:02:52.071,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And the social pressures that go along with that are relentless.

48
0:02:56.424,000 --> 0:03:,000
This always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves

49
0:03:01.302,000 --> 0:03:02,000
based on the number of likes they get

50
0:03:03.013,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and the types of comments that they receive.

51
0:03:06.012,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There's no separation between online and offline life.

52
0:03:10.591,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between.

53
0:03:16.164,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And it's also really hard to tell the difference between what's authentic

54
0:03:19.955,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and what's digitally manipulated.

55
0:03:22.241,000 --> 0:03:27,000
What's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of everyday.

56
0:03:27.886,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And where are they looking to for inspiration?

57
0:03:31.017,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds

58
0:03:34.829,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of girls today.

59
0:03:36.441,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.

60
0:03:39.655,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Airbrushing is now routine.

61
0:03:42.312,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,

62
0:03:44.923,000 --> 0:03:46,000
#bikinibridge and #proana.

63
0:03:47.042,000 --> 0:03:5,000
For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.

64
0:03:50.586,000 --> 0:03:54,000
These trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification

65
0:03:55.427,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of women in today's popular culture.

66
0:03:57.631,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against.

67
0:04:03.608,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But boys are not immune to this either.

68
0:04:06.057,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero-like sports stars

69
0:04:11.189,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and playboy music artists.

70
0:04:13.707,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But, what's the problem with all of this?

71
0:04:16.079,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, well balanced individuals.

72
0:04:23.132,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But in an image-obsessed culture, we are training our kids

73
0:04:27.008,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance

74
0:04:31.816,000 --> 0:04:35,000
at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities.

75
0:04:36.111,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So, things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities,

76
0:04:40.221,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and their studies and so on begin to suffer.

77
0:04:44.256,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do something because they don't

78
0:04:49.858,000 --> 0:04:5,000
think they look good enough.

79
0:04:51.722,000 --> 0:04:53,000
These are not trivial activities.

80
0:04:54.104,000 --> 0:04:57,000
These are fundamental activities to their development as humans

81
0:04:58.008,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and as contributors to society and to the workforce.

82
0:05:03.358,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Thirty-one percent, nearly one in three teenagers, are withdrawing

83
0:05:09.279,000 --> 0:05:1,000
from classroom debate. They're failing

84
0:05:10.851,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to engage in classroom debate because

85
0:05:12.982,000 --> 0:05:15,000
they don't want to draw attention to the way that they look.

86
0:05:16.232,000 --> 0:05:18,000
One in five are not showing up to class at all

87
0:05:19.089,000 --> 0:05:21,000
on days when they don't feel good about it.

88
0:05:21.456,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And when it comes to exams,

89
0:05:22.876,000 --> 0:05:24,000
if you don't think you look good enough,

90
0:05:25.225,000 --> 0:05:28,000
specifically if you don't think you are thin enough,

91
0:05:28.561,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you will score a lower grade point average

92
0:05:31.667,000 --> 0:05:33,000
than your peers who are not concerned with this.

93
0:05:34.464,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.

94
0:05:37.607,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh.

95
0:05:43.664,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So to be super clear, we're talking about the

96
0:05:46.546,000 --> 0:05:51,000
way you think you look, not how you actually look.

97
0:05:51.789,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement.

98
0:05:56.544,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But it's also damaging health.

99
0:05:58.952,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity,

100
0:06:02.534,000 --> 0:06:04,000
eat less fruits and vegetables,

101
0:06:04.657,000 --> 0:06:07,000
partake in more unhealthy weight control practices

102
0:06:07.692,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that can lead to eating disorders.

103
0:06:10.101,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They have lower self-esteem.

104
0:06:12.654,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They're more easily influenced by people around them

105
0:06:14.74,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and they're at greater risk of depression.

106
0:06:17.488,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks

107
0:06:21.416,000 --> 0:06:24,000
with things like alcohol and drug use;

108
0:06:25.141,000 --> 0:06:3,000
crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; unprotected, earlier sex;

109
0:06:30.552,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and self-harm.

110
0:06:32.682,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems

111
0:06:36.816,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and costing our governments billions of dollars every year.

112
0:06:41.263,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And we don't grow out of it.

113
0:06:43.916,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Women who think they're overweight — again,

114
0:06:46.815,000 --> 0:06:48,000
regardless of whether they are or are not —

115
0:06:49.567,000 --> 0:06:52,000
have higher rates of absenteeism.

116
0:06:52.877,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Seventeen percent of women would

117
0:06:54.934,000 --> 0:06:56,000
not show up to a job interview on

118
0:06:57.651,000 --> 0:07:02,000
a day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look.

119
0:07:02.961,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Have a think about what this is doing

120
0:07:04.866,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to our economy.

121
0:07:06.582,000 --> 0:07:07,000
If we could overcome this, what that

122
0:07:08.444,000 --> 0:07:1,000
opportunity looks like.

123
0:07:10.754,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Unlocking this potential is in the interest

124
0:07:13.349,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of every single one of us.

125
0:07:16.609,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But how do we do that?

126
0:07:18.181,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.

127
0:07:22.153,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's not enough by itself.

128
0:07:24.037,000 --> 0:07:25,000
If you actually want to make a difference,

129
0:07:25.462,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you have to do something.

130
0:07:27.598,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And we've learned there are three key ways:

131
0:07:30.672,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The first is we have to educate for body confidence.

132
0:07:33.314,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We have to help our teenagers develop

133
0:07:35.236,000 --> 0:07:38,000
strategies to overcome image-related pressures

134
0:07:38.581,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and build their self-esteem.

135
0:07:40.131,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, the good news is that there are

136
0:07:42.117,000 --> 0:07:45,000
many programs out there available to do this.

137
0:07:46.07,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The bad news is that most of them don't work.

138
0:07:49.82,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning

139
0:07:54.527,000 --> 0:07:57,000
programs are inadvertently actually

140
0:07:57.755,000 --> 0:08:,000
making the situation worse.

141
0:08:01.15,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we need to make damn sure that

142
0:08:02.856,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the programs that our kids are receiving

143
0:08:05.459,000 --> 0:08:06,000
are not only having a positive impact,

144
0:08:07.419,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but having a lasting impact as well.

145
0:08:10.387,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And the research shows that the best programs

146
0:08:13.779,000 --> 0:08:15,000
address six key areas:

147
0:08:15.854,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.

148
0:08:19.917,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The second is media and celebrity culture,

149
0:08:23.381,000 --> 0:08:25,000
then how to handle teasing and bullying,

150
0:08:25.433,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the way we compete and compare with one another

151
0:08:27.425,000 --> 0:08:28,000
based on looks,

152
0:08:28.962,000 --> 0:08:29,000
talking about appearance — some people

153
0:08:30.712,000 --> 0:08:32,000
call this "body talk" or "fat talk" —

154
0:08:33.219,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and finally, the foundations of respecting

155
0:08:35.693,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and looking after yourself.

156
0:08:37.467,000 --> 0:08:39,000
These six things are crucial starting points

157
0:08:39.94,000 --> 0:08:41,000
for anyone serious about delivering

158
0:08:42.831,000 --> 0:08:44,000
body-confidence education that works.

159
0:08:45.768,000 --> 0:08:47,000
An education is critical,

160
0:08:48.074,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but tackling this problem is going

161
0:08:49.895,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to require each and everyone of us

162
0:08:52.665,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to step up and be better role models

163
0:08:55.255,000 --> 0:08:57,000
for the women and girls in our own lives.

164
0:08:58.233,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Challenging the status quo of how

165
0:09:00.166,000 --> 0:09:03,000
women are seen and talked about in our own circles.

166
0:09:03.17,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It is not okay that we judge the contribution

167
0:09:07.212,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of our politicians by their haircuts

168
0:09:10.37,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or the size of their breasts,

169
0:09:12.099,000 --> 0:09:15,000
or to infer that the determination or the success

170
0:09:15.464,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of an Olympian is down to her not being a looker.

171
0:09:18.697,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We need to start judging people by what they do,

172
0:09:21.803,000 --> 0:09:23,000
not what they look like.

173
0:09:24.354,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures

174
0:09:28.718,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and comments that we post

175
0:09:30.361,000 --> 0:09:32,000
on our own social networks.

176
0:09:32.548,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We can compliment people based on their effort

177
0:09:36.777,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and their actions

178
0:09:38.18,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and not on their appearance.

179
0:09:40.861,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And let me ask you,

180
0:09:42.375,000 --> 0:09:43,000
when was the last time that you

181
0:09:43.663,000 --> 0:09:44,000
kissed a mirror?

182
0:09:45.519,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Ultimately, we need to work together

183
0:09:47.812,000 --> 0:09:49,000
as communities, as governments

184
0:09:50.236,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and as businesses to really change this culture of ours

185
0:09:54.701,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves,

186
0:09:59.306,000 --> 0:10:03,000
valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.

187
0:10:03.969,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We need to put the people that are making a real difference

188
0:10:06.765,000 --> 0:10:09,000
on our pedestals, making a difference

189
0:10:10.173,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in the real world.

190
0:10:12.153,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Giving them the airtime, because only then

191
0:10:14.863,000 --> 0:10:15,000
will we create a different world.

192
0:10:16.728,000 --> 0:10:19,000
A world where our kids are free to become

193
0:10:20.057,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the best versions of themselves,

194
0:10:23.302,000 --> 0:10:24,000
where the way they think they look

195
0:10:25.248,000 --> 0:10:27,000
never holds them back from being who they are

196
0:10:27.889,000 --> 0:10:29,000
or achieving what they want in life.

197
0:10:30.835,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Think about what this might mean for someone in your life.

198
0:10:35.053,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Who have you got in mind?

199
0:10:36.551,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Is it your wife?

200
0:10:37.956,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Your sister?

201
0:10:39.344,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Your daughter?

202
0:10:40.993,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Your niece?

203
0:10:42.266,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Your friend? It could just be the woman a couple of seats away

204
0:10:45.329,000 --> 0:10:46,000
from you today.

205
0:10:46.624,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What would it mean for her

206
0:10:49.314,000 --> 0:10:52,000
if she were freed from that voice

207
0:10:53.072,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of her inner critic, nagging her to have

208
0:10:56.106,000 --> 0:10:58,000
longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,

209
0:10:58.897,000 --> 0:10:59,000
shorter feet?

210
0:11:00.332,000 --> 0:11:03,000
What could it mean for her if we overcame this

211
0:11:03.7,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and unlocked her potential in that way?

212
0:11:08.213,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Right now, our culture's obsession

213
0:11:12.035,000 --> 0:11:15,000
with image is holding us all back.

214
0:11:15.39,000 --> 0:11:17,000
But let's show our kids the truth.

215
0:11:17.917,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Let's show them that the way you look

216
0:11:19.932,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is just one part of your identity

217
0:11:23.647,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and that the truth is we love them

218
0:11:26.36,000 --> 0:11:27,000
for who they are

219
0:11:27.931,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and what they do

220
0:11:29.898,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and how they make us feel.

221
0:11:32.598,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.

222
0:11:36.683,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Let's each and every one of us change the way

223
0:11:39.343,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we talk and compare ourselves to other people.

224
0:11:42.778,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And let's work together as communities,

225
0:11:45.508,000 --> 0:11:47,000
from grassroots to governments,

226
0:11:48.302,000 --> 0:11:5,000
so that the happy little one-year-olds

227
0:11:50.477,000 --> 0:11:52,000
of today become the confident

228
0:11:53.354,000 --> 0:11:55,000
changemakers of tomorrow.

229
0:11:55.969,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Let's do this.

230
0:11:57.986,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Applause)

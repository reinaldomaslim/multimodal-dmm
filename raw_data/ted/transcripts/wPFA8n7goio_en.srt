0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the overwhelming complexity

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and richness that we experience at the conference

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in a project called Big Viz.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that were made by two visual artists.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
David Sibbet from The Grove,

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk,

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
made 650 sketches that strive to capture

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the essence of each presenter's ideas.

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the consensus was: it really worked.

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
These sketches brought to life the key ideas,

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the portraits, the magic moments

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that we all experienced last year.

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This year we were thinking, "Why does it work?"

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What is it about animation,

17
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?

18
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And this is an important question to ask and answer

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning,

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the better we can communicate,

21
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.

22
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So this year we're going to visualize how

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the brain visualizes.

24
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain

25
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
doesn't actually see the world as it is,

26
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but instead, creates a series of mental models

27
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
through a collection of "Ah-ha moments,"

28
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or moments of discovery, through various processes.

29
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The processing, of course, begins with the eyes.

30
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated,

31
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain,

32
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
at the primary visual cortex.

33
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry,

34
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
just the simplest of shapes.

35
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But it also acts like a kind of relay station

36
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that re-radiates and redirects information

37
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to many other parts of the brain.

38
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense,

39
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
create more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.

40
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We're only going to talk about three of them.

41
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So the first one is called the ventral stream.

42
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's on this side of the brain.

43
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.

44
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's the "what" detector.

45
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book.

46
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So that's the part of the brain that is activated

47
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
when you give a word to something.

48
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.

49
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And what it does is locates the object

50
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in physical body space.

51
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So if you look around the stage here

52
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.

53
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.

54
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.

55
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The third part that I'd like to talk about

56
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is the limbic system.

57
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.

58
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And it's the part that feels.

59
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image

60
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and you go, "Oh! I have a strong

61
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing."

62
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So the combination of these processing centers

63
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
help us make meaning in very different ways.

64
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So what can we learn about this? How can we apply this insight?

65
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Well, again, the schematic view

66
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.

67
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information

68
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
asking a whole bunch of questions

69
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to create a unified mental model.

70
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So, for example, when you look at this image

71
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a good graphic invites the eye to dart around,

72
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to selectively create a visual logic.

73
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.

74
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's the selective logic.

75
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information.

76
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built

77
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel

78
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
where we quite literally create an infinite wall.

79
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.

80
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery

81
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
enriches meaning.

82
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It activates a different part of the brain.

83
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then the limbic system

84
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is activated when we see motion, when we see color,

85
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors

86
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that we've heard about before.

87
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So the point of this is what?

88
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We make meaning by seeing,

89
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
by an act of visual interrogation.

90
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The lessons for us are three-fold.

91
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.

92
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Secondly make those images interactive

93
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so that we engage much more fully.

94
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And the third is to augment memory

95
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
by creating a visual persistence.

96
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
These are techniques that can be used to be --

97
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving.

98
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So the low-tech version looks like this.

99
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And, by the way, this is the way in which

100
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we develop and formulate

101
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
strategy within Autodesk,

102
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in some of our organizations and some of our divisions.

103
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
What we literally do is have the teams

104
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
draw out the entire strategic plan

105
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
on one giant wall.

106
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else.

107
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
There's always a room, always a place

108
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to be able to make sense of all of the components

109
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in the strategic plan.

110
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This is a time-lapse view of it.

111
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"

112
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You'll be able to figure that out. (Laughter)

113
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So the act of collectively and collaboratively

114
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
building the image

115
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
transforms the collaboration.

116
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
No Powerpoint is used in two days.

117
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But instead the entire team

118
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
creates a shared mental model

119
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that they can all agree on and move forward on.

120
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And this can be enhanced and augmented with

121
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
some emerging digital technology.

122
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And this is our great unveiling for today.

123
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And this is an emerging set of technologies

124
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that use large-screen displays

125
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
with intelligent calculation in the background

126
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to make the invisible visible.

127
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Here what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.

128
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So a team can actually look at

129
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
all the key components that heat the structure

130
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and make choices and then see the end result

131
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that is visualized on this screen.

132
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So making images meaningful has three components.

133
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.

134
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Secondly, making them interactive.

135
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then thirdly, making them persistent.

136
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I believe that these three principles

137
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems

138
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that we face in the world today. Thanks so much.

139
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.349,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.

2
0:00:19.124,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This might be the most important sneaker in history.

3
0:00:23.111,000 --> 0:00:24,000
First released in 1988,

4
0:00:24.938,000 --> 0:00:27,000
this is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it.

5
0:00:29.046,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage,

6
0:00:32.864,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and perhaps saved Nike.

7
0:00:34.907,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers

8
0:00:37.844,000 --> 0:00:38,000
what the iPhone did for phones.

9
0:00:40.11,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's been re-released four times.

10
0:00:42.637,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Every celebrity's been seen wearing it.

11
0:00:44.805,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement.

12
0:00:47.484,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's been right under your nose for decades

13
0:00:50.148,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and you never looked down.

14
0:00:52.577,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And right about now,

15
0:00:54.367,000 --> 0:00:57,000
most of you are probably thinking, "Sneakers?"

16
0:00:58.097,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.076,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Yes.

18
0:01:01.262,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Yes, sneakers.

19
0:01:03.805,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Some extraordinary things about sneakers

20
0:01:07.412,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and data

21
0:01:09.025,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and Nike

22
0:01:10.524,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and how they're all related, possibly, to the future of all online commerce.

23
0:01:15.259,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In 2011,

24
0:01:16.443,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released,

25
0:01:19.446,000 --> 0:01:21,000
at a retail of 160 dollars,

26
0:01:21.803,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it sold out globally in minutes.

27
0:01:24.286,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores

28
0:01:27.303,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for days before it went on sale.

29
0:01:29.399,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And just minutes after that,

30
0:01:30.867,000 --> 0:01:33,000
thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail.

31
0:01:34.923,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay right now, four years later.

32
0:01:40.107,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But here's the thing:

33
0:01:41.729,000 --> 0:01:44,000
this happens every single Saturday.

34
0:01:45.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Every week there's another release or two or three,

35
0:01:48.131,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and every shoe has a story

36
0:01:50.409,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as rich and compelling as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.

37
0:01:54.069,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads --

38
0:01:58.249,000 --> 0:02:01,000
people who collect sneakers --

39
0:02:02.049,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and my daughter.

40
0:02:03.321,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:05.27,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.

42
0:02:08.244,000 --> 0:02:11,000
For the brands, sneakerheads are a very important demographic.

43
0:02:11.437,000 --> 0:02:14,000
These are the tastemakers; these are the Apple fanboys.

44
0:02:15.383,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Because who else is going to buy

45
0:02:16.946,000 --> 0:02:19,000
a pair of $8,000 Back to the Future sneakers?

46
0:02:20.603,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:22.465,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Yeah, 8,000 dollars.

48
0:02:25.364,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And while that's obviously the anomaly,

49
0:02:27.739,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the resell sneaker market is definitely not.

50
0:02:30.941,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Thirty years in the making,

51
0:02:32.789,000 --> 0:02:33,000
what started as an underground culture

52
0:02:34.749,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much --

53
0:02:37.754,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:40.524,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now we have sneaker addictions.

55
0:02:42.758,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In a market where in the past 12 months,

56
0:02:44.71,000 --> 0:02:46,000
there have been over nine million pairs of shoes

57
0:02:46.988,000 --> 0:02:48,000
resold in the United States alone,

58
0:02:49.405,000 --> 0:02:53,000
at a value of 1.2 billion dollars.

59
0:02:53.669,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And that's a conservative estimate --

60
0:02:55.732,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I should know, I am a sneakerhead.

61
0:02:58.959,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is my collection.

62
0:03:00.981,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In the pantheon of great collections, mine doesn't even register.

63
0:03:05.392,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I have about 250 pairs, but trust me, I am small-time.

64
0:03:08.462,000 --> 0:03:09,000
People have thousands.

65
0:03:10.759,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I'm a very typical 37-year-old sneakerhead.

66
0:03:14.139,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played,

67
0:03:16.796,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I always wanted Air Jordans,

68
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,

69
0:03:20.153,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans --

70
0:03:22.57,000 --> 0:03:24,000
literally, we all have the exact same story.

71
0:03:24.667,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But here's where mine diverged.

72
0:03:27.166,000 --> 0:03:31,000
After starting three companies, I took a job as a strategy consultant,

73
0:03:31.285,000 --> 0:03:34,000
when I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data.

74
0:03:35.95,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But I learned, because I had to,

75
0:03:38.762,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I liked it.

76
0:03:40.08,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data,

77
0:03:43.516,000 --> 0:03:45,000
just to play with for my own amusement.

78
0:03:45.949,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The goal was to develop a price guide,

79
0:03:47.846,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a real data-driven view of the market.

80
0:03:50.373,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions,

81
0:03:54.726,000 --> 0:03:56,000
providing real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers.

82
0:03:58.331,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases.

83
0:04:02.54,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Others have used the data to validate insurance claims.

84
0:04:06.781,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And the top investment banks in the world

85
0:04:08.786,000 --> 0:04:12,000
now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry.

86
0:04:13.416,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And here's the best part:

87
0:04:15.03,000 --> 0:04:18,000
sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.

88
0:04:18.583,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:20.617,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time,

90
0:04:23.614,000 --> 0:04:24,000
compare it to others,

91
0:04:24.789,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and have access to the same analytics you might

92
0:04:27.043,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for your online brokerage account.

93
0:04:28.987,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which 352 are his.

94
0:04:33.915,000 --> 0:04:35,000
He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --

95
0:04:36.828,000 --> 0:04:38,000
frankly, a modest collection.

96
0:04:38.853,000 --> 0:04:41,000
At the asset level, he can see gain-loss by shoe.

97
0:04:42.486,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Here he's made over 600 dollars on one pair.

98
0:04:46.183,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I have one of those.

99
0:04:47.538,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:50.655,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So an unregulated 1.2 billion dollar industry

101
0:04:54.126,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that thrives as much on the street as it does online,

102
0:04:56.719,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers?

103
0:05:01.113,000 --> 0:05:04,000
At some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market,

104
0:05:04.273,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and two comparisons started to emerge.

105
0:05:06.612,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?

106
0:05:10.387,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:11.612,000 --> 0:05:12,000
In fact, one guy emailed to say

108
0:05:13.504,000 --> 0:05:17,000
he thought his 15-year-old son was selling drugs

109
0:05:17.792,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and later found out he was selling sneakers.

110
0:05:20.853,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:22.757,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And now they use the data to do it together.

112
0:05:25.711,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity

113
0:05:28.433,000 --> 0:05:29,000
where none other exists.

114
0:05:29.616,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs.

115
0:05:32.677,000 --> 0:05:33,000
How about all kids?

116
0:05:34.391,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You have to be 18 to play the stock market.

117
0:05:37.967,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,

118
0:05:40.331,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Blow Pops in ninth grade

119
0:05:41.933,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and collected baseball cards through high school.

120
0:05:44.378,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The cards are long dead,

121
0:05:46.199,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and the candy market's usually quite local.

122
0:05:49.122,000 --> 0:05:54,000
For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity --

123
0:05:54.873,000 --> 0:05:57,000
a democratized stock market,

124
0:05:58.664,000 --> 0:06:,000
but also unregulated.

125
0:06:00.759,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Which is why the story you're probably most familiar with

126
0:06:03.565,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is people killing each other for sneakers.

127
0:06:06.606,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And while that definitely happens and is tragic,

128
0:06:10.405,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe.

129
0:06:14.274,000 --> 0:06:18,000
In fact, it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story.

130
0:06:18.483,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So sneakers have clear similarities

131
0:06:20.203,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade,

132
0:06:23.331,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor.

133
0:06:27.752,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Someone is making the rules.

134
0:06:30.988,000 --> 0:06:33,000
In the case of sneakers, that someone is Nike.

135
0:06:35.91,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Let me walk you through some numbers.

136
0:06:38.186,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The resell market, we know, is $1.2 billion.

137
0:06:41.446,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Nike, including Jordan brand,

138
0:06:43.768,000 --> 0:06:47,000
accounts for 96 percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market.

139
0:06:48.308,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Just complete domination.

140
0:06:49.924,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Sneakerheads love Jordans.

141
0:06:52.536,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And profit on the secondary market is about a third.

142
0:06:55.571,000 --> 0:07:,000
That means that sneakerheads made 380 million dollars

143
0:07:00.665,000 --> 0:07:01,000
selling Nikes last year.

144
0:07:03.03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Let's jump to retail for a second.

145
0:07:05.071,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Skechers, earlier this year,

146
0:07:06.515,000 --> 0:07:08,000
became the number two footwear brand in the country,

147
0:07:09.329,000 --> 0:07:11,000
surpassing Adidas -- this was a big deal.

148
0:07:12.187,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And in the 12 months ending in June,

149
0:07:14.985,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Skechers's net income was 209 million dollars.

150
0:07:19.853,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That means that Nike's customers

151
0:07:23.211,000 --> 0:07:26,000
make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor.

152
0:07:27.758,000 --> 0:07:28,000
That --

153
0:07:29.581,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:33.029,000 --> 0:07:34,000
How is that even possible?

155
0:07:36.249,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The sneaker market is just supply and demand,

156
0:07:38.854,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but Nike's gotten very good at using supply -- limited sneakers --

157
0:07:43.6,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit.

158
0:07:47.437,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So it's really just supply.

159
0:07:49.473,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Sneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.

160
0:07:53.262,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars do so because they're very rare.

161
0:07:57.095,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's no different than any other collectible market,

162
0:07:59.885,000 --> 0:08:02,000
only this isn't a market at all.

163
0:08:03.508,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's a false construct created by Nike --

164
0:08:05.977,000 --> 0:08:09,000
ingeniously created by Nike, in the most positive sense -- to sell more shoes.

165
0:08:10.613,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And in the process,

166
0:08:11.788,000 --> 0:08:14,000
it provided tens of thousands of people with life-long passions,

167
0:08:15.18,000 --> 0:08:16,000
myself included.

168
0:08:17.488,000 --> 0:08:2,000
If Nike wanted to kill the resell market, they could do so tomorrow,

169
0:08:20.727,000 --> 0:08:22,000
all they have to do is release more shoes.

170
0:08:22.783,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But we certainly don't want them to, nor is it in their best interest.

171
0:08:27.345,000 --> 0:08:31,000
That's because unlike Apple, who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one,

172
0:08:31.606,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Nike doesn't make their money by just selling $200 sneakers.

173
0:08:35.448,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars.

174
0:08:39.146,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing

175
0:08:41.709,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and the hype and the PR and the brand cachet,

176
0:08:44.263,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and enable Nike to sell millions of $60 sneakers.

177
0:08:49.501,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It's marketing.

178
0:08:50.906,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before --

179
0:08:54.042,000 --> 0:08:55,000
this isn't in any textbook.

180
0:08:55.486,000 --> 0:08:58,000
For 15 years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market,

181
0:08:59.05,000 --> 0:09:03,000
with a Facebook-level hyped IPO every single weekend.

182
0:09:03.537,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Drive by any Footlocker at 8am on a Saturday morning,

183
0:09:06.234,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and there will be a line down the street and around the block,

184
0:09:09.209,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week.

185
0:09:12.437,000 --> 0:09:15,000
You know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year?

186
0:09:16.232,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Nike lines happen 104 times more often.

187
0:09:21.075,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So Nike sets the rules.

188
0:09:22.627,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And they do so by controlling supply and distribution.

189
0:09:26.014,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But once a pair leaves the retail channel, it's the Wild West.

190
0:09:30.5,000 --> 0:09:35,000
There are very few -- if any -- legal, unregulated markets of this size.

191
0:09:36.48,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So Nike is definitely not the stock exchange.

192
0:09:39.827,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In fact, there is no central exchange.

193
0:09:42.634,000 --> 0:09:46,000
By last count, there were 48 different online markets that I know of.

194
0:09:48.61,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Some are eBay clones, some are mobile markets,

195
0:09:51.502,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and then you have consignment shops and brick-and-mortar stores,

196
0:09:54.548,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and sneaker conventions, and reseller sites,

197
0:09:56.636,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --

198
0:09:59.065,000 --> 0:10:02,000
literally, anywhere sneakerheads come into contact with each other,

199
0:10:02.621,000 --> 0:10:03,000
shoes will be bought and sold.

200
0:10:05.504,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But that means no efficiencies, no transparency,

201
0:10:10.539,000 --> 0:10:12,000
sometimes not even authenticity.

202
0:10:13.584,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Can you imagine if that's how stocks were bought?

203
0:10:17.125,000 --> 0:10:19,000
What if the way to buy a share of Apple stock

204
0:10:19.433,000 --> 0:10:21,000
was to search over 100 places online and off,

205
0:10:22.312,000 --> 0:10:24,000
including every time you walk down the street

206
0:10:24.559,000 --> 0:10:26,000
just hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock?

207
0:10:27.221,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Never knowing who had the best price,

208
0:10:29.112,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or even if the stock you were looking at was real.

209
0:10:31.703,000 --> 0:10:32,000
That would surely make you say:

210
0:10:33.544,000 --> 0:10:35,000
[WTF?]

211
0:10:35.622,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Of course that's not how we buy stock.

212
0:10:38.904,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But what if that's not how we need to buy sneakers either?

213
0:10:42.923,000 --> 0:10:43,000
What if the inverse is true,

214
0:10:44.329,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and what if we could buy sneakers

215
0:10:45.939,000 --> 0:10:46,000
exactly the same way as we buy stock?

216
0:10:47.756,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And what if it wasn't just sneakers, but any similar product,

217
0:10:50.669,000 --> 0:10:52,000
like watches and handbags and women's shoes,

218
0:10:52.796,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and any collectible, any seasonal item and any markdown item?

219
0:10:56.168,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What if there was a stock market for commerce?

220
0:11:00.046,000 --> 0:11:02,000
A stock market of things.

221
0:11:04.167,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner,

222
0:11:08.514,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions

223
0:11:11.778,000 --> 0:11:12,000
you can with the stock market.

224
0:11:13.385,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Shorts and options and futures

225
0:11:15.012,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and well, maybe you see where this is going.

226
0:11:18.146,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things.

227
0:11:22.997,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Because if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,

228
0:11:29.293,000 --> 0:11:31,000
you could either be wearing them onstage,

229
0:11:31.714,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:33.657,000 --> 0:11:36,000
or have earned 162 percent on your money --

231
0:11:37.67,000 --> 0:11:4,000
double the S&P and 20 percent more than Apple.

232
0:11:41.039,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

233
0:11:43.203,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And that's why we're talking about sneakers.

234
0:11:46.228,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Thank you.

235
0:11:47.403,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

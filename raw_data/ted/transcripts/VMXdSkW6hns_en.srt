1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I remember my aunt brushing my hair when I was a child.

2
0:00:16.52,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I felt this tingling in my stomach,

3
0:00:18.64,000 --> 0:00:2,000
this swelling in my belly.

4
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:22,000
All her attention on me,

5
0:00:23.36,000 --> 0:00:24,000
just me.

6
0:00:25.12,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My beautiful Aunt Bea,

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
stroking my hair with a fine-bristled brush.

8
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Do you have a memory like that that you can feel in your body right now?

9
0:00:35.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Before language,

10
0:00:37.4,000 --> 0:00:38,000
we're all sensation.

11
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
As children, that's how we learn

12
0:00:40.88,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to differentiate ourselves in the world -- through touch.

13
0:00:43.6,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Everything goes in the mouth, the hands, on the skin.

14
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Sensation --

15
0:00:48.76,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it is the way that we first experience love.

16
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's the basis of human connection.

17
0:00:56.64,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We want our children to grow up to have healthy intimate relationships.

18
0:01:00.56,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So as parents,

19
0:01:01.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
one of the things that we do is we teach our children about sex.

20
0:01:04.88,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We have books to help us,

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
we have sex ed at school for the basics.

22
0:01:08.96,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There's porn to fill in the gaps --

23
0:01:11.32,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it will fill in the gaps.

24
0:01:13.2,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:14.48,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We teach our children "the talk" about biology and mechanics,

26
0:01:18.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
about pregnancy and safe sex,

27
0:01:20.48,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and that's what our kids grow up thinking that sex is pretty much all about.

28
0:01:24.6,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But we can do better than that.

29
0:01:26.8,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We can teach our sons and daughters about pleasure and desire,

30
0:01:31.32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
about consent and boundaries,

31
0:01:33.6,000 --> 0:01:36,000
about what it feels like to be present in their body

32
0:01:37.28,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and to know when they're not.

33
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And we do that in the ways that we model touch, play,

34
0:01:43.48,000 --> 0:01:44,000
make eye contact --

35
0:01:45.24,000 --> 0:01:47,000
all the ways that we engage their senses.

36
0:01:48.4,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We can teach our children not just about sex,

37
0:01:50.96,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but about sensuality.

38
0:01:54.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is the kind of talk that I needed as a girl.

39
0:01:56.48,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I was extremely sensitive,

40
0:01:58.84,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but by the time I was an adolescent,

41
0:02:00.6,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I had numbed out.

42
0:02:02.12,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The shame of boys mocking my changing body

43
0:02:04.88,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and then girls exiling me for,

44
0:02:06.88,000 --> 0:02:08,000
ironically, my interest in boys,

45
0:02:09.72,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it was so much.

46
0:02:13.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I didn't have any language for what I was experiencing;

47
0:02:15.84,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I didn't know it was going to pass.

48
0:02:17.56,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I did the best thing I could at the time

49
0:02:20.12,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I checked out.

50
0:02:22.199,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And you can't isolate just the difficult feelings,

51
0:02:24.6,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so I lost access to the joy, the pleasure, the play,

52
0:02:27.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and I spent decades like that,

53
0:02:28.8,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with this his low-grade depression,

54
0:02:30.52,000 --> 0:02:32,000
thinking that this is what it meant to be a grown-up.

55
0:02:35.24,000 --> 0:02:36,000
For the past year,

56
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I've been interviewing men and women about their relationship to sex

57
0:02:39.72,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I've heard my story again and again.

58
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Girls who were told they were too sensitive, too much.

59
0:02:44.28,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Boys who were taught to man up --

60
0:02:46.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"don't be so emotional."

61
0:02:48.28,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I learned I was not alone in checking out.

62
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It was my daughter who reminded me of how much I used to feel.

63
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We were at the beach.

64
0:03:01.72,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It was this rare day.

65
0:03:03.08,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I turned off my cell phone,

66
0:03:05.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
put in the calendar, "Day at the beach with the girls."

67
0:03:08.48,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I laid our towels down just out of reach of the surf

68
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and fell asleep.

69
0:03:14.6,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And when I woke up,

70
0:03:15.88,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I saw my daughter drizzling sand on her arm like this,

71
0:03:21.76,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and I could feel that light tickle of sand on her skin

72
0:03:27.04,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I remembered my aunt brushing my hair.

73
0:03:31.04,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So I curled up next to her

74
0:03:32.76,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I drizzled sand on her other arm and then her legs.

75
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And then I said, "Hey, you want me to bury you?"

76
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And her eyes got really big and she was like, "Yeah!"

77
0:03:43.8,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So we dug a hole

78
0:03:45.08,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I covered her in sand and shells

79
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and drew this little mermaid tail.

80
0:03:49.468,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And then I took her home and lathered her up in the shower

81
0:03:52.2,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and massaged her scalp

82
0:03:53.48,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and I dried her off in a towel.

83
0:03:55.944,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I thought,

84
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"Ah. How many times had I done that --

85
0:03:59.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
bathed her and dried her off --

86
0:04:01.48,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but had I ever stopped and paid attention

87
0:04:03.96,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to the sensations that I was creating for her?"

88
0:04:07.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I'd been treating her like she was on some assembly line

89
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
of children needing to be fed and put to bed.

90
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And I realized

91
0:04:14.4,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that when I dry my daughter off in a towel tenderly the way a lover would,

92
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I'm teaching her to expect that kind of touch.

93
0:04:24.36,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I'm teaching her in that moment about intimacy.

94
0:04:27.36,000 --> 0:04:29,000
About how to love her body and respect her body.

95
0:04:31.519,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I realized there are parts of the talk that can't be conveyed in words.

96
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In her book, "Girls and Sex,"

97
0:04:38.88,000 --> 0:04:4,000
writer Peggy Orenstein finds

98
0:04:41.2,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that young women are focusing on their partner's pleasure,

99
0:04:44.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
not their own.

100
0:04:47.04,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This is something I'm going to talk about with my girls when they're older,

101
0:04:50.64,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but for now, I look for ways to help them identify what gives them pleasure

102
0:04:54.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and to practice articulating that.

103
0:04:58.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Rub my back," my daughter says when I tuck her in.

104
0:05:01.28,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I say, "OK, how do you want me to rub your back?"

105
0:05:05.52,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"I don't know," she says.

106
0:05:07.48,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So I pause, waiting for her directions.

107
0:05:10.6,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Finally she says, "OK, up and to the right,

108
0:05:12.68,000 --> 0:05:13,000
like you're tickling me."

109
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I run my fingertips up her spine.

110
0:05:16.4,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"What else?" I ask.

111
0:05:18.2,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Over to the left, a little harder now."

112
0:05:21.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We need to teach our children how to articulate their sensations

113
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so they're familiar with them.

114
0:05:27.24,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I look for ways to play games with my girls at home to do this.

115
0:05:30.68,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I scratch my fingernails on my daughter's arm and say,

116
0:05:33.28,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"Give me one word to describe this."

117
0:05:35.92,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"Violent," she says.

118
0:05:38.24,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I embrace her, hold her tight.

119
0:05:40.24,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"Protected," she tells me.

120
0:05:43.04,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I find opportunities to tell them how I'm feeling,

121
0:05:46.36,000 --> 0:05:47,000
what I'm experiencing,

122
0:05:47.6,000 --> 0:05:48,000
so we have common language.

123
0:05:48.96,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Like right now,

124
0:05:50.2,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this tingling in my scalp down my spine means I'm nervous and I'm excited.

125
0:05:55.2,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You are likely experiencing sensations in response to me.

126
0:05:59.64,000 --> 0:06:,000
The language I'm using,

127
0:06:01.04,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the ideas I'm sharing.

128
0:06:03.32,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And our tendency is to judge these reactions

129
0:06:06.8,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and sort them into a hierarchy:

130
0:06:08.36,000 --> 0:06:09,000
better or worse,

131
0:06:09.6,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and then seek or avoid them.

132
0:06:12.48,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And that's because we live in this binary culture

133
0:06:14.84,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and we're taught from a very young age to sort the world into good and bad.

134
0:06:19.28,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"Did you like that book?"

135
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"Did you have a good day?"

136
0:06:23.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
How about, "What did you notice about that story?"

137
0:06:26.6,000 --> 0:06:27,000
"Tell me a moment about your day.

138
0:06:28.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What did you learn?"

139
0:06:30.2,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Let's teach our children to stay open and curious about their experiences,

140
0:06:34.88,000 --> 0:06:36,000
like a traveler in a foreign land.

141
0:06:38.28,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And that way they can stay with sensation without checking out --

142
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
even the heightened and challenging ones --

143
0:06:44.52,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the way I did,

144
0:06:45.76,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the way so many of us have.

145
0:06:47.84,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This sense education,

146
0:06:49.32,000 --> 0:06:51,000
this is education I want for my daughters.

147
0:06:51.92,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Sense education is what I needed as girl.

148
0:06:55.72,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's what I hope for all of our children.

149
0:06:58.48,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This awareness of sensation,

150
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
it's where we began as children.

151
0:07:02.68,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's what we can learn from our children

152
0:07:05.4,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and it's what we can in turn remind our children

153
0:07:08.68,000 --> 0:07:09,000
as they come of age.

154
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Thank you.

155
0:07:13.4,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So my story starts on July 4, 1992,

3
0:00:17.625,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the day my mother followed her college sweetheart

4
0:00:20.125,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to New York City from Egypt.

5
0:00:22.208,000 --> 0:00:24,000
As fireworks exploded behind the skyline,

6
0:00:25.042,000 --> 0:00:28,000
my father looked at my mother jokingly and said,

7
0:00:28.167,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"Look, habibti,

8
0:00:29.5,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Americans are celebrating your arrival."

9
0:00:31.944,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:33.833,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Unfortunately, it didn't feel much like a celebration

11
0:00:37.333,000 --> 0:00:4,000
when, growing up, my mother and I would wander past Queens

12
0:00:41.167,000 --> 0:00:42,000
into New York City streets,

13
0:00:42.958,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and my mother with her hijab and long flowy dresses

14
0:00:46.208,000 --> 0:00:48,000
would tighten her hand around my small fingers

15
0:00:49.167,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as she stood up against weathered comments like,

16
0:00:52.417,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"Go back to where you came from,"

17
0:00:54.542,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"Learn English,"

18
0:00:55.875,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"Stupid immigrant."

19
0:00:57.708,000 --> 0:01:01,000
These words were meant to make us feel unsafe, insecure

20
0:01:02.208,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in our own neighborhoods, in our own skin.

21
0:01:05.5,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But it was these same streets

22
0:01:07.083,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that made me fall in love with New York.

23
0:01:09.75,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Queens is one of the most diverse places in the world,

24
0:01:13.042,000 --> 0:01:16,000
with immigrant parents holding stories that always start

25
0:01:16.542,000 --> 0:01:19,000
with something between three and 15 dollars in a pocket,

26
0:01:20.208,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a voyage across a vast sea

27
0:01:22.667,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and a cash-only hustle

28
0:01:24.167,000 --> 0:01:27,000
sheltering families in jam-packed, busted apartments.

29
0:01:28.417,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And it was these same families

30
0:01:30.792,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that worked so hard to make sure that we had safe microcommunities --

31
0:01:35.083,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we, as immigrant children,

32
0:01:36.833,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to feel affirmed and loved in our identities.

33
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But it was mostly the women.

34
0:01:41.917,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And these women are the reason why,

35
0:01:43.792,000 --> 0:01:46,000
regardless of these statements that my mom faced,

36
0:01:46.917,000 --> 0:01:48,000
she remained unapologetic.

37
0:01:49.5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And these women were some of the most powerful women

38
0:01:52.125,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I have ever met in my entire life.

39
0:01:54.792,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I mean, they had networks for everything.

40
0:01:57.875,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They had rotations for who watched whose kids when,

41
0:02:00.833,000 --> 0:02:01,000
for saving extra cash,

42
0:02:02.667,000 --> 0:02:03,000
for throwing belly dance parties

43
0:02:04.625,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and memorizing Koran and learning English.

44
0:02:07.417,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And they would collect small gold tokens

45
0:02:10.208,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to fundraise for the local mosque.

46
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And it was these same women,

47
0:02:14.75,000 --> 0:02:16,000
when I decided to wear my hijab,

48
0:02:16.917,000 --> 0:02:17,000
who supported me through it.

49
0:02:18.833,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And when I was bullied for being Muslim,

50
0:02:21.25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I always felt like I had an army of unapologetic North African aunties

51
0:02:26.5,000 --> 0:02:27,000
who had my back.

52
0:02:28.875,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And so every morning at 15,

53
0:02:30.542,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I would wake up and stand in front of a mirror,

54
0:02:33.208,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and wrap beautiful bright silk around my head

55
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the way my mother does and my grandmother did.

56
0:02:39.042,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And one day that summer 2009,

57
0:02:41.667,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I stepped out into the streets of New York City

58
0:02:43.958,000 --> 0:02:46,000
on my way to volunteer at a domestic violence organization

59
0:02:47.375,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that a woman in my neighborhood had started.

60
0:02:49.833,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I remember at that moment I felt a yank at the back of my head.

61
0:02:53.875,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Then someone pulled and grabbed me,

62
0:02:55.792,000 --> 0:02:58,000
trying to remove my hijab from off of my head.

63
0:02:58.833,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I turned around to a tall, broad-shouldered man,

64
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:03,000
pure hate in his eyes.

65
0:03:04.625,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I struggled and fought back,

66
0:03:06.375,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and finally was able to get away,

67
0:03:08.833,000 --> 0:03:11,000
hid myself in the bathroom of that organization and cried and cried.

68
0:03:13.375,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I kept thinking to myself,

69
0:03:15.542,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"Why does he hate me?

70
0:03:17.625,000 --> 0:03:18,000
He doesn't even know me."

71
0:03:20.083,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Hate crimes against Muslims in the US

72
0:03:22.667,000 --> 0:03:26,000
increased by 1,600 percent post-9/11,

73
0:03:26.833,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and one in every four women in the US

74
0:03:29.5,000 --> 0:03:31,000
will suffer some form of gender violence.

75
0:03:32.208,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And it may not seem like it,

76
0:03:34.083,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but Islamophobia and anti-Muslim violence

77
0:03:36.5,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is a form of gender violence,

78
0:03:38.417,000 --> 0:03:41,000
given the visibility of Muslim women in our hijabs.

79
0:03:42.208,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And so I was not alone,

80
0:03:44.042,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and that horrified me.

81
0:03:45.875,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It made me want to do something.

82
0:03:47.542,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It made me want to go out there and make sure that no one I loved,

83
0:03:50.958,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that no woman would have to feel this insecure in her own skin.

84
0:03:55.667,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So I started to think about how the women in my own neighborhood

85
0:03:59.25,000 --> 0:04:01,000
were able to build community for themselves,

86
0:04:01.875,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and how they were able to use the very little resources they had

87
0:04:05.5,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to actually offer something.

88
0:04:06.917,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I began to think about what I could potentially offer

89
0:04:09.625,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to build safety and power for women.

90
0:04:12.208,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And through this journey,

91
0:04:13.708,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I learned a couple of things,

92
0:04:15.208,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and this is what I want to share with you today, some of these lessons.

93
0:04:18.958,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So lesson number one:

94
0:04:20.917,000 --> 0:04:22,000
start with what you know.

95
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
At the time, I had been doing Shotokan karate

96
0:04:25.667,000 --> 0:04:26,000
for as long as I could remember,

97
0:04:27.5,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and so I had a black belt.

98
0:04:29.5,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Yeah. And so, I thought -- surprise.

99
0:04:31.916,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:32.958,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I thought that maybe I should go out into my neighborhood

101
0:04:35.708,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and teach self-defense to young girls.

102
0:04:37.625,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And so I actually went out and knocked on doors,

103
0:04:39.917,000 --> 0:04:41,000
spoke to community leaders, to parents, to young women,

104
0:04:42.542,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and finally was able to secure a free community center basement

105
0:04:46.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and convince enough young women that they should come to my class.

106
0:04:50.083,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And it actually all worked out,

107
0:04:52.583,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because when I pitched the idea,

108
0:04:54.833,000 --> 0:04:55,000
most of the responses were, like,

109
0:04:56.792,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"All right, cute,

110
0:04:58.25,000 --> 0:05:01,000
this 5'1" hijabi girl who knows karate.

111
0:05:01.583,000 --> 0:05:02,000
How nice."

112
0:05:03.208,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But in reality, I became the Queens, New York version of Mr. Miyagi

113
0:05:08.083,000 --> 0:05:09,000
at 16 years old,

114
0:05:09.75,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I started teaching 13 young women in that community center basement

115
0:05:14.792,000 --> 0:05:15,000
self-defense.

116
0:05:16.125,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And with every single self-defense move,

117
0:05:18.25,000 --> 0:05:2,000
for eight sessions over the course of that summer,

118
0:05:20.667,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we began to understand the power of our bodies,

119
0:05:23.417,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and we began to share our experiences

120
0:05:26.042,000 --> 0:05:27,000
about our identities.

121
0:05:27.417,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And sometimes there were shocking realizations,

122
0:05:30.958,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and other times there were tears,

123
0:05:32.667,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but mostly it was laughs.

124
0:05:34.458,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I ended that summer with this incredible sisterhood,

125
0:05:37.875,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and I began to feel much safer in my own skin.

126
0:05:41.083,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And it was because of these women that we just kept teaching.

127
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I never thought that I would continue, but we just kept teaching.

128
0:05:47.125,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And today, nine years, 17 cities,

129
0:05:49.75,000 --> 0:05:51,000
12 countries, 760 courses

130
0:05:52.5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and thousands of women and girls later,

131
0:05:55.542,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I'm still teaching.

132
0:05:57.042,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And what started as a self-defense course

133
0:05:59.333,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in the basement of a community center

134
0:06:01.542,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is now an international grassroots organization

135
0:06:04.708,000 --> 0:06:07,000
focused on building safety and power for women around the world:

136
0:06:08.583,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Malikah.

137
0:06:09.875,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

138
0:06:15.958,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, for lesson number two:

139
0:06:18.583,000 --> 0:06:19,000
start with who you know.

140
0:06:21.625,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Oftentimes, it could be quite exciting,

141
0:06:24.042,000 --> 0:06:26,000
especially if you're an expert in something

142
0:06:26.125,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and you want to have impact,

143
0:06:27.542,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to swoop into a community and think you have the magic recipe.

144
0:06:30.958,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But very early on I learned

145
0:06:33.375,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that, as esteemed philosopher Kendrick Lamar once said,

146
0:06:37.625,000 --> 0:06:4,000
it's really important to be humble and to sit down.

147
0:06:42.083,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So, basically, at 15 years old,

148
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the only community that I had any business doing work with

149
0:06:48.583,000 --> 0:06:5,000
were the 14-year-old girls in my neighborhood,

150
0:06:51.125,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and that's because I was friends with them.

151
0:06:53.25,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Other than that, I didn't know what it meant to be a child

152
0:06:56.042,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of Bengali immigrants in Brooklyn

153
0:06:58.208,000 --> 0:07:,000
or to be Senegalese in the Bronx.

154
0:07:00.25,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But I did know young women who were connected to those communities,

155
0:07:03.75,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and it was quite remarkable how they already had

156
0:07:06.667,000 --> 0:07:09,000
these layers of trust and awareness and relationship with their communities.

157
0:07:10.5,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So like my mother and the women in her neighborhood,

158
0:07:13.25,000 --> 0:07:15,000
they had these really strong social networks,

159
0:07:15.917,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and it was about providing capacity

160
0:07:18.083,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and believing in other women's definition of safety.

161
0:07:21.5,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Even though I was a self-defense instructor,

162
0:07:23.667,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I couldn't come into a community

163
0:07:25.542,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and define safety for any other woman

164
0:07:27.833,000 --> 0:07:28,000
who was not part of my own community.

165
0:07:31.042,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And it was because, as our network expanded,

166
0:07:33.583,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I learned that self-defense is not just physical.

167
0:07:36.333,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's actually really emotional work.

168
0:07:38.458,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I mean, we would do a 60-minute self-defense class,

169
0:07:42.042,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and then we'd have 30 minutes reserved for just talking and healing.

170
0:07:45.542,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And in those 30 minutes,

171
0:07:46.917,000 --> 0:07:49,000
women would share what brought them to the class to begin with

172
0:07:50.083,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but also various other experiences with violence.

173
0:07:53.417,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And, as an example, one time in one of those classes,

174
0:07:55.917,000 --> 0:07:57,000
one woman actually started to talk about the fact

175
0:07:58.667,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that she had been in a domestic violence relationship for over 30 years,

176
0:08:02.75,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and it was her first time being able to articulate that

177
0:08:05.5,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because we had established that safe space for her.

178
0:08:08.542,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So it's powerful work,

179
0:08:09.875,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but it only happens when we believe in women's agency to define

180
0:08:13.875,000 --> 0:08:16,000
what safety and what power looks like for themselves.

181
0:08:17.875,000 --> 0:08:19,000
All right, for lesson number three --

182
0:08:20.5,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and this was the hardest thing for me --

183
0:08:22.458,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the most important thing about this work is to start with the joy.

184
0:08:26.125,000 --> 0:08:3,000
When I started doing this work, I was reacting to a hate-based attack,

185
0:08:30.167,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so I was feeling insecure and anxious and overwhelmed.

186
0:08:33.417,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I was really afraid.

187
0:08:35.083,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And it makes sense, because if you take a step back,

188
0:08:37.583,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I can imagine that a lot of women in this room can probably relate to this,

189
0:08:41.625,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the feeling, an overwhelming feeling of insecurity,

190
0:08:44.082,000 --> 0:08:46,000
is oftentimes with us constantly.

191
0:08:46.5,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I mean, imagine this:

192
0:08:47.832,000 --> 0:08:5,000
walking home late at night, hearing footsteps behind you.

193
0:08:52.042,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You wonder if you should walk faster or if you should slow down.

194
0:08:55.707,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You keep your keys in your hand in case you need to use them.

195
0:08:58.833,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You say, "Text me when you get home. I want to make sure you are safe."

196
0:09:02.792,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And we mean those words.

197
0:09:04.5,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We're afraid to put down our drinks.

198
0:09:06.708,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We're afraid to speak too much or too little in a meeting.

199
0:09:10.417,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And imagine being woman and black and trans and queer and Latinx

200
0:09:14.833,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and undocumented and poor and immigrant,

201
0:09:18.167,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and you could then only imagine how overwhelming this work can be,

202
0:09:21.417,000 --> 0:09:23,000
especially within the context of personal safety.

203
0:09:24.833,000 --> 0:09:26,000
However, when I took a step to reflect

204
0:09:27.167,000 --> 0:09:29,000
on what brought me to this work to begin with,

205
0:09:29.375,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I began to realize it was actually the love that I had

206
0:09:32.667,000 --> 0:09:33,000
for women in my community.

207
0:09:34.25,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It was the way I saw them gather,

208
0:09:36.75,000 --> 0:09:37,000
their ability to build for each other,

209
0:09:38.75,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that inspired me to keep doing this work

210
0:09:41.042,000 --> 0:09:42,000
day in and day out.

211
0:09:42.75,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So whether I was in a refugee camp in Jordan

212
0:09:45.75,000 --> 0:09:47,000
or a community center in Dallas, Texas

213
0:09:48.208,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or a corporate office in Silicon Valley,

214
0:09:50.708,000 --> 0:09:53,000
women gathered in beautifully magical ways

215
0:09:53.792,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and they built together and supported each other

216
0:09:56.083,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in ways that shifted culture

217
0:09:57.75,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to empower and build safety for women.

218
0:10:00.25,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And that is how the change happens.

219
0:10:02.25,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It was through those relationships we built together.

220
0:10:04.958,000 --> 0:10:06,000
That's why we don't just teach self-defense,

221
0:10:07.083,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but we also throw dance parties

222
0:10:08.792,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and host potlucks

223
0:10:10.125,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and write love notes to each other

224
0:10:12.5,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and sing songs together.

225
0:10:14.333,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And it's really about the friendship,

226
0:10:16.167,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and it's been so, so fun.

227
0:10:18.083,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So the last thing I want to leave you with

228
0:10:20.167,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is that the key takeaway for me in teaching self-defense all of these years

229
0:10:25.833,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is that I actually don't want women, as cool as the self-defense moves are,

230
0:10:29.917,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to go out and use these self-defense techniques.

231
0:10:32.708,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I don't want any woman to have to de-escalate any violent situation.

232
0:10:38.583,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But for that to happen,

233
0:10:39.958,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the violence shouldn't happen,

234
0:10:41.667,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and for the violence not to happen,

235
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the systems and the cultures

236
0:10:45.5,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that allow for this violence to take place to begin with needs to stop.

237
0:10:49.125,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And for that to happen, we need all hands on deck.

238
0:10:52.667,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So I've given you my secret recipe,

239
0:10:55.542,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and now it's up to you.

240
0:10:57.333,000 --> 0:11:,000
To start with what you know, to start with who you know

241
0:11:01.167,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and to start with joy. But just start.

242
0:11:03.875,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Thank you so much.

243
0:11:05.167,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Applause)

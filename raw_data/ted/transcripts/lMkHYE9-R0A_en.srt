1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So, where are the robots?

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Very soon they'll be doing everything for us.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but we don't have any robots.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So what can we do about that? What can we say?

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective

9
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.

10
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
And this is an x-ray picture

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that --

12
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
what was true then is certainly true today.

13
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces.

14
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We can make the circuitry of the right computational power,

15
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but we can't actually put them together to make something

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems.

17
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So let's try to look at it from a different perspective.

18
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Let's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers.

19
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Let's see what evolution can do for us.

20
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup

21
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars, with motors, with neurons.

22
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection,

23
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.

24
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:52,000
A very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that.

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines

26
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
come out of this. They all move around.

27
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right,

28
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that we actually made a couple of these things,

29
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots,

30
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for:

31
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation,

32
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but we can also do that on a real machine.

33
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Here's a physical robot that we actually

34
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
have a population of brains,

35
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
competing, or evolving on the machine.

36
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine,

37
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and they get rewarded for how fast or how far

38
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
they can make the machine move forward.

39
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And you can see these robots are not ready

40
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to take over the world yet, but

41
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
they gradually learn how to move forward,

42
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and they do this autonomously.

43
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So in these two examples, we had basically

44
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
machines that learned how to walk in simulation,

45
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and also machines that learned how to walk in reality.

46
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But I want to show you a different approach,

47
0:02:54,000 --> 0:03:,000
and this is this robot over here, which has four legs.

48
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.

49
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine

50
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which way it's tilting.

51
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.

52
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You look at it and you see it has four legs,

53
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,

54
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
it doesn't have any idea what it looks like,

55
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but it's going to try to find that out.

56
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Initially, it does some random motion,

57
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and then it tries to figure out what it might look like.

58
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds,

59
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship

60
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do

61
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a second action that creates the most disagreement

62
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
among predictions of these alternative models,

63
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that

64
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models.

65
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much

66
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model,

67
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.

68
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines --

69
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
a pattern of locomotion.

70
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk,

71
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.

72
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But when you look at that, you have to remember

73
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward,

74
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
nor did it have a model of itself.

75
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward,

76
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and then actually tried that out.

77
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Applause)

78
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So, we'll move forward to a different idea.

79
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So that was what happened when we had a couple of --

80
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK --

81
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
-- they don't like each other. So

83
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
there's a different robot.

84
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That's what happened when the robots actually

85
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
are rewarded for doing something.

86
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in?

87
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So we have these cubes, like the diagram showed here.

88
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The cube can swivel, or flip on its side,

89
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup --

90
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything,

91
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we just let them flip. We pump energy into this

92
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and see what happens in a couple of mutations.

93
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.

94
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But after a very short while, you can see these blue things

95
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
on the right there begin to take over.

96
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
They begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward,

97
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the intrinsic reward is self-replication.

98
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And we've actually built a couple of these,

99
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.

100
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually

101
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
carrying out some of its replication process.

102
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case --

103
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and more energy, and it can make another robot.

104
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So of course, this is a very crude machine,

105
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but we're working on a micro-scale version of these,

106
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in.

107
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:02,000
OK, so what can we learn? These robots are of course

108
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
not very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something

109
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
about how we can build better robots,

110
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn.

111
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And one of the things that I think is important

112
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is that we have to get away from this idea

113
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
of designing the machines manually,

114
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but actually let them evolve and learn, like children,

115
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you.

116
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.698,000 --> 0:00:13,000
How are we doing?

2
0:00:14.65,000 --> 0:00:15,000
No, no, no, by that, I meant,

3
0:00:16.239,000 --> 0:00:17,000
how are we, homo sapiens "we" ...

4
0:00:17.944,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:18.976,000 --> 0:00:19,000
doing as a species?

6
0:00:20.151,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:21.185,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now the typical way to answer that question is this.

8
0:00:23.66,000 --> 0:00:26,000
You choose some measure of human physical well-being:

9
0:00:26.809,000 --> 0:00:28,000
average longevity, average calories per day,

10
0:00:29.531,000 --> 0:00:31,000
average income, overall population, that sort of thing,

11
0:00:32.197,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and draw a graph of its value over time.

12
0:00:35.131,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In almost every case, you get the same result.

13
0:00:37.621,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The line skitters along at a low level for millennia,

14
0:00:40.336,000 --> 0:00:43,000
then rockets up exponentially in the 19th and 20th century.

15
0:00:44.535,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Or choose a measure of consumption:

16
0:00:47.18,000 --> 0:00:49,000
consumption of energy, consumption of fresh water,

17
0:00:49.553,000 --> 0:00:51,000
consumption of the world's photosynthesis,

18
0:00:51.648,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and draw a graph of its value over time.

19
0:00:53.894,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In the same way, the line skitters along at a low level for millennia,

20
0:00:57.99,000 --> 0:01:01,000
then rockets up exponentially in the 19th and 20th century.

21
0:01:02.731,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Biologists have a word for this: outbreak.

22
0:01:05.894,000 --> 0:01:07,000
An outbreak is when a population or species

23
0:01:08.531,000 --> 0:01:1,000
exceeds the bounds of natural selection.

24
0:01:10.61,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Natural selection ordinarily keeps populations and species

25
0:01:13.65,000 --> 0:01:14,000
within roughly defined limits.

26
0:01:16.13,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Pests, parasites, lack of resources prevent them from expanding too much.

27
0:01:20.365,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But every now and then, a species escapes its bounds.

28
0:01:24.116,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Crown-of-thorns starfish in the Indian Ocean,

29
0:01:26.532,000 --> 0:01:29,000
zebra mussels in the Great Lakes, spruce budworm here in Canada.

30
0:01:30.136,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Populations explode, a hundredfold, a thousandfold,

31
0:01:33.303,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a millionfold.

32
0:01:35.023,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So here's a fundamental lesson from biology:

33
0:01:37.589,000 --> 0:01:39,000
outbreaks in nature don't end well.

34
0:01:40.126,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:41.66,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Put a couple of protozoa into a petri dish full of nutrient goo.

36
0:01:46.276,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In their natural habitat, soil or water, their environment constrains them.

37
0:01:50.896,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In the petri dish, they have an ocean of breakfast

38
0:01:53.295,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and no natural enemies.

39
0:01:54.685,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They eat and reproduce, eat and reproduce,

40
0:01:57.217,000 --> 0:01:59,000
until bang, they hit the edge of the petri dish,

41
0:01:59.5,000 --> 0:02:01,000
at which point they either drown in their own waste,

42
0:02:01.959,000 --> 0:02:02,000
starve from lack of resources, or both.

43
0:02:03.888,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The outbreak ends, always, badly.

44
0:02:06.953,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, from the viewpoint of biology,

45
0:02:09.41,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you and I are not fundamentally different than the protozoa in the petri dish.

46
0:02:13.884,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We're not special.

47
0:02:17.598,000 --> 0:02:2,000
All the things that we, in our vanity, think make us different --

48
0:02:20.758,000 --> 0:02:22,000
art, science, technology, and so forth, they don't matter.

49
0:02:23.548,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We're an outbreak species,

50
0:02:24.841,000 --> 0:02:27,000
we're going to hit the edge of the petri dish, simple as that.

51
0:02:28.32,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Well, the obvious question: Is this actually true?

52
0:02:31.766,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Are we in fact doomed to hit the edge of the petri dish?

53
0:02:34.457,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'd like to set aside this question for a moment

54
0:02:36.75,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and ask you guys another one.

55
0:02:38.298,000 --> 0:02:41,000
If we are going to escape biology, how are we going to do it?

56
0:02:42.242,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In the year 2050,

57
0:02:43.854,000 --> 0:02:45,000
there will be almost 10 billion people in the world,

58
0:02:46.373,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and all of those people will want the things that you and I want:

59
0:02:49.536,000 --> 0:02:52,000
nice cars, nice clothes, nice homes,

60
0:02:52.837,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the odd chunk of Toblerone.

61
0:02:55.064,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I mean, think of it: Toblerone for 10 billion people.

62
0:02:57.579,000 --> 0:02:58,000
How are we going to do this?

63
0:02:59.176,000 --> 0:03:01,000
How are we going to feed everybody, get water to everybody,

64
0:03:02.04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
provide power to everybody, avoid the worst impacts of climate change?

65
0:03:05.453,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'm a science journalist,

66
0:03:07.254,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I've been asking these questions to researchers for years,

67
0:03:10.617,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and in my experience, their answers fall into two broad categories,

68
0:03:14.618,000 --> 0:03:15,000
which I call "wizards" and "prophets."

69
0:03:16.994,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Wizards, techno-whizzes,

70
0:03:18.832,000 --> 0:03:2,000
believe that science and technology, properly applied,

71
0:03:21.664,000 --> 0:03:23,000
will let us produce our way out of our dilemmas.

72
0:03:24.312,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"Be smart, make more," they say.

73
0:03:26.013,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"That way, everyone can win."

74
0:03:28.537,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Prophets believe close to the opposite.

75
0:03:31.79,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They see the world as governed by fundamental ecological processes

76
0:03:35.905,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with limits that we transgress to our peril.

77
0:03:39.206,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Use less, conserve," they say.

78
0:03:41.246,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"Otherwise, everybody's going to lose."

79
0:03:44.261,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Wizards and prophets have been butting their heads together for decades,

80
0:03:47.713,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but they both believe that technology is key to a successful future.

81
0:03:51.42,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The trouble is, they envision different types of technology

82
0:03:54.491,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and different types of futures.

83
0:03:56.995,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Wizards envision a world of glittering, hyperefficient megacities

84
0:04:02.152,000 --> 0:04:04,000
surrounded by vast tracts of untouched nature,

85
0:04:05.138,000 --> 0:04:07,000
economies that have transitioned from atoms to bits,

86
0:04:07.782,000 --> 0:04:09,000
dematerialized capitalist societies

87
0:04:09.847,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that no longer depend on exploiting nature.

88
0:04:12.755,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Energy, to wizards, comes from compact nuclear plants;

89
0:04:15.421,000 --> 0:04:17,000
food from low-footprint farms with ultraproductive,

90
0:04:18.287,000 --> 0:04:2,000
genetically modified crops tended by robots;

91
0:04:21.119,000 --> 0:04:23,000
water from high-throughput desalination plants,

92
0:04:23.659,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which means we no longer exploit rivers and aquifers.

93
0:04:27.208,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Wizards envision all 10 billion of us

94
0:04:29.066,000 --> 0:04:31,000
packed into ultradense but walkable megacities,

95
0:04:31.733,000 --> 0:04:33,000
an urbanized world of maximum human aspiration

96
0:04:34.431,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and maximum human liberty.

97
0:04:36.557,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, prophets object to every bit of this.

98
0:04:40.089,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You can't dematerialize food and water, they point out.

99
0:04:43.557,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They say, you can't eat bits,

100
0:04:45.717,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and industrial agriculture has already given us massive soil erosion,

101
0:04:49.265,000 --> 0:04:51,000
huge coastal dead zones and ruined soil microbiomes.

102
0:04:52.21,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And you wizards, you want more of this?

103
0:04:54.181,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And those giant desalination plants?

104
0:04:56.623,000 --> 0:04:58,000
You know they generate equally giant piles of toxic salt

105
0:04:59.616,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that are basically impossible to dispose of.

106
0:05:02.424,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And those megacities you like?

107
0:05:04.632,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Can you name me an actually existing megacity

108
0:05:07.721,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that really exists in the world today, except for possibly Tokyo,

109
0:05:10.969,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that isn't a cesspool of corruption and inequality?

110
0:05:15.055,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Instead, prophets pray for a world of smaller, interconnected communities,

111
0:05:21.715,000 --> 0:05:23,000
closer to the earth,

112
0:05:23.905,000 --> 0:05:26,000
a more agrarian world of maximum human connection

113
0:05:26.946,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and reduced corporate control.

114
0:05:30.142,000 --> 0:05:32,000
More people live in the countryside in this vision,

115
0:05:32.897,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with power provided by neighborhood-scale solar and wind installations

116
0:05:36.262,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that disappear into the background.

117
0:05:38.698,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Prophets don't generate water from giant desalination plants.

118
0:05:44.044,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They capture it from rainfall,

119
0:05:46.576,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and they reuse and recycle it endlessly.

120
0:05:49.069,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And the food comes from small-scale networks of farms

121
0:05:53.513,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that focus on trees and tubers

122
0:05:55.443,000 --> 0:05:58,000
rather than less productive cereals like wheat and rice.

123
0:06:01.286,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Above all, though, prophets envision people changing their habits.

124
0:06:05.009,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They don't drive to work, they take their renewable-powered train.

125
0:06:08.143,000 --> 0:06:1,000
They don't take 30-minute hot showers every morning.

126
0:06:10.674,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They eat, you know, like Michael Pollan says,

127
0:06:13.159,000 --> 0:06:16,000
real food, mostly plants, not too much.

128
0:06:17.825,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Above all, prophets say submitting to nature's restraints

129
0:06:21.357,000 --> 0:06:25,000
leads to a freer, more democratic, healthier way of life.

130
0:06:26.967,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Now, wizards regard all this as hooey.

131
0:06:29.481,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They see it as a recipe for narrowness, regression, and global poverty.

132
0:06:34.314,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Prophet-style agriculture, they say, only extends the human footprint

133
0:06:37.656,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and shunts more people into low-wage agricultural labor.

134
0:06:40.728,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Those neighborhood-run solar facilities,

135
0:06:42.683,000 --> 0:06:43,000
they sound great,

136
0:06:44.471,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but they depend on a technology that doesn't exist yet.

137
0:06:47.2,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They're a fantasy.

138
0:06:49.012,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And recycling water? It's a brake on growth and development.

139
0:06:51.862,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Above all, though, wizards object to the prophets' emphasis

140
0:06:55.369,000 --> 0:06:57,000
on wide-scale social engineering,

141
0:06:57.431,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which they see as deeply anti-democratic.

142
0:07:01.105,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If the history of the last two centuries was one of unbridled growth,

143
0:07:05.033,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the history of the coming century may well be the choice we make

144
0:07:08.242,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as a species between these two paths.

145
0:07:11.021,000 --> 0:07:14,000
These are the arguments that will be resolved, in one way or another,

146
0:07:14.942,000 --> 0:07:15,000
by our children's generation,

147
0:07:16.43,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the generation that will come into the world of 10 billion.

148
0:07:19.27,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now, but wait, by this point, biologists should be rolling their eyes

149
0:07:22.556,000 --> 0:07:23,000
so loud you can barely hear me speak.

150
0:07:24.466,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They should be saying, all of this, wizards, prophets,

151
0:07:28.187,000 --> 0:07:29,000
it's a pipe dream.

152
0:07:29.563,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It doesn't matter which illusory path you think you're taking.

153
0:07:34.736,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Outbreaks in nature don't end well.

154
0:07:37.196,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I mean, you think the protozoa see the edge of the petri dish approaching

155
0:07:40.696,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and say, "Hey guys, time to change society"?

156
0:07:42.815,000 --> 0:07:44,000
No. They just let her rip.

157
0:07:44.997,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That's what life does, and we're part of life.

158
0:07:47.552,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We'll do the same thing. Deal with it.

159
0:07:50.242,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Well, if you're a follower of Darwin, you have to take this into consideration.

160
0:07:56.5,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I mean, the basic counterargument boils down to: "We're special."

161
0:08:00.762,000 --> 0:08:01,000
How lame is that?

162
0:08:02.045,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:03.56,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I mean, we can accumulate and share knowledge

164
0:08:05.704,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and use it to guide our future.

165
0:08:07.552,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Well, are we actually doing this?

166
0:08:09.3,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Is there any evidence that we're actually using our accumulated, shared knowledge

167
0:08:15.514,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to guarantee our long-term prosperity?

168
0:08:18.093,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It's pretty easy to say no.

169
0:08:20.398,000 --> 0:08:2,000
If you're a wizard,

170
0:08:21.321,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and you believe that hyperproductive, genetically engineered crops

171
0:08:24.783,000 --> 0:08:26,000
are key to feeding everyone in tomorrow's world,

172
0:08:27.17,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you have to worry that 20 years

173
0:08:29.979,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of scientists demonstrating that they are safe to consume

174
0:08:32.725,000 --> 0:08:34,000
has failed to convince the public to embrace this technology.

175
0:08:35.655,000 --> 0:08:36,000
If you're a prophet

176
0:08:36.993,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and you believe that key to solving today's growing shortage of fresh water

177
0:08:41.494,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is to stop wasting it,

178
0:08:43.469,000 --> 0:08:45,000
you have to worry that cities around the world,

179
0:08:46.39,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in rich places as well as poor,

180
0:08:48.214,000 --> 0:08:5,000
routinely lose a quarter or more of their water

181
0:08:50.825,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to leaky and contaminated pipes.

182
0:08:53.515,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I mean, Cape Town, just a little while ago, almost ran out of water.

183
0:08:57.068,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Cape Town loses a third of its water to leaky pipes.

184
0:08:59.659,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This problem has been getting worse for decades,

185
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and remarkably little has been done about it.

186
0:09:04.619,000 --> 0:09:07,000
If you're a wizard, and you think that clean, abundant,

187
0:09:07.892,000 --> 0:09:09,000
carbon-free nuclear power is key to fighting climate change,

188
0:09:10.785,000 --> 0:09:11,000
then you have to worry

189
0:09:12.05,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that the public willingness to build nukes is going down.

190
0:09:15.455,000 --> 0:09:18,000
If you're a prophet, and you think that the solution to the same problem

191
0:09:18.915,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is these neighborhood-run solar facilities shuttling power back and forth,

192
0:09:22.517,000 --> 0:09:24,000
you have to worry that no nation anywhere in the world

193
0:09:25.295,000 --> 0:09:28,000
has devoted anything like the resources necessary to develop this technology

194
0:09:29.288,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and deploy it in the time that we need it.

195
0:09:31.815,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And if you're on either side, wizard or prophet,

196
0:09:34.177,000 --> 0:09:38,000
you have to worry that, despite the massive alarm about climate change,

197
0:09:38.749,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the amount of energy generated every year from fossil fuels has gone up

198
0:09:42.726,000 --> 0:09:45,000
by about 30 percent since the beginning of this century.

199
0:09:46.443,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So, still think we're different than the protozoa?

200
0:09:50.498,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Still think we're special?

201
0:09:54.392,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Actually, it's even worse than that.

202
0:09:56.979,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:59.591,000 --> 0:10:,000
We're not in the streets.

204
0:10:00.866,000 --> 0:10:03,000
No seriously, if there's a difference between us and the protozoa,

205
0:10:04.065,000 --> 0:10:05,000
a difference that matters,

206
0:10:05.631,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it's not just our art and science and technology and so forth --

207
0:10:08.732,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it's that we can yell and scream, we can go out into the streets,

208
0:10:11.987,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and, over time, change the way society works,

209
0:10:14.129,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but we're not doing it.

210
0:10:15.407,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Wizards have been arguing literally for decades

211
0:10:17.855,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that nuclear power is key to resolving climate change.

212
0:10:24.174,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But the first pro-nuke march in history occurred less than two years ago,

213
0:10:28.427,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and it was dwarfed by the anti-nuke marches of the past.

214
0:10:31.713,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Prophets have been arguing, again literally for decades,

215
0:10:34.863,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that conservation is key to keeping freshwater supplies

216
0:10:38.65,000 --> 0:10:41,000
without destroying the ecosystems that generate those freshwater supplies.

217
0:10:42.509,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But in the history of humankind, there has never been a street

218
0:10:45.444,000 --> 0:10:47,000
full of angry protesters waving signs about leaky pipes.

219
0:10:48.985,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In fact, most of the political activity in this sphere

220
0:10:52.607,000 --> 0:10:55,000
has been wizards and prophets fighting each other, protesting each other

221
0:10:56.122,000 --> 0:10:59,000
rather than recognizing that they are, fundamentally, on the same side.

222
0:10:59.884,000 --> 0:11:02,000
After all, these people are concerned about the same thing:

223
0:11:03.315,000 --> 0:11:06,000
How are we going to make our way in the world of 10 billion?

224
0:11:06.936,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The first step towards generating that necessary social movement,

225
0:11:10.094,000 --> 0:11:13,000
creating that critical mass and getting that yelling and screaming going

226
0:11:13.562,000 --> 0:11:15,000
seems obvious: wizards and prophets join together.

227
0:11:15.947,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But how are you going to do this, given the decades of hostility?

228
0:11:19.121,000 --> 0:11:2,000
One way might be this:

229
0:11:20.319,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Each side agrees to accept the fundamental premises of the other.

230
0:11:25.837,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Accept that nuclear power is safe and carbon-free,

231
0:11:29.258,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and that uranium mines can be hideously dirty

232
0:11:31.829,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and that putting large volumes of toxic waste on rickety trains

233
0:11:36.178,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and shuttling them around the countryside is a terrible idea.

234
0:11:40.122,000 --> 0:11:43,000
To me, this leads rather quickly to a vision of small,

235
0:11:43.679,000 --> 0:11:45,000
neighborhood scale, temporary nukes,

236
0:11:46.371,000 --> 0:11:49,000
nuclear power as a bridge technology while we develop and deploy renewables.

237
0:11:50.015,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Or accept that genetically modified crops are safe

238
0:11:53.74,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and that industrial agriculture has caused huge environmental problems.

239
0:11:57.455,000 --> 0:12:01,000
To me, this leads rather quickly to a vision of plant scientists

240
0:12:01.729,000 --> 0:12:04,000
devoting much more of their attention to tree and tuber crops,

241
0:12:04.9,000 --> 0:12:07,000
which can be much more productive than cereals,

242
0:12:07.932,000 --> 0:12:1,000
use much less water than cereals, and cause much less erosion than cereals.

243
0:12:11.717,000 --> 0:12:13,000
These are just ideas from a random journalist.

244
0:12:13.928,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I'm sure there's a hundred better ones right here in this room.

245
0:12:17.006,000 --> 0:12:18,000
The main point is,

246
0:12:18.181,000 --> 0:12:21,000
wizards and prophets working together have many paths to success.

247
0:12:22.204,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And success would mean much more than mere survival,

248
0:12:24.9,000 --> 0:12:25,000
important though that is.

249
0:12:26.175,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I mean, if humankind somehow survives its own outbreak,

250
0:12:29.184,000 --> 0:12:31,000
if we get food to everybody, get water to everybody,

251
0:12:31.65,000 --> 0:12:32,000
get power to everybody,

252
0:12:32.831,000 --> 0:12:36,000
if we avoid the worst effects of climate change,

253
0:12:36.952,000 --> 0:12:38,000
if we somehow safeguard the biome,

254
0:12:39.035,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it would be amazing.

255
0:12:41.405,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It would say, I think,

256
0:12:43.21,000 --> 0:12:45,000
even to a hardened cynic like me,

257
0:12:45.393,000 --> 0:12:46,000
maybe we really are special.

258
0:12:47.615,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Thank you.

259
0:12:48.79,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Applause)

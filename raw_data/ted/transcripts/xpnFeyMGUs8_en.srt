1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let's talk about billions.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Let's talk about

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
past and future billions.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We know

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that about 106 billion people

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
have ever lived.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And we know that most of them are dead.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And we also know

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that most of them live or lived in Asia.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And we also know

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that most of them were or are very poor --

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
did not live for very long.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Let's talk about billions.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Let's talk about

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the 195,000 billion dollars of wealth

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in the world today.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We know that most of that wealth

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was made after the year 1800.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And we know that most of it

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is currently owned

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by people we might call Westerners:

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Europeans, North Americans, Australasians.

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
19 percent of the world's population today,

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth.

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Economic historians

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
call this "The Great Divergence."

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And this slide here

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is the best simplification

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
of the Great Divergence story

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I can offer you.

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It's basically two ratios

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of per capita GDP,

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
per capita gross domestic product,

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
so average income.

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
One, the red line,

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is the ratio of British to Indian

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
per capita income.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And the blue line

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is the ratio of American to Chinese.

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And this chart goes back to 1500.

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And you can see here

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that there's an exponential Great Divergence.

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They start off pretty close together.

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In fact, in 1500,

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the average Chinese was richer than the average North American.

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
When you get to the 1970s,

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
which is where this chart ends,

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the average Briton is more than 10 times richer

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
than the average Indian.

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And that's allowing

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
for differences in the cost of living.

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's based on purchasing power parity.

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The average American

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is nearly 20 times richer

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
than the average Chinese

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by the 1970s.

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So why?

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This wasn't just an economic story.

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
If you take the 10 countries

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that went on to become

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the Western empires,

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in 1500 they were really quite tiny --

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
five percent of the world's land surface,

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
16 percent of its population,

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
maybe 20 percent of its income.

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
By 1913,

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
these 10 countries, plus the United States,

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
controlled vast global empires --

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
58 percent of the world's territory,

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
about the same percentage of its population,

71
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and a really huge, nearly three-quarters share

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of global economic output.

73
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And notice, most of that went to the motherland,

74
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to the imperial metropoles,

75
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
not to their colonial possessions.

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now you can't just blame this on imperialism --

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
though many people have tried to do so --

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
for two reasons.

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
One, empire was the least original thing

80
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that the West did after 1500.

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Everybody did empire.

82
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They beat preexisting Oriental empires

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
like the Mughals and the Ottomans.

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for the Great Divergence.

86
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In any case, as you may remember,

87
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
some considerable time after decolonization.

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This is not a new question.

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Samuel Johnson,

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the great lexicographer,

92
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
[posed] it through his character Rasselas

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia,"

94
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
published in 1759.

95
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"By what means are the Europeans thus powerful;

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa

97
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for trade or conquest,

98
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
cannot the Asiaticks and Africans

99
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
invade their coasts,

100
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
plant colonies in their ports,

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and give laws to their natural princes?

102
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The same wind that carries them back

103
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
would bring us thither?"

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
That's a great question.

105
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And you know what,

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
it was also being asked at roughly the same time

107
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
by the Resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world --

108
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
like Ibrahim Muteferrika,

109
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
an Ottoman official,

110
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the man who introduced printing, very belatedly,

111
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to the Ottoman Empire --

112
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
who said in a book published in 1731,

113
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past

114
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
compared with Muslim nations

115
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
begin to dominate so many lands in modern times

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?"

117
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Unlike Rasselas,

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Muteferrika had an answer to that question,

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which was correct.

120
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
He said it was "because they have laws and rules

121
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
invented by reason."

122
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's not geography.

123
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You may think we can explain the Great Divergence

124
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in terms of geography.

125
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We know that's wrong,

126
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to see if geography mattered more than institutions.

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We took all the Germans,

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we divided them roughly in two,

130
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and we gave the ones in the East communism,

131
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and you see the result.

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Within an incredibly short period of time,

133
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
people living in the German Democratic Republic

134
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
produced Trabants, the Trabbi,

135
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
one of the world's worst ever cars,

136
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.

137
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If you still don't believe me,

138
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.

139
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And we decided we'd take Koreans

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in roughly the same geographical place

141
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
with, notice, the same basic traditional culture,

142
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.

143
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And the result is an even bigger divergence

144
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in a very short space of time

145
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
than happened in Germany.

146
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but in almost every other respect,

148
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it's a huge divergence.

149
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Which leads me to think

150
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that neither geography nor national character,

151
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
popular explanations for this kind of thing,

152
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
are really significant.

153
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's the ideas.

154
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's the institutions.

155
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This must be true

156
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because a Scotsman said it.

157
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.

158
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So let me just explain to you

159
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.

160
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
He was Adam Smith --

161
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
not Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery --

162
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
though he is very smart indeed.

163
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Smith -- and I want you to go

165
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;

166
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it's a wonderful statue --

167
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Smith, in the "Wealth of Nations"

168
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
published in 1776 --

169
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that's the most important thing that happened that year ...

170
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You bet.

172
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ...

173
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"China seems to have been long stationary,

175
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches

176
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.

177
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But this complement may be much inferior

178
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to what, with other laws and institutions,

179
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the nature of its soil, climate, and situation

180
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
might admit of."

181
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
That is so right and so cool.

182
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And he said it such a long time ago.

183
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But you know, this is a TED audience,

184
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and if I keep talking about institutions,

185
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you're going to turn off.

186
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.

187
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Let's call them the killer apps.

188
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps

189
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that set the West apart from the rest.

190
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And they're kind of like the apps on your phone,

191
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
in the sense that they look quite simple.

192
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They're just icons; you click on them.

193
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But behind the icon, there's complex code.

194
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's the same with institutions.

195
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
There are six

196
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which I think explain the Great Divergence.

197
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
One, competition.

198
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Two, the scientific revolution.

199
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Three, property rights.

200
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Four, modern medicine.

201
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Five, the consumer society.

202
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And six, the work ethic.

203
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,

204
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or try and boil it down to just four,

205
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but you'll lose.

206
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,

208
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
synthesizing the work of many economic historians

209
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in the process.

210
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Competition means,

211
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,

212
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but within each of these units,

213
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.

214
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,

215
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
existed in the 12th century.

216
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Nothing like this existed in China,

217
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
where there was one monolithic state

218
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
covering a fifth of humanity,

219
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and anyone with any ambition

220
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
had to pass one standardized examination,

221
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
which took three days and was very difficult

222
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters

223
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and very complex Confucian essay writing.

224
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The scientific revolution was different

225
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world

226
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in a number of crucial ways,

227
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the most important being

228
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that, through the experimental method,

229
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.

230
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Example: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application

231
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of Newtonian physics to ballistics.

232
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Once you do that,

233
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
your artillery becomes accurate.

234
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Think of what that means.

235
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That really was a killer application.

236
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Laughter)

237
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Meanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.

238
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,

239
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but there's no scientific revolution there.

240
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,

241
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because it's considered blasphemous

242
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to inquire into the mind of God.

243
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks;

244
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it's having the rule of law based on private property rights.

245
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
That's what makes the difference

246
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
between North America and South America.

247
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
You could turn up in North America

248
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
having signed a deed of indenture

249
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
saying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.

250
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You just have to feed me."

251
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.

252
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
That's the land grant

253
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
on the bottom half of the slide.

254
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That's not possible in Latin America

255
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
where land is held onto

256
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.

257
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And you can see here the huge divergence

258
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that happens in property ownership between North and South.

259
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Most people in rural North America

260
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
owned some land by 1900.

261
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Hardly anyone in South America did.

262
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
That's another killer app.

263
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Modern medicine in the late 19th century

264
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
began to make major breakthroughs

265
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.

266
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And this was another killer app --

267
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the very opposite of a killer,

268
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.

269
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It even did that

270
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in the European empires.

271
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Even in places like Senegal,

272
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
beginning in the early 20th century,

273
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
there were major breakthroughs in public health,

274
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and life expectancy began to rise.

275
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It doesn't rise any faster

276
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
after these countries become independent.

277
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The empires weren't all bad.

278
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The consumer society is what you need

279
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
for the Industrial Revolution to have a point.

280
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You need people to want to wear tons of clothes.

281
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;

282
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
I guarantee it.

283
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
That's the consumer society,

284
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and it propels economic growth

285
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
more than even technological change itself.

286
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Japan was the first non-Western society

287
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to embrace it.

288
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
The alternative,

289
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,

290
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.

291
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Very few Indians today

292
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
wish that India had gone down

293
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Mahatma Gandhi's road.

294
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Finally, the work ethic.

295
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.

296
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
He was wrong.

297
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Any culture can get the work ethic

298
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
if the institutions are there

299
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to create the incentive to work.

300
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We know this

301
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because today the work ethic

302
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.

303
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.

304
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Today, the average Korean

305
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
works a thousand hours more a year

306
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
than the average German --

307
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
a thousand.

308
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And this is part

309
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of a really extraordinary phenomenon,

310
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and that is the end of the Great Divergence.

311
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Who's got the work ethic now?

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Take a look at mathematical attainment

313
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
by 15 year-olds.

314
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
At the top of the international league table

315
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
according to the latest PISA study,

316
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is the Shanghai district of China.

317
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The gap between Shanghai

318
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and the United Kingdom and the United States

319
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.

320
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and Albania and Tunisia.

321
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
You probably assume

322
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that because the iPhone was designed in California

323
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but assembled in China

324
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.

325
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You're wrong.

326
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
In terms of patents,

327
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
there's no question that the East is ahead.

328
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Not only has Japan been ahead for some time,

329
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
South Korea has gone into third place,

330
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and China is just about to overtake Germany.

331
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Why?

332
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Because the killer apps can be downloaded.

333
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It's open source.

334
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Any society can adopt these institutions,

335
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and when they do,

336
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 --

337
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
only faster.

338
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
This is the Great Reconvergence,

339
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and it's the biggest story of your lifetime.

340
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Because it's on your watch that this is happening.

341
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It's our generation

342
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that is witnessing the end of Western predominance.

343
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The average American used to be more than 20 times richer

344
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
than the average Chinese.

345
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Now it's just five times,

346
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and soon it will be 2.5 times.

347
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So I want to end with three questions

348
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
for the future billions,

349
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
just ahead of 2016,

350
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
when the United States will lose its place

351
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
as number one economy to China.

352
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
The first is, can you delete these apps,

353
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and are we in the process of doing so

354
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in the Western world?

355
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
The second question is,

356
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
does the sequencing of the download matter?

357
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?

358
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
One obvious implication of modern economic history

359
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy

360
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
before you've established

361
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
secure private property rights.

362
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Warning: that may not work.

363
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And third, can China do without

364
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
killer app number three?

365
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
That's the one that John Locke systematized

366
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights

367
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and the protection of law.

368
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
That's the basis

369
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
for the Western model

370
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
of representative government.

371
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Now this picture shows the demolition

372
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio

373
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in Shanghai earlier this year.

374
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
He's now free again,

375
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
having been detained, as you know, for some time.

376
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.

377
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Winston Churchill once defined civilization

378
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.

379
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And I think these words really nail it:

380
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.

381
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,

382
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,

383
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
give place to parliaments where laws are made,

384
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and independent courts of justice

385
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
in which over long periods those laws are maintained.

386
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
That is civilization --

387
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and in its soil grow continually

388
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
freedom, comfort and culture,"

389
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
what all TEDsters care about most.

390
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
"When civilization reigns in any country,

391
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
a wider and less harassed life

392
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
is afforded to the masses of the people."

393
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
That's so true.

394
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I don't think the decline of Western civilization

395
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
is inevitable,

396
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
because I don't think history operates

397
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
in this kind of life-cycle model,

398
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's

399
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
"Course of Empire" paintings.

400
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
That's not the way history works.

401
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
That's not the way the West rose,

402
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and I don't think it's the way the West will fall.

403
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
The West may collapse very suddenly.

404
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Complex civilizations do that,

405
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
because they operate, most of the time,

406
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
on the edge of chaos.

407
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
That's one of the most profound insights

408
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
to come out of the historical study of complex institutions

409
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
like civilizations.

410
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
No, we may hang on,

411
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,

412
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic

413
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and other parts of our historical mojo.

414
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
But one thing is for sure,

415
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the Great Divergence

416
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
is over, folks.

417
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Thanks very much.

418
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
(Applause)

419
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Bruno Giussani: Niall,

420
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
I am just curious

421
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
about your take on the other region of the world that's booming,

422
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
which is Latin America.

423
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
What's your view on that?

424
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking

425
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
about the rise of the East;

426
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
I'm talking about the rise of the Rest,

427
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and that includes South America.

428
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,

429
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
"Hey, is South America part of the West?"

430
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
He was an expert in Latin American history.

431
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
He said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that."

432
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
That tells you something really important.

433
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,

434
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
but also Chile,

435
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
which was in many ways the one that led the way

436
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
in transforming the institutions of economic life,

437
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
there's a very bright future indeed.

438
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
So my story really is

439
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
as much about that convergence in the Americas

440
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
as it's a convergence story in Eurasia.

441
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
BG: And there is this impression

442
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
that North America and Europe

443
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
are not really paying attention

444
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
to these trends.

445
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Mostly they're worried about each other.

446
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.

447
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.

448
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And that's all we seem to be caring about recently.

449
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
NF: I think the fiscal crisis

450
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
that we see in the developed World right now -- both sides of the Atlantic --

451
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
is essentially the same thing

452
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
taking different forms

453
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
in terms of political culture.

454
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And it's a crisis that has its structural facet --

455
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
it's partly to do with demographics.

456
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
But it's also, of course, to do with the massive crisis

457
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
that followed excessive leverage,

458
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
excessive borrowing in the private sector.

459
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
That crisis,

460
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
which has been the focus of so much attention, including by me,

461
0:19:55.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
I think is an epiphenomenon.

462
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon,

463
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
which has just accelerated

464
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
this huge shift,

465
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy.

466
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
I think that's its real importance.

467
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:1,000
BG: Niall, thank you. (NF: Thank you very much, Bruno.)

468
0:20:10.26,000 --> 0:20:13,000
(Applause)

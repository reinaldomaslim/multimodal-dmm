1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The world is changing

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
with really remarkable speed.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
If you look at the chart at the top here,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
you'll see that in 2025,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
these Goldman Sachs projections

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
suggest that the Chinese economy

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
will be almost the same size as the American economy.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And if you look at the chart

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for 2050,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it's projected that the Chinese economy

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
will be twice the size of the American economy,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the Indian economy will be almost the same size

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
as the American economy.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And we should bear in mind here

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that these projections were drawn up

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
before the Western financial crisis.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
A couple of weeks ago,

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was looking at the latest projection

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
by BNP Paribas

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for when China

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
will have a larger economy

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
than the United States.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Goldman Sachs projected 2027.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The post-crisis projection

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is 2020.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That's just a decade away.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
China is going to change the world

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in two fundamental respects.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
First of all,

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it's a huge developing country

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with a population of 1.3 billion people,

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which has been growing for over 30 years

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
at around 10 percent a year.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And within a decade,

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it will have the largest economy in the world.

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Never before in the modern era

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
has the largest economy in the world

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
been that of a developing country,

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
rather than a developed country.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Secondly,

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
for the first time in the modern era,

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the dominant country in the world --

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which I think is what China will become --

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
will be not from the West

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and from very, very different civilizational roots.

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that as countries modernize,

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they also westernize.

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is an illusion.

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's an assumption that modernity

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It is not. It is also shaped equally

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
by history and culture.

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
China is not like the West,

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and it will not become like the West.

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It will remain in very fundamental respects

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
very different.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now the big question here is obviously,

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
how do we make sense of China?

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
How do we try to understand what China is?

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is that the conventional approach

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is that we understand it really in Western terms,

64
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
using Western ideas.

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We can't.

66
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now I want to offer you

67
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
three building blocks

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
for trying to understand what China is like,

69
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
just as a beginning.

70
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The first is this:

71
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that China is not really a nation-state.

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Okay, it's called itself a nation-state

73
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
for the last hundred years,

74
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but everyone who knows anything about China

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
knows it's a lot older than this.

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty

77
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period --

78
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the birth of modern China.

79
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.

80
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,

81
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
still 2,000 years ago.

82
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And you can see already it occupies

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
most of what we now know as Eastern China,

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then

85
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and live now.

86
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now what is extraordinary about this

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is, what gives China its sense of being China,

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
what gives the Chinese

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the sense of what it is to be Chinese,

90
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
comes not from the last hundred years,

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
not from the nation-state period,

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which is what happened in the West,

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but from the period, if you like,

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of the civilization-state.

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I'm thinking here, for example,

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of customs like ancestral worship,

97
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
of a very distinctive notion of the state,

98
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,

99
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
social relationships like guanxi,

100
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Confucian values and so on.

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
These are all things that come

102
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
from the period of the civilization-state.

103
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,

104
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is shaped by its sense of civilization,

105
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
its existence as a civilization-state,

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
rather than as a nation-state.

107
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:

108
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Of course we know China's big, huge,

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
demographically and geographically,

110
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
with a population of 1.3 billion people.

111
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
What we often aren't really aware of

112
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is the fact

113
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that China is extremely diverse

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and very pluralistic,

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and in many ways very decentralized.

116
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
even though we think this to be the case.

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's never been the case.

119
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So this is China, a civilization-state,

120
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
rather than a nation-state.

121
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And what does it mean?

122
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.

123
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I'll give you two quick ones.

124
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The first is that

125
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the most important political value for the Chinese

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is unity,

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is the maintenance

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
of Chinese civilization.

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
China, over the same time period,

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
went in exactly the opposite direction,

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
very painfully holding this huge civilization,

135
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
civilization-state, together.

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The second

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is maybe more prosaic,

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
which is Hong Kong.

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong

140
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
by Britain to China in 1997?

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You may remember

142
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
what the Chinese constitutional proposition was.

143
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
One country, two systems.

144
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I'll lay a wager

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that barely anyone in the West believed them.

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"Window dressing.

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong,

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that won't be the case."

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Thirteen years on,

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the political and legal system in Hong Kong

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is as different now as it was in 1997.

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We were wrong. Why were we wrong?

153
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,

154
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
in nation-state ways.

155
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Think of German unification, 1990.

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
What happened?

157
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West.

158
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
One nation, one system.

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
That is the nation-state mentality.

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But you can't run a country like China,

161
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a civilization-state,

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
on the basis of one civilization, one system.

163
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It doesn't work.

164
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So actually the response of China

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to the question of Hong Kong --

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
as it will be to the question of Taiwan --

167
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was a natural response:

168
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
one civilization, many systems.

169
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Let me offer you another building block

170
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to try and understand China --

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
maybe not sort of a comfortable one.

172
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The Chinese have a very, very different

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
conception of race

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to most other countries.

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Do you know,

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of the 1.3 billion Chinese,

177
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
over 90 percent of them

178
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
think they belong to the same race,

179
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the Han?

180
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Now, this is completely different

181
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
from the world's [other] most populous countries.

182
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
India, the United States,

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Indonesia, Brazil --

184
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
all of them are multiracial.

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The Chinese don't feel like that.

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
China is only multiracial

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
really at the margins.

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So the question is, why?

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Well the reason, I think, essentially

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is, again, back to the civilization-state.

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
A history of at least 2,000 years,

192
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
a history of conquest, occupation,

193
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
absorption, assimilation and so on,

194
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
led to the process by which,

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
over time, this notion of the Han emerged --

196
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of course, nurtured

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
by a growing and very powerful sense

198
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
of cultural identity.

199
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now the great advantage of this historical experience

200
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
has been that, without the Han,

201
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
China could never have held together.

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The Han identity has been the cement

203
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
which has held this country together.

204
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The great disadvantage of it

205
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is that the Han have a very weak conception

206
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of cultural difference.

207
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They really believe

208
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in their own superiority,

209
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and they are disrespectful

210
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
of those who are not.

211
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Hence their attitude, for example,

212
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.

213
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Or let me give you my third building block,

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the Chinese state.

215
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now the relationship

216
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
between the state and society in China

217
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is very different from that in the West.

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now we in the West

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least --

220
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that the authority and legitimacy of the state

221
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is a function of democracy.

222
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The problem with this proposition

223
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is that the Chinese state

224
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
enjoys more legitimacy

225
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and more authority

226
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
amongst the Chinese

227
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
than is true

228
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
with any Western state.

229
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And the reason for this

230
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is because --

231
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
well, there are two reasons, I think.

232
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,

233
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.

234
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And the reason for this is,

235
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
firstly, because the state in China

236
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is given a very special --

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it enjoys a very special significance

238
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
as the representative,

239
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the embodiment and the guardian

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
of Chinese civilization,

241
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
of the civilization-state.

242
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is as close as China gets

243
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to a kind of spiritual role.

244
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And the second reason is because,

245
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
whereas in Europe

246
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and North America,

247
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the state's power is continuously challenged --

248
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I mean in the European tradition,

249
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
historically against the church,

250
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
against other sectors of the aristocracy,

251
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
against merchants and so on --

252
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
for 1,000 years,

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the power of the Chinese state

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
has not been challenged.

255
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's had no serious rivals.

256
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So you can see

257
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that the way in which power has been constructed in China

258
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is very different from our experience

259
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in Western history.

260
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The result, by the way,

261
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.

262
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder,

263
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
a stranger,

264
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
certainly an organ

265
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
whose powers need to be limited

266
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
or defined and constrained,

267
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the Chinese don't see the state like that at all.

268
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The Chinese view the state

269
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually,

270
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
as a member of the family --

271
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
not just in fact as a member of the family,

272
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
but as the head of the family,

273
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the patriarch of the family.

274
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is the Chinese view of the state --

275
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
very, very different to ours.

276
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It's embedded in society in a different kind of way

277
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to what is the case

278
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in the West.

279
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,

280
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in the Chinese context,

281
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
is a new kind of paradigm,

282
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
which is different from anything

283
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we've had to think about in the past.

284
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Know that China believes in the market and the state.

285
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I mean, Adam Smith,

286
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
already writing in the late 18th century, said,

287
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
"The Chinese market is larger and more developed

288
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and more sophisticated

289
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
than anything in Europe."

290
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And, apart from the Mao period,

291
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that has remained more or less the case ever since.

292
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But this is combined

293
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.

294
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
The state is everywhere in China.

295
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I mean, it's leading firms --

296
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
many of them are still publicly owned.

297
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,

298
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
depend in many ways on state patronage.

299
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Targets for the economy and so on

300
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
are set by the state.

301
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --

302
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
as we are familiar with --

303
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
with something like the one-child policy.

304
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Moreover, this is a very old state tradition,

305
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
a very old tradition of statecraft.

306
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I mean, if you want an illustration of this,

307
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the Great Wall is one.

308
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But this is another, this is the Grand Canal,

309
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
which was constructed in the first instance

310
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
in the fifth century B.C.

311
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and was finally completed

312
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in the seventh century A.D.

313
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It went for 1,114 miles,

314
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
linking Beijing

315
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
with Hangzhou and Shanghai.

316
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So there's a long history

317
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
of extraordinary state infrastructural projects

318
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in China,

319
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,

320
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
which is something like the Three Gorges Dam

321
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and many other expressions

322
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
of state competence

323
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
within China.

324
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So there we have three building blocks

325
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
for trying to understand the difference that is China --

326
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the civilization-state,

327
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
the notion of race

328
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and the nature of the state

329
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and its relationship to society.

330
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And yet we still insist, by and large,

331
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
in thinking that we can understand China

332
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
by simply drawing on Western experience,

333
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
looking at it through Western eyes,

334
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
using Western concepts.

335
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
If you want to know why

336
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
we unerringly seem to get China wrong --

337
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect --

338
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
this is the reason.

339
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Unfortunately, I think,

340
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I have to say that I think

341
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
attitude towards China

342
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.

343
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It's kind of arrogant.

344
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It's arrogant in the sense

345
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that we think that we are best,

346
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and therefore we have the universal measure.

347
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And secondly, it's ignorant.

348
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We refuse to really address

349
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the issue of difference.

350
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
You know, there's a very interesting passage

351
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.

352
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And Paul Cohen argues

353
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that the West thinks of itself

354
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
as probably the most cosmopolitan

355
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
of all cultures.

356
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
But it's not.

357
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
In many ways,

358
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
it's the most parochial,

359
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
because for 200 years,

360
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the West has been so dominant in the world

361
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that it's not really needed

362
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to understand other cultures,

363
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
other civilizations.

364
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Because, at the end of the day,

365
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it could, if necessary by force,

366
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
get its own way.

367
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Whereas those cultures --

368
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
virtually the rest of the world, in fact,

369
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --

370
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
have been thereby forced to understand the West,

371
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
because of the West's presence in those societies.

372
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And therefore, they are, as a result,

373
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.

374
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I mean, take the question of East Asia.

375
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --

376
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
a third of the world's population lives there.

377
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Now the largest economic region in the world.

378
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And I'll tell you now,

379
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that East Asianers, people from East Asia,

380
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
are far more knowledgeable

381
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
about the West

382
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
than the West is about East Asia.

383
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid,

384
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to the present.

385
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,

386
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
the Goldman Sachs chart.

387
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
What is happening

388
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
is that, very rapidly in historical terms,

389
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
the world is being driven

390
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and shaped,

391
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
not by the old developed countries,

392
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
but by the developing world.

393
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We've seen this

394
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
in terms of the G20

395
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
usurping very rapidly the position of the G7,

396
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
or the G8.

397
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And there are two consequences of this.

398
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
First, the West

399
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
is rapidly losing

400
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
its influence in the world.

401
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago --

402
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Copenhagen, climate change conference.

403
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Europe was not at the final negotiating table.

404
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
When did that last happen?

405
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.

406
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And that is what is going to happen in the future.

407
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And the second implication

408
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,

409
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
become increasingly unfamiliar to us,

410
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories

411
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
that we are not really familiar with,

412
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
or conversant with.

413
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe;

414
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
America is slightly different --

415
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
but Europeans by and large, I have to say,

416
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
are ignorant,

417
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
are unaware

418
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
about the way the world is changing.

419
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Some people -- I've got an English friend in China,

420
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion."

421
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Well, maybe that's true,

422
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
maybe that's an exaggeration.

423
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
But there's another problem which goes along with this --

424
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world --

425
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and that is a sort of

426
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
loss of a sense of the future.

427
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future

428
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
in its confidence.

429
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Take the 19th century, for example.

430
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
But this, alas, is no longer true.

431
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,

432
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
try China -- there's old Confucius.

433
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
This is a railway station

434
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
the likes of which you've never seen before.

435
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
It doesn't even look like a railway station.

436
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
This is the new [Wuhan] railway station

437
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
for the high-speed trains.

438
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
China already has a bigger network

439
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
than any other country in the world

440
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.

441
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Or take this: now this is an idea,

442
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
but it's an idea to be tried out shortly

443
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
in a suburb of Beijing.

444
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Here you have a megabus,

445
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.

446
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
It travels on rails

447
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
down a suburban road,

448
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and the cars travel underneath it.

449
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.

450
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
Now this is the way things are going to move,

451
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
because China has a very specific problem,

452
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
which is different from Europe

453
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and different from the United States:

454
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
China has huge numbers of people and no space.

455
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
So this is a solution to a situation

456
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
where China's going to have

457
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
many, many, many cities

458
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
over 20 million people.

459
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Okay, so how would I like to finish?

460
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Well, what should our attitude be

461
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
towards this world

462
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
that we see

463
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
very rapidly developing

464
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
before us?

465
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.

466
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
But I want to argue, above all,

467
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
a big-picture positive for this world.

468
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
For 200 years,

469
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:51,000
the world was essentially governed

470
0:19:51.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
by a fragment of the human population.

471
0:19:55.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
That's what Europe and North America represented.

472
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
The arrival of countries

473
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:03,000
like China and India --

474
0:20:03.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
between them 38 percent of the world's population --

475
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on,

476
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
represent the most important single act

477
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:16,000
of democratization

478
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
in the last 200 years.

479
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
Civilizations and cultures,

480
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
which had been ignored, which had no voice,

481
0:20:23.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
which were not listened to, which were not known about,

482
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
will have a different sort

483
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
of representation in this world.

484
0:20:30.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
As humanists, we must welcome, surely,

485
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
this transformation,

486
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and we will have to learn

487
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
about these civilizations.

488
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
This big ship here

489
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:43,000
was the one sailed in by Zheng He

490
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
in the early 15th century

491
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:47,000
on his great voyages

492
0:20:47.26,000 --> 0:20:5,000
around the South China Sea, the East China Sea

493
0:20:50.26,000 --> 0:20:53,000
and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa.

494
0:20:53.26,000 --> 0:20:57,000
The little boat in front of it

495
0:20:57.26,000 --> 0:20:59,000
was the one in which, 80 years later,

496
0:20:59.26,000 --> 0:21:02,000
Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic.

497
0:21:02.26,000 --> 0:21:04,000
(Laughter)

498
0:21:04.26,000 --> 0:21:06,000
Or, look carefully

499
0:21:06.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
at this silk scroll

500
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:11,000
made by ZhuZhou

501
0:21:11.26,000 --> 0:21:14,000
in 1368.

502
0:21:14.26,000 --> 0:21:16,000
I think they're playing golf.

503
0:21:16.26,000 --> 0:21:19,000
Christ, the Chinese even invented golf.

504
0:21:19.26,000 --> 0:21:22,000
Welcome to the future. Thank you.

505
0:21:22.26,000 --> 0:21:25,000
(Applause)

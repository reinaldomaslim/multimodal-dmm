1
0:00:12.988,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I wrote my memoir,

2
0:00:14.889,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the publishers were really confused.

3
0:00:18.566,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Was it about me as a child refugee,

4
0:00:22.8,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or as a woman who set up a high-tech software company back in the 1960s,

5
0:00:28.304,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one that went public

6
0:00:30.38,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and eventually employed over 8,500 people?

7
0:00:34.963,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Or was it as a mother of an autistic child?

8
0:00:39.47,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Or as a philanthropist that's now given away serious money?

9
0:00:43.925,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Well, it turns out, I'm all of these.

10
0:00:46.569,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So let me tell you my story.

11
0:00:51.779,000 --> 0:00:57,000
All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna,

12
0:00:58.446,000 --> 0:01:03,000
part of the Kindertransport that saved nearly 10,000 Jewish children

13
0:01:03.483,000 --> 0:01:05,000
from Nazi Europe.

14
0:01:05.851,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I was five years old, clutching the hand of my nine-year-old sister

15
0:01:09.86,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and had very little idea as to what was going on.

16
0:01:13.813,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"What is England and why am I going there?"

17
0:01:18.504,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I'm only alive because so long ago, I was helped by generous strangers.

18
0:01:26.911,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was lucky, and doubly lucky to be later reunited

19
0:01:30.446,000 --> 0:01:32,000
with my birth parents.

20
0:01:32.885,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But, sadly, I never bonded with them again.

21
0:01:39.917,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day

22
0:01:43.227,000 --> 0:01:44,000
when my mother put me on the train

23
0:01:45.003,000 --> 0:01:48,000
than I would ever have dreamed possible.

24
0:01:48.29,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I love England, my adopted country,

25
0:01:51.398,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel.

26
0:01:57.831,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving.

27
0:02:04.188,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And then, I just got on with it.

28
0:02:07.709,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

29
0:02:11.264,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Let me take you back to the early 1960s.

30
0:02:15.465,000 --> 0:02:19,000
To get past the gender issues of the time,

31
0:02:19.953,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in Britain.

32
0:02:26.443,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But it was also a company of women, a company for women,

33
0:02:32.301,000 --> 0:02:35,000
an early social business.

34
0:02:35.325,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And people laughed at the very idea because software, at that time,

35
0:02:39.001,000 --> 0:02:41,000
was given away free with hardware.

36
0:02:41.074,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Nobody would buy software, certainly not from a woman.

37
0:02:45.808,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees,

38
0:02:51.745,000 --> 0:02:54,000
there was a glass ceiling to our progress.

39
0:02:56.309,000 --> 0:03:,000
And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often,

40
0:03:00.985,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I wanted opportunities for women.

41
0:03:04.55,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage,

42
0:03:09.042,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or when their first child was expected

43
0:03:11.293,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and structured them into a home-working organization.

44
0:03:16.484,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce

45
0:03:21.069,000 --> 0:03:23,000
after a career break.

46
0:03:23.611,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We pioneered all sorts of new, flexible work methods:

47
0:03:27.394,000 --> 0:03:32,000
job shares, profit-sharing, and eventually, co-ownership

48
0:03:32.646,000 --> 0:03:35,000
when I took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff

49
0:03:36.092,000 --> 0:03:39,000
at no cost to anyone but me.

50
0:03:41.582,000 --> 0:03:47,000
For years, I was the first woman this, or the only woman that.

51
0:03:47.773,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And in those days, I couldn't work on the stock exchange,

52
0:03:51.539,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane.

53
0:03:55.3,000 --> 0:04:,000
Indeed, I couldn't open a bank account without my husband's permission.

54
0:04:01.193,000 --> 0:04:05,000
My generation of women fought the battles for the right to work

55
0:04:05.715,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and the right for equal pay.

56
0:04:10.207,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Nobody really expected much from people at work or in society

57
0:04:14.068,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because all the expectations then

58
0:04:16.566,000 --> 0:04:19,000
were about home and family responsibilities.

59
0:04:20.461,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I couldn't really face that,

60
0:04:23.298,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so I started to challenge the conventions of the time,

61
0:04:29.287,000 --> 0:04:34,000
even to the extent of changing my name from "Stephanie" to "Steve"

62
0:04:35.142,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in my business development letters,

63
0:04:36.891,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so as to get through the door before anyone realized

64
0:04:39.369,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that he was a she.

65
0:04:40.75,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

66
0:04:44.054,000 --> 0:04:51,000
My company, called Freelance Programmers, and that's precisely what it was,

67
0:04:51.214,000 --> 0:04:56,000
couldn't have started smaller: on the dining room table,

68
0:04:56.287,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today's terms,

69
0:05:01.681,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and financed by my labor and by borrowing against the house.

70
0:05:08.978,000 --> 0:05:13,000
My interests were scientific, the market was commercial --

71
0:05:14.615,000 --> 0:05:18,000
things such as payroll, which I found rather boring.

72
0:05:18.64,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So I had to compromise with operational research work,

73
0:05:23.752,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which had the intellectual challenge that interested me

74
0:05:27.183,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and the commercial value that was valued by the clients:

75
0:05:34.85,000 --> 0:05:39,000
things like scheduling freight trains,

76
0:05:40.108,000 --> 0:05:46,000
time-tabling buses, stock control, lots and lots of stock control.

77
0:05:46.297,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And eventually, the work came in.

78
0:05:50.545,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We disguised the domestic and part-time nature of the staff

79
0:05:54.3,000 --> 0:05:59,000
by offering fixed prices, one of the very first to do so.

80
0:05:59.44,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And who would have guessed that the programming

81
0:06:02.755,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of the black box flight recorder of Supersonic Concord

82
0:06:06.699,000 --> 0:06:11,000
would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes.

83
0:06:11.908,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Applause)

84
0:06:19.392,000 --> 0:06:23,000
All we used was a simple "trust the staff" approach

85
0:06:24.323,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and a simple telephone.

86
0:06:26.504,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We even used to ask job applicants, "Do you have access to a telephone?"

87
0:06:34.175,000 --> 0:06:37,000
An early project was to develop software standards

88
0:06:37.194,000 --> 0:06:39,000
on management control protocols.

89
0:06:39.434,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And software was and still is a maddeningly hard-to-control activity,

90
0:06:45.636,000 --> 0:06:47,000
so that was enormously valuable.

91
0:06:47.747,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We used the standards ourselves,

92
0:06:49.971,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we were even paid to update them over the years,

93
0:06:52.989,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and eventually, they were adopted by NATO.

94
0:06:58.323,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Our programmers -- remember, only women,

95
0:07:02.45,000 --> 0:07:05,000
including gay and transgender --

96
0:07:05.896,000 --> 0:07:1,000
worked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts

97
0:07:10.939,000 --> 0:07:13,000
defining each task to be done.

98
0:07:14.596,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And they then wrote code, usually machine code,

99
0:07:18.509,000 --> 0:07:2,000
sometimes binary code,

100
0:07:20.776,000 --> 0:07:24,000
which was then sent by mail to a data center

101
0:07:25.506,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to be punched onto paper tape or card

102
0:07:29.724,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and then re-punched, in order to verify it.

103
0:07:34.051,000 --> 0:07:37,000
All this, before it ever got near a computer.

104
0:07:37.387,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That was programming in the early 1960s.

105
0:07:43.566,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In 1975, 13 years from startup,

106
0:07:48.701,000 --> 0:07:51,000
equal opportunity legislation came in in Britain

107
0:07:51.912,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and that made it illegal to have our pro-female policies.

108
0:07:58.824,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And as an example of unintended consequences,

109
0:08:02.4,000 --> 0:08:05,000
my female company had to let the men in.

110
0:08:06.072,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

111
0:08:11.014,000 --> 0:08:13,000
When I started my company of women,

112
0:08:13.418,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the men said, "How interesting, because it only works because it's small."

113
0:08:20.317,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And later, as it became sizable, they accepted, "Yes, it is sizable now,

114
0:08:26.136,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but of no strategic interest."

115
0:08:30.125,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And later, when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars,

116
0:08:37.274,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I'd made 70 of the staff into millionaires,

117
0:08:41.877,000 --> 0:08:44,000
they sort of said, "Well done, Steve!"

118
0:08:45.397,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

119
0:08:49.683,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Applause)

120
0:08:53.969,000 --> 0:08:57,000
You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads:

121
0:08:58.255,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They're flat on top for being patted patronizingly.

122
0:09:01.58,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

123
0:09:07.521,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink.

124
0:09:12.084,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

125
0:09:13.737,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Let me share with you two secrets of success:

126
0:09:17.562,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Surround yourself with first-class people and people that you like;

127
0:09:23.781,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and choose your partner very, very carefully.

128
0:09:30.065,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Because the other day when I said, "My husband's an angel,"

129
0:09:33.278,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a woman complained -- "You're lucky," she said,

130
0:09:35.764,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"mine's still alive."

131
0:09:37.79,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

132
0:09:45.117,000 --> 0:09:5,000
If success were easy, we'd all be millionaires.

133
0:09:51.054,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But in my case, it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed, crisis.

134
0:10:01.258,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Our late son, Giles, was an only child, a beautiful, contented baby.

135
0:10:09.532,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And then, at two and a half,

136
0:10:13.465,000 --> 0:10:16,000
like a changeling in a fairy story,

137
0:10:16.738,000 --> 0:10:19,000
he lost the little speech that he had

138
0:10:20.17,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and turned into a wild, unmanageable toddler.

139
0:10:25.442,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Not the terrible twos;

140
0:10:27.524,000 --> 0:10:32,000
he was profoundly autistic and he never spoke again.

141
0:10:36.387,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that I set up

142
0:10:41.734,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to pioneer services for autism.

143
0:10:45.304,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And then there's been a groundbreaking Prior's Court school

144
0:10:48.304,000 --> 0:10:5,000
for pupils with autism

145
0:10:50.724,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and a medical research charity, again, all for autism.

146
0:10:54.844,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Because whenever I found a gap in services, I tried to help.

147
0:11:01.313,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I like doing new things and making new things happen.

148
0:11:06.583,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And I've just started a three-year think tank for autism.

149
0:11:13.159,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems,

150
0:11:18.434,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I've also founded the Oxford Internet Institute

151
0:11:22.017,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and other IT ventures.

152
0:11:24.51,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The Oxford Internet Institute focuses not on the technology,

153
0:11:28.795,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but on the social, economic, legal and ethical issues of the Internet.

154
0:11:35.887,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Giles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now.

155
0:11:42.909,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And I have learned to live without him,

156
0:11:46.689,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and I have learned to live without his need of me.

157
0:11:51.469,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Philanthropy is all that I do now.

158
0:11:54.829,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I need never worry about getting lost

159
0:11:57.188,000 --> 0:12:,000
because several charities would quickly come and find me.

160
0:12:00.697,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

161
0:12:12.807,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise,

162
0:12:16.885,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but as many people in this room will know,

163
0:12:19.112,000 --> 0:12:21,000
making it happen is a very difficult thing

164
0:12:22.025,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and it demands extraordinary energy, self-belief and determination,

165
0:12:30.117,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the courage to risk family and home,

166
0:12:34.322,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and a 24/7 commitment that borders on the obsessive.

167
0:12:39.491,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic.

168
0:12:43.475,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility.

169
0:12:50.153,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else.

170
0:12:57.612,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We live our lives forward.

171
0:12:59.756,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So what has all that taught me?

172
0:13:04.21,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I learned that tomorrow's never going to be like today,

173
0:13:07.846,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and certainly nothing like yesterday.

174
0:13:10.899,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And that made me able to cope with change,

175
0:13:14.306,000 --> 0:13:18,000
indeed, eventually to welcome change,

176
0:13:18.634,000 --> 0:13:23,000
though I'm told I'm still very difficult.

177
0:13:23.666,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Thank you very much.

178
0:13:25.801,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Today I'm going to talk

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about unexpected discoveries.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now I work in the solar technology industry.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And my small startup

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is looking to force ourselves

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
into the environment

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by paying attention to ...

8
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.

9
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's just a quick video

10
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of what we do.

11
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Huh. Hang on a moment.

12
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It might take a moment to load.

13
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We'll just -- we can just skip --

15
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I'll just skip through the video instead ...

16
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
No.

18
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Music)

21
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is not ...

22
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

23
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Okay.

24
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

25
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Solar technology is ...

26
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Oh, that's all my time?

27
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Okay. Thank you very much.

28
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Applause)

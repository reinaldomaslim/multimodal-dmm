2
0:00:15.918,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I'd like to start by focusing on

3
0:00:18.654,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the world's most dangerous animal.

4
0:00:21.19,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now, when you talk about dangerous animals,

5
0:00:23.35,000 --> 0:00:26,000
most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.

6
0:00:26.397,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But of course the most dangerous animal

7
0:00:28.074,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is the mosquito.

8
0:00:29.937,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The mosquito has killed more humans

9
0:00:32.096,000 --> 0:00:34,000
than any other creature in human history.

10
0:00:35.085,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In fact, probably adding them all together,

11
0:00:37.075,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the mosquito has killed more humans.

12
0:00:39.261,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars

13
0:00:41.92,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and plague.

14
0:00:43.619,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And you would think, would you not,

15
0:00:46.192,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that with all our science, with all our advances in society,

16
0:00:50.139,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with better towns, better civilizations, better sanitation,

17
0:00:55.051,000 --> 0:00:58,000
wealth, that we would get better at controlling mosquitos,

18
0:00:58.251,000 --> 0:01:,000
and hence reduce this disease.

19
0:01:00.944,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And that's not really the case.

20
0:01:04.286,000 --> 0:01:06,000
If it was the case, we wouldn't have

21
0:01:06.406,000 --> 0:01:1,000
between 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year,

22
0:01:10.993,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and we wouldn't have

23
0:01:12.718,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a million and a half deaths from malaria,

24
0:01:16.66,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and we wouldn't have a disease

25
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that was relatively unknown 50 years ago

26
0:01:21.896,000 --> 0:01:23,000
now suddenly turned into

27
0:01:24.728,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have,

28
0:01:27.96,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and that's called dengue fever.

29
0:01:30.653,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So 50 years ago, pretty much no one had heard of it,

30
0:01:33.384,000 --> 0:01:35,000
no one certainly in the European environment.

31
0:01:36.376,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization,

32
0:01:40.009,000 --> 0:01:43,000
infects between 50 and 100 million people every year,

33
0:01:43.496,000 --> 0:01:45,000
so that's equivalent to the whole of the population

34
0:01:45.832,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of the U.K. being infected every year.

35
0:01:48.76,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Other estimates put that number at roughly double

36
0:01:51.872,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that number of infections.

37
0:01:55.83,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally.

38
0:02:00.265,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue

39
0:02:03.315,000 --> 0:02:05,000
has grown thirtyfold.

40
0:02:05.533,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is,

41
0:02:08.036,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for those who don't know.

42
0:02:09.624,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now let's assume you go on holiday.

43
0:02:11.833,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Let's assume you go to the Caribbean,

44
0:02:13.595,000 --> 0:02:15,000
or you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America,

45
0:02:15.988,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Asia, Africa, anywhere in Saudi Arabia.

46
0:02:19.947,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You might go to India, the Far East.

47
0:02:21.67,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito,

48
0:02:24.283,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and it's the same disease. You're at risk.

49
0:02:27.195,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito

50
0:02:29.871,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that's carrying that virus.

51
0:02:31.432,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Well, you could develop flu-like symptoms.

52
0:02:34.427,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They could be quite mild.

53
0:02:36.205,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You could develop nausea, headache,

54
0:02:38.306,000 --> 0:02:4,000
your muscles could feel like they're contracting,

55
0:02:40.745,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking.

56
0:02:44.831,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And that's the nickname given to this disease.

57
0:02:47.055,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's called breakbone fever,

58
0:02:48.648,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because that's how you can feel.

59
0:02:50.992,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten

60
0:02:53.929,000 --> 0:02:55,000
by this mosquito, and you've had this disease,

61
0:02:56.191,000 --> 0:02:58,000
your body develops antibodies,

62
0:02:58.813,000 --> 0:03:02,000
so if you're bitten again with that strain,

63
0:03:03.227,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it doesn't affect you.

64
0:03:04.943,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But it's not one virus, it's four,

65
0:03:07.863,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and the same protection that gives you the antibodies

66
0:03:10.839,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and protects you from the same virus that you had before

67
0:03:14.151,000 --> 0:03:17,000
actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.

68
0:03:17.217,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So the next time you get dengue fever,

69
0:03:19.952,000 --> 0:03:21,000
if it's a different strain, you're more susceptible,

70
0:03:22.592,000 --> 0:03:24,000
you're likely to get worse symptoms,

71
0:03:25.223,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you're more likely to get the more severe forms,

72
0:03:27.824,000 --> 0:03:3,000
hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.

73
0:03:31.086,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So you don't want dengue once,

74
0:03:32.505,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and you certainly don't want it again.

75
0:03:35.246,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So why is it spreading so fast?

76
0:03:38.529,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And the answer is this thing.

77
0:03:40.625,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is Aedes aegypti.

78
0:03:42.399,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now this is a mosquito that came, like its name suggests,

79
0:03:45.609,000 --> 0:03:48,000
out of North Africa, and it's spread round the world.

80
0:03:49.051,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, in fact, a single mosquito will only travel

81
0:03:52.179,000 --> 0:03:55,000
about 200 yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far.

82
0:03:55.908,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking,

83
0:03:58.293,000 --> 0:03:59,000
particularly the eggs.

84
0:03:59.703,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They will lay their eggs in clear water, any pool, any puddle,

85
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:05,000
any birdbath, any flower pot,

86
0:04:06.35,000 --> 0:04:08,000
anywhere there's clear water, they'll lay their eggs,

87
0:04:09.09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and if that clear water is near freight, it's near a port,

88
0:04:12.712,000 --> 0:04:14,000
if it's anywhere near transport,

89
0:04:15.361,000 --> 0:04:18,000
those eggs will then get transported around the world.

90
0:04:18.545,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And that's what's happened. Mankind has transported

91
0:04:20.968,000 --> 0:04:22,000
these eggs all the way around the world,

92
0:04:22.974,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and these insects have infested over 100 countries,

93
0:04:26.672,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and there's now 2.5 billion people living in countries

94
0:04:29.37,000 --> 0:04:31,000
where this mosquito resides.

95
0:04:32.362,000 --> 0:04:33,000
To give you just a couple of examples

96
0:04:33.946,000 --> 0:04:35,000
how fast this has happened,

97
0:04:36.462,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in the mid-'70s, Brazil declared, "We have no Aedes aegypti,"

98
0:04:41.978,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and currently they spend about a billion dollars now

99
0:04:44.328,000 --> 0:04:46,000
a year trying to get rid of it, trying to control it,

100
0:04:47.128,000 --> 0:04:52,000
just one species of mosquito.

101
0:04:52.229,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Two days ago, or yesterday, I can't remember which,

102
0:04:55.772,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I saw a Reuters report that said

103
0:04:57.736,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Madeira had had their first cases of dengue,

104
0:05:00.37,000 --> 0:05:03,000
about 52 cases, with about 400 probable cases.

105
0:05:04.19,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That's two days ago.

106
0:05:06.004,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Interestingly, Madeira first got the insect in 2005,

107
0:05:11.185,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and here we are, a few years later,

108
0:05:13.242,000 --> 0:05:14,000
first cases of dengue.

109
0:05:14.569,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes,

110
0:05:17.928,000 --> 0:05:19,000
dengue will follow.

111
0:05:20.242,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Once you've got the mosquito in your area,

112
0:05:22.433,000 --> 0:05:24,000
anyone coming into that area with dengue,

113
0:05:24.802,000 --> 0:05:26,000
mosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else,

114
0:05:27.745,000 --> 0:05:27,000
somewhere else, somewhere else,

115
0:05:28.709,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and you'll get an epidemic.

116
0:05:32.824,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So we must be good at killing mosquitos.

117
0:05:34.732,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I mean, that can't be very difficult.

118
0:05:36.629,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Well, there's two principle ways.

119
0:05:39.449,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The first way is that you use larvicides.

120
0:05:42.821,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed.

121
0:05:45.633,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now in an urban environment, that's extraordinarily difficult.

122
0:05:48.433,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You've got to get your chemical into every puddle,

123
0:05:50.618,000 --> 0:05:52,000
every birdbath, every tree trunk.

124
0:05:52.866,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's just not practical.

125
0:05:55.908,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The second way you can do it

126
0:05:57.424,000 --> 0:06:,000
is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around.

127
0:06:00.738,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This is a picture of fogging.

128
0:06:02.964,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Here what someone is doing

129
0:06:05.409,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is mixing up chemical in a smoke

130
0:06:08.323,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and basically spreading that through the environment.

131
0:06:11.337,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You could do the same with a space spray.

132
0:06:14.297,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This is really unpleasant stuff,

133
0:06:15.865,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase

134
0:06:18.267,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.

135
0:06:22.923,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So it's not very effective, but it's probably

136
0:06:25.012,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the best thing we've got at the moment.

137
0:06:27.907,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Having said that, actually, your best form of protection

138
0:06:30.059,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt

139
0:06:32.444,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and a little bit of DEET to go with it.

140
0:06:35.868,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So let's start again. Let's design a product,

141
0:06:39.557,000 --> 0:06:42,000
right from the word go, and decide what we want.

142
0:06:42.833,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Well we clearly need something that is effective

143
0:06:45.428,000 --> 0:06:47,000
at reducing the mosquito population.

144
0:06:47.736,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.

145
0:06:50.168,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We want something that gets that population right the way down

146
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
so it can't get the disease transmission.

147
0:06:56.276,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.

148
0:06:59.58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We are going to use it in and around humans.

149
0:07:01.756,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It has to be safe.

150
0:07:03.319,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment.

151
0:07:05.549,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We don't want to do anything that you can't undo.

152
0:07:08.783,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Maybe a better product comes along in 20, 30 years.

153
0:07:13.876,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Fine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact.

154
0:07:16.75,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We want something that's relatively cheap, or cost-effective,

155
0:07:20.022,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because there's an awful lot of countries involved,

156
0:07:21.975,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and some of them are emerging markets,

157
0:07:23.981,000 --> 0:07:26,000
some of them emerging countries, low-income.

158
0:07:27.543,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And finally, you want something that's species-specific.

159
0:07:29.918,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue,

160
0:07:32.706,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but you don't really want to get all the other insects.

161
0:07:35.694,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Some are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem.

162
0:07:38.91,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This one's not. It's invaded you.

163
0:07:40.748,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But you don't want to get all of the insects.

164
0:07:43.43,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You just want to get this one.

165
0:07:45.089,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And most of the time, you'll find this insect

166
0:07:47.948,000 --> 0:07:48,000
lives in and around your home,

167
0:07:49.383,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so this -- whatever we do has got to get to that insect.

168
0:07:53.307,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's got to get into people's houses, into the bedrooms,

169
0:07:55.69,000 --> 0:07:56,000
into the kitchens.

170
0:07:57.484,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now there are two features of mosquito biology

171
0:08:01.129,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that really help us in this project,

172
0:08:03.029,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and that is, firstly, males don't bite.

173
0:08:06.901,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you.

174
0:08:10.01,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The male can't bite you, won't bite you,

175
0:08:12.411,000 --> 0:08:14,000
doesn't have the mouth parts to bite you.

176
0:08:14.714,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's just the female.

177
0:08:16.373,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And the second is a phenomenon

178
0:08:18.346,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that males are very, very good at finding females.

179
0:08:22.562,000 --> 0:08:24,000
If there's a male mosquito that you release,

180
0:08:25.21,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and if there's a female around, that male will find the female.

181
0:08:30.053,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So basically, we've used those two factors.

182
0:08:33.871,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So here's a typical situation,

183
0:08:35.539,000 --> 0:08:37,000
male meets female, lots of offspring.

184
0:08:38.107,000 --> 0:08:39,000
A single female will lay about

185
0:08:39.836,000 --> 0:08:4,000
up to 100 eggs at a time,

186
0:08:41.631,000 --> 0:08:43,000
up to about 500 in her lifetime.

187
0:08:44.115,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now if that male is carrying a gene

188
0:08:47.136,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which causes the death of the offspring,

189
0:08:49.754,000 --> 0:08:51,000
then the offspring don't survive,

190
0:08:52.435,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and instead of having 500 mosquitos running around,

191
0:08:55.866,000 --> 0:08:57,000
you have none.

192
0:08:58.487,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if you can put more, I'll call them sterile,

193
0:09:01.606,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that the offspring will actually die at different stages,

194
0:09:04.479,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but I'll call them sterile for now.

195
0:09:06.068,000 --> 0:09:09,000
If you put more sterile males out into the environment,

196
0:09:09.624,000 --> 0:09:12,000
then the females are more likely to find a sterile male

197
0:09:12.912,000 --> 0:09:17,000
than a fertile one, and you will bring that population down.

198
0:09:18.751,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So the males will go out, they'll look for females,

199
0:09:21.146,000 --> 0:09:24,000
they'll mate. If they mate successfully, then no offspring.

200
0:09:24.97,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If they don't find a female, then they'll die anyway.

201
0:09:27.973,000 --> 0:09:3,000
They only live a few days.

202
0:09:31.707,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And that's exactly where we are.

203
0:09:33.941,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So this is technology that was developed

204
0:09:35.571,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in Oxford University a few years ago.

205
0:09:38.123,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The company itself, Oxitec, we've been working

206
0:09:40.544,000 --> 0:09:42,000
for the last 10 years, very much on a sort of similar

207
0:09:43.093,000 --> 0:09:46,000
development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company.

208
0:09:46.535,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing,

209
0:09:50.645,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready.

210
0:09:54.037,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And then we've gone out into the big outdoors,

211
0:09:56.524,000 --> 0:09:57,000
always with local community consent,

212
0:09:58.125,000 --> 0:10:,000
always with the necessary permits.

213
0:10:00.31,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands,

214
0:10:03.373,000 --> 0:10:04,000
a small one in Malaysia,

215
0:10:04.919,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and two more now in Brazil.

216
0:10:09.254,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And what's the result?

217
0:10:10.987,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Well, the result has been very good.

218
0:10:14.295,000 --> 0:10:16,000
In about four months of release,

219
0:10:17.119,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we've brought that population of mosquitos

220
0:10:19.415,000 --> 0:10:21,000
— in most cases we're dealing with villages here

221
0:10:21.958,000 --> 0:10:24,000
of about 2,000, 3,000 people, that sort of size,

222
0:10:25.23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
starting small —

223
0:10:26.668,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we've taken that mosquito population down

224
0:10:28.859,000 --> 0:10:31,000
by about 85 percent in about four months.

225
0:10:32.083,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And in fact, the numbers after that get,

226
0:10:34.082,000 --> 0:10:37,000
those get very difficult to count, because there just aren't any left.

227
0:10:37.822,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So that's been what we've seen in Cayman,

228
0:10:39.478,000 --> 0:10:42,000
it's been what we've seen in Brazil

229
0:10:42.74,000 --> 0:10:43,000
in those trials.

230
0:10:44.726,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And now what we're doing is we're going through a process

231
0:10:47.038,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to scale up to a town of about 50,000,

232
0:10:49.871,000 --> 0:10:51,000
so we can see this work at big scale.

233
0:10:52.244,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And we've got a production unit in Oxford,

234
0:10:55.031,000 --> 0:10:58,000
or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos.

235
0:10:58.522,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We can produce them,

236
0:10:59.726,000 --> 0:11:01,000
in a space a bit more than this red carpet,

237
0:11:01.882,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I can produce about 20 million a week.

238
0:11:04.406,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We can transport them around the world.

239
0:11:06.572,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's not very expensive, because it's a coffee cup --

240
0:11:09.594,000 --> 0:11:1,000
something the size of a coffee cup

241
0:11:10.883,000 --> 0:11:13,000
will hold about three million eggs.

242
0:11:14.21,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So freight costs aren't our biggest problem. (Laughter)

243
0:11:18.028,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory.

244
0:11:21.332,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And for Brazil, where we've been doing some trials,

245
0:11:24.428,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the Brazilian government themselves have now built

246
0:11:26.316,000 --> 0:11:28,000
their own mosquito factory, far bigger than ours,

247
0:11:28.748,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil.

248
0:11:34.223,000 --> 0:11:36,000
There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs.

249
0:11:36.596,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We've separated the males from the females.

250
0:11:39.228,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The males have been put in little pots

251
0:11:42.878,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and the truck is going down the road

252
0:11:44.962,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and they are releasing males as they go.

253
0:11:47.926,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It's actually a little bit more precise than that.

254
0:11:49.576,000 --> 0:11:5,000
You want to release them so that

255
0:11:51.057,000 --> 0:11:53,000
you get good coverage of your area.

256
0:11:53.138,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So you take a Google Map, you divide it up,

257
0:11:55.929,000 --> 0:11:56,000
work out how far they can fly,

258
0:11:57.813,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and make sure you're releasing such that you get

259
0:11:59.788,000 --> 0:12:01,000
coverage of the area, and then you go back,

260
0:12:02.686,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and within a very short space of time,

261
0:12:04.46,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you're bringing that population right the way down.

262
0:12:08.036,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We've also done this in agriculture.

263
0:12:10.468,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We've got several different species of agriculture coming along,

264
0:12:14.54,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and I'm hoping that soon

265
0:12:16.448,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back

266
0:12:19.244,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and start looking at malaria.

267
0:12:22.326,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So that's where we stand at the moment,

268
0:12:24.375,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and I've just got a few final thoughts,

269
0:12:26.904,000 --> 0:12:29,000
which is that this is another way in which biology

270
0:12:30.348,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is now coming in to supplement chemistry

271
0:12:34.337,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in some of our societal advances in this area,

272
0:12:38.08,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and these biological approaches are coming in

273
0:12:40.368,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in very different forms,

274
0:12:42.769,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and when you think about genetic engineering,

275
0:12:45.091,000 --> 0:12:48,000
we've now got enzymes for industrial processing,

276
0:12:48.097,000 --> 0:12:5,000
enzymes, genetically engineered enzymes in food.

277
0:12:51.031,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We have G.M. crops, we have pharmaceuticals,

278
0:12:53.833,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we have new vaccines,

279
0:12:55.149,000 --> 0:12:59,000
all using roughly the same technology, but with very different outcomes.

280
0:12:59.233,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I'm in favor, actually. Of course I am.

281
0:13:02.746,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies

282
0:13:05.642,000 --> 0:13:08,000
don't work well or have become unacceptable.

283
0:13:08.714,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And although the techniques are similar,

284
0:13:12.071,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the outcomes are very, very different,

285
0:13:13.612,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and if you take our approach, for example,

286
0:13:15.126,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and you compare it to, say, G.M. crops,

287
0:13:17.551,000 --> 0:13:21,000
both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.

288
0:13:21.843,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Both have a side benefit,

289
0:13:23.986,000 --> 0:13:26,000
which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.

290
0:13:27.695,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant,

291
0:13:31.656,000 --> 0:13:33,000
for example, and give it an advantage,

292
0:13:34.4,000 --> 0:13:37,000
what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito

293
0:13:37.495,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have,

294
0:13:41.584,000 --> 0:13:43,000
rendering it unable to reproduce effectively.

295
0:13:44.568,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So for the mosquito, it's a dead end.

296
0:13:48.168,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.86,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here to offer you a new way to think about my field,

2
0:00:16.635,000 --> 0:00:17,000
artificial intelligence.

3
0:00:18.427,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I think the purpose of AI

4
0:00:20.465,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is to empower humans with machine intelligence.

5
0:00:25.106,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And as machines get smarter,

6
0:00:27.58,000 --> 0:00:28,000
we get smarter.

7
0:00:29.727,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I call this "humanistic AI" --

8
0:00:32.263,000 --> 0:00:35,000
artificial intelligence designed to meet human needs

9
0:00:35.958,000 --> 0:00:37,000
by collaborating and augmenting people.

10
0:00:39.969,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, today I'm happy to see

11
0:00:41.903,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that the idea of an intelligent assistant

12
0:00:44.104,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is mainstream.

13
0:00:45.597,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's the well-accepted metaphor for the interface between humans and AI.

14
0:00:51.376,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And the one I helped create is called Siri.

15
0:00:54.777,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You know Siri.

16
0:00:55.953,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Siri is the thing that knows your intent

17
0:00:58.622,000 --> 0:01:,000
and helps you do it for you,

18
0:01:00.688,000 --> 0:01:01,000
helps you get things done.

19
0:01:02.213,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But what you might not know is that we designed Siri

20
0:01:05.465,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as humanistic AI,

21
0:01:07.455,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to augment people with a conversational interface

22
0:01:10.65,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that made it possible for them to use mobile computing,

23
0:01:14.127,000 --> 0:01:17,000
regardless of who they were and their abilities.

24
0:01:18.634,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now for most of us,

25
0:01:20.235,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the impact of this technology

26
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is to make things a little bit easier to use.

27
0:01:25.736,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But for my friend Daniel,

28
0:01:29.172,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the impact of the AI in these systems is a life changer.

29
0:01:33.037,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You see, Daniel is a really social guy,

30
0:01:37.894,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and he's blind and quadriplegic,

31
0:01:40.434,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which makes it hard to use those devices that we all take for granted.

32
0:01:44.317,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The last time I was at his house, his brother said,

33
0:01:46.783,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready.

34
0:01:48.665,000 --> 0:01:5,000
He's on the phone with a woman he met online."

35
0:01:52.07,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'm like, "That's cool, how'd he do it?"

36
0:01:54.104,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Well, Daniel uses Siri to manage his own social life --

37
0:01:58.551,000 --> 0:01:59,000
his email, text and phone --

38
0:02:00.515,000 --> 0:02:02,000
without depending on his caregivers.

39
0:02:04.321,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is kind of interesting, right?

40
0:02:06.083,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The irony here is great.

41
0:02:07.424,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Here's the man whose relationship with AI

42
0:02:10.344,000 --> 0:02:13,000
helps him have relationships with genuine human beings.

43
0:02:14.625,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And this is humanistic AI.

44
0:02:19.224,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Another example with life-changing consequences

45
0:02:21.646,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is diagnosing cancer.

46
0:02:24.615,000 --> 0:02:26,000
When a doctor suspects cancer,

47
0:02:26.794,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they take a sample and send it to a pathologist,

48
0:02:29.521,000 --> 0:02:3,000
who looks at it under a microscope.

49
0:02:31.965,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, pathologists look at hundreds of slides

50
0:02:34.514,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and millions of cells every day.

51
0:02:37.45,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So to support this task,

52
0:02:38.861,000 --> 0:02:41,000
some researchers made an AI classifier.

53
0:02:43.368,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, the classifier says, "Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"

54
0:02:47.945,000 --> 0:02:48,000
looking at the pictures.

55
0:02:50.175,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The classifier was pretty good,

56
0:02:52.787,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but not as good as the person,

57
0:02:55.765,000 --> 0:02:56,000
who got it right most of the time.

58
0:02:58.247,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But when they combine the ability of the machine and the human together,

59
0:03:04.451,000 --> 0:03:06,000
accuracy went to 99.5 percent.

60
0:03:08.97,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Adding that AI to a partnership eliminated 85 percent of the errors

61
0:03:13.995,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that the human pathologist would have made working alone.

62
0:03:18.64,000 --> 0:03:21,000
That's a lot of cancer that would have otherwise gone untreated.

63
0:03:22.917,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, for the curious, it turns out

64
0:03:24.871,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that the human was better at rejecting false positives,

65
0:03:28.369,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the machine was better at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.

66
0:03:31.965,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But the lesson here isn't about which agent is better

67
0:03:35.226,000 --> 0:03:37,000
at this image-classification task.

68
0:03:37.708,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Those things are changing every day.

69
0:03:39.571,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The lesson here

70
0:03:41.163,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is that by combining the abilities of the human and machine,

71
0:03:44.547,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it created a partnership that had superhuman performance.

72
0:03:50.363,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And that is humanistic AI.

73
0:03:54.607,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now let's look at another example

74
0:03:56.617,000 --> 0:03:58,000
with turbocharging performance.

75
0:03:58.928,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is design.

76
0:04:00.355,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, let's say you're an engineer.

77
0:04:02.42,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You want to design a new frame for a drone.

78
0:04:04.561,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You get out your favorite software tools, CAD tools,

79
0:04:07.649,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and you enter the form and the materials, and then you analyze performance.

80
0:04:11.888,000 --> 0:04:12,000
That gives you one design.

81
0:04:13.982,000 --> 0:04:16,000
If you give those same tools to an AI,

82
0:04:17.683,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it can generate thousands of designs.

83
0:04:22.013,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This video by Autodesk is amazing.

84
0:04:23.971,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This is real stuff.

85
0:04:25.912,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So this transforms how we do design.

86
0:04:29.007,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The human engineer now

87
0:04:30.459,000 --> 0:04:33,000
says what the design should achieve,

88
0:04:33.798,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and the machine says,

89
0:04:34.978,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"Here's the possibilities."

90
0:04:37.578,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now in her job, the engineer's job

91
0:04:40.542,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is to pick the one that best meets the goals of the design,

92
0:04:43.666,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which she knows as a human better than anyone else,

93
0:04:47.029,000 --> 0:04:48,000
using human judgment and expertise.

94
0:04:49.234,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In this case, the winning form

95
0:04:50.838,000 --> 0:04:52,000
looks kind of like something nature would have designed,

96
0:04:53.573,000 --> 0:04:55,000
minus a few million years of evolution

97
0:04:55.712,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and all that unnecessary fur.

98
0:05:00.244,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now let's see where this idea of humanistic AI might lead us

99
0:05:04.94,000 --> 0:05:06,000
if we follow it into the speculative beyond.

100
0:05:07.938,000 --> 0:05:1,000
What's a kind of augmentation that we would all like to have?

101
0:05:11.349,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Well, how about cognitive enhancement?

102
0:05:15.724,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Instead of asking,

103
0:05:17.227,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"How smart can we make our machines?"

104
0:05:19.312,000 --> 0:05:2,000
let's ask

105
0:05:20.509,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"How smart can our machines make us?"

106
0:05:24.925,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I mean, take memory for example.

107
0:05:27.331,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Memory is the foundation of human intelligence.

108
0:05:31.587,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But human memory is famously flawed.

109
0:05:35.361,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We're great at telling stories,

110
0:05:37.459,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but not getting the details right.

111
0:05:39.434,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And our memories -- they decay over time.

112
0:05:42.664,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I mean, like, where did the '60s go, and can I go there, too?

113
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:48.468,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But what if you could have a memory that was as good as computer memory,

115
0:05:53.978,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and was about your life?

116
0:05:57.534,000 --> 0:05:59,000
What if you could remember every person you ever met,

117
0:06:00.347,000 --> 0:06:01,000
how to pronounce their name,

118
0:06:02.317,000 --> 0:06:04,000
their family details, their favorite sports,

119
0:06:04.433,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the last conversation you had with them?

120
0:06:06.42,000 --> 0:06:08,000
If you had this memory all your life,

121
0:06:09.099,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you could have the AI look at all the interactions

122
0:06:12.421,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you had with people over time

123
0:06:13.862,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and help you reflect on the long arc of your relationships.

124
0:06:18.35,000 --> 0:06:23,000
What if you could have the AI read everything you've ever read

125
0:06:23.44,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and listen to every song you've ever heard?

126
0:06:27.164,000 --> 0:06:3,000
From the tiniest clue, it could help you retrieve

127
0:06:30.927,000 --> 0:06:32,000
anything you've ever seen or heard before.

128
0:06:33.751,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Imagine what that would do for the ability to make new connections

129
0:06:37.025,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and form new ideas.

130
0:06:38.629,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And what about our bodies?

131
0:06:41.552,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What if we could remember the consequences of every food we eat,

132
0:06:45.854,000 --> 0:06:46,000
every pill we take,

133
0:06:48.305,000 --> 0:06:49,000
every all-nighter we pull?

134
0:06:50.868,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We could do our own science on our own data

135
0:06:53.602,000 --> 0:06:56,000
about what makes us feel good and stay healthy.

136
0:06:57.486,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And imagine how this could revolutionize

137
0:06:59.986,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the way we manage allergies and chronic disease.

138
0:07:04.729,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I believe that AI will make personal memory enhancement a reality.

139
0:07:10.942,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I can't say when or what form factors are involved,

140
0:07:14.447,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but I think it's inevitable,

141
0:07:17.743,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because the very things that make AI successful today --

142
0:07:22.594,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the availability of comprehensive data

143
0:07:25.111,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and the ability for machines to make sense of that data --

144
0:07:28.683,000 --> 0:07:31,000
can be applied to the data of our lives.

145
0:07:32.325,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And those data are here today, available for all of us,

146
0:07:35.836,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because we lead digitally mediated lives,

147
0:07:40.39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in mobile and online.

148
0:07:43.653,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In my view, a personal memory is a private memory.

149
0:07:47.567,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We get to choose what is and is not recalled and retained.

150
0:07:52.337,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's absolutely essential that this be kept very secure.

151
0:07:57.114,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now for most of us,

152
0:07:58.6,000 --> 0:08:,000
the impact of augmented personal memory

153
0:08:01.517,000 --> 0:08:03,000
will be a more improved mental gain,

154
0:08:04.276,000 --> 0:08:06,000
maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace.

155
0:08:08.478,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But for the millions who suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia,

156
0:08:15.029,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the difference that augmented memory could make

157
0:08:17.256,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is a difference between a life of isolation

158
0:08:20.836,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and a life of dignity and connection.

159
0:08:23.986,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We are in the middle of a renaissance in artificial intelligence right now.

160
0:08:30.472,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I mean, in just the past few years,

161
0:08:32.467,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we're beginning to see solutions to AI problems

162
0:08:36.122,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that we have struggled with literally for decades:

163
0:08:41.046,000 --> 0:08:43,000
speech understanding, text understanding,

164
0:08:43.737,000 --> 0:08:44,000
image understanding.

165
0:08:45.997,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We have a choice in how we use this powerful technology.

166
0:08:51.088,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We can choose to use AI to automate and compete with us,

167
0:08:55.976,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or we can use AI to augment and collaborate with us,

168
0:08:59.977,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to overcome our cognitive limitations

169
0:09:03.072,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and to help us do what we want to do,

170
0:09:06.258,000 --> 0:09:07,000
only better.

171
0:09:08.159,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And as we discover new ways to give machines intelligence,

172
0:09:14.687,000 --> 0:09:17,000
we can distribute that intelligence

173
0:09:17.78,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to all of the AI assistants in the world,

174
0:09:20.185,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and therefore to every person, regardless of circumstance.

175
0:09:25.009,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And that is why,

176
0:09:26.562,000 --> 0:09:29,000
every time a machine gets smarter,

177
0:09:30.448,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we get smarter.

178
0:09:32.848,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That is an AI worth spreading.

179
0:09:36.605,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Thank you.

180
0:09:37.811,000 --> 0:09:4,000

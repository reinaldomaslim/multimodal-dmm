1
0:00:13.039,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?

2
0:00:17.349,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:18.752,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Well, because we're not monkeys,

4
0:00:20.864,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we're fish.

5
0:00:22.038,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:23.101,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, knowing you're a fish and not a monkey

7
0:00:26.073,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is actually really important to understanding where we came from.

8
0:00:30.524,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I teach one of the largest evolutionary biology classes in the US,

9
0:00:34.285,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and when my students finally understand why I call them fish all the time,

10
0:00:38.368,000 --> 0:00:4,000
then I know I'm getting my job done.

11
0:00:40.979,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But I always have to start my classes by dispelling some hardwired myths,

12
0:00:45.637,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because without really knowing it, many of us were taught evolution wrong.

13
0:00:50.849,000 --> 0:00:53,000
For instance, we're taught to say "the theory of evolution."

14
0:00:54.944,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There are actually many theories, and just like the process itself,

15
0:00:58.785,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the ones that best fit the data are the ones that survive to this day.

16
0:01:03.241,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The one we know best is Darwinian natural selection.

17
0:01:06.963,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That's the process by which organisms that best fit an environment

18
0:01:10.947,000 --> 0:01:12,000
survive and get to reproduce,

19
0:01:13.191,000 --> 0:01:15,000
while those that are less fit slowly die off.

20
0:01:16.698,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And that's it.

21
0:01:17.898,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Evolution is as simple as that, and it's a fact.

22
0:01:21.785,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Evolution is a fact as much as the "theory of gravity."

23
0:01:26.15,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You can prove it just as easily.

24
0:01:28.205,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You just need to look at your bellybutton

25
0:01:30.292,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that you share with other placental mammals,

26
0:01:32.482,000 --> 0:01:35,000
or your backbone that you share with other vertebrates,

27
0:01:35.526,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or your DNA that you share with all other life on earth.

28
0:01:39.511,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Those traits didn't pop up in humans.

29
0:01:41.748,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They were passed down from different ancestors

30
0:01:44.528,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to all their descendants, not just us.

31
0:01:47.619,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But that's not really how we learn biology early on, is it?

32
0:01:51.017,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We learn plants and bacteria are primitive things,

33
0:01:54.46,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and fish give rise to amphibians followed by reptiles and mammals,

34
0:01:57.638,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and then you get you,

35
0:01:59.445,000 --> 0:02:01,000
this perfectly evolved creature at the end of the line.

36
0:02:03.032,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But life doesn't evolve in a line,

37
0:02:05.79,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and it doesn't end with us.

38
0:02:08.591,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But we're always shown evolution portrayed something like this,

39
0:02:12.075,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a monkey and a chimpanzee,

40
0:02:14.487,000 --> 0:02:15,000
some extinct humans,

41
0:02:15.747,000 --> 0:02:18,000
all on a forward and steady march to becoming us.

42
0:02:19.621,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But they don't become us any more than we would become them.

43
0:02:23.24,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We're also not the goal of evolution.

44
0:02:27.298,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But why does it matter?

45
0:02:28.823,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Why do we need to understand evolution the right way?

46
0:02:32.56,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Well, misunderstanding evolution has led to many problems,

47
0:02:36.132,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but you can't ask that age-old question,

48
0:02:40.472,000 --> 0:02:41,000
"Where are we from?"

49
0:02:42.203,000 --> 0:02:44,000
without understanding evolution the right way.

50
0:02:45.036,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Misunderstanding it has led to many convoluted and corrupted views

51
0:02:50.916,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of how we should treat other life on earth,

52
0:02:53.987,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and how we should treat each other

53
0:02:55.876,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in terms of race and gender.

54
0:02:59.253,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So let's go back four billion years.

55
0:03:02.927,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is the single-celled organism we all came from.

56
0:03:06.075,000 --> 0:03:09,000
At first, it gave rise to other single-celled life,

57
0:03:09.424,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but these are still evolving to this day,

58
0:03:11.94,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and some would say the Archaea and Bacteria

59
0:03:14.154,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that make up most of this group

60
0:03:16.028,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is the most successful on the planet.

61
0:03:18.175,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They are certainly going to be here well after us.

62
0:03:21.5,000 --> 0:03:24,000
About three billion years ago, multicellularity evolved.

63
0:03:25.204,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This includes your fungi and your plants and your animals.

64
0:03:29.021,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The first animals to develop a backbone were fishes.

65
0:03:33.385,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So technically, all vertebrates are fishes,

66
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
so technically, you and I are fish.

67
0:03:40.717,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So don't say I didn't warn you.

68
0:03:43.526,000 --> 0:03:45,000
One fish lineage came onto land

69
0:03:45.631,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and gave rise to, among other things, the mammals and reptiles.

70
0:03:49.561,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Some reptiles become birds, some mammals become primates,

71
0:03:53.909,000 --> 0:03:55,000
some primates become monkeys with tails,

72
0:03:56.694,000 --> 0:04:,000
and others become the great apes, including a variety of human species.

73
0:04:01.511,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys,

74
0:04:03.911,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but we do share a common ancestor with them.

75
0:04:06.824,000 --> 0:04:08,000
All the while, life around us kept evolving:

76
0:04:09.768,000 --> 0:04:12,000
more bacteria, more fungi, lots of fish, fish, fish.

77
0:04:13.734,000 --> 0:04:15,000
If you couldn't tell -- yes, they're my favorite group.

78
0:04:16.345,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:17.37,000 --> 0:04:19,000
As life evolves, it also goes extinct.

80
0:04:20.331,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Most species just last for a few million years.

81
0:04:23.642,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So you see, most life on earth that we see around us today

82
0:04:26.419,000 --> 0:04:28,000
are about the same age as our species.

83
0:04:28.958,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So it's hubris, it's self-centered to think,

84
0:04:32.284,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive,

85
0:04:34.879,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and we've been here for an evolutionary minute,

86
0:04:37.141,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so we're somehow special."

87
0:04:39.172,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Think of life as being this book, an unfinished book for sure.

88
0:04:44.085,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We're just seeing the last few pages of each chapter.

89
0:04:48.386,000 --> 0:04:5,000
If you look out on the eight million species

90
0:04:50.672,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that we share this planet with,

91
0:04:52.321,000 --> 0:04:56,000
think of them all being four billion years of evolution.

92
0:04:56.863,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They're all the product of that.

93
0:04:59.386,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life,

94
0:05:04.242,000 --> 0:05:08,000
all of us connected by invisible branches not just to each other,

95
0:05:08.567,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors.

96
0:05:12.499,000 --> 0:05:15,000
As a biologist, I'm still trying to learn, with others,

97
0:05:15.88,000 --> 0:05:18,000
how everyone's related to each other, who is related to whom.

98
0:05:20.831,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Perhaps it's better still

99
0:05:23.133,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to think of us as a little fish out of water.

100
0:05:26.853,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Yes, one that learned to walk and talk,

101
0:05:29.797,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but one that still has a lot of learning to do

102
0:05:32.17,000 --> 0:05:34,000
about who we are and where we came from.

103
0:05:35.348,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Thank you.

104
0:05:36.523,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Applause)

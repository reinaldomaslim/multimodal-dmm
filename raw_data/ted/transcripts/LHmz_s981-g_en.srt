in your hand you must be willing to lose

39
0:02:41.51,000 --> 0:02:46,000
when the dream was an ocean it lived in

40
0:02:44.97,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the desert near Edwards Air Force Base

41
0:02:47.34,000 --> 0:02:54,000
where NASA tested spaceships it fed on

42
0:02:51.9,000 --> 0:02:57,000
cactus and stars but it kept being

43
0:02:54.63,000 --> 0:03:,000
delayed it's not time they said the

44
0:02:58.41,000 --> 0:03:03,000
dream grew impatient broke water

45
0:03:01.46,000 --> 0:03:07,000
extracted from its mother in a bed of

46
0:03:04.14,000 --> 0:03:1,000
wrecked strawberries as a teenager it

47
0:03:07.65,000 --> 0:03:12,000
cried took endless drives over the

48
0:03:10.71,000 --> 0:03:15,000
grapevine out of a town ripe with

49
0:03:12.99,000 --> 0:03:19,000
oranges and silence get me out of here

50
0:03:16.2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it begged it was so tiny and delicate

51
0:03:20.22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you feared for its life it seemed a

52
0:03:23.4,000 --> 0:03:28,000
butterfly might land on its face and

53
0:03:25.53,000 --> 0:03:32,000
crush it it frightened you to love

54
0:03:28.62,000 --> 0:03:34,000
something so much later it rebelled got

55
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000

0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:47,000
screamed it needed skyscrapers and

59
0:03:44.7,000 --> 0:03:48,000
nicotine needed to stay home reading the

60
0:03:47.07,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Easter Parade instead of going to its

61
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:54,000
job as a waitress at a restaurant where

62
0:03:51.51,000 --> 0:03:56,000
could not afford the food it was a dream

63
0:03:54.36,000 --> 0:03:59,000
for Christ's sake it had better things

64
0:03:56.58,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to do it had to write pray dispatch

65
0:04:00.18,000 --> 0:04:07,000
fleets of messages to God about how to

66
0:04:03.24,000 --> 0:04:1,000
make itself known in daylight all its

67
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
life the dream made plans it planned to

68
0:04:10.65,000 --> 0:04:15,000
write publish get rich publish have sex

69
0:04:14.01,000 --> 0:04:2,000
with reckless attractive men in the back

70
0:04:16.47,000 --> 0:04:22,000
seats of taxis yes that happened no it

71
0:04:20.07,000 --> 0:04:26,000
didn't the dream argued with itself with

72
0:04:23.34,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the truth you didn't have the dream the

73
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
dream had you every single one of its

74
0:04:29.7,000 --> 0:04:35,000
plans fell through I give up

75
0:04:32.31,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it cried I quit hid itself in the dark

76
0:04:36.51,000 --> 0:04:43,000
until finally it heard its name being

77
0:04:40.08,000 --> 0:04:46,000
called pondered the unspeakable miracle

78
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of sticking around long enough to be

79
0:04:46.98,000 --> 0:04:52,000
seen now it looks around for the ones

80
0:04:51.45,000 --> 0:04:56,000
who've waited years

81
0:04:53.43,000 --> 0:04:57,000
for its arrival they always come for you

82
0:04:56.91,000 --> 0:05:,000
don't they

83
0:04:58.17,000 --> 0:05:03,000
your girls with their crossed fingers

84
0:05:01.02,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and belief in you no destination they

85
0:05:03.93,000 --> 0:05:11,000
say no Maps no idea where we're headed

86
0:05:08.73,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and even though you cannot believe this

87
0:05:12.57,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is happening

88
0:05:13.44,000 --> 0:05:19,000
even though you are hallucinating with

89
0:05:16.53,000 --> 0:05:3,000
fear you hear yourself say it I am ready

90
0:05:20.31,000 --> 0:05:33,000

92
0:05:33.78,000 --> 0:05:38,000
sisters how'd you two meet like we're a

93
0:05:36.3,000 --> 0:05:39,000
married couple I like to say we met

94
0:05:38.94,000 --> 0:05:43,000
online

95
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we met at the Nuyorican poets cafe in

96
0:05:43.97,000 --> 0:05:48,000
1999 every Friday night of our young

97
0:05:47.34,000 --> 0:05:52,000
lives spent in the audience or on the

98
0:05:49.83,000 --> 0:05:53,000
mic miss one Friday and you would hear

99
0:05:52.5,000 --> 0:05:57,000
about the poet who killed it you should

100
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
have been there I killed it the night I

101
0:05:57.84,000 --> 0:06:04,000
met Jeff she was sitting on the lap of

102
0:06:00.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
my arch-nemesis I swear we are never

103
0:06:05.1,000 --> 0:06:11,000
going to be friends really we're not

104
0:06:09.36,000 --> 0:06:13,000
going to be friends because I'm friends

105
0:06:11.91,000 --> 0:06:17,000
with someone you don't like absolutely

106
0:06:14.01,000 --> 0:06:21,000
without a doubt misdemeanor one menacing

107
0:06:18.75,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I love it when women size me up and spit

108
0:06:21.93,000 --> 0:06:25,000
me out before they've ever met me before

109
0:06:23.79,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I've said one word the phrase dismissed

110
0:06:26.58,000 --> 0:06:32,000
before investigation comes to mind

111
0:06:28.91,000 --> 0:06:34,000
misdemeanor to fraud Felice likes to

112
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
claim she believes in science and math

113
0:06:35.79,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that she proceeds through life with

114
0:06:37.95,000 --> 0:06:41,000
logic like a man lot of logic in this

115
0:06:40.74,000 --> 0:06:45,000
example a lot of fairness and justice

116
0:06:42.54,000 --> 0:06:48,000
real open mind at play Felice is not a

117
0:06:46.44,000 --> 0:06:5,000
detective she only plays one on stage

118
0:06:48.96,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and when I say that I say it as a

119
0:06:51.27,000 --> 0:06:55,000
private investigator license in the

120
0:06:53.22,000 --> 0:06:59,000
state of New York

121
0:06:56.09,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Sherlock Holmes doesn't need a license

122
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
he solves crime so do i using science

123
0:07:04.2,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and my intuition

124
0:07:06.24,000 --> 0:07:11,000
everything I know about detective work I

125
0:07:07.83,000 --> 0:07:14,000
learned on TV episode 2 how we became

126
0:07:12.06,000 --> 0:07:17,000
sisters right so about a year later Jen

127
0:07:15.09,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and I were invited to read poems in the

128
0:07:17.25,000 --> 0:07:23,000
basement of to boots pizzeria careers

129
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
had taken off after the pizzeria reading

130
0:07:24.21,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we have a slice I don't know why but I

131
0:07:27.3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
tell her something I hadn't told anyone

132
0:07:29.4,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I spent the weekend in Reno with nacho

133
0:07:32.819,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Velasquez first thing she says did you

134
0:07:35.94,000 --> 0:07:44,000
see nachos little nacho and we were

135
0:07:39.27,000 --> 0:07:48,000
friends that not how I remember it in my

136
0:07:45.78,000 --> 0:07:5,000
mind we became friends after I was

137
0:07:48.479,000 --> 0:07:52,000
diagnosed with cancer you came with me

138
0:07:50.909,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to sloan-kettering because my family

139
0:07:53.009,000 --> 0:07:58,000
wasn't handy okay let's hear that

140
0:07:54.84,000 --> 0:08:01,000
version so we walk into sloan-kettering

141
0:07:58.259,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and I have never seen my sister happier

142
0:08:02.569,000 --> 0:08:08,000
reminder we are at the cancer hospital

143
0:08:05.639,000 --> 0:08:11,000
there are people limping by with curved

144
0:08:09.21,000 --> 0:08:15,000
faces and missing ears this place has

145
0:08:12.27,000 --> 0:08:17,000
everything there is a waterfall there

146
0:08:15.63,000 --> 0:08:19,000

147
0:08:17.46,000 --> 0:08:22,000
crackers I am sitting in the waiting

148
0:08:19.74,000 --> 0:08:23,000
room sweating through my dress she's

149
0:08:22.469,000 --> 0:08:28,000
making herself a cappuccino it's

150
0:08:24.24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
delicious I cannot handle you right now

151
0:08:29.449,000 --> 0:08:4,000
episode three six years after we first

152
0:08:34.979,000 --> 0:08:43,000

157
0:08:57.36,000 --> 0:09:06,000

is no bus my sister will walk miles just

159
0:09:06.839,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to be by my side when a sister loves a

160
0:09:12.149,000 --> 0:09:18,000
sister when she says it's time for

161
0:09:16.14,000 --> 0:09:19,000

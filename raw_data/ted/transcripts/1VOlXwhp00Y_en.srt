1
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
on his first successful telephone call,

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I just really want to thank you very much.

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"What a strange, long trip."

8
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And he should have said,

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
My lower half is appearing at a different conference

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

13
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in a different country.

14
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.

15
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'll explain at another time.

17
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And though I'm a rock star,

18
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.

19
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But what really turns me on about technology

20
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.

21
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that.

22
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I hope, I believe.

23
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What turns me on about the digital age,

24
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
what excites me personally,

25
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.

26
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,

27
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:59,000
you needed a studio and a producer.

28
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, you need a laptop.

29
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,000
If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment

30
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and a Hollywood budget.

31
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm,

32
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.

33
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.

34
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And that really, really excites me.

35
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.

36
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:35,000
What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.

37
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Political, economic, psychological, whatever.

38
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.

39
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles

40
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that no one knew could even be budged.

41
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.

42
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
First, though, I should probably explain why, and how,

43
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I got to this place.

44
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's a journey that started 20 years ago.

45
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You may remember that song, "We Are the World,"

46
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"

47
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Band Aid, Live Aid.

48
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,

49
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
issued a challenge to "feed the world."

50
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.

51
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.

52
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.

53
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.

54
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The children had a name for me.

55
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They called me, "The girl with the beard."

56
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Don't ask.

58
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.

59
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.

60
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Beautiful, royal people.

61
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.

62
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.

63
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Anyway, on our last day at this orphanage

64
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a man handed me his baby and said,

65
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"Would you take my son with you?"

66
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,

67
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.

68
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It was the middle of that awful famine.

69
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Well, I turned him down.

70
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.

71
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.

72
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And in that moment, I started this journey.

73
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In that moment, I became the worst thing of all:

74
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)

75
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Except this isn't the cause, is it?

76
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS --

77
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
a preventable, treatable disease --

78
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.

79
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

80
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
11 million AIDS orphans in Africa,

81
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
20 million by the end of the decade.

82
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

83
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Today, every day, 9,000 more Africans

84
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:46,000
will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.

85
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:5,000
That's not a cause. That's an emergency.

86
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So what we're talking about here is human rights.

87
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The right to live like a human.

88
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The right to live, period.

89
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And what we're facing in Africa is

90
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:08,000
an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.

91
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,

92
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and what this problem isn't.

93
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Because this is not all about charity.

94
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This is about justice. Really.

95
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This is not about charity. This is about justice.

96
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That's right.

97
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.

98
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Americans, like Irish people, are good at it.

99
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.

100
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We like to give, and we give a lot.

101
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Look at the response to the tsunami -- it's inspiring.

102
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But justice is a tougher standard than charity.

103
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.

104
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
It makes a farce of our idea of equality.

105
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.

106
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It questions our commitment.

107
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,

108
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and if we're honest,

109
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.

110
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.

111
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Not here, not in America, not in Europe.

112
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with

113
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
admitted this to me. And it's really true.

114
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life

115
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.

116
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Africa is a continent in flames.

117
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,

118
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we would all do more to put the fire out.

119
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We're standing around with watering cans,

120
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
when what we really need is the fire brigade.

121
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.

122
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's crazy, really, when you think about it.

123
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days

124
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to exist in the front of our brain?

125
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The slow extinguishing of countless lives

126
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is just not dramatic enough, it would appear.

127
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Catastrophes that we can avert

128
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:25,000
are not as interesting as ones we could avert.

129
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Funny, that.

130
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinking

131
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
offends the intellectual rigor in this room.

132
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Six-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,

133
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but the fact that it's not on the nightly news,

134
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that we in Europe, or you in America,

135
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
are not treating it like an emergency --

136
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.

137
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,

138
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
it could be soon.

139
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Every week, religious extremists take another African village.

140
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They're attempting to bring order to chaos.

141
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Well, why aren't we?

142
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Poverty breeds despair. We know this.

143
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Despair breeds violence. We know this.

144
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
In turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,

145
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to make friends out of potential enemies

146
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
than to defend yourself against them later?

147
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."

148
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.

149
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war

150
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that cannot be won by military might alone,

151
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
maybe we should listen.

152
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
There's an opportunity here, and it's real.

153
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.

154
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The problems facing the developing world

155
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
afford us in the developed world

156
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:,000
a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.

157
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We will not only transform other people's lives,

158
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but we will also transform the way those other lives see us.

159
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.

160
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Don't you think that on a purely commercial level,

161
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements

162
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
for Western ingenuity and technology?

163
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Doesn't compassion look well on us?

164
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And let's cut the crap for a second.

165
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:37,000
In certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,

166
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
is not at its shiniest.

167
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The neon sign is fizzing and cracking.

168
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Someone's put a brick through the window.

169
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The regional branch managers are getting nervous.

170
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized.

171
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Our values: do we have any?

172
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Our credibility?

173
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
These things are under attack around the world.

174
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Brand USA could use some polishing.

175
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And I say that as a fan, you know?

176
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
As a person who buys the products.

177
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But think about it.

178
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
More anti-retrovirals make sense.

179
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.

180
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But equality for Africa --

181
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that's a big, expensive idea.

182
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.

183
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:36,000
What on earth can we all do about this?

184
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Well, much more than we think.

185
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,

186
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I want to argue, we must.

187
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And because we can, we must.

188
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This is the straight truth, the righteous truth.

189
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It is not a theory.

190
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The fact is that ours is the first generation

191
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,

192
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:06,000
look across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:

193
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
we do not have to stand for this.

194
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:14,000
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.

195
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

196
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And let me say this without a trace of irony --

197
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.

198
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Forget the '60s. We can change the world.

199
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.

200
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I really believe that, the people in this room.

201
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Look at the Gates Foundation.

202
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
They've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.

203
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But working together, we can actually change the world.

204
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We can turn the inevitable outcomes,

205
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and transform the quality of life for millions of lives

206
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:09,000
who look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.

207
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different

208
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:19,000
than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.

209
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Laughter)

210
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.

211
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It is the flowering of the seeds you planted

212
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:33,000
in earlier, headier days.

213
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Ideas that you gestated in your youth.

214
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
This is what excites me.

215
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
This room was born for this moment,

216
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
is really what I want to say to you tonight.

217
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?

218
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Most of you did, the digital world.

219
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Well, now, actually because of you,

220
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
it is possible to change the physical world.

221
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It's a fact.

222
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.

223
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?

224
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Probably because when we admit we can do something about it,

225
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
we've got to do something about it.

226
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It is a pain in the arse.

227
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This equality business is actually a pain in the arse.

228
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:33,000
But for the first time in history, we have the technology;

229
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
we have the know-how; we have the cash;

230
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we have the life-saving drugs.

231
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Do we have the will?

232
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.

233
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.

234
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I do not have flowers in my hair.

235
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Actually, I come from punk rock.

236
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.

237
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But I know toughness when I see it.

238
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,

239
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:13,000
there was muscle to the movement that started out here.

240
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:19,000
You see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.

241
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But idealism allied with pragmatism,

242
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,

243
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:31,000
is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.

244
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And it's very present in a crowd like you.

245
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Last year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,

246
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
we launched a campaign to summon this spirit

247
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.

248
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We're calling it the ONE Campaign.

249
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's based on our belief that the action of one person

250
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
can change a lot,

251
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but the actions of many coming together as one

252
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:05,000
can change the world.

253
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.

254
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:15,000
There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.

255
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We believe this is one.

256
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:22,000
We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides

257
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.

258
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
This could be the time that we finally get serious

259
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:36,000
about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.

260
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Momentum has been building.

261
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Lurching a little, but it's building.

262
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:45,000
This year is a test for us all,

263
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:49,000
especially the leaders of the G8 nations,

264
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:51,000
who really are on the line here,

265
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
with all the world in history watching.

266
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.

267
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:02,000
They started out with such promise on Africa.

268
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:05,000
They made some really great promises,

269
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.

270
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
But some of them they haven't.

271
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:15,000
They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.

272
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:21,000
But my disappointment has much more perspective

273
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:23,000
when I talk to American people,

274
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and I hear their worries about the deficit,

275
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and the fiscal well being of their country.

276
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I understand that.

277
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:34,000
But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,

278
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:37,000
if we got organized.

279
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:41,000
What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,

280
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:45,000
is that aid for Africa is just great value for money

281
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:48,000
at a time when America really needs it.

282
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Putting it in the crassest possible terms,

283
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:55,000
the investment reaps huge returns.

284
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Not only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability

285
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and security that we'll gain.

286
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:09,000
So this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,

287
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and not have it deducted from my number of wishes.

288
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:17,000
(Laughter)

289
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:23,000
What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,

290
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:28,000
that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,

291
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:31,000
by America and by the world.

292
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Give them permission, if you like,

293
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
to spend their political capital and your financial capital,

294
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:41,000
your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.

295
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:44,000
That's really what I would like you to do.

296
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Because we also need your intellectual capital:

297
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:52,000
your ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.

298
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And you, at this conference, are in a unique position.

299
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:,000
Some of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,

300
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:03,000
or at least revolutionized the way that they're used.

301
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,

302
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and pushed the boundaries.

303
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And we'd like you to give us that energy.

304
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Give us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.

305
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:22,000
As I say, there're two things on the line here.

306
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:24,000
There's the continent Africa.

307
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
But there's also our sense of ourselves.

308
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:31,000
People are starting to figure this out.

309
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Movements are springing up.

310
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Artists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,

311
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:38,000
NGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.

312
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:42,000
A lot of people are getting together, and working

313
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:46,000
under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.

314
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:54,000
I think they just have one idea in their mind,

315
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:58,000
which is, where you live in the world

316
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:03,000
should not determine whether you live in the world.

317
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:07,000
(Applause)

318
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:11,000
History, like God, is watching what we do.

319
0:20:12,000 --> 0:20:14,000
When the history books get written,

320
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:18,000
I think our age will be remembered for three things.

321
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.

322
0:20:22,000 --> 0:20:25,000
The digital revolution, yes.

323
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:28,000
The war against terror, yes.

324
0:20:28,000 --> 0:20:34,000
And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.

325
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:42,000
Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.

326
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Thank you, thank you very much.

327
0:20:45,000 --> 0:20:52,000
(Applause)

328
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Okay, my three wishes.

329
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:58,000
The ones that TED has offered to grant.

330
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:03,000
You see, if this is true, and I believe it is,

331
0:21:03,000 --> 0:21:09,000
that the digital world you all created has uncoupled

332
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:14,000
the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,

333
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:16,000
this should be a piece of piss.

334
0:21:17,000 --> 0:21:2,000
(Laughter)

335
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:24,000
I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.

336
0:21:24,000 --> 0:21:26,000
Most of them impossible, some of them impractical

337
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:3,000
and one or two of them certainly immoral.

338
0:21:3,000 --> 0:21:34,000
(Laughter)

339
0:21:34,000 --> 0:21:38,000
This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,

340
0:21:38,000 --> 0:21:4,000
when somebody else is picking up the tab.

341
0:21:41,000 --> 0:21:43,000
Anyway, here's number one.

342
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:51,000
I wish for you to help build a social movement

343
0:21:51,000 --> 0:21:58,000
of more than one million American activists for Africa.

344
0:21:58,000 --> 0:22:,000
That is my first wish.

345
0:22:,000 --> 0:22:02,000
I believe it's possible.

346
0:22:02,000 --> 0:22:07,000
A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.

347
0:22:07,000 --> 0:22:09,000
You know, there's lots out there.

348
0:22:09,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And with this one campaign as our umbrella,

349
0:22:12,000 --> 0:22:15,000
my organization, DATA, and other groups,

350
0:22:15,000 --> 0:22:19,000
have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm

351
0:22:19,000 --> 0:22:23,000
that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.

352
0:22:23,000 --> 0:22:27,000
We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.

353
0:22:27,000 --> 0:22:3,000
We just need your help in making it happen.

354
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:33,000
We want all of you here, church America, corporate America,

355
0:22:33,000 --> 0:22:36,000
Microsoft America, Apple America, Coke America,

356
0:22:36,000 --> 0:22:39,000
Pepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.

357
0:22:39,000 --> 0:22:43,000
We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.

358
0:22:43,000 --> 0:22:48,000
I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,

359
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:51,000
we're not going to be denied.

360
0:22:51,000 --> 0:22:53,000
We will have the ear of Congress.

361
0:22:56,000 --> 0:22:59,000
We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,

362
0:22:59,000 --> 0:23:02,000
and right into the Oval Office.

363
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:05,000
If there's one million Americans -- and I really know this --

364
0:23:05,000 --> 0:23:07,000
who are ready to make phone calls,

365
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:09,000
who are ready to be on email,

366
0:23:09,000 --> 0:23:13,000
I am absolutely sure that we can actually change

367
0:23:13,000 --> 0:23:19,000
the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.

368
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:22,000
Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.

369
0:23:23,000 --> 0:23:27,000
I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,

370
0:23:27,000 --> 0:23:3,000
but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.

371
0:23:3,000 --> 0:23:34,000
Right, my second wish, number two.

372
0:23:38,000 --> 0:23:43,000
I would like one media hit for every person on the planet

373
0:23:43,000 --> 0:23:47,000
who is living on less than one dollar a day.

374
0:23:48,000 --> 0:23:51,000
That's one billion media hits.

375
0:23:51,000 --> 0:23:54,000
Could be on Google, could be on AOL.

376
0:23:54,000 --> 0:23:59,000
Steve Case, Larry, Sergey -- they've done a lot already.

377
0:24:,000 --> 0:24:02,000
It could be NBC. It could be ABC.

378
0:24:02,000 --> 0:24:05,000
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.

379
0:24:05,000 --> 0:24:1,000
We have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.

380
0:24:11,000 --> 0:24:15,000
But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.

381
0:24:15,000 --> 0:24:19,000
We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.

382
0:24:19,000 --> 0:24:22,000
I really believe that old Truman line,

383
0:24:22,000 --> 0:24:25,000
that if you give the American people the facts,

384
0:24:25,000 --> 0:24:27,000
they'll do the right thing.

385
0:24:27,000 --> 0:24:31,000
And, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.

386
0:24:31,000 --> 0:24:36,000
This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.

387
0:24:36,000 --> 0:24:38,000
(Video): One by one they step forward,

388
0:24:38,000 --> 0:24:4,000
a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,

389
0:24:4,000 --> 0:24:42,000
and lives are saved.

390
0:24:42,000 --> 0:24:44,000
The problem is enormous.

391
0:24:44,000 --> 0:24:47,000
Every three seconds one person dies.

392
0:24:47,000 --> 0:24:5,000
Another three seconds, one more.

393
0:24:5,000 --> 0:24:53,000
The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,

394
0:24:53,000 --> 0:24:55,000
Asia, even America,

395
0:24:55,000 --> 0:24:58,000
that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,

396
0:24:58,000 --> 0:25:02,000
are uniting as one, acting as one.

397
0:25:02,000 --> 0:25:06,000
We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.

398
0:25:06,000 --> 0:25:08,000
But we need your help.

399
0:25:08,000 --> 0:25:1,000
One more person, letter, voice

400
0:25:1,000 --> 0:25:13,000
will mean the difference between life and death

401
0:25:13,000 --> 0:25:15,000
for millions of people.

402
0:25:16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
Please join us by working together.

403
0:25:18,000 --> 0:25:21,000
Americans have an unprecedented opportunity.

404
0:25:21,000 --> 0:25:23,000
We can make history.

405
0:25:23,000 --> 0:25:25,000
We can start to make poverty history.

406
0:25:26,000 --> 0:25:28,000
One, by one, by one.

407
0:25:28,000 --> 0:25:31,000
Please visit ONE at this address.

408
0:25:31,000 --> 0:25:34,000
We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.

409
0:25:36,000 --> 0:25:44,000
Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,

410
0:25:44,000 --> 0:25:49,000
its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,

411
0:25:49,000 --> 0:25:55,000
by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school

412
0:25:55,000 --> 0:25:58,000
in one African country.

413
0:25:59,000 --> 0:26:02,000
And I would like it to be Ethiopia.

414
0:26:02,000 --> 0:26:06,000
I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,

415
0:26:06,000 --> 0:26:09,000
every health clinic, every hospital --

416
0:26:09,000 --> 0:26:12,000
we can connect to the Internet.

417
0:26:12,000 --> 0:26:14,000
That is my wish, my third wish.

418
0:26:14,000 --> 0:26:15,000
I think it's possible.

419
0:26:15,000 --> 0:26:18,000
I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.

420
0:26:18,000 --> 0:26:24,000
And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.

421
0:26:24,000 --> 0:26:27,000
I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.

422
0:26:27,000 --> 0:26:3,000
It's actually where it all started for me.

423
0:26:34,000 --> 0:26:38,000
The idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,

424
0:26:38,000 --> 0:26:42,000
can transform a country -- and a continent

425
0:26:42,000 --> 0:26:48,000
that has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital -- blows my mind.

426
0:26:49,000 --> 0:26:51,000
But it didn't start out that way.

427
0:26:52,000 --> 0:26:55,000
The first long-distance line from Boston to New York

428
0:26:55,000 --> 0:27:,000
was used in 1885 on the phone.

429
0:27:01,000 --> 0:27:05,000
It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa

430
0:27:05,000 --> 0:27:1,000
was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.

431
0:27:12,000 --> 0:27:14,000
Since then, not that much has changed.

432
0:27:15,000 --> 0:27:19,000
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia

433
0:27:19,000 --> 0:27:21,000
is actually about seven or eight years.

434
0:27:23,000 --> 0:27:28,000
But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.

435
0:27:29,000 --> 0:27:31,000
Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,

436
0:27:31,000 --> 0:27:34,000
I know how important talking is.

437
0:27:35,000 --> 0:27:39,000
Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country.

438
0:27:39,000 --> 0:27:41,000
Nurses getting better training,

439
0:27:41,000 --> 0:27:43,000
pharmacists being able to order supplies,

440
0:27:43,000 --> 0:27:47,000
doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.

441
0:27:48,000 --> 0:27:51,000
It's a very, very good idea to get them wired.

442
0:27:52,000 --> 0:27:56,000
And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.

443
0:27:56,000 --> 0:27:58,000
Thank you very much once again.

444
0:27:58,000 --> 0:28:,000
(Applause)

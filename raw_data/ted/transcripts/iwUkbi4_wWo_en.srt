1
0:00:12.775,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I love making movies.

2
0:00:17.174,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Motion pictures have been in existence for more than a hundred years.

3
0:00:22.37,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Filmmaking hasn't changed for the dimensional mindset.

4
0:00:27.092,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Placing the camera in a scene and pressing "record" hasn't changed.

5
0:00:31.454,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Filmmaking is still a frontal experience,

6
0:00:34.723,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and creating the film has the possibility

7
0:00:37.883,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to follow the same direction of the content creation.

8
0:00:42.086,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We still stand in front of a flat image,

9
0:00:45.191,000 --> 0:00:46,000
watching the fiction.

10
0:00:48.324,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There's nothing wrong with it.

11
0:00:49.785,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I love watching movies and going to the theaters.

12
0:00:52.658,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The experiences can be such emotional experiences.

13
0:00:55.708,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The art and craft of emotional experiences within a frame

14
0:00:59.159,000 --> 0:01:01,000
can be so strong to drive a stronger emotion.

15
0:01:03.178,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The question we're asking is,

16
0:01:05.558,000 --> 0:01:08,000
How the experience of motion pictures can exist beyond the flat screen.

17
0:01:10.544,000 --> 0:01:11,000
How can we start creating content

18
0:01:12.431,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for the next generation of content experiences?

19
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Traditionally, when we imagine a scene,

20
0:01:19.272,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we look at the frame and the composition.

21
0:01:22.056,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We have to think about how we create depth and parallax

22
0:01:25.452,000 --> 0:01:29,000
using foreground, background elements as the camera moves.

23
0:01:30.354,000 --> 0:01:33,000
With the technology today and devices of VR glasses,

24
0:01:33.989,000 --> 0:01:35,000
AR glasses, smart devices,

25
0:01:36.809,000 --> 0:01:39,000
allowing three-dimensional and full navigation in space,

26
0:01:40.724,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we have the possibility to enable audiences

27
0:01:43.244,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to experience content from multiple perspectives.

28
0:01:46.515,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What we have to think about is how we take this technology,

29
0:01:50.329,000 --> 0:01:51,000
all the capabilities,

30
0:01:51.921,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and enable the experience to move farther away inside the scene.

31
0:01:57.325,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now we're not talking about video games or computer-generated actors,

32
0:02:01.143,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which look tremendously realistic.

33
0:02:04.485,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We're talking about real actors and real performance,

34
0:02:07.389,000 --> 0:02:08,000
performing onstage.

35
0:02:10.127,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We have to start thinking how we capture the actors

36
0:02:14.128,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and how we capture the real scene

37
0:02:16.404,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in order to immerse inside.

38
0:02:18.374,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, we're familiar with the 360-degree video,

39
0:02:21.699,000 --> 0:02:23,000
where you place a camera inside the scene

40
0:02:24.239,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and you can create this beautiful panoramic image all around you,

41
0:02:28.017,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but from the same aspect,

42
0:02:29.581,000 --> 0:02:31,000
filmmaking is still frontal.

43
0:02:32.472,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In order to emerge fully inside the scene,

44
0:02:35.283,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we will need to capture the light from all the possible directions.

45
0:02:39.351,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We will have to surround the scene with an enormous amount of sensors,

46
0:02:44.081,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with all possible capabilities to capture the light

47
0:02:47.932,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and enable us to emerge inside afterwards again.

48
0:02:51.908,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now, in this setup,

49
0:02:53.25,000 --> 0:02:55,000
there's no more foreground or background

50
0:02:55.798,000 --> 0:02:56,000
or a camera placed in space

51
0:02:57.514,000 --> 0:03:,000
but hundreds of sensors capturing the light

52
0:03:01.055,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and capturing the motion from all the possible directions.

53
0:03:05.021,000 --> 0:03:07,000
With the new technological advancements,

54
0:03:07.123,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we can start looking at 3D photography,

55
0:03:09.711,000 --> 0:03:11,000
capturing the light from multiple perspectives,

56
0:03:12.582,000 --> 0:03:13,000
enabling us to reconstruct the object.

57
0:03:15.534,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This is like photography in 3D space.

58
0:03:18.457,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now, with these technological advancements,

59
0:03:21.156,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we can record video not just as a flat image

60
0:03:24.577,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but as a volume.

61
0:03:26.093,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This is what we call "volumetric video,"

62
0:03:29.013,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and it has the capability to record every action of the scene

63
0:03:32.632,000 --> 0:03:33,000
as a full three-dimensional volume.

64
0:03:35.138,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, what is a voxel?

65
0:03:38.193,000 --> 0:03:41,000
A voxel is like a three-dimensional pixel,

66
0:03:41.32,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but instead of being a flat image square, staying light and colored,

67
0:03:46.64,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it's like a three-dimensional cube in space,

68
0:03:49.925,000 --> 0:03:51,000
with x, y, and z positions.

69
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This enables us to create a full capture of the scene

70
0:03:56.834,000 --> 0:03:57,000
from any perspective.

71
0:03:58.976,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now this renders a fully light-immersive scene

72
0:04:03.913,000 --> 0:04:05,000
from multiple perspectives.

73
0:04:06.009,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This capability requires an insane amount of information to be processed.

74
0:04:10.953,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We will have to capture the light from an enormous amount of cameras

75
0:04:15.89,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to create this information.

76
0:04:18.573,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Now, in order to do such a thing,

77
0:04:21.776,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we would need a setup that would host a numerous amount of cameras

78
0:04:28.051,000 --> 0:04:29,000
installed in a stage

79
0:04:30.068,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and a stage big enough in order to fit a full cinematic experience.

80
0:04:36.099,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now that sounds like a crazy idea, but that's exactly what we did.

81
0:04:41.583,000 --> 0:04:42,000
For the last three years,

82
0:04:43.035,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we have been building a huge volumetric camera chamber.

83
0:04:48.059,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's 10,000 square feet of a stage,

84
0:04:51.234,000 --> 0:04:54,000
enabling to capture the action from any location.

85
0:04:55.184,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We have deployed hundreds of cameras,

86
0:04:57.29,000 --> 0:04:59,000
sending a tremendous amount of information

87
0:04:59.83,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to a huge data center powered by Intel supercomputers.

88
0:05:04.695,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The ability to have this 10,000 feet

89
0:05:08.083,000 --> 0:05:11,000
enables us to fit any kind of action,

90
0:05:11.469,000 --> 0:05:12,000
any kind of performance.

91
0:05:13.443,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It is the size of an average Broadway stage.

92
0:05:17.397,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We call it Intel Studios,

93
0:05:19.479,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and it's the largest volumetric stage in the world,

94
0:05:22.5,000 --> 0:05:25,000
with the objective of enabling and exploring

95
0:05:26.078,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the next generation of this immersive media filmmaking.

96
0:05:30.498,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, to test these ideas,

97
0:05:33.966,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we were thinking about what we can do as the first scene to try it out.

98
0:05:39.949,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So we chose the Western scene.

99
0:05:42.354,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We brought horses, set designers, dirt,

100
0:05:46.953,000 --> 0:05:49,000
everything needed to create the full scene of a Western.

101
0:05:50.672,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But this time, there was no camera inside.

102
0:05:54.306,000 --> 0:05:57,000
There was nothing really moving besides all the cameras

103
0:05:58.243,000 --> 0:05:59,000
installed outside.

104
0:06:00.423,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The challenge of the actors was tremendous.

105
0:06:03.289,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They have to perform a flawless action visible from all the directions.

106
0:06:09.653,000 --> 0:06:13,000
There's no possibility to hide a punch or not show the action.

107
0:06:14.7,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Everything is captured and everything is seen.

108
0:06:17.703,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The output of the capture --

109
0:06:21.425,000 --> 0:06:22,000
this is our future capture --

110
0:06:22.909,000 --> 0:06:24,000
opened our eyes for the immense capabilities.

111
0:06:25.76,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It was like a full 3D scan of the entire scene.

112
0:06:29.745,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We were able to move around and travel in the space.

113
0:06:33.507,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The thing about this,

114
0:06:34.693,000 --> 0:06:37,000
it's not anymore about perceiving the light emitted from a screen

115
0:06:38.457,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but now traveling inside the light,

116
0:06:41.086,000 --> 0:06:42,000
traveling inside the scene.

117
0:06:42.809,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This obviously opens possibilities for an enormous amount

118
0:06:45.746,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of storytelling and methodologies of creation.

119
0:06:49.799,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is the possibilities of your personal narrative,

120
0:06:53.202,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the possibility of creating your own story inside,

121
0:06:56.054,000 --> 0:06:57,000
or maybe following other stories.

122
0:06:59.47,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Let's take a look at one of the last renders and see.

123
0:07:01.986,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Music)

124
0:07:03.082,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What you're seeing here is full volumetric video,

125
0:07:06.169,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and there's no physical camera in the scene.

126
0:07:08.415,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Music)

127
0:07:10.352,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We have the full control

128
0:07:11.915,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Music, sounds of combat)

129
0:07:13.514,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of space and time.

130
0:07:15.336,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Music, sounds of combat)

131
0:07:26.358,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, again, no physical camera was here.

132
0:07:29.193,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Everything was captured surrounding.

133
0:07:31.891,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now, this is very nice,

134
0:07:34.066,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but what if we wanted to see the scene, maybe, from the eyes of the horse?

135
0:07:38.676,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Well, we can do that as well.

136
0:07:41.066,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Horse galloping)

137
0:07:42.486,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So what you're seeing right now is the same action,

138
0:07:45.779,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but this time, we're watching exactly from the eyes of the horse.

139
0:07:49.224,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The possibilities are, well, unlimited.

140
0:07:53.36,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Applause)

141
0:07:54.385,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Thank you.

142
0:07:55.568,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Applause)

143
0:07:58.999,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So this is all great for creators and storytellers.

144
0:08:03.11,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It really opens a huge canvas

145
0:08:05.146,000 --> 0:08:07,000
for a different type of storytelling and moviemaking.

146
0:08:08.126,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But what about the audience?

147
0:08:09.645,000 --> 0:08:11,000
How can the audience experience this differently?

148
0:08:12.838,000 --> 0:08:13,000
In order to [create] our explorations,

149
0:08:14.75,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we partnered with Paramount Pictures

150
0:08:16.59,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in order to explore immersive media in a Hollywood movie production.

151
0:08:21.109,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Together with the director Randal Kleiser,

152
0:08:23.277,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we reimagined the iconic movie of 1978,

153
0:08:28.109,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Grease."

154
0:08:29.484,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Some of you know it, some of you don't.

155
0:08:31.886,000 --> 0:08:34,000
A 40-year-old movie, amazing experience.

156
0:08:35.454,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And our goal was really to look at how we can take this iconic action and dance

157
0:08:41.914,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and bring it deeper into the experience,

158
0:08:44.613,000 --> 0:08:45,000
bring it deeper into the audience.

159
0:08:46.63,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Imagine that you can not just watch the movie

160
0:08:49.24,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but get inside it and dance with the actors

161
0:08:52.646,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and dance with the performance.

162
0:08:54.305,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now we're breaking, really, the traditional 2D mindset of thinking,

163
0:09:00.032,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and bringing a much richer possibility of moviemaking

164
0:09:03.329,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and content creation.

165
0:09:05.259,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But why watch it on the screen?

166
0:09:08.002,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Let's try to bring these actors here on the stage.

167
0:09:17.165,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So they're not going to really come --

168
0:09:19.088,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I'm going to use an iPad.

169
0:09:20.386,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:21.411,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Sorry.

171
0:09:22.586,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'm going to use an iPad in order to bring in augmented reality.

172
0:09:27.276,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now, obviously, these devices have their own limitations

173
0:09:33.113,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in terms of the data-computing process,

174
0:09:35.142,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so we have to reduce the amount of resolution.

175
0:09:39.016,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So what I'm doing now, I'm placing here a marker,

176
0:09:42.937,000 --> 0:09:46,000
so I'll be able to position exactly where I want everyone to appear.

177
0:09:54.608,000 --> 0:09:55,000
OK.

178
0:09:55.783,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I think we have them here.

179
0:09:57.907,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

180
0:10:04.328,000 --> 0:10:05,000
John Travolta, or --

181
0:10:05.661,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

182
0:10:06.686,000 --> 0:10:07,000
a version of him.

183
0:10:08.776,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Let's take a look.

184
0:10:10.463,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Video) Female: Hey.

185
0:10:11.638,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Male: And that is how it's done.

186
0:10:13.241,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Female: Your turn.

187
0:10:14.471,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Male: Hey, guys! Check this out.

188
0:10:16.055,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Song: "You're the one that I want")

189
0:10:19.366,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Danny: Sandy!

190
0:10:20.844,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Sandy: Tell me about it, stud.

191
0:10:24.031,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Singing) I got chills. They're multiplying

192
0:10:28.554,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And I'm losing control

193
0:10:32.964,000 --> 0:10:36,000
'Cause the power you're supplying

194
0:10:37.252,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's electrifying!

195
0:10:39.261,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Video ends)

196
0:10:40.261,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Applause and cheers)

197
0:10:45.881,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Diego Prilusky: Thank you.

198
0:10:47.238,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause and cheers)

199
0:10:49.509,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So as you can see,

200
0:10:52.039,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we can watch and experience content in the traditional way

201
0:10:55.985,000 --> 0:10:56,000
or in an immersive way.

202
0:10:58.014,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Really, the possibilities are open.

203
0:11:00.705,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We're not trying to change or replace movies.

204
0:11:04.76,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We're enhancing them.

205
0:11:06.372,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The technologies enable new possibilities to start thinking beyond the flat screen.

206
0:11:12.219,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We're in immersive and really exciting times in filmmaking.

207
0:11:16.465,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We're at the threshold of a new era.

208
0:11:18.974,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We're opening the gates for new possibilities

209
0:11:22.146,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of immersive storytelling,

210
0:11:25.122,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and exploration and defining what immersive media filmmaking means.

211
0:11:30.868,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We're really just at the beginning,

212
0:11:33.226,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and we invite you all to join us.

213
0:11:36.15,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Thank you.

214
0:11:37.325,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Applause)

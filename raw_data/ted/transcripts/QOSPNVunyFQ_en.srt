1
0:00:19.45,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Interestingly, Charles Darwin

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
was born a very lightly pigmented man,

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Over the course of his life,

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Darwin had great privilege.

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
He lived in a fairly wealthy home.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And when he was in his 20s

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
he embarked upon a remarkable voyage on the ship the Beagle.

10
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And during the course of that voyage,

11
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
he saw remarkable things:

12
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
tremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.

13
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And the observations that he made

14
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
on that epic journey

15
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
were to be eventually distilled

16
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
into his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species,"

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
published 150 years ago.

18
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now what is so interesting

19
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous

20
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
about "The Origin of Species,"

21
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is that there is only one line in it

22
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
about human evolution.

23
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Light will be thrown on the origin of man

24
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and his history."

25
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It wasn't until much longer,

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
much later,

27
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that Darwin actually spoke

28
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and wrote about humans.

29
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now in his years of

30
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
traveling on the Beagle,

31
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and from listening to the accounts

32
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
or explorers and naturalists,

33
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
he knew that skin color

34
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
was one of the most important ways

35
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in which people varied.

36
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.

37
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He knew that darkly pigmented peoples

38
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
were found close to the equator;

39
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
lightly pigmented peoples, like himself,

40
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
were found closer to the poles.

41
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So what did he make of all this?

42
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.

43
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But much later, in 1871,

44
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
he did have something to say about it.

45
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And it was quite curious. He said,

46
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Of all the differences between the races of men,

47
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the color of the skin is the most conspicuous

48
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and one of the best marked."

49
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And he went on to say,

50
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"These differences do not coincide

51
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with corresponding differences in climate."

52
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So he had traveled all around.

53
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
He had seen people of different colors

54
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
living in different places.

55
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And yet he rejected the idea

56
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that human skin pigmentation

57
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
was related to the climate.

58
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
If only Darwin lived today.

59
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
If only Darwin had NASA.

60
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does

61
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
is it puts up a variety of satellites

62
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.

63
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And for many decades now

64
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
there have been a series of TOMS satellites

65
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.

66
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here,

67
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
show the annual average

68
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.

69
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now the really hot pink and red areas

70
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts

71
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of UV during the year.

72
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The incrementally cooler colors --

73
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
blues, greens, yellows, and finally grays --

74
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.

75
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation

76
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere

77
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is in these cool gray zones.

78
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
This has tremendous implications for our understanding

79
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of the evolution of human skin pigmentation.

80
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And what Darwin could not appreciate,

81
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time,

82
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is that there was a fundamental relationship

83
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation

84
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and skin pigmentation.

85
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And that skin pigmentation itself

86
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
was a product of evolution.

87
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And so when we look at a map of skin color,

88
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and predicted skin color, as we know it today,

89
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
what we see is a beautiful gradient

90
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator,

91
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the lightest ones toward the poles.

92
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
What's very, very important here

93
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is that the earliest humans

94
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
evolved in high-UV environments,

95
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in equatorial Africa.

96
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The earliest members of our lineage,

97
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.

98
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And we all share this incredible heritage

99
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of having originally been

100
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
darkly pigmented,

101
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
two million to one and half million years ago.

102
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now what happened in our history?

103
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Let's first look at the relationship

104
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.

105
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
In those early days of our evolution,

106
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
looking at the equator,

107
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.

108
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The UVC, the most energetic type,

109
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.

110
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But UVB and UVA

111
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
especially, came in unimpeded.

112
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
UVB turns out to be incredibly important.

113
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's very destructive,

114
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin,

115
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need

116
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for our strong bones, the health of our immune system,

117
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and myriad other important functions in our bodies.

118
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So, living at the equator, we got

119
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation

120
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and the melanin --

121
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer

122
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
compound in our skin --

123
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
served as a superb natural sunscreen.

124
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This polymer is amazing

125
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because it's present in so many different organisms.

126
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Melanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth

127
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a billion years,

128
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and has been recruited over and over again

129
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
by evolution, as often happens.

130
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Why change it if it works?

131
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So melanin was recruited, in our lineage,

132
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and specifically in our earliest ancestors

133
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
evolving in Africa,

134
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to be a natural sunscreen.

135
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Where it protected the body

136
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation,

137
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the destruction, or damage to DNA,

138
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate,

139
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which helps to fuel cell production,

140
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and reproduction in the body.

141
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective,

142
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
wonderful covering of melanin.

143
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But then we moved.

144
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And humans dispersed -- not once, but twice.

145
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Major moves, outside of our equatorial homeland,

146
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
from Africa into other parts of the Old World,

147
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and most recently, into the New World.

148
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
When humans dispersed into these latitudes,

149
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
what did they face?

150
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Conditions were significantly colder,

151
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but they were also less intense

152
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
with respect to the ultraviolet regime.

153
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere,

154
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.

155
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We're still getting a dose of UVA.

156
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But all of the UVB,

157
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
or nearly all of it,

158
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.

159
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps,

160
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
you may experience ultraviolet radiation.

161
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But it's all UVA,

162
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and, significantly, that UVA

163
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.

164
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments

165
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
were bereft of the potential

166
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.

167
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This had tremendous consequences

168
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
for the evolution of human skin pigmentation.

169
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Because what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being,

170
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
these lineages of people

171
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere

172
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
lost their pigmentation.

173
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
There was natural selection

174
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.

175
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Here we begin to see the evolution

176
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of the beautiful sepia rainbow

177
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that now characterizes all of humanity.

178
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,

179
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
not just twice, but probably three times.

180
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Not just in modern humans,

181
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors,

182
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
the Neanderthals.

183
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
A remarkable, remarkable testament

184
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to the power of evolution.

185
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Humans have been on the move for a long time.

186
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And just in the last 5,000 years,

187
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in increasing rates, over increasing distances.

188
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people,

189
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
voluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years.

190
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions:

191
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
people from high UV areas

192
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
going to low UV and vice versa.

193
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And not all these moves were voluntary.

194
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Between 1520 and 1867,

195
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
12 million, 500 people

196
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
were moved from high UV

197
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to low UV areas

198
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in the transatlantic slave trade.

199
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.

200
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But it also had deleterious

201
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
health consequences to people.

202
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So what? We've been on the move.

203
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
We're so clever we can overcome all of these

204
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
seeming biological impediments.

205
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Well, often we're unaware

206
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of the fact that we're living

207
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in environments in which our skin

208
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is inherently poorly adapted.

209
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Some of us with lightly pigmented skin

210
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
live in high-UV areas.

211
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Some of us with darkly pigmented skin

212
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
live in low-UV areas.

213
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
These have tremendous consequences for our health.

214
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We have to, if we're lightly pigmented,

215
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
be careful about the problems of skin cancer,

216
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and destruction of folate in our bodies,

217
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
by lots of sun.

218
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Epidemiologists and doctors

219
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
have been very good about telling us

220
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
about protecting our skin.

221
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What they haven't been so good about instructing people

222
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is the problem of darkly pigmented people

223
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
living in high latitude areas,

224
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
or working inside all the time.

225
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Because the problem there is just as severe,

226
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but it is more sinister,

227
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
because vitamin D deficiency,

228
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation,

229
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is a major problem.

230
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people,

231
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones,

232
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to their gradual decay of their immune systems,

233
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
or loss of immune function,

234
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and probably some problems

235
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
with their mood and health,

236
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
their mental health.

237
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So we have, in skin pigmentation,

238
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
one of these wonderful products of evolution

239
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that still has consequences for us today.

240
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And the social consequences,

241
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
as we know, are incredibly profound.

242
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We live in a world where we

243
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
have lightly and darkly pigmented people

244
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
living next to one another,

245
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but often brought into proximity initially

246
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
as a result of very invidious social interactions.

247
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So how can we overcome this?

248
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
How can we begin to understand it?

249
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Evolution helps us.

250
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
200 years after Darwin's birthday,

251
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.

252
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

253
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
How wonderful is that?

254
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Applause)

255
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
This man is significant for a whole host of reasons.

256
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But we need to think about how he compares,

257
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.

258
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
He, as one of many urban admixed populations,

259
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is very emblematic

260
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.

261
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And he resembles, very closely,

262
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
people with moderate levels of pigmentation

263
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia.

264
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
These people have a tremendous potential

265
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to tan, to develop more pigment in their skin,

266
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
as a result of exposure to sun.

267
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency,

268
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
if they have desk jobs, like that guy.

269
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So lets all wish for his great health,

270
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.

271
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Now what is wonderful

272
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
about the evolution of human skin pigmentation,

273
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and the phenomenon of pigmentation,

274
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is that it is the demonstration,

275
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the evidence, of evolution

276
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
by natural selection,

277
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
right on your body.

278
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
When people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"

279
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
You don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.

280
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
You just have to look at your skin.

281
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Darwin, I think, would have appreciated this,

282
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
even though he eschewed the importance

283
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.

284
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I think, were he able to look

285
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
at the evidence we have today, he would understand it.

286
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
He would appreciate it.

287
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And most of all, he would teach it.

288
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
You, you can teach it.

289
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
You can touch it.

290
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
You can understand it.

291
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Take it out of this room.

292
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Take your skin color,

293
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and celebrate it.

294
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Spread the word.

295
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You have the evolution

296
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
of the history of our species,

297
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
part of it, written in your skin.

298
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.

299
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Go out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?

300
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
You are the products of evolution.

301
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Thank you.

302
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Applause)

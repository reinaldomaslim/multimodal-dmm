1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to talk to you

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about power in this 21st century.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And basically, what I'd like to tell you

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is that power is changing,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and there are two types of changes

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I want to discuss.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
One is power transition,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
which is change of power amongst states.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And there the simple version of the message

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is it's moving from West to East.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The other is power diffusion,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the way power is moving

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
from all states West or East

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to non-state actors.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Those two things

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
are the huge shifts of power

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in our century.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I want to tell you about them each separately

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and then how they interact

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and why, in the end, there may be some good news.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
When we talk about power transition,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we often talk about the rise of Asia.

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It really should be called

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the recovery or return of Asia.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If we looked at the world

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in 1800,

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you'd find that more than half of the world's people

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
lived in Asia

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and they made more than half the world's product.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now fast forward to 1900:

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia,

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but they're now making

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
only a fifth of the world's product.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
What happened? The Industrial Revolution,

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which meant that all of a sudden,

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Europe and America

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
became the dominant center of the world.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
What we're going to see in the 21st century

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is Asia gradually returning

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to being more than half of the world's population

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and more than half of the world's product.

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That's important and it's an important shift.

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But let me tell you a little bit about

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the other shift that I'm talking about,

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which is power diffusion.

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
To understand power diffusion

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
put this in your mind:

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
computing and communications costs

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
have fallen a thousandfold

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
between 1970

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the beginning of this century.

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now that's a big abstract number.

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But to make it more real,

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
if the price of an automobile

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
had fallen as rapidly

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as the price of computing power,

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you could buy a car today

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
for five dollars.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now when the price of any technology

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
declines that dramatically,

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the barriers to entry go down.

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Anybody can play in the game.

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So in 1970,

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
if you wanted to communicate

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
from Oxford to Johannesburg

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to New Delhi

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
to Brasilia

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and anywhere simultaneously,

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you could do it.

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The technology was there.

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But to be able to do it,

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
you had to be very rich --

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
a government, a multinational corporation,

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
maybe the Catholic Church --

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but you had to be pretty wealthy.

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Now, anybody has that capacity,

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which previously was restricted by price

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
just to a few actors.

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe --

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour --

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and if you have Skype, it's free.

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So capabilities

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that were once restricted

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
are now available to everyone.

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And what that means

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is not that the age of the State is over.

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The State still matters.

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But the stage is crowded.

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors.

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Some of that's good:

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Oxfam,

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a great non-governmental actor.

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Some of it's bad:

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But think of what it does

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to how we think in traditional terms and concepts.

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We think in terms of war

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and interstate war.

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And you can think back to 1941

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when the government of Japan

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's worth noticing

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that a non-state actor

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
attacking the United States in 2001

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
killed more Americans

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
than the government of Japan did in 1941.

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You might think of that

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
as the privatization of war.

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So we're seeing a great change

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in terms of diffusion of power.

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now the problem is

112
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So let me step back

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and ask: what's power?

115
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Power is simple the ability

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
to affect others

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to get the outcomes you want,

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and you can do it in three ways.

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You can do it with threats

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of coercion, "sticks,"

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
you can do it with payments,

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"carrots,"

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
or you can do it by getting others

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to want what you want.

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And that ability to get others to want what you want,

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to get the outcomes you want

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
without coercion or payment,

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is what I call soft power.

129
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And that soft power has been much neglected

130
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and much misunderstood,

131
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and yet it's tremendously important.

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Indeed, if you can learn

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to use more soft power,

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you can save a lot

135
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
on carrots and sticks.

136
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Traditionally, the way people thought about power

137
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
was primarily in terms of military power.

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
For example, the great Oxford historian

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
defined a great power

141
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
as a country able to prevail in war.

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But we need a new narrative

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
if we're to understand power in the 21st century.

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's not just prevailing at war,

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
though war still persists.

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's not whose army wins;

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it's also whose story wins.

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And we have to think much more in terms of narratives

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and whose narrative is going to be effective.

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now let me go back

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to the question

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of power transition

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
between states

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and what's happening there.

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the narratives that we use now

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
tend to be the rise and fall

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of the great powers.

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And the current narrative is all about

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the rise of China

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and the decline of the United States.

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
many people said this was

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the beginning of the end of American power.

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The tectonic plates

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
of world politics were shifting.

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And president Medvedev of Russia, for example,

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
pronounced in 2008

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
this was the beginning of the end

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of United States power.

170
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But in fact,

171
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
this metaphor of decline

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is often very misleading.

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
If you look at history, in recent history,

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you'll see the cycles of belief

175
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in American decline

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
come and go every 10 or 15 years or so.

177
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
In 1958,

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
after the Soviets put up Sputnik,

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it was "That's the end of America."

180
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In 1973, with the oil embargo

181
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and the closing of the gold window,

182
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that was the end of America.

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In the 1980s,

184
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
as America went through a transition in the Reagan period,

185
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
between the rust belt economy of the midwest

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to the Silicon Valley economy of California,

187
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that was the end of America.

188
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But in fact, what we've seen

189
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is none of those were true.

190
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Indeed, people were over-enthusiastic

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in the early 2000s,

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
thinking America could do anything,

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which led us into some disastrous

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
foreign policy adventures,

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and now we're back to decline again.

196
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The moral of this story

197
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline

198
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
tell us a lot more about psychology

199
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
than they do about reality.

200
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
If we try to focus on the reality,

201
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
then what we need to focus on

202
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is what's really happening

203
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in terms of China and the United States.

204
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Goldman Sachs has projected

205
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that China, the Chinese economy,

206
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
will surpass that of the U.S.

207
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
by 2027.

208
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So we've got, what,

209
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
17 more years to go or so

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
before China's bigger.

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now someday,

212
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
with a billion point three people getting richer,

213
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
they are going to be bigger than the United States.

214
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But be very careful about these projections

215
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
such as the Goldman Sachs projection

216
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
as though that gives you an accurate picture

217
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of power transition in this century.

218
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
First of all, it's a linear projection.

220
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You know, everything says,

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
here it goes -- straight line.

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
History is not linear.

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.

225
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The second thing is

226
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that the Chinese economy

227
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,

228
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
which it may it,

229
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that will be a measure of total economic size,

230
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but not of per capita income --

231
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
won't tell you about the composition of the economy.

232
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
China still has large areas

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
of underdevelopment

234
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and per capita income is a better measure

235
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of the sophistication of the economy.

236
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans

237
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
until somewhere in the latter part,

238
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
after 2050, of this century.

239
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The other point that's worth noticing

240
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is how one-dimensional

241
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
this projection is.

242
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You know, it looks at economic power

243
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
measured by GDP.

244
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Doesn't tell you much about military power,

245
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
doesn't tell you very much about soft power.

246
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's all very one-dimensional.

247
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And also, when we think about the rise of Asia,

248
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or return of Asia

249
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
as I called it a little bit earlier,

250
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.

251
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
If you're sitting in Japan,

252
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or in New Delhi,

253
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or in Hanoi,

254
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
your view of the rise of China

255
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Indeed, one of the advantages

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that the Americans will have

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in terms of power in Asia

259
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
is all those countries

260
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
want an American insurance policy

261
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
against the rise of China.

262
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's as though Mexico and Canada

263
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
were hostile neighbors to the United States,

264
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
which they're not.

265
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So these simple projections

266
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of the Goldman Sachs type

267
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are not telling us what we need to know

268
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
about power transition.

269
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
But you might ask, well so what in any case?

270
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Why does it matter? Who cares?

271
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Is this just a game

272
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that diplomats and academics play?

273
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The answer is it matters quite a lot.

274
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Because, if you believe in decline

275
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and you get the answers wrong on this,

276
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the facts, not the myths,

277
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
you may have policies which are very dangerous.

278
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Let me give you an example from history.

279
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
The Peloponnesian War

280
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
was the great conflict

281
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in which the Greek city state system

282
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
tore itself apart

283
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
two and a half millennia ago.

284
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
What caused it?

285
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,

286
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
said it was the rise in the power of Athens

287
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and the fear it created in Sparta.

288
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Notice both halves of that explanation.

289
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Many people argue

290
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that the 21st century

291
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is going to repeat the 20th century,

292
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in which World War One,

293
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the great conflagration

294
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in which the European state system

295
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
tore itself apart

296
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and destroyed its centrality in the world,

297
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that that was caused by

298
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the rise in the power of Germany

299
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and the fear it created in Britain.

300
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So there are people who are telling us

301
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
this is going to be reproduced today,

302
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that what we're going to see

303
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is the same thing now in this century.

304
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
No, I think that's wrong.

305
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's bad history.

306
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain

307
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in industrial strength by 1900.

308
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And as I said earlier,

309
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
China has not passed the United States.

310
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But also, if you have this belief

311
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and it creates a sense of fear,

312
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
it leads to overreaction.

313
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And the greatest danger we have

314
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
of managing this power transition

315
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of the shift toward the East is fear.

316
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt

317
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
from a different context,

318
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We don't have to fear the rise of China

320
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
or the return of Asia.

321
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And if we have policies

322
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in which we take it

323
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
in that larger historical perspective,

324
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
we're going to be able

325
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to manage this process.

326
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Let me say a word now

327
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
about the distribution of power

328
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and how it relates to power diffusion

329
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and then pull these two types together.

330
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
If you ask how is power distributed in the world today,

331
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
it's distributed much like

332
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
a three-dimensional chess game.

333
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Top board:

334
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
military power among states.

335
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The United States is the only superpower,

336
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and it's likely to remain that way

337
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
for two or three decades.

338
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.

339
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game:

340
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
economic power among states.

341
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Power is multi-polar.

342
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
There are balancers --

343
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the U.S., Europe,

344
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
China, Japan

345
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
can balance each other.

346
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The bottom board of this three-dimensional,

347
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
the board of transnational relations,

348
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
things that cross borders outside the control of governments,

349
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
things like climate change, drug trade,

350
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
financial flows,

351
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
pandemics,

352
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
all these things that cross borders

353
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
outside the control of governments,

354
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
there nobody's in charge.

355
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It makes no sense to call this unipolar

356
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
or multi-polar.

357
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Power is chaotically distributed.

358
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And the only way you can solve these problems --

359
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and this is where many greatest challenges

360
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
are coming in this century --

361
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
is through cooperation,

362
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
through working together,

363
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
which means that soft power becomes more important,

364
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that ability to organize networks

365
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to deal with these kinds of problems

366
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and to be able to get cooperation.

367
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Another way of putting it

368
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is that as we think of power in the 21st century,

369
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
we want to get away from the idea

370
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that power's always zero sum --

371
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
my gain is your loss and vice versa.

372
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Power can also be positive sum,

373
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
where your gain can be my gain.

374
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
If China develops greater energy security

375
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and greater capacity

376
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to deal with its problems of carbon emissions,

377
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that's good for us

378
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
as well as good for China

379
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
as well as good for everybody else.

380
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So empowering China

381
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to deal with its own problems of carbon

382
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is good for everybody,

383
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.

384
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It's one in which we can all gain.

385
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
So as we think about power

386
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
in this century,

387
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
we want to get away from this view

388
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that it's all I win, you lose.

389
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.

390
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Wars persist. Power persists.

391
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Military power is important.

392
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Keeping balances is important.

393
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
All this still persists.

394
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Hard power is there,

395
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and it will remain.

396
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
But unless you learn how to mix

397
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
hard power with soft power

398
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
into strategies that I call smart power,

399
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems

400
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
that we're facing.

401
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this

402
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is how do we work together

403
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to produce global public goods,

404
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
things from which all of us can benefit?

405
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
How do we define our national interests

406
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
so that it's not just zero sum,

407
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
but positive sum.

408
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
In that sense, if we define our interests,

409
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
for example, for the United States

410
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,

411
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
keeping an open trading system,

412
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas --

413
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
those were good for Britain,

414
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
they were good for others as well.

415
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.

416
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
How do we produce global public goods,

417
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
which are good for us,

418
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
but good for everyone at the same time?

419
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And that's going to be the good news dimension

420
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
of what we need to think about

421
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
as we think of power in the 21st century.

422
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
There are ways to define our interests

423
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,

424
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
we can organize with others in networks

425
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
to produce, not only public goods,

426
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
but ways that will enhance our soft power.

427
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
So if one looks at the statements

428
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that have been made about this,

429
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton

430
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
described the foreign policy

431
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
of the Obama administration,

432
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration

433
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
was going to be smart power,

434
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
as she put it, "using all the tools

435
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
in our foreign policy tool box."

436
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And if we're going to deal

437
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
with these two great power shifts that I've described,

438
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
the power shift represented by transition among states,

439
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the power shift represented

440
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
by diffusion of power away from all states,

441
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power

442
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
in which we combine hard and soft power

443
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
into strategies of smart power.

444
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And that's the good news I have. We can do that.

445
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Thank you very much.

446
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.844,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Growing up in Kenya,

2
0:00:14.71,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I knew I always wanted to study biochemistry.

3
0:00:18.908,000 --> 0:00:23,000
See, I had seen the impact of the high prevalence of diseases like malaria,

4
0:00:24.463,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I wanted to make medicines that would cure the sick.

5
0:00:27.585,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So I worked really hard,

6
0:00:28.994,000 --> 0:00:31,000
got a scholarship to the United States, where I became a cancer researcher,

7
0:00:32.805,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I loved it.

8
0:00:34.432,000 --> 0:00:36,000
For someone who wants to cure diseases,

9
0:00:36.543,000 --> 0:00:37,000
there is no higher calling.

10
0:00:39.141,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Ten years later, I returned to Kenya to do just that.

11
0:00:43.021,000 --> 0:00:44,000
A freshly minted PhD,

12
0:00:45.006,000 --> 0:00:47,000
ready to take on this horrific illness,

13
0:00:47.231,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which in Kenya was almost certainly a death sentence.

14
0:00:51.421,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But instead of landing a job in a pharmaceutical company

15
0:00:54.396,000 --> 0:00:55,000
or a hospital,

16
0:00:56.309,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I found myself drawn to a different kind of lab,

17
0:00:59.186,000 --> 0:01:01,000
working with a different kind of patient --

18
0:01:01.586,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a patient whose illness was so serious

19
0:01:03.964,000 --> 0:01:05,000
it impacted every single person in my country;

20
0:01:07.438,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a patient who needed to get healthy fast.

21
0:01:10.148,000 --> 0:01:12,000
That patient was my government.

22
0:01:13.946,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:15.922,000 --> 0:01:18,000
See, many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today.

24
0:01:20.696,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:22.803,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Applause)

26
0:01:28.634,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And Kenya was no exception.

27
0:01:30.795,000 --> 0:01:32,000
When I returned to Kenya in 2014,

28
0:01:33.322,000 --> 0:01:35,000
there was 17 percent youth unemployment.

29
0:01:36.605,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And Nairobi, the major business hub,

30
0:01:38.977,000 --> 0:01:42,000
was rated 177th on the quality of living index.

31
0:01:43.076,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It was bad.

32
0:01:46.09,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up.

33
0:01:51.007,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So when government --

34
0:01:52.181,000 --> 0:01:53,000
one of its most vital entities --

35
0:01:53.95,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is weak or unhealthy,

36
0:01:55.412,000 --> 0:01:56,000
everyone and everything suffers.

37
0:01:58.342,000 --> 0:02:,000
Sometimes you might put a Band-Aid in place

38
0:02:01.139,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to try and temporarily stop the pain.

39
0:02:04.552,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Maybe some of you here have participated

40
0:02:06.558,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in a Band-Aid operation to an African country --

41
0:02:09.561,000 --> 0:02:13,000
setting up alternative schools, building hospitals, digging wells --

42
0:02:14.067,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because governments there either weren't or couldn't provide

43
0:02:17.028,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the services to their citizens.

44
0:02:19.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We all know this is a temporary solution.

45
0:02:23.275,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There are just some things Band-Aids can't fix,

46
0:02:26.847,000 --> 0:02:3,000
like providing an environment where businesses feel secure

47
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that they'll have an equal opportunity

48
0:02:33.095,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to be able to run and start their businesses successfully.

49
0:02:36.361,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Or there are systems in place

50
0:02:38.199,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that would protect the private property that they create.

51
0:02:41.264,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I would argue,

52
0:02:42.445,000 --> 0:02:45,000
only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions

53
0:02:45.913,000 --> 0:02:46,000
for economies to thrive.

54
0:02:48.369,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Economies thrive when business are able to quickly and easily set up shop.

55
0:02:53.231,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Business owners create new sources of income for themselves,

56
0:02:56.627,000 --> 0:02:58,000
new jobs get added into the economy

57
0:02:59.102,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and then more taxes are paid to fund public projects.

58
0:03:03.324,000 --> 0:03:05,000
New business is good for everyone.

59
0:03:06.235,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And it's such an important measure of economic growth,

60
0:03:09.089,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the World Bank has a ranking called the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking,"

61
0:03:13.064,000 --> 0:03:16,000
which measures how easy or difficult it is to start a business

62
0:03:16.125,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in any given country.

63
0:03:17.746,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And as you can imagine,

64
0:03:20.224,000 --> 0:03:23,000
starting or running a business in a country with an ailing government --

65
0:03:23.869,000 --> 0:03:24,000
almost impossible.

66
0:03:26.252,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The President of Kenya knew this, which is why in 2014,

67
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
he came to our lab and asked us to partner with him

68
0:03:33.393,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to be able to help Kenya to jump-start business growth.

69
0:03:37.509,000 --> 0:03:38,000
He set an ambitious goal:

70
0:03:39.598,000 --> 0:03:43,000
he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50 in this World Bank ranking.

71
0:03:44.987,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In 2014 when he came,

72
0:03:47.088,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.

73
0:03:51.891,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We had our work cut out for us.

74
0:03:55.412,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Fortunately, he came to the right place.

75
0:03:58.137,000 --> 0:04:,000
We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.

76
0:04:00.488,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We're a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers

77
0:04:04.278,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and a cancer researcher,

78
0:04:06.239,000 --> 0:04:08,000
who understood that in order to cure the sickness

79
0:04:08.709,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of a system as big as government,

80
0:04:10.807,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we needed to examine the whole body,

81
0:04:13.231,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs,

82
0:04:16.342,000 --> 0:04:17,000
into the tissues,

83
0:04:17.699,000 --> 0:04:18,000
all the way to single cells,

84
0:04:19.225,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so that we could properly make a diagnosis.

85
0:04:22.582,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So with our marching orders from the President himself,

86
0:04:25.437,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we embarked on the purest of the scientific method:

87
0:04:28.574,000 --> 0:04:29,000
collecting data --

88
0:04:29.773,000 --> 0:04:31,000
all the data we could get our hands on --

89
0:04:31.884,000 --> 0:04:32,000
making hypotheses,

90
0:04:33.165,000 --> 0:04:34,000
creating solutions,

91
0:04:34.426,000 --> 0:04:35,000
one after the other.

92
0:04:36.665,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So we met with hundreds of individuals who worked at government agencies,

93
0:04:40.724,000 --> 0:04:43,000
from the tax agency, the lands office, utilities company,

94
0:04:44.684,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the agency that's responsible for registering companies,

95
0:04:48.176,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and with each of them, we observed them as they served customers,

96
0:04:51.799,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we documented their processes -- most of them were manual.

97
0:04:57.293,000 --> 0:05:,000
We also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork

98
0:05:00.773,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to try and really understand;

99
0:05:02.965,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to try and diagnose what bodily malfunctions had occurred

100
0:05:06.339,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that lead to that 136th spot on the World Bank list.

101
0:05:10.068,000 --> 0:05:11,000
What did we find?

102
0:05:11.794,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days

103
0:05:15.889,000 --> 0:05:17,000
for a business owner to register their property,

104
0:05:18.857,000 --> 0:05:2,000
compared to just one day in New Zealand,

105
0:05:21.278,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which was ranked second on the World Bank list.

106
0:05:24.647,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It took 158 days to get a new electric connection.

107
0:05:29.699,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In Korea it took 18 days.

108
0:05:32.804,000 --> 0:05:34,000
If you wanted to get a construction permit

109
0:05:34.881,000 --> 0:05:35,000
so you could put up a building,

110
0:05:36.425,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in Kenya, it was going to take you 125 days.

111
0:05:40.02,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In Singapore, which is ranked first, that would only take you 26 days.

112
0:05:45.4,000 --> 0:05:47,000
God forbid you had to go to court

113
0:05:47.468,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract,

114
0:05:51.379,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because that process alone would take you 465 days.

115
0:05:56.885,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And if that wasn't bad enough,

116
0:06:00.495,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you would lose 40 percent of your claim in just fees --

117
0:06:04.671,000 --> 0:06:06,000
legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.

118
0:06:08.928,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now, I know what you're thinking:

119
0:06:12.546,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for there to exist such inefficiencies in an African country,

120
0:06:16.237,000 --> 0:06:17,000
there must be corruption.

121
0:06:18.311,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The very cells that run the show must be corrupt to the bone.

122
0:06:22.792,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I thought so, too, actually.

123
0:06:24.804,000 --> 0:06:25,000
When we started out,

124
0:06:25.981,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I thought I was going to find so much corruption,

125
0:06:29.493,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I was literally going to either die or get killed in the process.

126
0:06:33.013,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:36.766,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But when we dug deeper,

128
0:06:38.745,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we didn't find corruption in the classic sense:

129
0:06:41.926,000 --> 0:06:44,000
slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,

130
0:06:44.958,000 --> 0:06:46,000
waiting to grease the palms of their friends.

131
0:06:47.959,000 --> 0:06:5,000
What we found was an overwhelming sense of helplessness.

132
0:06:53.504,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Our government was sick,

133
0:06:54.79,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because government employees felt helpless.

134
0:06:58.813,000 --> 0:07:01,000
They felt that they were not empowered to drive change.

135
0:07:02.42,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And when people feel stuck and helpless,

136
0:07:06.788,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they stop seeing their role in a bigger system.

137
0:07:10.085,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They start to think the work they do doesn't matter in driving change.

138
0:07:14.578,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And when that happens,

139
0:07:16.408,000 --> 0:07:17,000
things slow down,

140
0:07:18.025,000 --> 0:07:19,000
fall through the cracks

141
0:07:19.469,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and inefficiencies flourish.

142
0:07:22.991,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now imagine with me,

143
0:07:24.78,000 --> 0:07:27,000
if you had a process you had to go through --

144
0:07:28.742,000 --> 0:07:29,000
had no other alternative --

145
0:07:30.536,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and this process was inefficient, complex

146
0:07:34.281,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and very, very slow.

147
0:07:35.695,000 --> 0:07:36,000
What would you do?

148
0:07:38.302,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I think you might start by trying to find somebody to outsource it to,

149
0:07:41.654,000 --> 0:07:43,000
so that they can just take care of that for you.

150
0:07:44.62,000 --> 0:07:45,000
If that doesn't work,

151
0:07:47.127,000 --> 0:07:49,000
maybe you'd consider paying somebody

152
0:07:49.161,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to just "unofficially" take care of it on your behalf --

153
0:07:52.565,000 --> 0:07:54,000
especially if you thought nobody was going to catch you.

154
0:07:56.61,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Not out of malice or greed,

155
0:07:59.004,000 --> 0:08:02,000
just trying to make sure that you get something to work for you

156
0:08:02.119,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so you can move on.

157
0:08:03.738,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Unfortunately, that is the beginning of corruption.

158
0:08:07.259,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And if left to thrive and grow,

159
0:08:09.606,000 --> 0:08:1,000
it seeps into the whole system,

160
0:08:11.196,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and before you know it,

161
0:08:12.59,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the whole body is sick.

162
0:08:16.416,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Knowing this,

163
0:08:17.733,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we had to start by making sure

164
0:08:19.312,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that every single stakeholder we worked with had a shared vision

165
0:08:23.913,000 --> 0:08:24,000
for what we wanted to do.

166
0:08:26.012,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So we met with everyone,

167
0:08:28.476,000 --> 0:08:3,000
from the clerk whose sole job is to remove staples

168
0:08:31.059,000 --> 0:08:32,000
from application packets,

169
0:08:33.266,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to the legal drafters at the attorney general's office,

170
0:08:37.007,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to the clerks who are responsible for serving business owners

171
0:08:40.028,000 --> 0:08:42,000
when they came to access government services.

172
0:08:43.377,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And with them,

173
0:08:44.551,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we made sure that they understood

174
0:08:46.147,000 --> 0:08:5,000
how their day-to-day actions were impacting our ability as a country

175
0:08:50.918,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to create new jobs and to attract investments.

176
0:08:54.425,000 --> 0:08:57,000
No one's role was too small; everyone's role was vital.

177
0:08:59.907,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now, guess what we started to see?

178
0:09:02.814,000 --> 0:09:04,000
A coalition of government employees

179
0:09:04.851,000 --> 0:09:06,000
who are excited and ready to drive change,

180
0:09:06.987,000 --> 0:09:08,000
began to grow and form.

181
0:09:09.747,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And together we started to implement changes

182
0:09:12.375,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that impacted the service delivery of our country.

183
0:09:16.405,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The result?

184
0:09:17.853,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In just two years,

185
0:09:19.918,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.

186
0:09:24.844,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

187
0:09:32.34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And in recognition of the significant reforms we've been able to implement

188
0:09:36.753,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in such a short time,

189
0:09:38.556,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Kenya was recognized

190
0:09:40.461,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to be among the top three global reformers in the world

191
0:09:44.071,000 --> 0:09:45,000
two years in a row.

192
0:09:46.518,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Applause)

193
0:09:52.984,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Are we fully healthy?

194
0:09:55.376,000 --> 0:09:56,000
No.

195
0:09:56.969,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We have some serious work still to do.

196
0:10:00.156,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I like to think about these two years like a weight-loss program.

197
0:10:03.995,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:06.341,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's that time after months of hard, grueling work at the gym,

199
0:10:10.327,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and then you get your first time to weigh yourself,

200
0:10:12.781,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and you've lost 20 pounds.

201
0:10:14.827,000 --> 0:10:15,000
You're feeling unstoppable.

202
0:10:18.517,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now, some of you may think this doesn't apply to you.

203
0:10:22.878,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You're not from Kenya.

204
0:10:24.252,000 --> 0:10:26,000
You don't intend to be an entrepreneur.

205
0:10:26.418,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But think with me for just a moment.

206
0:10:29.134,000 --> 0:10:32,000
When is the last time you accessed a government service?

207
0:10:33.8,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Maybe applied for your driver's license,

208
0:10:36.6,000 --> 0:10:39,000
tried to do your taxes on your own.

209
0:10:42.464,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's easy in this political and global economy

210
0:10:45.258,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to want to give up when we think about transforming government.

211
0:10:49.206,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking

212
0:10:52.731,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that government is too inefficient,

213
0:10:55.097,000 --> 0:10:56,000
too corrupt,

214
0:10:56.277,000 --> 0:10:57,000
unfixable.

215
0:10:58.347,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We might even rarely get some key government responsibilities

216
0:11:01.808,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to other sectors,

217
0:11:03.032,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to Band-Aid solutions,

218
0:11:04.225,000 --> 0:11:06,000
or to just give up and feel helpless.

219
0:11:07.849,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But just because a system is sick doesn't mean it's dying.

220
0:11:12.509,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We cannot afford to give up

221
0:11:15.34,000 --> 0:11:18,000
when it comes to the challenges of fixing our governments.

222
0:11:19.809,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In the end,

223
0:11:22.502,000 --> 0:11:26,000
what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells --

224
0:11:26.701,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that's you and I --

225
0:11:29.654,000 --> 0:11:3,000
get to the ground,

226
0:11:31.325,000 --> 0:11:32,000
roll up our sleeves,

227
0:11:32.633,000 --> 0:11:34,000
refuse to be helpless

228
0:11:34.762,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and believe that sometimes,

229
0:11:36.582,000 --> 0:11:39,000
all it takes is for us to create some space

230
0:11:39.836,000 --> 0:11:41,000
for healthy cells to grow and thrive.

231
0:11:42.601,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Thank you.

232
0:11:43.782,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

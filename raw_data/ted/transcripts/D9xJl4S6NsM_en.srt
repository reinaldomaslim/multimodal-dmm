2
0:00:15.89,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So raise your hand if you know someone

3
0:00:19.118,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in your immediate family or circle of friends

4
0:00:21.765,000 --> 0:00:24,000
who suffers from some form of mental illness.

5
0:00:25.253,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised.

6
0:00:28.037,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And raise your hand if you think that

7
0:00:30.332,000 --> 0:00:32,000
basic research on fruit flies has anything to do

8
0:00:33.157,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with understanding mental illness in humans.

9
0:00:37.619,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.

10
0:00:40.412,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I can see I've got my work cut out for me here.

11
0:00:43.732,000 --> 0:00:45,000
As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,

12
0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:5,000
psychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia

13
0:00:50.533,000 --> 0:00:52,000
take a terrible toll on human suffering.

14
0:00:53.408,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We know much less about their treatment

15
0:00:56.621,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and the understanding of their basic mechanisms

16
0:00:59.227,000 --> 0:01:01,000
than we do about diseases of the body.

17
0:01:01.846,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Think about it: In 2013,

18
0:01:04.489,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the second decade of the millennium,

19
0:01:06.444,000 --> 0:01:08,000
if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis

20
0:01:08.809,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,

21
0:01:11.328,000 --> 0:01:13,000
biopsies and blood tests.

22
0:01:14.256,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,

23
0:01:18.121,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you go to your doctor, and what do you get?

24
0:01:20.084,000 --> 0:01:21,000
A questionnaire.

25
0:01:22.071,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now, part of the reason for this is that we have

26
0:01:24.5,000 --> 0:01:27,000
an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view

27
0:01:28.323,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.

28
0:01:32.21,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We tend to view them --

29
0:01:33.453,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the popular press aids and abets this view --

30
0:01:36.298,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as chemical imbalances in the brain,

31
0:01:39.314,000 --> 0:01:42,000
as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup

32
0:01:42.998,000 --> 0:01:46,000
full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.

33
0:01:47.198,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This view is conditioned by the fact

34
0:01:49.525,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,

35
0:01:52.931,000 --> 0:01:56,000
like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,

36
0:01:57.602,000 --> 0:02:,000
as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.

37
0:02:01.578,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But that can't be the answer,

38
0:02:03.479,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because these drugs actually don't work all that well.

39
0:02:06.716,000 --> 0:02:09,000
A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them,

40
0:02:09.892,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because of their unpleasant side effects.

41
0:02:12.549,000 --> 0:02:14,000
These drugs have so many side effects

42
0:02:14.609,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder

43
0:02:18.565,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is a bit like trying to change your engine oil

44
0:02:21.254,000 --> 0:02:25,000
by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.

45
0:02:25.367,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Some of it will dribble into the right place,

46
0:02:27.517,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but a lot of it will do more harm than good.

47
0:02:30.618,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, an emerging view

48
0:02:32.856,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,

49
0:02:35.806,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is that psychiatric disorders are actually

50
0:02:38.376,000 --> 0:02:41,000
disturbances of neural circuits that mediate

51
0:02:41.85,000 --> 0:02:44,000
emotion, mood and affect.

52
0:02:45.369,000 --> 0:02:46,000
When we think about cognition,

53
0:02:47.131,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.

54
0:02:50.707,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Well it turns out that the computer analogy

55
0:02:53.288,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is just as valid for emotion.

56
0:02:55.671,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.

57
0:02:58.457,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But we know much less about the circuit basis

58
0:03:01.74,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of psychiatric disorders

59
0:03:03.639,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because of the overwhelming dominance

60
0:03:05.709,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of this chemical imbalance hypothesis.

61
0:03:09.061,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, it's not that chemicals are not important

62
0:03:12.888,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in psychiatric disorders.

63
0:03:14.425,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.

64
0:03:18.397,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Rather, they're released in very specific locations

65
0:03:22.046,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and they act on specific synapses

66
0:03:24.771,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to change the flow of information in the brain.

67
0:03:28.459,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So if we ever really want to understand

68
0:03:30.896,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the biological basis of psychiatric disorders,

69
0:03:33.601,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain

70
0:03:36.633,000 --> 0:03:37,000
where these chemicals act.

71
0:03:38.367,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Otherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines

72
0:03:41.846,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and suffering the consequences.

73
0:03:44.803,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now to begin to overcome our ignorance

74
0:03:47.862,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,

75
0:03:51.396,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it's helpful to work on what we biologists call

76
0:03:54.076,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"model organisms,"

77
0:03:55.655,000 --> 0:03:58,000
animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,

78
0:03:58.989,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques

79
0:04:02.414,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to molecularly identify and pinpoint

80
0:04:06.039,000 --> 0:04:07,000
specific classes of neurons,

81
0:04:07.602,000 --> 0:04:09,000
as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.

82
0:04:10.505,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Moreover, once we can do that,

83
0:04:12.966,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we can actually activate specific neurons

84
0:04:15.715,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.

85
0:04:19.926,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,

86
0:04:22.64,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and we find that a behavior is blocked,

87
0:04:25.105,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we can conclude that those neurons

88
0:04:27.319,000 --> 0:04:29,000
are necessary for that behavior.

89
0:04:30.283,000 --> 0:04:32,000
On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons

90
0:04:32.665,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we find that that produces the behavior,

91
0:04:35.479,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.

92
0:04:39.553,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So in this way, by doing this kind of test,

93
0:04:42.562,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we can draw cause and effect relationships

94
0:04:46.085,000 --> 0:04:48,000
between the activity of specific neurons

95
0:04:48.441,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in particular circuits and particular behaviors,

96
0:04:51.354,000 --> 0:04:53,000
something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,

97
0:04:53.791,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to do right now in humans.

98
0:04:58.842,000 --> 0:05:,000
But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is --

99
0:05:01.679,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it's a great model organism

100
0:05:03.879,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because it's got a small brain,

101
0:05:06.417,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,

102
0:05:10.204,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it breeds quickly, and it's cheap.

103
0:05:13.354,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But can an organism like this

104
0:05:15.149,000 --> 0:05:18,000
teach us anything about emotion-like states?

105
0:05:18.992,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Do these organisms even have emotion-like states,

106
0:05:22.292,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or are they just little digital robots?

107
0:05:25.655,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion

108
0:05:28.855,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and express them in their behaviors, as he wrote

109
0:05:31.405,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.

110
0:05:36.598,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.

111
0:05:40.117,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila

112
0:05:43.531,000 --> 0:05:46,000
here at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism

113
0:05:47.054,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to study the connection between genes and behavior.

114
0:05:50.651,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.

115
0:05:54.258,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,

116
0:05:58.692,000 --> 0:06:,000
and Seymour taught me both to love flies

117
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and also to play with science.

118
0:06:04.129,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So how do we ask this question?

119
0:06:07.245,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,

120
0:06:11.305,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?

121
0:06:14.468,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,

122
0:06:18.418,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.

123
0:06:22.323,000 --> 0:06:25,000
However, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.

124
0:06:26.043,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:29.356,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's kind of like landing on Mars

126
0:06:32.493,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and looking out the window of your spaceship

127
0:06:35.198,000 --> 0:06:37,000
at all the little green men who are surrounding it

128
0:06:37.668,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and trying to figure out, "How do I find out

129
0:06:40.074,000 --> 0:06:42,000
if they have emotions or not?"

130
0:06:42.429,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What can we do? It's not so easy.

131
0:06:45.972,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Well, one of the ways that we can start

132
0:06:48.157,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is to try to come up with some general characteristics

133
0:06:52.282,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or properties of emotion-like states

134
0:06:56.03,000 --> 0:06:59,000
such as arousal, and see if we can identify

135
0:06:59.494,000 --> 0:07:04,000
any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.

136
0:07:04.87,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So three important ones that I can think of

137
0:07:07.69,000 --> 0:07:11,000
are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.

138
0:07:12.362,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Persistence means long-lasting.

139
0:07:14.696,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion

140
0:07:18.657,000 --> 0:07:23,000
causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.

141
0:07:23.673,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like.

142
0:07:26.763,000 --> 0:07:3,000
You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.

143
0:07:31.346,000 --> 0:07:33,000
If you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth

144
0:07:33.946,000 --> 0:07:34,000
turn down and you sniffle,

145
0:07:35.633,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face

146
0:07:38.771,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and you might sob.

147
0:07:40.603,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Valence means good or bad, positive or negative.

148
0:07:44.982,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing

149
0:07:49.434,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the kind of behavior that you see

150
0:07:51.885,000 --> 0:07:53,000
by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,

151
0:07:54.695,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger

152
0:07:57.38,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the more vigorously you try to swat it away,

153
0:07:59.909,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and it seems to keep getting irritated.

154
0:08:02.193,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,

155
0:08:05.84,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies

156
0:08:10.185,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench

157
0:08:12.961,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and blow them away.

158
0:08:14.686,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And what we found is that if we gave these flies

159
0:08:17.925,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,

160
0:08:20.773,000 --> 0:08:22,000
they became somewhat hyperactive

161
0:08:23.462,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped

162
0:08:27.897,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and took a while to calm down.

163
0:08:30.761,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So we quantified this behavior

164
0:08:32.95,000 --> 0:08:35,000
using custom locomotor tracking software

165
0:08:35.962,000 --> 0:08:37,000
developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona,

166
0:08:38.762,000 --> 0:08:41,000
who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.

167
0:08:42.374,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And what this quantification showed us is that,

168
0:08:45.188,000 --> 0:08:48,000
upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,

169
0:08:48.412,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity

170
0:08:52.726,000 --> 0:08:54,000
which is persistent, long-lasting,

171
0:08:55.324,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and also appears to be graded.

172
0:08:57.828,000 --> 0:08:59,000
More puffs, or more intense puffs,

173
0:09:00.687,000 --> 0:09:03,000
make the state last for a longer period of time.

174
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So now we wanted to try to understand something

175
0:09:06.636,000 --> 0:09:09,000
about what controls the duration of this state.

176
0:09:10.35,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So we decided to use our puff-o-mat

177
0:09:13.201,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and our automated tracking software

178
0:09:15.256,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies

179
0:09:19.038,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.

180
0:09:24.117,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.

181
0:09:26.464,000 --> 0:09:28,000
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone

182
0:09:29.257,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants

183
0:09:32.898,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and screen them in your assay and then find out

184
0:09:35.07,000 --> 0:09:38,000
what gene is affected in the mutation.

185
0:09:38.389,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant

186
0:09:41.901,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that took much longer than normal to calm down

187
0:09:45.375,000 --> 0:09:47,000
after the air puffs,

188
0:09:47.652,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,

189
0:09:51.602,000 --> 0:09:54,000
it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.

190
0:09:55.207,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine,

191
0:09:58.218,000 --> 0:10:,000
and it acts on their brains and on their synapses

192
0:10:00.99,000 --> 0:10:02,000
through the same dopamine receptor molecules

193
0:10:03.54,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that you and I have.

194
0:10:05.929,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,

195
0:10:09.415,000 --> 0:10:12,000
including in attention, arousal, reward,

196
0:10:12.528,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked

197
0:10:15.941,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,

198
0:10:19.041,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.

199
0:10:23.275,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.

200
0:10:26.065,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We tend to infer the normal function of something

201
0:10:29.325,000 --> 0:10:32,000
by what doesn't happen when we take it away,

202
0:10:33.035,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by the opposite of what we see when we take it away.

203
0:10:36.038,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So when we take away the dopamine receptor

204
0:10:39.051,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and the flies take longer to calm down,

205
0:10:41.608,000 --> 0:10:44,000
from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine

206
0:10:45.454,000 --> 0:10:49,000
is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.

207
0:10:49.939,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,

208
0:10:52.889,000 --> 0:10:55,000
which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.

209
0:10:56.864,000 --> 0:11:,000
Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies

210
0:11:01.47,000 --> 0:11:02,000
by feeding them cocaine

211
0:11:03.18,000 --> 0:11:05,000
after getting the appropriate DEA license

212
0:11:06.152,000 --> 0:11:1,000
— oh my God -- (Laughter) —

213
0:11:10.152,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies

214
0:11:13.324,000 --> 0:11:16,000
calm down faster than normal flies do,

215
0:11:16.366,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and that's also reminiscent of ADHD,

216
0:11:19.565,000 --> 0:11:21,000
which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin

217
0:11:21.61,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that act similarly to cocaine.

218
0:11:24.629,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So slowly I began to realize that what started out

219
0:11:27.778,000 --> 0:11:3,000
as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies

220
0:11:31.427,000 --> 0:11:34,000
might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.

221
0:11:35.403,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Now, how far does this analogy go?

222
0:11:37.629,000 --> 0:11:4,000
As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD

223
0:11:40.751,000 --> 0:11:42,000
also have learning disabilities.

224
0:11:43.088,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?

225
0:11:46.654,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Remarkably, the answer is yes.

226
0:11:49.374,000 --> 0:11:51,000
As Seymour showed back in the 1970s,

227
0:11:52.002,000 --> 0:11:54,000
flies, like songbirds, as you just heard,

228
0:11:54.453,000 --> 0:11:55,000
are capable of learning.

229
0:11:56.186,000 --> 0:12:,000
You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,

230
0:12:00.629,000 --> 0:12:02,000
if you pair that odor with a shock.

231
0:12:03.017,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose

232
0:12:06.401,000 --> 0:12:09,000
between a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,

233
0:12:09.555,000 --> 0:12:13,000
it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.

234
0:12:13.755,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,

235
0:12:17.257,000 --> 0:12:19,000
they don't learn. Their learning score is zero.

236
0:12:19.722,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They flunk out of CalTech.

237
0:12:23.533,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So that means that these flies have two abnormalities,

238
0:12:28.281,000 --> 0:12:31,000
or phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,

239
0:12:31.331,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.

240
0:12:36.843,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Now what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?

241
0:12:41.206,000 --> 0:12:44,000
In ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity

242
0:12:45.119,000 --> 0:12:46,000
causes the learning disability.

243
0:12:47.025,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.

244
0:12:50.744,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities

245
0:12:54.04,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that cause the hyperactivity.

246
0:12:55.912,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Because the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.

247
0:13:00.382,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all

248
0:13:03.439,000 --> 0:13:05,000
between learning disabilities and hyperactivity,

249
0:13:05.843,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.

250
0:13:10.758,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Now people have been wondering about this for a long time

251
0:13:13.1,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.

252
0:13:16.588,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind

253
0:13:19.672,000 --> 0:13:23,000
of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.

254
0:13:23.938,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies

255
0:13:26.4,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor

256
0:13:30.964,000 --> 0:13:33,000
by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene

257
0:13:34.199,000 --> 0:13:36,000
back into the fly brain.

258
0:13:36.25,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons

259
0:13:40.085,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and not in others, and then we test each of these flies

260
0:13:43.799,000 --> 0:13:46,000
for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.

261
0:13:47.467,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Remarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.

262
0:13:52.285,000 --> 0:13:54,000
If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back

263
0:13:54.948,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in this elliptical structure called the central complex,

264
0:13:57.909,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn.

265
0:14:01.986,000 --> 0:14:03,000
On the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure

266
0:14:04.712,000 --> 0:14:05,000
called the mushroom body,

267
0:14:06.23,000 --> 0:14:09,000
the learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,

268
0:14:09.315,000 --> 0:14:1,000
but they're still hyperactive.

269
0:14:11.145,000 --> 0:14:13,000
What that tells us is that dopamine

270
0:14:13.395,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.

271
0:14:16.787,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Rather, it's acting to control two different functions

272
0:14:19.949,000 --> 0:14:2,000
on two different circuits,

273
0:14:21.583,000 --> 0:14:24,000
so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies

274
0:14:25.487,000 --> 0:14:29,000
is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions

275
0:14:29.662,000 --> 0:14:31,000
in two different regions of the brain.

276
0:14:32.525,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans

277
0:14:35.587,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we don't know, but these kinds of results

278
0:14:37.963,000 --> 0:14:4,000
should at least cause us to consider that possibility.

279
0:14:41.44,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever

280
0:14:45.413,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,

281
0:14:48.825,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders

282
0:14:52.352,000 --> 0:14:54,000
just by changing the flavor of the soup.

283
0:14:55.063,000 --> 0:14:59,000
What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge

284
0:14:59.28,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to try to design a new generation of treatments

285
0:15:01.988,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain

286
0:15:06.276,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.

287
0:15:09.614,000 --> 0:15:12,000
If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders

288
0:15:12.814,000 --> 0:15:14,000
without the unpleasant side effects,

289
0:15:14.861,000 --> 0:15:16,000
putting the oil back in our mental engines,

290
0:15:17.607,000 --> 0:15:2,000
just where it's needed. Thank you very much.

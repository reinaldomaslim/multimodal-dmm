1
0:00:12.504,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I need to start by telling you a little bit

2
0:00:15.066,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about my social life,

3
0:00:16.555,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which I know may not seem relevant,

4
0:00:19.473,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but it is.

5
0:00:21.22,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When people meet me at parties

6
0:00:23.15,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and they find out that I'm an English professor

7
0:00:25.342,000 --> 0:00:27,000
who specializes in language,

8
0:00:27.739,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they generally have one of two reactions.

9
0:00:31.189,000 --> 0:00:36,000
One set of people look frightened. (Laughter)

10
0:00:36.378,000 --> 0:00:37,000
They often say something like,

11
0:00:37.971,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.

12
0:00:41.277,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."

13
0:00:44.495,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And then they stop talking. (Laughter)

14
0:00:48.553,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And they wait for me to go away

15
0:00:50.95,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and talk to someone else.

16
0:00:53.187,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The other set of people,

17
0:00:55.222,000 --> 0:00:57,000
their eyes light up,

18
0:00:57.647,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and they say,

19
0:00:58.878,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"You are just the person I want to talk to."

20
0:01:03.187,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And then they tell me about whatever it is

21
0:01:05.607,000 --> 0:01:07,000
they think is going wrong with the English language.

22
0:01:08.142,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:10.511,000 --> 0:01:12,000
A couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party

24
0:01:12.828,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and the man to my right

25
0:01:15.065,000 --> 0:01:17,000
started telling me about all the ways

26
0:01:17.1,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that the Internet is degrading the English language.

27
0:01:20.381,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He brought up Facebook, and he said,

28
0:01:23.62,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?"

29
0:01:29.47,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I want to pause on that question:

30
0:01:33.04,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What makes a word real?

31
0:01:36.826,000 --> 0:01:38,000
My dinner companion and I both know

32
0:01:38.91,000 --> 0:01:41,000
what the verb "defriend" means,

33
0:01:42.077,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so when does a new word like "defriend"

34
0:01:44.777,000 --> 0:01:46,000
become real?

35
0:01:46.858,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Who has the authority to make those kinds

36
0:01:49.362,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of official decisions about words, anyway?

37
0:01:52.78,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Those are the questions I want to talk about today.

38
0:01:57.075,000 --> 0:02:,000
I think most people, when they say a word isn't real,

39
0:02:00.375,000 --> 0:02:01,000
what they mean is, it doesn't appear

40
0:02:02.236,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in a standard dictionary.

41
0:02:03.864,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That, of course, raises a host of other questions,

42
0:02:06.327,000 --> 0:02:11,000
including, who writes dictionaries?

43
0:02:11.724,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Before I go any further,

44
0:02:13.048,000 --> 0:02:15,000
let me clarify my role in all of this.

45
0:02:15.49,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I do not write dictionaries.

46
0:02:17.998,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I do, however, collect new words

47
0:02:20.695,000 --> 0:02:23,000
much the way dictionary editors do,

48
0:02:23.75,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and the great thing about being a historian

49
0:02:25.573,000 --> 0:02:26,000
of the English language

50
0:02:26.64,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is that I get to call this "research."

51
0:02:30.276,000 --> 0:02:32,000
When I teach the history of the English language,

52
0:02:32.62,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I require that students teach me

53
0:02:35.377,000 --> 0:02:38,000
two new slang words before I will begin class.

54
0:02:38.903,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Over the years, I have learned

55
0:02:41.22,000 --> 0:02:44,000
some great new slang this way,

56
0:02:44.454,000 --> 0:02:48,000
including "hangry," which --

57
0:02:48.492,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Applause) —

58
0:02:52.188,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which is when you are cranky or angry

59
0:02:54.535,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because you are hungry,

60
0:02:58.774,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and "adorkable,"

61
0:03:03.55,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which is when you are adorable

62
0:03:05.257,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in kind of a dorky way,

63
0:03:08.278,000 --> 0:03:11,000
clearly, terrific words that fill

64
0:03:11.471,000 --> 0:03:13,000
important gaps in the English language.

65
0:03:14.176,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:18.389,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But how real are they

67
0:03:21.06,000 --> 0:03:23,000
if we use them primarily as slang

68
0:03:23.279,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and they don't yet appear in a dictionary?

69
0:03:27.396,000 --> 0:03:29,000
With that, let's turn to dictionaries.

70
0:03:30.213,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I'm going to do this as a show of hands:

71
0:03:32.053,000 --> 0:03:34,000
How many of you still regularly

72
0:03:34.387,000 --> 0:03:37,000
refer to a dictionary, either print or online?

73
0:03:39.338,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Okay, so that looks like most of you.

74
0:03:41.532,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, a second question. Again, a show of hands:

75
0:03:44.697,000 --> 0:03:47,000
How many of you have ever looked to see

76
0:03:47.902,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who edited the dictionary you are using?

77
0:03:54.048,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Okay, many fewer.

78
0:03:57.68,000 --> 0:04:,000
At some level, we know that there are human hands

79
0:04:01.36,000 --> 0:04:02,000
behind dictionaries,

80
0:04:02.936,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but we're really not sure who those hands belong to.

81
0:04:07.207,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I'm actually fascinated by this.

82
0:04:09.547,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Even the most critical people out there

83
0:04:12.02,000 --> 0:04:14,000
tend not to be very critical about dictionaries,

84
0:04:14.614,000 --> 0:04:15,000
not distinguishing among them

85
0:04:16.497,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and not asking a whole lot of questions

86
0:04:18.568,000 --> 0:04:2,000
about who edited them.

87
0:04:20.791,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Just think about the phrase

88
0:04:22.414,000 --> 0:04:24,000
"Look it up in the dictionary,"

89
0:04:24.89,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which suggests that all dictionaries

90
0:04:26.567,000 --> 0:04:27,000
are exactly the same.

91
0:04:28.273,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Consider the library here on campus,

92
0:04:30.873,000 --> 0:04:31,000
where you go into the reading room,

93
0:04:32.569,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and there is a large, unabridged dictionary

94
0:04:35.442,000 --> 0:04:38,000
up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect

95
0:04:39.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
lying open so we can go stand before it

96
0:04:41.667,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to get answers.

97
0:04:43.87,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, don't get me wrong,

98
0:04:46.176,000 --> 0:04:49,000
dictionaries are fantastic resources,

99
0:04:49.381,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but they are human

100
0:04:50.93,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and they are not timeless.

101
0:04:53.211,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'm struck as a teacher

102
0:04:55.013,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that we tell students to critically question

103
0:04:58.23,000 --> 0:05:01,000
every text they read, every website they visit,

104
0:05:01.964,000 --> 0:05:02,000
except dictionaries,

105
0:05:03.452,000 --> 0:05:06,000
which we tend to treat as un-authored,

106
0:05:06.617,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as if they came from nowhere to give us answers

107
0:05:09.259,000 --> 0:05:13,000
about what words really mean.

108
0:05:13.603,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Here's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,

109
0:05:17.2,000 --> 0:05:18,000
what they'll tell you

110
0:05:18.358,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is they're just trying to keep up with us

111
0:05:20.672,000 --> 0:05:21,000
as we change the language.

112
0:05:22.427,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They're watching what we say and what we write

113
0:05:24.912,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and trying to figure out what's going to stick

114
0:05:27.07,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and what's not going to stick.

115
0:05:29.22,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They have to gamble,

116
0:05:30.537,000 --> 0:05:31,000
because they want to appear cutting edge

117
0:05:32.286,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and catch the words that are going to make it,

118
0:05:34.942,000 --> 0:05:36,000
such as LOL,

119
0:05:37.381,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but they don't want to appear faddish

120
0:05:39.585,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and include the words that aren't going to make it,

121
0:05:42.127,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I think a word that they're watching right now

122
0:05:43.94,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is YOLO, you only live once.

123
0:05:49.317,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors,

124
0:05:51.811,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and you might be surprised

125
0:05:53.319,000 --> 0:05:55,000
by one of the places where we hang out.

126
0:05:55.535,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Every January, we go

127
0:05:57.672,000 --> 0:06:,000
to the American Dialect Society annual meeting,

128
0:06:00.825,000 --> 0:06:01,000
where among other things,

129
0:06:02.172,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we vote on the word of the year.

130
0:06:05.93,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There are about 200 or 300 people who come,

131
0:06:08.933,000 --> 0:06:1,000
some of the best known linguists in the United States.

132
0:06:11.373,000 --> 0:06:12,000
To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,

133
0:06:13.231,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it occurs right before happy hour.

134
0:06:16.532,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Anyone who comes can vote.

135
0:06:18.608,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The most important rule is

136
0:06:19.92,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that you can vote with only one hand.

137
0:06:23.049,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In the past, some of the winners have been

138
0:06:26.513,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"tweet" in 2009

139
0:06:28.998,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and "hashtag" in 2012.

140
0:06:32.403,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"Chad" was the word of the year in the year 2000,

141
0:06:35.462,000 --> 0:06:38,000
because who knew what a chad was before 2000,

142
0:06:39.282,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and "WMD" in 2002.

143
0:06:43.696,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, we have other categories in which we vote too,

144
0:06:46.497,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and my favorite category

145
0:06:48.09,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is most creative word of the year.

146
0:06:50.474,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Past winners in this category have included

147
0:06:53.224,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"recombobulation area,"

148
0:06:56.277,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,

149
0:07:00.08,000 --> 0:07:02,000
where you can recombobulate.

150
0:07:02.64,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:04.124,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You can put your belt back on,

152
0:07:05.643,000 --> 0:07:07,000
put your computer back in your bag.

153
0:07:10.289,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then my all-time favorite word at this vote,

154
0:07:13.621,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which is "multi-slacking."

155
0:07:15.847,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:18.35,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And multi-slacking is the act

157
0:07:20.633,000 --> 0:07:22,000
of having multiple windows up on your screen

158
0:07:23.501,000 --> 0:07:24,000
so it looks like you're working

159
0:07:24.902,000 --> 0:07:26,000
when you're actually goofing around on the web.

160
0:07:26.996,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

161
0:07:33.381,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Will all of these words stick? Absolutely not.

162
0:07:36.989,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And we have made some questionable choices,

163
0:07:39.888,000 --> 0:07:4,000
for example in 2006

164
0:07:41.565,000 --> 0:07:43,000
when the word of the year was "Plutoed,"

165
0:07:43.604,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to mean demoted.

166
0:07:45.596,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:50.586,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But some of the past winners

168
0:07:52.955,000 --> 0:07:54,000
now seem completely unremarkable,

169
0:07:55.87,000 --> 0:07:56,000
such as "app"

170
0:07:57.388,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and "e" as a prefix,

171
0:07:59.401,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and "google" as a verb.

172
0:08:02.36,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, a few weeks before our vote,

173
0:08:06.427,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Lake Superior State University

174
0:08:08.208,000 --> 0:08:12,000
issues its list of banished words for the year.

175
0:08:12.987,000 --> 0:08:13,000
What is striking about this

176
0:08:14.92,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap

177
0:08:17.691,000 --> 0:08:19,000
between their list and the list that we are considering

178
0:08:20.528,000 --> 0:08:22,000
for words of the year,

179
0:08:22.778,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and this is because we're noticing the same thing.

180
0:08:26.87,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We're noticing words that are coming into prominence.

181
0:08:29.9,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's really a question of attitude.

182
0:08:32.053,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Are you bothered by language fads and language change,

183
0:08:35.72,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or do you find it fun, interesting,

184
0:08:39.13,000 --> 0:08:4,000
something worthy of study

185
0:08:40.484,000 --> 0:08:42,000
as part of a living language?

186
0:08:43.369,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The list by Lake Superior State University

187
0:08:45.525,000 --> 0:08:47,000
continues a fairly long tradition in English

188
0:08:48.17,000 --> 0:08:5,000
of complaints about new words.

189
0:08:50.443,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,

190
0:08:54.795,000 --> 0:08:56,000
who was very concerned that "desirability"

191
0:08:57.041,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is really a terrible word.

192
0:08:59.49,000 --> 0:09:01,000
In 1760, Benjamin Franklin

193
0:09:02.224,000 --> 0:09:03,000
wrote a letter to David Hume

194
0:09:03.68,000 --> 0:09:06,000
giving up the word "colonize" as bad.

195
0:09:07.483,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Over the years, we've also seen worries

196
0:09:09.682,000 --> 0:09:1,000
about new pronunciations.

197
0:09:11.572,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Here is Samuel Rogers in 1855

198
0:09:14.62,000 --> 0:09:16,000
who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations

199
0:09:17.219,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that he finds offensive,

200
0:09:19.226,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and he says "as if contemplate were not bad enough,

201
0:09:22.714,000 --> 0:09:24,000
balcony makes me sick."

202
0:09:25.132,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:28.528,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The word is borrowed in from Italian

204
0:09:30.878,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and it was pronounced bal-COE-nee.

205
0:09:34.418,000 --> 0:09:36,000
These complaints now strike us as quaint,

206
0:09:37.361,000 --> 0:09:41,000
if not downright adorkable -- (Laughter) --

207
0:09:42.306,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but here's the thing:

208
0:09:45.04,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we still get quite worked up about language change.

209
0:09:49.413,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I have an entire file in my office

210
0:09:51.475,000 --> 0:09:54,000
of newspaper articles

211
0:09:54.537,000 --> 0:09:56,000
which express concern about illegitimate words

212
0:09:57.23,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that should not have been included in the dictionary,

213
0:09:59.109,000 --> 0:10:,000
including "LOL"

214
0:10:00.557,000 --> 0:10:02,000
when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary

215
0:10:02.627,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and "defriend"

216
0:10:04.402,000 --> 0:10:06,000
when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.

217
0:10:07.174,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I also have articles expressing concern

218
0:10:09.391,000 --> 0:10:11,000
about "invite" as a noun,

219
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"impact" as a verb,

220
0:10:14.216,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because only teeth can be impacted,

221
0:10:17.187,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and "incentivize" is described

222
0:10:20.162,000 --> 0:10:24,000
as "boorish, bureaucratic misspeak."

223
0:10:24.673,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, it's not that dictionary editors

224
0:10:26.634,000 --> 0:10:28,000
ignore these kinds of attitudes about language.

225
0:10:29.325,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They try to provide us some guidance about words

226
0:10:31.88,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that are considered slang or informal

227
0:10:34.15,000 --> 0:10:37,000
or offensive, often through usage labels,

228
0:10:37.293,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but they're in something of a bind,

229
0:10:38.983,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because they're trying to describe what we do,

230
0:10:42.635,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and they know that we often go to dictionaries

231
0:10:44.964,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to get information about how we should use a word

232
0:10:47.732,000 --> 0:10:48,000
well or appropriately.

233
0:10:49.64,000 --> 0:10:52,000
In response, the American Heritage Dictionaries

234
0:10:52.664,000 --> 0:10:54,000
include usage notes.

235
0:10:54.805,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Usage notes tend to occur with words

236
0:10:56.922,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that are troublesome in one way,

237
0:10:58.245,000 --> 0:11:,000
and one of the ways that they can be troublesome

238
0:11:01.11,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is that they're changing meaning.

239
0:11:03.043,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now usage notes involve very human decisions,

240
0:11:06.469,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and I think, as dictionary users,

241
0:11:08.528,000 --> 0:11:1,000
we're often not as aware of those human decisions

242
0:11:10.77,000 --> 0:11:11,000
as we should be.

243
0:11:11.869,000 --> 0:11:12,000
To show you what I mean,

244
0:11:12.993,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we'll look at an example, but before we do,

245
0:11:15.71,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I want to explain what the dictionary editors

246
0:11:17.692,000 --> 0:11:2,000
are trying to deal with in this usage note.

247
0:11:20.99,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Think about the word "peruse"

248
0:11:23.664,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and how you use that word.

249
0:11:27.302,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I would guess many of you are thinking

250
0:11:29.838,000 --> 0:11:33,000
of skim, scan, reading quickly.

251
0:11:34.375,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Some of you may even have some walking involved,

252
0:11:37.21,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because you're perusing grocery store shelves,

253
0:11:39.456,000 --> 0:11:4,000
or something like that.

254
0:11:41.127,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You might be surprised to learn

255
0:11:43.611,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that if you look in most standard dictionaries,

256
0:11:45.48,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the first definition will be to read carefully,

257
0:11:48.253,000 --> 0:11:5,000
or pore over.

258
0:11:50.697,000 --> 0:11:52,000
American Heritage has that as the first definition.

259
0:11:53.556,000 --> 0:11:55,000
They then have, as the second definition, skim,

260
0:11:56.521,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and next to that, they say "usage problem."

261
0:12:00.316,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

262
0:12:02.226,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And then they include a usage note,

263
0:12:04.314,000 --> 0:12:05,000
which is worth looking at.

264
0:12:06.191,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So here's the usage note:

265
0:12:08.102,000 --> 0:12:1,000
"Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'...

266
0:12:10.459,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But the word is often used more loosely,

267
0:12:12.226,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to mean simply 'to read.'...

268
0:12:14.386,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Further extension of the word to mean 'to glance over, skim,'

269
0:12:17.315,000 --> 0:12:19,000
has traditionally been considered an error,

270
0:12:19.771,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming

271
0:12:22.174,000 --> 0:12:23,000
somewhat more acceptable.

272
0:12:23.87,000 --> 0:12:24,000
When asked about the sentence,

273
0:12:25.269,000 --> 0:12:27,000
'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,'

274
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
66 percent of the [Usage] Panel

275
0:12:30.075,000 --> 0:12:32,000
found it unacceptable in 1988,

276
0:12:32.422,000 --> 0:12:34,000
58 percent in 1999,

277
0:12:34.529,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and 48 percent in 2011."

278
0:12:38.397,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Ah, the Usage Panel,

279
0:12:40.358,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that trusted body of language authorities

280
0:12:42.968,000 --> 0:12:44,000
who is getting more lenient about this.

281
0:12:45.82,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Now, what I hope you're thinking right now is,

282
0:12:47.89,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"Wait, who's on the Usage Panel?

283
0:12:51.885,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And what should I do with their pronouncements?"

284
0:12:54.997,000 --> 0:12:55,000
If you look in the front matter

285
0:12:56.96,000 --> 0:12:57,000
of American Heritage Dictionaries,

286
0:12:58.068,000 --> 0:12:59,000
you can actually find the names

287
0:12:59.643,000 --> 0:13:,000
of the people on the Usage Panel.

288
0:13:01.212,000 --> 0:13:03,000
But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?

289
0:13:03.244,000 --> 0:13:06,000
There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.

290
0:13:06.291,000 --> 0:13:08,000
They include academicians,

291
0:13:08.668,000 --> 0:13:09,000
journalists, creative writers.

292
0:13:10.345,000 --> 0:13:12,000
There's a Supreme Court justice on it

293
0:13:12.437,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and a few linguists.

294
0:13:14.336,000 --> 0:13:18,000
As of 2005, the list includes me.

295
0:13:19.168,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Applause)

296
0:13:23.342,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Here's what we can do for you.

297
0:13:26.71,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We can give you a sense

298
0:13:29.07,000 --> 0:13:32,000
of the range of opinions about contested usage.

299
0:13:32.122,000 --> 0:13:35,000
That is and should be the extent of our authority.

300
0:13:35.479,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We are not a language academy.

301
0:13:38.89,000 --> 0:13:4,000
About once a year, I get a ballot

302
0:13:41.837,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that asks me about whether new uses,

303
0:13:44.869,000 --> 0:13:47,000
new pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable.

304
0:13:48.207,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot.

305
0:13:51.099,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I listen to what other people are saying and writing.

306
0:13:54.607,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I do not listen to my own likes

307
0:13:56.851,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and dislikes about the English language.

308
0:14:00.06,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I will be honest with you:

309
0:14:01.529,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I do not like the word "impactful,"

310
0:14:04.478,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but that is neither here nor there

311
0:14:06.48,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in terms of whether "impactful" is becoming common usage

312
0:14:09.719,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and becoming more acceptable in written prose.

313
0:14:12.97,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So to be responsible,

314
0:14:14.018,000 --> 0:14:16,000
what I do is go look at usage,

315
0:14:16.546,000 --> 0:14:17,000
which often involves going to look

316
0:14:18.382,000 --> 0:14:2,000
at online databases such as Google Books.

317
0:14:21.077,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Well, if you look for "impactful" in Google Books,

318
0:14:23.897,000 --> 0:14:26,000
here is what you find.

319
0:14:27.103,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Well, it sure looks like "impactful"

320
0:14:29.344,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is proving useful

321
0:14:31.074,000 --> 0:14:32,000
for a certain number of writers,

322
0:14:32.703,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and has become more and more useful

323
0:14:34.303,000 --> 0:14:35,000
over the last 20 years.

324
0:14:36.262,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Now, there are going to be changes

325
0:14:38.415,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that all of us don't like in the language.

326
0:14:41.049,000 --> 0:14:43,000
There are going to be changes where you think,

327
0:14:43.233,000 --> 0:14:43,000
"Really?

328
0:14:44.22,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Does the language have to change that way?"

329
0:14:47.905,000 --> 0:14:48,000
What I'm saying is,

330
0:14:49.588,000 --> 0:14:5,000
we should be less quick

331
0:14:51.31,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to decide that that change is terrible,

332
0:14:55.101,000 --> 0:14:56,000
we should be less quick to impose

333
0:14:56.815,000 --> 0:14:59,000
our likes and dislikes about words on other people,

334
0:15:00.116,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and we should be entirely reluctant

335
0:15:03.03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
to think that the English language is in trouble.

336
0:15:05.774,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled

337
0:15:09.97,000 --> 0:15:12,000
with the creativity of the speakers who speak it.

338
0:15:12.98,000 --> 0:15:14,000
In retrospect, we think it's fascinating

339
0:15:15.598,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that the word "nice" used to mean silly,

340
0:15:18.976,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and that the word "decimate"

341
0:15:20.66,000 --> 0:15:23,000
used to mean to kill one in every 10.

342
0:15:24.165,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

343
0:15:29.162,000 --> 0:15:34,000
We think that Ben Franklin was being silly

344
0:15:34.255,000 --> 0:15:36,000
to worry about "notice" as a verb.

345
0:15:36.904,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Well, you know what?

346
0:15:38.367,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years

347
0:15:41.067,000 --> 0:15:43,000
for worrying about "impact" as a verb

348
0:15:43.364,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and "invite" as a noun.

349
0:15:46.176,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The language is not going to change so fast

350
0:15:48.416,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that we can't keep up.

351
0:15:50.313,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Language just doesn't work that way.

352
0:15:52.596,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I hope that what you can do

353
0:15:54.209,000 --> 0:15:56,000
is find language change not worrisome

354
0:15:57.038,000 --> 0:15:59,000
but fun and fascinating,

355
0:15:59.076,000 --> 0:16:02,000
just the way dictionary editors do.

356
0:16:02.085,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I hope you can enjoy being part

357
0:16:04.047,000 --> 0:16:09,000
of the creativity that is continually remaking

358
0:16:09.051,000 --> 0:16:12,000
our language and keeping it robust.

359
0:16:12.327,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So how does a word get into a dictionary?

360
0:16:15.247,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It gets in because we use it

361
0:16:17.716,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and we keep using it,

362
0:16:19.34,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.

363
0:16:23.575,000 --> 0:16:26,000
If you're thinking, "But that lets all of us decide

364
0:16:26.695,000 --> 0:16:27,000
what words mean,"

365
0:16:28.444,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I would say, "Yes it does,

366
0:16:32.495,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and it always has."

367
0:16:34.847,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,

368
0:16:38.774,000 --> 0:16:41,000
but there is no objective dictionary authority out there

369
0:16:42.27,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that is the final arbiter about what words mean.

370
0:16:46.043,000 --> 0:16:48,000
If a community of speakers is using a word

371
0:16:48.556,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and knows what it means, it's real.

372
0:16:52.152,000 --> 0:16:53,000
That word might be slangy,

373
0:16:53.52,000 --> 0:16:54,000
that word might be informal,

374
0:16:55.162,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that word might be a word that you think

375
0:16:57.067,000 --> 0:16:59,000
is illogical or unnecessary,

376
0:16:59.524,000 --> 0:17:01,000
but that word that we're using,

377
0:17:02.075,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that word is real.

378
0:17:04.433,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Thank you.

379
0:17:06.774,000 --> 0:17:07,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This is a guy named Bob McKim.

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
He was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s,

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and also led the Stanford Design Program.

4
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley,

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who’s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.

6
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And he liked to do an exercise with his students

7
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
where he got them to take a piece of paper

8
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor,

9
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
very quickly, just as quickly as they could.

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And in fact, we’re going to do that exercise right now.

11
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.

12
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.

13
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I need you to turn that piece of paper over;

14
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you should find that it’s blank on the other side.

15
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And there should be a pencil.

16
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I want you to pick somebody that’s seated next to you,

17
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and when I say, go, you’ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?

18
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So, everybody ready? OK. Off you go.

19
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast.

20
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Come on: those masterpieces ...

21
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
OK? Stop. All right, now.

22
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Yes, lot’s of laughter. Yeah, exactly.

24
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Lots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment.

25
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Am I hearing a few "sorry’s"? I think I’m hearing a few sorry’s.

27
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Yup, yup, I think I probably am.

28
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And that’s exactly what happens every time,

29
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
every time you do this with adults.

30
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
McKim found this every time he did it with his students.

31
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry’s.

32
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And he would point this out as evidence

34
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that we fear the judgment of our peers,

35
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that we’re embarrassed about showing our ideas

36
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to people we think of as our peers, to those around us.

37
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And this fear is what causes us

38
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to be conservative in our thinking.

39
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So we might have a wild idea,

40
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else.

41
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids,

42
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they have no embarrassment at all.

43
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
They just quite happily show their masterpiece

44
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to whoever wants to look at it.

45
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But as they learn to become adults,

46
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,

47
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.

48
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And in studies of kids playing, it’s been shown

49
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
time after time that kids who feel secure,

50
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
who are in a kind of trusted environment --

51
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
they’re the ones that feel most free to play.

52
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And if you’re starting a design firm, let’s say,

53
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
then you probably also want to create

54
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a place where people have the same kind of security.

55
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Where they have the same kind of security to take risks.

56
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Maybe have the same kind of security to play.

57
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Before founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do

58
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends.

59
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now, that wasn’t just self-indulgence.

60
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He knew that friendship is a short cut to play.

61
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust,

62
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks

63
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that we need to take as designers.

64
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And so, that decision to work with his friends --

65
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
now he has 550 of them -- was what got IDEO started.

66
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today,

67
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
are designed to help people feel relaxed:

68
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
familiar with their surroundings,

69
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
comfortable with the people that they’re working with.

70
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It takes more than decor, but I think we’ve all seen that

71
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace

72
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that remind people to be playful,

73
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and that it’s a permissive environment.

74
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So, whether it’s this microbus meeting room

75
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that we have in one our buildings at IDEO;

76
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
or at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;

77
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or at the Googleplex, where

78
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
it’s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,

79
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.

80
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos,

81
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but anyway, they’re there in the garden.

82
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Or even in the Swiss office of Google,

83
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.

84
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And my theory is, that’s so the Swiss can prove

85
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to their Californian colleagues that they’re not boring.

86
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman’s pole.

87
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one.

88
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So all of these places have these symbols.

89
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually

90
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
not so much the place, it’s a thing.

91
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago,

92
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
or created a few years ago.

93
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It’s a toy; it’s called a "finger blaster."

94
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I forgot to bring one up with me.

95
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So if somebody can reach under the chair that’s next to them,

96
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
you’ll find something taped underneath it.

97
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That’s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.

98
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you

99
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
has got one taped under your chair.

100
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I’m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.

101
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
But before we start, I need just to put these on.

102
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Thank you. All right.

103
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, what I’m going to do is, I’m going to see how --

104
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I can’t see out of these, OK.

105
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I’m going to see how many of you at the back of the room

106
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
can actually get those things onto the stage.

107
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So the way they work is, you know,

108
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you just put your finger in the thing,

109
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
pull them back, and off you go.

110
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So, don’t look backwards. That’s my only recommendation here.

111
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.

112
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh.

113
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I have another idea. I wanted to -- there we go.

114
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
There we go.

116
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

118
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Not bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.

119
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Well, they’re still coming in from the back there;

121
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
they’re still coming in.

122
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Some of you haven’t fired them yet.

123
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Can you not figure out how to do it, or something?

124
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It’s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this

125
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up.

126
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
All right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.

127
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Okay, all right. Let’s -- I suppose we'd better...

128
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I'd better clear these up out of the way;

129
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
otherwise, I’m going to trip over them.

130
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
All right. So the rest of you can save them

131
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
for when I say something particularly boring,

132
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and then you can fire at me.

133
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

134
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
All right. I think I’m going to take these off now,

135
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because I can’t see a damn thing when I’ve -- all right, OK.

136
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So, ah, that was fun.

137
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughter)

138
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
All right, good.

139
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

140
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So, OK, so why?

141
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know.

142
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Why do we have them? Well, as I said,

143
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.

144
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But why is it important?

145
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.

146
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.

147
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Helps us do our jobs better,

148
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and helps us feel better when we do them.

149
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Now, an adult encountering a new situation --

150
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency

151
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.

152
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And there’s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.

153
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Life’s complicated; we want to figure out

154
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
what’s going on around us very quickly.

155
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists

156
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want

157
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to categorize new things very, very quickly.

158
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
One of them might be, you know,

159
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
when we see this funny stripy thing:

160
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?

161
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree?

162
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We need to figure that out pretty fast.

163
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Well, at least, we did once.

164
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose.

165
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.

166
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That’s what it is, isn’t it? Of course it is, of course it is.

167
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Well, not necessarily.

168
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Kids are more engaged with open possibilities.

170
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now, they’ll certainly -- when they come across something new,

171
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they’ll certainly ask, "What is it?"

172
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Of course they will. But they’ll also ask, "What can I do with it?"

173
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And you know, the more creative of them

174
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
might get to a really interesting example.

175
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.

176
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Any parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.

177
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Yeah, thought so. So we’ve all seen it, haven’t we?

178
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We’ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning,

179
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
our kids end up playing with the boxes

180
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
far more than they play with the toys that are inside them.

181
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And you know, from an exploration perspective,

182
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
this behavior makes complete sense.

183
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy.

184
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Even one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo --

185
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
which, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing,

186
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices.

187
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So again, this is another one of those playful activities

188
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn.

189
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So another one of Bob McKim’s favorite exercises

190
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is called the "30 Circles Test."

191
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So we’re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again.

192
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on

193
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
back over, and you’ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.

194
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.

195
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So what I’m going to do is, I’m going to give you minute,

196
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can

197
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
into objects of some form.

198
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So for example, you could turn one into a football,

199
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
or another one into a sun. All I’m interested in is quantity.

200
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I want you to do as many of them as you can,

201
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in the minute that I’m just about to give you.

202
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.

203
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say.

204
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So, who got more than five circles figured out?

205
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Hopefully everybody? More than 10?

206
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Keep your hands up if you did 10.

207
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
15? 20? Anybody get all 30?

208
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.

209
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?

210
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Happy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?

211
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Anybody use my examples? The sun and the football?

212
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity.

213
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I wasn’t actually very interested in whether they were all different.

214
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.

215
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things.

216
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We stop ourselves from doing things.

217
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We self-edit as we’re having ideas.

218
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.

219
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And that actually isn’t necessarily really playful.

220
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things,

221
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
even if they don’t seem that different from each other,

222
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play.

223
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
So now, Bob McKim did another

224
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
version of this test

225
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s.

226
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Anybody know what this is? It’s the peyote cactus.

227
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It’s the plant from which you can create mescaline,

228
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
one of the psychedelic drugs.

229
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well.

230
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment

231
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that he and his colleagues conducted

232
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.

233
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So he picked 27 professionals -- they were

234
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
engineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,

235
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
furniture designers even, artists --

236
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and he asked them to come along one evening,

237
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and to bring a problem with them that they were working on.

238
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
He gave each of them some mescaline,

239
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.

240
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
And then he did what’s called the Purdue Creativity Test.

241
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
You might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?"

242
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It’s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.

243
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now, actually, he gave the test before the drugs

244
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and after the drugs, to see

245
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
what the difference was in people’s

246
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
facility and speed with coming up with ideas.

247
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And then he asked them to go away

248
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and work on those problems that they’d brought.

249
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And they’d come up with a bunch of

250
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
interesting solutions -- and actually, quite

251
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on.

252
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And so, some of the things that they figured out,

253
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
some of these individuals figured out;

254
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses

255
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that were accepted by clients;

256
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
a design of a solar space probe experiment;

257
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
a redesign of the linear electron accelerator;

258
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder --

259
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you can tell this is a while ago;

260
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the completion of a line of furniture;

261
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and even a new conceptual model of the photon.

262
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So it was a pretty successful evening.

263
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
In fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley

264
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
got off to its great start with innovation.

265
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We don’t know, but it may be.

266
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We need to ask some of the CEOs

267
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.

268
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But really, it wasn’t the drugs that were important;

269
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
it was this idea that what the drugs did

270
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,

271
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and getting them to forget the adult behaviors

272
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that were getting in the way of their ideas.

273
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
But it’s hard to break our habits, our adult habits.

274
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls.

275
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Edicts like, "Defer judgment," or "Go for quantity."

276
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And somehow that seems wrong.

277
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I mean, can you have rules about creativity?

278
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Well, it sort of turns out that we need rules

279
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to help us break the old rules and norms

280
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that otherwise we might bring to the creative process.

281
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And we’ve certainly learnt that over time,

282
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
you get much better brainstorming,

283
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.

284
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
Now, of course, many designers, many individual designers,

285
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
achieve this is in a much more organic way.

286
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.

287
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And they experimented with plywood for many years

288
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
without necessarily having one single goal in mind.

289
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
They were exploring following what was interesting to them.

290
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers

291
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
coming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,

292
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and from this experiment they moved on to chairs.

293
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Through constant experimentation with materials,

294
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
they developed a wide range of iconic solutions

295
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
that we know today, eventually resulting in,

296
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
of course, the legendary lounge chair.

297
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Now, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,

298
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
then we wouldn’t be the beneficiaries of so many

299
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
wonderful designs today.

300
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,

301
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
from films to buildings, from games to graphics.

302
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So, they’re great examples, I think, of exploration

303
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and experimentation in design.

304
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Now, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities,

305
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
they were also exploring physical objects.

306
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And they were doing that through building prototypes.

307
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I’d talk about.

308
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So the average Western first-grader

309
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
spends as much as 50 percent of their play time

310
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
taking part in what’s called "construction play."

311
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Construction play -- it’s playful, obviously,

312
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
but also a powerful way to learn.

313
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
When play is about building a tower out of blocks,

314
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
the kid begins to learn a lot about towers.

315
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again,

316
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.

317
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
It’s classically learning by doing.

318
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Now, David Kelley calls this behavior,

319
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
when it’s carried out by designers, "thinking with your hands."

320
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And it typically involves making multiple,

321
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
low-resolution prototypes very quickly,

322
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
often by bringing lots of found elements together

323
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
in order to get to a solution.

324
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
On one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck,

325
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together

326
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.

327
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Now, that became the first commercial computer mouse

328
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.

329
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So, they learned their way to that by building prototypes.

330
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Another example is a group of designers

331
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons.

332
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
They were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons

333
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
about what it was they needed with this device.

334
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And one of the designers ran out of the room

335
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister --

336
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium --

337
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and a clothespin. He taped them all together,

338
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
ran back into the room and said, "You mean, something like this?"

339
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said,

340
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
well, I want to hold it like this, or like that.

341
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And all of a sudden a productive conversation

342
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
was happening about design around a tangible object.

343
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And in the end it turned into a real device.

344
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something

345
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
into the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result.

346
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
At IDEO there’s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel

347
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
sometimes about the environment.

348
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper

349
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff --

350
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.

351
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
But the important idea is that everything’s at hand, everything’s around.

352
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
So when designers are working on ideas,

353
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
they can start building stuff whenever they want.

354
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
They don’t necessarily even have to go

355
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
into some kind of formal workshop to do it.

356
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And we think that’s pretty important.

357
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And then the sad thing is, although preschools

358
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
are full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system

359
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
it all gets taken away.

360
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
They lose this stuff that facilitates

361
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
this sort of playful and building mode of thinking.

362
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And of course, by the time you get to the average workplace,

363
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
maybe the best construction tool we have

364
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
might be the Post-it notes. It’s pretty barren.

365
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
But by giving project teams and the clients

366
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
who they’re working with permission to think with their hands,

367
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
quite complex ideas can spring into life

368
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and go right through to execution much more easily.

369
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
This is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype,

370
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
explaining what she wants out of a portable information system

371
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
to a team of technologists and designers

372
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
that are working with her in a hospital.

373
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
And just having this very simple prototype

374
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.

375
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And of course, by building quick prototypes,

376
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
we can get out and test our ideas with consumers

377
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and users much more quickly

378
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
than if we’re trying to describe them through words.

379
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
But what about designing something that isn’t physical?

380
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
Something like a service or an experience?

381
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Something that exists as a series of interactions over time?

382
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
Instead of building play, this can be approached with role-play.

383
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:58,000
So, if you’re designing an interaction between two people --

384
0:19:58.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
such as, I don’t know -- ordering food at a fast food joint

385
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
or something, you need to be able to imagine

386
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:06,000
how that experience might feel over a period of time.

387
0:20:06.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
And I think the best way to achieve that,

388
0:20:08.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out.

389
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO

390
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
trying to convince our clients of this.

391
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
They can be a little skeptical; I’ll come back to that.

392
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
But a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile

393
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems --

394
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
things like education or security or finance or health.

395
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
And this is another example in a healthcare environment

396
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:37,000
of some doctors and some nurses and designers

397
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
acting out a service scenario around patient care.

398
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:42,000
But you know, many adults

399
0:20:42.16,000 --> 0:20:45,000
are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play.

400
0:20:45.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
Some of it’s embarrassment and some of it is because

401
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:51,000
they just don’t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid.

402
0:20:51.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying,

403
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
you know, "That’s just happening because they’re acting it out."

404
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
Research into kids' behavior actually suggests

405
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously.

406
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
Because when children play a role,

407
0:21:02.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
they actually follow social scripts quite closely

408
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:07,000
that they’ve learnt from us as adults.

409
0:21:07.16,000 --> 0:21:1,000
If one kid plays "store," and another one’s playing "house,"

410
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:12,000
then the whole kind of play falls down.

411
0:21:13.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
So they get used to quite quickly

412
0:21:16.16,000 --> 0:21:2,000
to understanding the rules for social interactions,

413
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
and are actually quite quick to point out when they’re broken.

414
0:21:23.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
So when, as adults, we role-play,

415
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.

416
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:33,000
We’ve gone through lots of experiences in life,

417
0:21:33.16,000 --> 0:21:36,000
and they provide a strong intuition

418
0:21:36.16,000 --> 0:21:39,000
as to whether an interaction is going to work.

419
0:21:39.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
So we’re very good, when acting out a solution,

420
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
at spotting whether something lacks authenticity.

421
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:47,000
So role-play is actually, I think,

422
0:21:47.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.

423
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:54,000
Another way for us, as designers, to explore role-play

424
0:21:54.16,000 --> 0:21:58,000
is to put ourselves through an experience which we’re designing for,

425
0:21:58.16,000 --> 0:22:01,000
and project ourselves into an experience.

426
0:22:01.16,000 --> 0:22:03,000
So here are some designers who are trying to understand

427
0:22:03.16,000 --> 0:22:06,000
what it might feel like to sleep in a

428
0:22:06.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
confined space on an airplane.

429
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:1,000
And so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see,

430
0:22:10.16,000 --> 0:22:14,000
and did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play,

431
0:22:14.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers

432
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:21,000
if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes.

433
0:22:21.16,000 --> 0:22:23,000
This is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian,

434
0:22:23.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
and he’s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient.

435
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:29,000
Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.

436
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:31,000
One of the reasons he chose to take

437
0:22:31.16,000 --> 0:22:32,000
this rather large video camera with him was

438
0:22:32.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
because he didn’t want the doctors and nurses thinking

439
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:37,000
he was actually sick, and sticking something into him

440
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
that he was going to regret later.

441
0:22:39.16,000 --> 0:22:42,000
So anyhow, he went there with his video camera,

442
0:22:42.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.

443
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:48,000
Because when we looked at the video when he got back,

444
0:22:48.16,000 --> 0:22:5,000
we saw 20 minutes of this.

445
0:22:50.16,000 --> 0:22:53,000
(Laughter)

446
0:22:53.16,000 --> 0:22:56,000
And also, the amazing thing about this video --

447
0:22:56.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
as soon as you see it you immediately

448
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:01,000
project yourself into that experience.

449
0:23:01.16,000 --> 0:23:03,000
And you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty

450
0:23:03.16,000 --> 0:23:05,000
while you’re left out in the hallway

451
0:23:05.16,000 --> 0:23:07,000
while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case

452
0:23:07.16,000 --> 0:23:11,000
in one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck’s going on.

453
0:23:11.16,000 --> 0:23:13,000
And so this notion of using role-play --

454
0:23:13.16,000 --> 0:23:16,000
or in this case, living through the experience

455
0:23:16.16,000 --> 0:23:17,000
as a way of creating empathy --

456
0:23:17.16,000 --> 0:23:2,000
particularly when you use video, is really powerful.

457
0:23:20.16,000 --> 0:23:22,000
Or another one of our designers, Altay Sendil:

458
0:23:22.16,000 --> 0:23:25,000
he’s here having his chest waxed, not because he’s very vain,

459
0:23:25.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
although actually he is -- no, I’m kidding --

460
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:31,000
but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients

461
0:23:31.16,000 --> 0:23:33,000
go through when they’re having dressings removed.

462
0:23:33.16,000 --> 0:23:36,000
And so sometimes these analogous experiences,

463
0:23:36.16,000 --> 0:23:39,000
analogous role-play, can also be quite valuable.

464
0:23:39.16,000 --> 0:23:42,000
So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know,

465
0:23:42.16,000 --> 0:23:44,000
he’s beginning to try on that identity.

466
0:23:44.16,000 --> 0:23:47,000
He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.

467
0:23:47.16,000 --> 0:23:49,000
We’re doing the same thing as designers.

468
0:23:49.16,000 --> 0:23:51,000
We’re trying on these experiences.

469
0:23:51.16,000 --> 0:23:55,000
And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool,

470
0:23:55.16,000 --> 0:23:59,000
as well as a tool for prototyping experiences.

471
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:04,000
And you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway.

472
0:24:04.16,000 --> 0:24:07,000
Not just because they lead to insights about the experience,

473
0:24:07.16,000 --> 0:24:1,000
but also because of their willingness to explore

474
0:24:10.16,000 --> 0:24:13,000
and their ability to unselfconsciously

475
0:24:13.16,000 --> 0:24:16,000
surrender themselves to the experience.

476
0:24:16.16,000 --> 0:24:21,000
In short, we admire their willingness to play.

477
0:24:21.16,000 --> 0:24:27,000
Playful exploration, playful building and role-play:

478
0:24:27.16,000 --> 0:24:3,000
those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work.

479
0:24:30.16,000 --> 0:24:34,000
And so far, I admit, this might feel

480
0:24:34.16,000 --> 0:24:37,000
like it’s a message just to go out and play like a kid.

481
0:24:37.16,000 --> 0:24:41,000
And to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.

482
0:24:41.16,000 --> 0:24:44,000
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.

483
0:24:44.16,000 --> 0:24:49,000
Play has rules, especially when it’s group play.

484
0:24:49.16,000 --> 0:24:53,000
When kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers,

485
0:24:53.16,000 --> 0:24:56,000
they’re following a script that they’ve agreed to.

486
0:24:56.16,000 --> 0:25:,000
And it’s this code negotiation that leads to productive play.

487
0:25:01.16,000 --> 0:25:03,000
So, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning?

488
0:25:03.16,000 --> 0:25:05,000
The kind of little face, the portrait you did?

489
0:25:05.16,000 --> 0:25:09,000
Well, imagine if you did the same task with friends

490
0:25:09.16,000 --> 0:25:11,000
while you were drinking in a pub.

491
0:25:11.16,000 --> 0:25:14,000
But everybody agreed to play a game

492
0:25:14.16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks.

493
0:25:18.16,000 --> 0:25:22,000
That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing,

494
0:25:22.16,000 --> 0:25:24,000
difficult situation into a fun game.

495
0:25:24.16,000 --> 0:25:3,000
As a result, we’d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time --

496
0:25:30.16,000 --> 0:25:35,000
but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together.

497
0:25:35.16,000 --> 0:25:39,000
But there aren’t just rules about how to play;

498
0:25:39.16,000 --> 0:25:42,000
there are rules about when to play.

499
0:25:42.16,000 --> 0:25:44,000
Kids don’t play all the time, obviously.

500
0:25:44.16,000 --> 0:25:46,000
They transition in and out of it,

501
0:25:46.16,000 --> 0:25:49,000
and good teachers spend a lot of time

502
0:25:49.16,000 --> 0:25:53,000
thinking about how to move kids through these experiences.

503
0:25:53.16,000 --> 0:25:58,000
As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.

504
0:25:58.16,000 --> 0:26:,000
And if we’re running design studios

505
0:26:00.16,000 --> 0:26:02,000
we need to be able to figure out, how can we transition

506
0:26:02.16,000 --> 0:26:05,000
designers through these different experiences?

507
0:26:05.16,000 --> 0:26:08,000
I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of --

508
0:26:08.16,000 --> 0:26:11,000
I think what’s very different about design

509
0:26:11.16,000 --> 0:26:15,000
is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.

510
0:26:15.16,000 --> 0:26:2,000
We go through a sort of generative mode,

511
0:26:20.16,000 --> 0:26:21,000
where we’re exploring many ideas;

512
0:26:21.16,000 --> 0:26:23,000
and then we come back together again,

513
0:26:23.16,000 --> 0:26:26,000
and come back looking for that solution,

514
0:26:26.16,000 --> 0:26:27,000
and developing that solution.

515
0:26:27.16,000 --> 0:26:3,000
I think they’re two quite different modes:

516
0:26:30.16,000 --> 0:26:33,000
divergence and convergence.

517
0:26:33.16,000 --> 0:26:36,000
And I think it’s probably in the divergent mode

518
0:26:36.16,000 --> 0:26:38,000
that we most need playfulness.

519
0:26:38.16,000 --> 0:26:41,000
Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious.

520
0:26:41.16,000 --> 0:26:43,000
And so being able to move between those modes

521
0:26:43.16,000 --> 0:26:47,000
is really quite important. So, it’s where there’s a

522
0:26:47.16,000 --> 0:26:5,000
more nuanced version view of play, I think, is required.

523
0:26:50.16,000 --> 0:26:53,000
Because it’s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute.

524
0:26:53.16,000 --> 0:26:57,000
You’re either playful or you’re serious, and you can’t be both.

525
0:26:57.16,000 --> 0:27:02,000
But that’s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult

526
0:27:02.16,000 --> 0:27:05,000
and, at times, be playful.

527
0:27:05.16,000 --> 0:27:07,000
It’s not an either/or; it’s an "and."

528
0:27:07.16,000 --> 0:27:11,000
You can be serious and play.

529
0:27:11.16,000 --> 0:27:17,000
So to sum it up, we need trust to play,

530
0:27:17.16,000 --> 0:27:21,000
and we need trust to be creative. So, there’s a connection.

531
0:27:21.16,000 --> 0:27:24,000
And there are a series of behaviors that we’ve learnt as kids,

532
0:27:24.16,000 --> 0:27:27,000
and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers.

533
0:27:27.16,000 --> 0:27:32,000
They include exploration, which is about going for quantity;

534
0:27:32.16,000 --> 0:27:35,000
building, and thinking with your hands;

535
0:27:35.16,000 --> 0:27:39,000
and role-play, where acting it out helps us both

536
0:27:39.16,000 --> 0:27:42,000
to have more empathy for the situations in which we’re designing,

537
0:27:42.16,000 --> 0:27:45,000
and to create services and experiences

538
0:27:45.16,000 --> 0:27:49,000
that are seamless and authentic.

539
0:27:49.16,000 --> 0:27:5,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

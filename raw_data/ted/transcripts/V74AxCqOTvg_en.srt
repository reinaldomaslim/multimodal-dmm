0:00:16.064,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Ladies and gentlemen, at TED we talk a lot about leadership

2
0:00:19.092,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and how to make a movement.

3
0:00:20.697,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish,

4
0:00:23.135,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in under three minutes

5
0:00:24.403,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and dissect some lessons from it.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
First, of course you know,

7
0:00:27.642,000 --> 0:00:3,000
a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.

8
0:00:32.723,000 --> 0:00:33,000
What he's doing is so easy to follow.

9
0:00:34.545,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Here's his first follower with a crucial role;

10
0:00:36.933,000 --> 0:00:38,000
he's going to show everyone else how to follow.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.

12
0:00:41.839,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now it's not about the leader anymore;

13
0:00:43.808,000 --> 0:00:44,000
it's about them, plural.

14
0:00:45.736,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, there he is calling to his friends.

15
0:00:47.837,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, if you notice that the first follower

16
0:00:49.861,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It takes guts to stand out like that.

18
0:00:55.744,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:05.505,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And here comes a second follower.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts --

23
0:01:09.682,000 --> 0:01:11,000
three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So a movement must be public.

25
0:01:14.603,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers,

26
0:01:17.86,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now, here come two more people, and immediately after,

28
0:01:24.856,000 --> 0:01:25,000
three more people.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point.

30
0:01:28.704,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now we've got a movement.

31
0:01:30.505,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:31.911,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So, notice that, as more people join in,

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
it's less risky.

34
0:01:35.848,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So those that were sitting on the fence before

35
0:01:38.103,000 --> 0:01:39,000
now have no reason not to.

36
0:01:39.637,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They won't stand out, they won't be ridiculed,

37
0:01:43.001,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.

38
0:01:45.834,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:48.59,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So, over the next minute,

40
0:01:50.129,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd

41
0:01:52.915,000 --> 0:01:55,000
because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in.

42
0:01:56.2,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And that's how you make a movement.

43
0:01:58.201,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But let's recap some lessons from this.

44
0:02:00.916,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So first, if you are the type,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone,

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so it's clearly about the movement, not you.

48
0:02:12.734,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:13.82,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here.

50
0:02:16.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The biggest lesson, if you noticed --

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
did you catch it? --

52
0:02:19.805,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is that leadership is over-glorified.

53
0:02:22.989,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Yes, it was the shirtless guy who was first,

54
0:02:25.061,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and he'll get all the credit,

55
0:02:26.594,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but it was really the first follower

56
0:02:28.408,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that transformed the lone nut into a leader.

57
0:02:31.748,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, as we're told that we should all be leaders,

58
0:02:34.023,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that would be really ineffective.

59
0:02:35.639,000 --> 0:02:37,000
If you really care about starting a movement,

60
0:02:38.067,000 --> 0:02:41,000
have the courage to follow and show others how to follow.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And when you find a lone nut doing something great,

62
0:02:43.898,000 --> 0:02:46,000
have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in.

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And what a perfect place to do that, at TED.

64
0:02:50.027,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Thanks.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Applause)

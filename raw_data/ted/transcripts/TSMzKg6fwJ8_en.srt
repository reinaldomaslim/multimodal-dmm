1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Right when I was 15 was when I first got interested in solar energy.

2
0:00:22.049,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My family had moved from Fort Lee, New Jersey to California,

3
0:00:24.93,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from the snow to lots of heat, and gas lines.

4
0:00:27.29,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There was gas rationing in 1973.

5
0:00:29.69,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The energy crisis was in full bore.

6
0:00:31.77,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I started reading "Popular Science" magazine,

7
0:00:33.93,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I got really excited about the potential of solar energy

8
0:00:36.81,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to try and solve that crisis.

9
0:00:38.57,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I had just taken trigonometry in high school,

10
0:00:40.73,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I learned about the parabola

11
0:00:42.13,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus.

12
0:00:45.05,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That got me very excited.

13
0:00:46.65,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I really felt that there would be potential

14
0:00:48.89,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light.

15
0:00:51.61,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So, I started this company called Solar Devices.

16
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this was a company where I built parabolas,

17
0:00:56.61,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I took metal shop,

18
0:00:57.89,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and Stirling engines.

19
0:01:01.65,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I was building a Stirling engine over on the lathe,

20
0:01:04.29,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and all the motorcycle guys said, "You're building a bong, aren't you?"

21
0:01:07.65,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And I said, "No, it's a Stirling engine." But they didn't believe me.

22
0:01:10.93,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I sold the plans for this engine

23
0:01:13.01,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and for this dish in the back of "Popular Science" magazine,

24
0:01:15.89,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for four dollars each.

25
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I earned enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech.

26
0:01:20.29,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It was a really big excitement for me to get into Caltech.

27
0:01:23.05,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And at my first year at Caltech, I continued the business.

28
0:01:26.13,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But then, in the second year of Caltech, they started grading.

29
0:01:29.09,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The whole first year was pass/fail, but the second year was graded.

30
0:01:32.29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I wasn't able to keep up with the business,

31
0:01:34.37,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I ended up with a 25-year detour.

32
0:01:36.21,000 --> 0:01:39,000
My dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost,

33
0:01:39.41,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but then I had this big detour.

34
0:01:40.97,000 --> 0:01:41,000
First, the coursework at Caltech.

35
0:01:42.61,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Then, when I graduated from Caltech, the IBM PC came out,

36
0:01:45.37,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.

37
0:01:47.45,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out,

38
0:01:49.81,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and I was completely blown away by Lotus 1-2-3.

39
0:01:52.05,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I began operating my business with 1-2-3, began writing add-ins for 1-2-3,

40
0:01:56.25,000 --> 0:01:58,000
wrote a natural language interface to 1-2-3.

41
0:01:58.61,000 --> 0:02:,000
I started an educational software company after I joined Lotus,

42
0:02:01.61,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then I started Idealab so I could have a roof

43
0:02:03.97,000 --> 0:02:06,000
under which I could build multiple companies in succession.

44
0:02:07.13,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Much later -- in 2000, very recently -- the new California energy crisis --

45
0:02:11.534,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what was purported to be a big energy crisis -- was coming.

46
0:02:14.389,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I was trying to figure out

47
0:02:15.87,000 --> 0:02:17,000
if we could build something that would capitalize on that

48
0:02:18.591,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and get people backup energy, in case the crisis really came.

49
0:02:21.5,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I started looking at how we could build battery backup systems

50
0:02:24.635,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that could give people five hours, 10 hours, maybe even a full day,

51
0:02:27.83,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or three days' worth of backup power.

52
0:02:29.77,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I'm glad you heard earlier today, batteries are unbelievably --

53
0:02:32.81,000 --> 0:02:34,000
lack density compared to fuel.

54
0:02:35.81,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries.

55
0:02:38.85,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space

56
0:02:41.93,000 --> 0:02:43,000
just to give yourself four hours of battery backup.

57
0:02:44.37,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I concluded, after researching every other technology

58
0:02:47.09,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that we could deploy for storing energy --

59
0:02:49.13,000 --> 0:02:51,000
flywheels, different formulations of batteries --

60
0:02:51.49,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it just wasn't practical to store energy.

61
0:02:53.89,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So what about making energy? Maybe we could make energy.

62
0:02:56.57,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I tried to figure out -- maybe solar's become attractive.

63
0:02:59.29,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's been 25 years since I was doing this,

64
0:03:01.37,000 --> 0:03:04,000
let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells.

65
0:03:04.53,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And the price had gone down from 10 dollars a watt

66
0:03:06.93,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to about four or five dollars a watt, but it stabilized.

67
0:03:09.61,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And it needed to get much lower to be cost-effective.

68
0:03:12.13,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells,

69
0:03:15.059,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and was looking for ways we could make solar cells more inexpensively.

70
0:03:18.45,000 --> 0:03:2,000
A lot of new things are happening to do that,

71
0:03:20.85,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but fundamentally, the process requires a tremendous amount of energy.

72
0:03:24.21,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Some people say it takes more energy to make a solar cell

73
0:03:26.93,000 --> 0:03:27,000
than it will give out in its entire life.

74
0:03:28.93,000 --> 0:03:3,000
If we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells,

75
0:03:31.85,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that will become more practical.

76
0:03:33.45,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But right now, you pretty much have to take silicon,

77
0:03:35.93,000 --> 0:03:38,000
put it in an oven at 1600 F for 17 hours, to make the cells.

78
0:03:39.53,000 --> 0:03:41,000
A lot of people are working to try and reduce that,

79
0:03:41.97,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but I didn't have anything to contribute.

80
0:03:43.97,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So I tried to figure out what other way could we try

81
0:03:46.45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to make cost-effective solar electricity.

82
0:03:48.65,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What if we collect the sun with a large reflector --

83
0:03:51.13,000 --> 0:03:53,000
like I had been thinking about in high school,

84
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper --

85
0:03:56.17,000 --> 0:03:58,000
concentrate it to a small converter,

86
0:03:58.25,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive,

87
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because it's much smaller, rather than solar cells,

88
0:04:03.81,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from.

89
0:04:07.25,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This seemed practical now,

90
0:04:08.53,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because a lot of new technologies had come in the 25 years

91
0:04:11.29,000 --> 0:04:12,000
since I had last looked at it.

92
0:04:12.77,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There was a lot of new manufacturing techniques,

93
0:04:15.05,000 --> 0:04:17,000
not to mention really cheap miniature motors --

94
0:04:17.29,000 --> 0:04:19,000
brushless motors, servomotors, stepper motors,

95
0:04:19.49,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that are used in printers and scanners.

96
0:04:21.41,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So, that's a breakthrough.

97
0:04:22.69,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Of course, inexpensive microprocessors

98
0:04:24.57,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and a very important breakthrough -- genetic algorithms.

99
0:04:27.49,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.

100
0:04:29.49,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection.

101
0:04:33.09,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer,

102
0:04:36.53,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing,

103
0:04:39.729,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you add sex --

104
0:04:40.97,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where you take half of one solution and half of another

105
0:04:43.61,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and then make new mutations --

106
0:04:45.09,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and you use natural selection to kill off not-as-good solutions.

107
0:04:48.17,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Usually, with a genetic algorithm on a computer today,

108
0:04:50.77,000 --> 0:04:51,000
with a three gigahertz processor,

109
0:04:52.53,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you can solve many formerly intractable problems

110
0:04:55.283,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in just a matter of minutes.

111
0:04:56.81,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms

112
0:04:59.89,000 --> 0:05:,000
to create a new type of concentrator.

113
0:05:01.73,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I'll show you what we came up with.

114
0:05:03.65,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Traditionally, concentrators look like this.

115
0:05:05.77,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Those shapes are parabolas.

116
0:05:07.13,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot.

117
0:05:10.53,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They have to track the sun,

118
0:05:11.85,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because they have to point directly at the sun.

119
0:05:14.09,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They usually have a one degree acceptance angle --

120
0:05:16.49,000 --> 0:05:17,000
once they're more than a degree off,

121
0:05:18.25,000 --> 0:05:2,000
none of the sunlight rays will hit the focus.

122
0:05:20.41,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So we tried to come up with a non-tracking collector

123
0:05:22.89,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that would gather much more than one degree of light, with no moving parts.

124
0:05:26.45,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So we created a genetic algorithm to try this out,

125
0:05:28.85,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we made a model in Excel of a multisurface reflector,

126
0:05:31.45,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and an amazing thing evolved, literally,

127
0:05:33.53,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from trying a billion cycles, a billion different attempts,

128
0:05:36.37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light,

129
0:05:39.81,000 --> 0:05:41,000
from the most angles, over a day, from the sun.

130
0:05:42.05,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And this is the shape that evolved.

131
0:05:43.77,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It's this non-tracking collector with these six tuba-like horns,

132
0:05:47.45,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and each of them collect light in the following way --

133
0:05:50.01,000 --> 0:05:51,000
if the sunlight strikes right here,

134
0:05:51.73,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it might bounce right to the center, the hot spot, directly,

135
0:05:54.61,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but if the sun is off axis and comes from the side,

136
0:05:57.05,000 --> 0:05:59,000
it might hit two places and take two bounces.

137
0:05:59.49,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So for direct light, it takes only one bounce,

138
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
for off-axis light it might take two,

139
0:06:04.25,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and for extreme off-axis, it might take three.

140
0:06:06.77,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Your efficiency goes down with more bounces,

141
0:06:08.89,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce,

142
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25-degree angle.

143
0:06:15.21,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So, about two and a half hours of the day

144
0:06:17.41,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we could collect with a stationary component.

145
0:06:19.77,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though.

146
0:06:22.57,000 --> 0:06:24,000
On an average adjusted day, a solar cell --

147
0:06:24.85,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because the sun's moving across the sky,

148
0:06:26.81,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance

149
0:06:30.09,000 --> 0:06:31,000
at the off-axis angles.

150
0:06:31.37,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day.

151
0:06:34.53,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So even this, although it was great with no moving parts --

152
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we could achieve high temperatures -- wasn't enough.

153
0:06:39.81,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We needed to beat solar cells.

154
0:06:41.29,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So we took a look at another idea.

155
0:06:42.97,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track.

156
0:06:46.852,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So what you see here is 12 separate petals

157
0:06:49.25,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors

158
0:06:52.17,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that would only cost a dollar.

159
0:06:53.65,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You can buy a two-megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now.

160
0:06:56.69,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out

161
0:06:59.89,000 --> 0:07:,000
because they have no brushes,

162
0:07:01.53,000 --> 0:07:02,000
for a dollar.

163
0:07:02.77,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So we can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars

164
0:07:06.45,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more,

165
0:07:09.97,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but only move the petals.

166
0:07:11.25,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The whole system would have a much lower profile,

167
0:07:13.61,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day.

168
0:07:17.13,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now that we have concentrated sunlight,

169
0:07:19.05,000 --> 0:07:22,000
what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity?

170
0:07:22.57,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So we tried to look at all the different heat engines

171
0:07:25.09,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that have been used in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity,

172
0:07:29.93,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And one of the great ones of all time,

173
0:07:31.81,000 --> 0:07:34,000
James Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major breakthrough.

174
0:07:35.01,000 --> 0:07:38,000
James Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine, he just refined it.

175
0:07:38.37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But his refinements were incredible.

176
0:07:40.13,000 --> 0:07:42,000
He added new linear motion guides to the pistons,

177
0:07:42.49,000 --> 0:07:44,000
he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder,

178
0:07:45.37,000 --> 0:07:47,000
he made the engine double-acting, so it had double the power.

179
0:07:48.29,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Those were major breakthroughs. All of the improvements he made --

180
0:07:51.45,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and it's justifiable that our measure of energy, the watt,

181
0:07:54.89,000 --> 0:07:55,000
today is named after him.

182
0:07:56.45,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So we looked at this engine, and this had some potential.

183
0:07:59.17,000 --> 0:08:,000
Steam engines are dangerous,

184
0:08:00.57,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and they had tremendous impact on the world --

185
0:08:02.77,000 --> 0:08:04,000
industrial revolution and ships and locomotives.

186
0:08:05.05,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But they're usually good to be large,

187
0:08:06.89,000 --> 0:08:08,000
so they're not good for distributed power generation.

188
0:08:09.41,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They're also very high-pressure, so they're dangerous.

189
0:08:11.97,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Another type of engine is the hot air engine.

190
0:08:14.57,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling,

191
0:08:17.65,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.

192
0:08:20.73,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This engine, because it was so interesting --

193
0:08:22.89,000 --> 0:08:23,000
it only worked on air, no steam --

194
0:08:24.57,000 --> 0:08:26,000
has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years

195
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that use the Stirling engine principle.

196
0:08:29.69,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along,

197
0:08:31.93,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine,

198
0:08:34.69,000 --> 0:08:35,000
he just refined it.

199
0:08:35.93,000 --> 0:08:37,000
He showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement

200
0:08:38.85,000 --> 0:08:4,000
because it brought the power density of the engine way up.

201
0:08:41.61,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space,

202
0:08:44.37,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications.

203
0:08:47.37,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So, once you have mobility,

204
0:08:48.85,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units,

205
0:08:51.93,000 --> 0:08:53,000
as opposed to steam ships or big factories,

206
0:08:53.954,000 --> 0:08:56,000
so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production

207
0:08:57.249,000 --> 0:08:58,000
where all the other engines didn't.

208
0:08:58.97,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So, because it went into mass production,

209
0:09:00.947,000 --> 0:09:02,000
costs were reduced, 100 years of refinement,

210
0:09:03.53,000 --> 0:09:05,000
emissions were reduced, tremendous production value.

211
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There have been hundreds of millions of internal combustion engines built,

212
0:09:09.85,000 --> 0:09:11,000
compared to thousands of Stirling engines built.

213
0:09:12.13,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore,

214
0:09:15.13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
only large ones for big operations.

215
0:09:16.85,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So after looking at these three, and 47 others,

216
0:09:19.53,000 --> 0:09:22,000
we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use.

217
0:09:22.73,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works.

218
0:09:26.65,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So we tried to look at the Stirling engine in a new way,

219
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because it was practical --

220
0:09:31.89,000 --> 0:09:33,000
weight no longer mattered for our application.

221
0:09:34.17,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered,

222
0:09:37.29,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because you were moving around.

223
0:09:38.85,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place

224
0:09:41.85,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the weight doesn't matter so much.

225
0:09:43.53,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We also discovered that efficiency doesn't matter so much

226
0:09:46.229,000 --> 0:09:47,000
if your energy source is free.

227
0:09:47.71,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Normally, efficiency is crucial

228
0:09:49.231,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because the fuel cost of your engine over its life

229
0:09:52.191,000 --> 0:09:53,000
dwarfs the cost of the engine.

230
0:09:53.89,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But if your fuel source is free,

231
0:09:55.49,000 --> 0:09:56,000
then the only thing that matters

232
0:09:57.09,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is the up-front capital cost of the engine.

233
0:09:59.13,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So you don't want to optimize for efficiency,

234
0:10:01.29,000 --> 0:10:03,000
you want to optimize for power per dollar.

235
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So using that new twist, with the new criteria,

236
0:10:05.57,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we thought we could relook at the Stirling engine,

237
0:10:07.97,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and also bring genetic algorithms in.

238
0:10:09.81,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Basically, Robert Stirling didn't have Gordon Moore before him

239
0:10:12.77,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to get us three gigahertz of processor power.

240
0:10:14.93,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So we took the same genetic algorithm

241
0:10:16.751,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that we used earlier to make that concentrator,

242
0:10:18.992,000 --> 0:10:19,000
which didn't work out for us,

243
0:10:20.468,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to optimize the Stirling engine,

244
0:10:22.05,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions

245
0:10:25.29,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar,

246
0:10:28.41,000 --> 0:10:3,000
irrespective of weight, irrespective of size,

247
0:10:30.57,000 --> 0:10:32,000
just to get the most conversion of solar energy,

248
0:10:32.85,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because the sun is free.

249
0:10:34.09,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And that's the process we took -- let me show you how the engine works.

250
0:10:37.45,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The simplest heat engine, or hot air engine, of all time

251
0:10:40.13,000 --> 0:10:43,000
would be this -- take a box, a steel canister, with a piston.

252
0:10:43.37,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.

253
0:10:45.69,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Take it off the flame and pour water on it, or let it cool down,

254
0:10:48.73,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the piston moves down.

255
0:10:49.97,000 --> 0:10:5,000
That's a heat engine.

256
0:10:51.21,000 --> 0:10:53,000
That's the most fundamental heat engine you could have.

257
0:10:53.85,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent,

258
0:10:56.93,000 --> 0:10:58,000
because you're heating all the metal of the chamber

259
0:10:59.37,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time.

260
0:11:02.05,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And you're only getting power from the air that's heating at the same time,

261
0:11:05.61,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but you're wasting energy heating and cooling the metal.

262
0:11:08.29,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So someone came up with a very clever idea.

263
0:11:10.37,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Instead of heating and cooling the whole cylinder,

264
0:11:12.77,000 --> 0:11:14,000
what about if you put a displacer inside --

265
0:11:14.81,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth.

266
0:11:17.29,000 --> 0:11:19,000
You move that up and down with a little bit of energy

267
0:11:19.81,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end.

268
0:11:23.61,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So, now you're not alternately heating and cooling the metal, just the air.

269
0:11:27.81,000 --> 0:11:28,000
That allows you to get the efficiency up

270
0:11:29.77,000 --> 0:11:31,000
from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent.

271
0:11:32.21,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And then Robert Stirling came along with this genius idea,

272
0:11:34.97,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which was, well, I'm still not heating the metal now,

273
0:11:37.49,000 --> 0:11:38,000
with this kind of engine,

274
0:11:38.73,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but I'm still reheating all the air.

275
0:11:40.49,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time.

276
0:11:43.73,000 --> 0:11:45,000
What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle,

277
0:11:46.37,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold?

278
0:11:50.29,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So he made fine wires, and cracked glass,

279
0:11:52.97,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge.

280
0:11:55.69,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end,

281
0:11:58.77,000 --> 0:12:,000
it puts some heat into the sponge.

282
0:12:00.97,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And then when the air comes back after it's been cooled,

283
0:12:03.65,000 --> 0:12:04,000
it picks up that heat again.

284
0:12:05.05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So you're reusing your energy five or six times,

285
0:12:08.09,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and that brings the efficiency up to between 30 and 40 percent.

286
0:12:11.09,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's a little known, but brilliant, genius invention of Robert Stirling

287
0:12:14.45,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical --

288
0:12:17.49,000 --> 0:12:2,000
like I found out when I made the real simple version in high school --

289
0:12:20.85,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to very potentially possible,

290
0:12:22.29,000 --> 0:12:23,000
once you get the efficiency up,

291
0:12:23.85,000 --> 0:12:25,000
if you can design this to be low enough cost.

292
0:12:26.01,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible.

293
0:12:29.45,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We built a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine works.

294
0:12:32.61,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We applied the genetic algorithm.

295
0:12:34.25,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We got the results from that for the optimal engine.

296
0:12:36.73,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We built engines --

297
0:12:37.97,000 --> 0:12:39,000
so we built 100 different engines over the last two years.

298
0:12:40.73,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We measured each one, we readjusted the model to what we measured,

299
0:12:43.89,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and then we led that to the current prototype.

300
0:12:46.09,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It led to a very compact, inexpensive engine,

301
0:12:48.25,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and this is what the engine looks like.

302
0:12:50.17,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Let me show you what it looks like in real life.

303
0:12:53.77,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So this is the engine. It's just a small cylinder down here,

304
0:12:57.49,000 --> 0:12:59,000
which holds the generator inside and all the linkage,

305
0:13:00.21,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and it's the hot cap -- the hot cylinder on the top --

306
0:13:03.57,000 --> 0:13:05,000
this part gets hot, this part is cool,

307
0:13:05.85,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and electricity comes out.

308
0:13:07.81,000 --> 0:13:08,000
The exact converse is also true.

309
0:13:09.69,000 --> 0:13:12,000
If you put electricity in, this will get hot and this will get cold,

310
0:13:13.09,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you get refrigeration.

311
0:13:14.41,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So it's a complete reversible cycle,

312
0:13:16.25,000 --> 0:13:18,000
a very efficient cycle, and quite a simple thing to make.

313
0:13:19.25,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So now you put the two things together.

314
0:13:21.17,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So you have the engine.

315
0:13:22.41,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What if you combine the petals and the engine in the center?

316
0:13:25.29,000 --> 0:13:27,000
The petals track and the engine gets the concentrated sunlight,

317
0:13:28.29,000 --> 0:13:3,000
takes that heat and turns it into electricity.

318
0:13:30.49,000 --> 0:13:32,000
This is what the first prototype of our system looked like

319
0:13:33.25,000 --> 0:13:35,000
with the petals and the engine in the center.

320
0:13:35.41,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This is being run out in the sun,

321
0:13:37.05,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like.

322
0:13:45.61,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Applause)

323
0:13:50.97,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Thank you.

324
0:13:52.21,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So this is a unit with the 12 petals.

325
0:13:54.89,000 --> 0:13:55,000
These petals cost about a dollar each --

326
0:13:56.85,000 --> 0:13:58,000
they're lightweight, injection-molded plastic, aluminized.

327
0:13:59.61,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The mechanism to control each petal is below there,

328
0:14:02.297,000 --> 0:14:04,000
with a microprocessor on each one.

329
0:14:04.37,000 --> 0:14:05,000
There are thermocouples on the engine --

330
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them.

331
0:14:09.53,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.

332
0:14:13.41,000 --> 0:14:16,000
When the sun comes out in the morning, the petals will seek the sun,

333
0:14:16.65,000 --> 0:14:18,000
find it by searching for the highest temperature.

334
0:14:19.01,000 --> 0:14:22,000
About a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap

335
0:14:22.97,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the engine will be warm enough to start

336
0:14:24.89,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and then the engine will generate electricity

337
0:14:27.05,000 --> 0:14:28,000
for about six and a half hours a day --

338
0:14:28.97,000 --> 0:14:3,000
six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky.

339
0:14:31.93,000 --> 0:14:33,000
A critical part that we can take advantage of

340
0:14:34.09,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is that we have these inexpensive microprocessors

341
0:14:36.45,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and each of these petals is autonomous,

342
0:14:38.37,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and each of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user setup.

343
0:14:41.85,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So you don't have to tell what latitude, longitude you're at,

344
0:14:44.77,000 --> 0:14:46,000
what your roof slope angle is, or what orientation.

345
0:14:47.21,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It doesn't really care.

346
0:14:48.49,000 --> 0:14:5,000
What it does is it searches to find the hottest spot,

347
0:14:51.09,000 --> 0:14:54,000
it searches again a half an hour later, a day later, a month later.

348
0:14:55.05,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It basically figures out where on Earth you are

349
0:14:57.29,000 --> 0:14:58,000
by watching the direction the sun moves,

350
0:14:59.25,000 --> 0:15:01,000
so you don't have to actually enter anything about that.

351
0:15:01.93,000 --> 0:15:02,000
The way the unit works is,

352
0:15:03.25,000 --> 0:15:05,000
when the sun comes out, the engine will start

353
0:15:05.57,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and you get power out here.

354
0:15:07.13,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC,

355
0:15:10.85,000 --> 0:15:12,000
so that could be used for certain applications.

356
0:15:13.09,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We have an inverter in there, so you get 117 volts AC.

357
0:15:15.69,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And you also get hot water. The hot water's optional.

358
0:15:18.29,000 --> 0:15:2,000
You don't have to use it, it will cool itself.

359
0:15:20.57,000 --> 0:15:22,000
But you can use it to optionally heat hot water

360
0:15:22.81,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and that brings the efficiency up even higher

361
0:15:24.97,000 --> 0:15:26,000
because some of the heat that you'd normally be rejecting,

362
0:15:27.73,000 --> 0:15:3,000
you can now use as useful energy, whether it's for a pool or hot water.

363
0:15:31.13,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running.

364
0:15:39.41,000 --> 0:15:41,000
This is the first test where we took it outside

365
0:15:41.65,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and each of the petals were individually seeking.

366
0:15:44.01,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And what they do is step, very coarsely at first,

367
0:15:46.41,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and very finely afterward.

368
0:15:47.69,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple

369
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
indicating they found the sun,

370
0:15:51.81,000 --> 0:15:52,000
they slow down and do a fine search.

371
0:15:53.57,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Then the petals will move into position, and the engine will start.

372
0:15:56.77,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We've been working on this for the last two years.

373
0:15:59.17,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We're very excited about the progress, we have a long way to go though.

374
0:16:02.57,000 --> 0:16:05,000
This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation:

375
0:16:05.85,000 --> 0:16:07,000
you'd probably have more than one unit on your roof.

376
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
It could be on your roof, your backyard, or somewhere else.

377
0:16:11.17,000 --> 0:16:13,000
You don't have to have enough units to power your entire house,

378
0:16:14.17,000 --> 0:16:16,000
you just save money with each incremental one you add.

379
0:16:16.73,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So you're still using the grid potentially,

380
0:16:18.85,000 --> 0:16:2,000
in this type of application, to be your backup supply --

381
0:16:21.53,000 --> 0:16:24,000
of course, you can't use these at night, and you can't use these on cloudy days.

382
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But by reducing your energy use, pretty much at the peak times --

383
0:16:28.77,000 --> 0:16:3,000
usually when you have your air conditioning on,

384
0:16:31.01,000 --> 0:16:32,000
or other times like that --

385
0:16:32.37,000 --> 0:16:34,000
this generates the peak power at the peak usage time,

386
0:16:34.89,000 --> 0:16:35,000
so it's very complementary in that sense.

387
0:16:36.89,000 --> 0:16:38,000
This is how we would envision a residential application.

388
0:16:39.57,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We also think there's very big potential for energy farms,

389
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun.

390
0:16:45.45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
It's a really good combination of those two factors.

391
0:16:47.93,000 --> 0:16:5,000
It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world, obviously,

392
0:16:51.49,000 --> 0:16:52,000
but in special places

393
0:16:52.77,000 --> 0:16:54,000
where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these

394
0:16:55.65,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and also in many more places where there is high wind power.

395
0:16:58.53,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So an example of that is, here's the map of the United States.

396
0:17:01.93,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Pretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is a really ideal place,

397
0:17:05.37,000 --> 0:17:07,000
but even the green or blue areas are good,

398
0:17:07.41,000 --> 0:17:09,000
just not as good as the places that are red, orange and yellow.

399
0:17:10.41,000 --> 0:17:13,000
But the hot spot right around Las Vegas and Death Valley is very good.

400
0:17:13.77,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And is only affects the payback period,

401
0:17:15.874,000 --> 0:17:17,000
it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy;

402
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
you could use it anywhere on Earth.

403
0:17:20.05,000 --> 0:17:21,000
It just affects the payback period

404
0:17:21.73,000 --> 0:17:23,000
if you're comparing to grid-supplied electricity.

405
0:17:24.09,000 --> 0:17:26,000
But if you don't have grid-supplied electricity,

406
0:17:26.369,000 --> 0:17:28,000
then the question of payback is a different one entirely.

407
0:17:29.09,000 --> 0:17:31,000
It's just how many watts do you get per dollar,

408
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and how could you benefit from that to change your life in some way.

409
0:17:34.57,000 --> 0:17:36,000
This is the map of the whole Earth,

410
0:17:36.68,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and you can see a huge swathe in the middle

411
0:17:38.761,000 --> 0:17:39,000
where a large part of the population is,

412
0:17:40.723,000 --> 0:17:42,000
there's tremendous chances for solar energy.

413
0:17:43.3,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And of course, look at Africa.

414
0:17:44.781,000 --> 0:17:47,000
The potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable,

415
0:17:48.102,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that.

416
0:17:51.783,000 --> 0:17:54,000
So, in conclusion, I would say my journey has shown me

417
0:17:55.529,000 --> 0:17:58,000
that you can revisit old ideas in a new light,

418
0:17:58.85,000 --> 0:18:,000
and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past

419
0:18:01.57,000 --> 0:18:04,000
can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists.

420
0:18:05.13,000 --> 0:18:08,000
We believe we're getting very close to something practical and affordable.

421
0:18:08.65,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Our short-term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells

422
0:18:11.85,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and our longer-term goal is to be less than a five-year payback.

423
0:18:14.93,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And at less than a five-year payback, this becomes very economic.

424
0:18:18.09,000 --> 0:18:21,000
So you don't have to just have a feel-good attitude about energy

425
0:18:21.17,000 --> 0:18:22,000
to want to have one of these.

426
0:18:22.61,000 --> 0:18:23,000
It just makes economic sense.

427
0:18:24.05,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Right now, solar paybacks are between 30 and 50 years.

428
0:18:26.65,000 --> 0:18:27,000
If you get it down below five years,

429
0:18:28.41,000 --> 0:18:3,000
then it's almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it --

430
0:18:31.41,000 --> 0:18:34,000
someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one.

431
0:18:35.13,000 --> 0:18:36,000
So that's our real powerful goal

432
0:18:36.73,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that we're really shooting for in the company.

433
0:18:38.93,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Two other things that I learned that were very surprising to me --

434
0:18:42.09,000 --> 0:18:45,000
one was how casual we are about energy.

435
0:18:47.29,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I was walking from the elevator over here,

436
0:18:49.69,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and even just looking at the stage right now --

437
0:18:51.93,000 --> 0:18:54,000
so there's probably 20,500-watt lights right now.

438
0:18:55.49,000 --> 0:18:57,000
There's 10,000 watts of light pouring on the stage,

439
0:18:57.93,000 --> 0:19:,000
one horsepower is 746 watts, at full power.

440
0:19:01.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
So there's basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit.

441
0:19:06.09,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Not to mention the 200 horses that are probably running right now

442
0:19:09.21,000 --> 0:19:1,000
to keep the air-conditioning going.

443
0:19:10.93,000 --> 0:19:11,000
And it's just amazing,

444
0:19:12.17,000 --> 0:19:14,000
walk in the elevator, and there's lights on in the elevator.

445
0:19:15.05,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Of course, now I'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake.

446
0:19:18.89,000 --> 0:19:2,000
But, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy

447
0:19:21.73,000 --> 0:19:22,000
because it's so cheap.

448
0:19:23.01,000 --> 0:19:25,000
And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy

449
0:19:25.57,000 --> 0:19:26,000
that's been concentrated by the sun.

450
0:19:27.33,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Basically, oil is solar-energy concentrate.

451
0:19:30.21,000 --> 0:19:33,000
It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy

452
0:19:33.57,000 --> 0:19:35,000
to make it have all that energy contained in it.

453
0:19:35.85,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And we don't have a birthright

454
0:19:37.33,000 --> 0:19:39,000
to just use that up as fast as we are, I think.

455
0:19:39.57,000 --> 0:19:42,000
And it would be great if we could make our energy usage renewable,

456
0:19:42.77,000 --> 0:19:45,000
where as we're using the energy, we're creating it at the same pace,

457
0:19:46.01,000 --> 0:19:47,000
and I really hope we can get there.

458
0:19:47.73,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Thank you very much, you've been a great audience.

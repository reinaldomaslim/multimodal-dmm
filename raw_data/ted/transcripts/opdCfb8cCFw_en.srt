0:00:13.583,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Aquay Wunne Kesuk. Kelsey Leonard Nooweesuonk.

2
0:00:17.575,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hello, good day, everyone.

3
0:00:19.59,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm from the Shinnecock Nation.

4
0:00:22.359,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Tabutni to the Cahuilla peoples,

5
0:00:24.931,000 --> 0:00:26,000
whose land we gather on today.

6
0:00:28.374,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was taught that water is alive.

7
0:00:31.656,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It can hear,

8
0:00:33.376,000 --> 0:00:34,000
it holds memories.

9
0:00:35.343,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And so I brought a water vessel up with me today,

10
0:00:38.448,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because I want it to hold the memories of our conversation today.

11
0:00:43.876,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Who gets legal rights?

12
0:00:47.273,000 --> 0:00:51,000
History has shown us some people but not others.

13
0:00:51.806,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In the United States, Indigenous peoples like myself

14
0:00:55.569,000 --> 0:00:58,000
were not citizens under the law until 1924.

15
0:00:59.85,000 --> 0:01:01,000
My Shinnecock ancestors, pictured here,

16
0:01:02.493,000 --> 0:01:04,000
were not citizens under the law.

17
0:01:05.573,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Then why do we claim to be nations governed by the rule of law

18
0:01:11.755,000 --> 0:01:15,000
if some people are protected, but not others?

19
0:01:16.042,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Because it remains one of the best ways to fight injustice.

20
0:01:21.47,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And, as Indigenous people, we know injustice.

21
0:01:26.809,000 --> 0:01:31,000
A dear friend, mentor, water walker,

22
0:01:32.071,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Nokomis, Grandmother Josephine Mandamin-ba,

23
0:01:35.199,000 --> 0:01:38,000
she told me of a prophecy that comes from her people,

24
0:01:38.946,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the Anishinaabe of the Midewiwin Society.

25
0:01:42.444,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And in that prophecy,

26
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
she told me that it tells of a day that will come

27
0:01:47.311,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where an ounce of water costs more than an ounce of gold.

28
0:01:52.767,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When she told me that prophecy, I sat for a moment,

29
0:01:57.465,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I thought about all of the injustices we see in our world today,

30
0:02:03.251,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the water crises we see in our world today,

31
0:02:07.168,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and I said, "Nokomis, Grandmother,

32
0:02:09.655,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I feel like we are already in that time of prophecy."

33
0:02:14.281,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And she looked back at me directly,

34
0:02:16.131,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and she said,

35
0:02:17.455,000 --> 0:02:19,000
"So what are you going to do about it?"

36
0:02:20.208,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That's why I'm here with you today,

37
0:02:22.679,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because I believe that one of the many solutions

38
0:02:26.005,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to solving the many water injustices we see in our world today

39
0:02:29.918,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is recognizing that water is a living relation

40
0:02:33.229,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and granting it the legal personhood it deserves.

41
0:02:37.319,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So to do so, we need to transform the way in which we value water.

42
0:02:43.268,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We have to start to think about how do we connect to water.

43
0:02:48.085,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Usually, someone might ask you,

44
0:02:50.221,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"What is water?"

45
0:02:51.955,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and you would respond with "Rain, ocean, lake, river,

46
0:02:57.794,000 --> 0:02:59,000
H20, liquid."

47
0:02:59.987,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You might even understand the sacred essentiality of water

48
0:03:04.318,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and say that water is life.

49
0:03:08.268,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But what if I asked you, instead,

50
0:03:10.755,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"Who is water?"

51
0:03:13.241,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In the same way that I might ask you, "Who is your grandmother?"

52
0:03:17.297,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"Who is your sister?"

53
0:03:20.04,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That type of orientation

54
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
fundamentally transforms the way in which we think about water,

55
0:03:25.493,000 --> 0:03:27,000
transforms the way in which we make decisions

56
0:03:27.684,000 --> 0:03:29,000
about how we might protect water,

57
0:03:29.795,000 --> 0:03:31,000
protect it in the way that you would protect your grandmother,

58
0:03:32.725,000 --> 0:03:34,000
your mother, your sister, your aunties.

59
0:03:35.974,000 --> 0:03:36,000
That is the type of transformation

60
0:03:37.641,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that we need if we are going to address the many water crises we see

61
0:03:41.489,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in our world today,

62
0:03:42.767,000 --> 0:03:44,000
these harrowing water crises

63
0:03:44.974,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that have streamed across our digital devices

64
0:03:47.146,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in countdowns to Day Zero,

65
0:03:49.459,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the point at which municipal water supplies are shut off.

66
0:03:53.636,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Places like Cape Town, South Africa,

67
0:03:56.039,000 --> 0:03:57,000
where in 2018,

68
0:03:57.839,000 --> 0:03:59,000
residents were limited to two-minute showers

69
0:04:00.776,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and 23 gallons of water per day per person,

70
0:04:04.488,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or just this past summer, where the mismanagement of water

71
0:04:08.011,000 --> 0:04:09,000
led the streets of Chennai

72
0:04:09.71,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to be lined with thousands of plastic water jugs

73
0:04:13.774,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as residents waited hours for water tankers

74
0:04:17.541,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to deliver water, first by rail, then by truck,

75
0:04:21.002,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to meet their daily needs.

76
0:04:23.113,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Or even here in the United States,

77
0:04:25.947,000 --> 0:04:27,000
one of the most developed nations in the world.

78
0:04:28.493,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Today, Flint, Michigan still does not have clean water.

79
0:04:32.982,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But you are likely unfamiliar with these water crises,

80
0:04:37.023,000 --> 0:04:4,000
such as Neskantaga First Nation in Northern Ontario, Canada,

81
0:04:40.35,000 --> 0:04:44,000
where residents have been on a boil water advisory since 1995.

82
0:04:45.309,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Or Grassy Narrows First Nation,

83
0:04:47.207,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which for decades has been dealing with water contamination

84
0:04:50.643,000 --> 0:04:51,000
from the paper mill industry

85
0:04:52.159,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and where a recent study found

86
0:04:53.763,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that nearly 90 percent of the Indigenous population

87
0:04:56.842,000 --> 0:04:58,000
has some form of mercury poisoning,

88
0:04:59.064,000 --> 0:05:01,000
causing severe health complications.

89
0:05:01.745,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Or even among the Navajo Nation.

90
0:05:04.287,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Pictured here is the Animas River on an early morning in 2015,

91
0:05:08.953,000 --> 0:05:1,000
prior to the Gold King Mine spill.

92
0:05:11.678,000 --> 0:05:14,000
After the spill leaked millions of hazardous mine waste

93
0:05:15.592,000 --> 0:05:16,000
into the river system,

94
0:05:17.044,000 --> 0:05:18,000
this was it later that day.

95
0:05:19.586,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Today, the Navajo Nation and the Diné People

96
0:05:22.432,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and the river itself are still trying to recover from contamination.

97
0:05:27.673,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Or even right here in Palm Springs, California,

98
0:05:31.404,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians

99
0:05:33.761,000 --> 0:05:37,000
has been fighting for decades to protect groundwater from exploitation

100
0:05:38.023,000 --> 0:05:39,000
so that future generations

101
0:05:39.817,000 --> 0:05:42,000
can not only live but thrive in their homelands,

102
0:05:43.206,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as they have since time immemorial.

103
0:05:46.202,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You see, a recent study by DIGDEEP and the US Water Alliance

104
0:05:50.393,000 --> 0:05:53,000
found that race, in the United States,

105
0:05:53.768,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is the strongest predictor of water and sanitation access,

106
0:05:57.483,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and that for us,

107
0:05:58.658,000 --> 0:05:59,000
as Native American people,

108
0:06:00.372,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we are the group most likely to have access issues

109
0:06:04.733,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as it comes to water and sanitation.

110
0:06:07.711,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So, as an Indigenous legal scholar and scientist,

111
0:06:11.645,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I believe that many of these water injustices

112
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
are the result of the Western legal system's failure to recognize

113
0:06:18.138,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the legal personhood of water.

114
0:06:20.567,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And so we must ask ourselves --

115
0:06:23.245,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who is justice for?

116
0:06:26.249,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Humanity alone?

117
0:06:28.824,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We've granted legal personhood to corporations.

118
0:06:31.674,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In the US, the Supreme Court found in "Citizens United"

119
0:06:34.896,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that a corporation was a person

120
0:06:36.606,000 --> 0:06:38,000
with similar protections under the Constitution,

121
0:06:39.098,000 --> 0:06:4,000
such as freedom of speech,

122
0:06:40.956,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and applied similar reasoning in "Hobby Lobby,"

123
0:06:43.647,000 --> 0:06:46,000
finding that a corporation had the right to freedom of religion

124
0:06:46.877,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in defense against the implementation of the Affordable Care Act

125
0:06:50.044,000 --> 0:06:51,000
for its employees.

126
0:06:52.004,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now, these are controversial cases,

127
0:06:55.025,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and as a Shinnecock woman and a legal scholar,

128
0:06:58.552,000 --> 0:07:01,000
they make me question the moral compass of the Western world,

129
0:07:02.434,000 --> 0:07:06,000
where you can grant legal personhood to a corporation

130
0:07:06.514,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but not nature.

131
0:07:08.037,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You see, legal personhood grants us the ability

132
0:07:11.189,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to be visible in a court of law,

133
0:07:13.692,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and to have our voices heard as a person protected under the law.

134
0:07:17.893,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And so if you can grant that to a corporation,

135
0:07:22.194,000 --> 0:07:24,000
why not the Great Lakes?

136
0:07:25.17,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Why not the Mississippi River?

137
0:07:28.172,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Why not the many waterways across our planet

138
0:07:32.791,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that we all depend on to survive?

139
0:07:37.83,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We know we are in a global climate crisis,

140
0:07:41.451,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but globally, our waters are also threatened,

141
0:07:45.039,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and we are facing a global water crisis,

142
0:07:48.303,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and if we want to address these crises in our lifetime,

143
0:07:51.581,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we need to change.

144
0:07:53.319,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We need to fundamentally transform the way in which we value water.

145
0:07:58.589,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And this is not something new for us as Indigenous peoples.

146
0:08:02.678,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Our Indigenous legal systems have a foundational principle

147
0:08:06.836,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of understanding our nonhuman relations

148
0:08:09.615,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as being living and protected under our laws.

149
0:08:13.361,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And even for the Western world,

150
0:08:15.4,000 --> 0:08:16,000
environmental legal theorists

151
0:08:17.091,000 --> 0:08:2,000
have argued for the rights of nature since the 1970s.

152
0:08:21.284,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But we need to do better.

153
0:08:22.983,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We need to change.

154
0:08:24.996,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And we need to grant legal personhood to water,

155
0:08:27.579,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because it affords the following rights and protections.

156
0:08:30.326,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It grants water the right to exist,

157
0:08:33.23,000 --> 0:08:35,000
flourish, and naturally evolve,

158
0:08:35.379,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and most of all, it protects the water from us,

159
0:08:37.896,000 --> 0:08:39,000
from human beings that would do it harm,

160
0:08:40.57,000 --> 0:08:42,000
from human-caused climate-change impacts,

161
0:08:42.738,000 --> 0:08:43,000
from pollutants,

162
0:08:43.913,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and from man-made contamination.

163
0:08:46.403,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Moreover, it reverses the accepted hierarchy

164
0:08:50.27,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of humanity's domination over nature.

165
0:08:53.744,000 --> 0:08:54,000
As human beings on this planet,

166
0:08:55.332,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we are not superior to other beings on this planet.

167
0:09:00.222,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We are not superior to the water itself.

168
0:09:03.78,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We have to learn how to be good stewards again.

169
0:09:08.484,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We often imagine that the world is filled with infinite water.

170
0:09:13.234,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In fact, it's not.

171
0:09:14.518,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This planet, Ohke, Mother Earth,

172
0:09:16.639,000 --> 0:09:19,000
has very finite freshwater resources.

173
0:09:19.663,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Currently, nearly two billion people

174
0:09:22.616,000 --> 0:09:25,000
live in countries experiencing high water stress.

175
0:09:26.839,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It is also estimated that by 2030,

176
0:09:29.925,000 --> 0:09:33,000
up to 700 million people could be displaced, worldwide,

177
0:09:34.334,000 --> 0:09:35,000
due to water scarcity.

178
0:09:37.059,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We have to address this crisis.

179
0:09:39.741,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And so it's time for us to change.

180
0:09:41.737,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We have to transform the way in which we value water.

181
0:09:45.125,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And we can do that.

182
0:09:46.3,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We can learn to be good stewards again.

183
0:09:48.761,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We can create laws through which we grant legal personhood to water.

184
0:09:53.463,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We can start to honor the original treaties

185
0:09:55.948,000 --> 0:09:57,000
between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous peoples

186
0:09:58.758,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for water protection.

187
0:10:00.43,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We can appoint guardians for the water

188
0:10:03.444,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that ensure the water's rights are always protected.

189
0:10:07.394,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We can also develop water-quality standards

190
0:10:10.109,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that have a holistic approach,

191
0:10:11.681,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that ensure the well-being of the water before our human needs.

192
0:10:16.478,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And moreover, we can work to dismantle exclusive property ownership over water.

193
0:10:23.843,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And there are amazing successful examples of this around the world.

194
0:10:29.542,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The Whanganui River in Aotearoa, in New Zealand,

195
0:10:32.127,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and the Ganges River in India

196
0:10:33.638,000 --> 0:10:35,000
were both granted legal personhood in 2017.

197
0:10:36.345,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And even this year,

198
0:10:37.971,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the residents of the city of Toledo

199
0:10:40.226,000 --> 0:10:43,000
recognized the legal personality of Lake Erie.

200
0:10:43.424,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And right here in California,

201
0:10:45.882,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the Yurok Tribe granted legal personhood to the Klamath River.

202
0:10:51.071,000 --> 0:10:55,000
You see, I imagine a world where we value water

203
0:10:55.127,000 --> 0:10:56,000
as a living relation,

204
0:10:57.955,000 --> 0:11:01,000
where we work to restore our connection to water.

205
0:11:02.955,000 --> 0:11:04,000
As women, we are water carriers.

206
0:11:05.736,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We nurture water in our wombs for nine months.

207
0:11:08.701,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's the first medicine that each of us as human beings

208
0:11:12.077,000 --> 0:11:13,000
is exposed to.

209
0:11:13.906,000 --> 0:11:18,000
See, we are all born as human beings with a natal connection to water,

210
0:11:19.124,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but somewhere along the way, we lost that connection,

211
0:11:22.554,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and we have to work to restore it.

212
0:11:24.712,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Because I imagine a world

213
0:11:26.824,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in which water is healthy and ecosystems are thriving.

214
0:11:31.854,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I imagine a world

215
0:11:33.625,000 --> 0:11:36,000
where each of us takes up our right of responsibility

216
0:11:37.22,000 --> 0:11:38,000
as water citizens

217
0:11:38.768,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and protects water.

218
0:11:41.868,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So, in the words of Nokomis,

219
0:11:45.581,000 --> 0:11:47,000
what are you going to do about it?

220
0:11:47.71,000 --> 0:11:5,000
What are you going to do for the water?

221
0:11:51.933,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Well, you can call your local politician.

222
0:11:54.696,000 --> 0:11:55,000
You can go to a town meeting.

223
0:11:56.482,000 --> 0:11:59,000
You can advocate for granting legal personhood to water.

224
0:12:00.052,000 --> 0:12:03,000
You can be like the residents of the city of Toledo

225
0:12:03.172,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and build from the grass roots,

226
0:12:04.799,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and craft your own legislation if the politicians won't write it,

227
0:12:08.207,000 --> 0:12:1,000
recognizing legal personality of water.

228
0:12:11.282,000 --> 0:12:15,000
You can learn about the Indigenous lands and waters that you now occupy

229
0:12:15.69,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and the Indigenous legal systems that still govern them.

230
0:12:19.523,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And most of all, you can connect to water.

231
0:12:21.92,000 --> 0:12:22,000
You can restore that connection.

232
0:12:23.769,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Go to the water closest to your home,

233
0:12:26.403,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and find out why it is threatened.

234
0:12:29.674,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But most of all, if you do anything,

235
0:12:31.807,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I ask that you make a promise to yourself,

236
0:12:35.399,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that each day, you will ask,

237
0:12:37.762,000 --> 0:12:39,000
"What have I done for the water today?"

238
0:12:41.541,000 --> 0:12:44,000
If we are able to fulfill that promise,

239
0:12:45.485,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I believe we can create a bold and brilliant world

240
0:12:49.742,000 --> 0:12:52,000
where future generations are able to form

241
0:12:53.215,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the same relationship to water that we have been privileged to have,

242
0:13:00.46,000 --> 0:13:05,000
where all communities of human and nonhuman relations

243
0:13:05.801,000 --> 0:13:07,000
have water to live,

244
0:13:08.117,000 --> 0:13:1,000
because water is life.

245
0:13:10.966,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Tabutni. Thank you.

246
0:13:12.453,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

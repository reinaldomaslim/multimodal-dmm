1
0:00:13.614,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Representation matters.

2
0:00:16.683,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Authentic representations of women matter.

3
0:00:21.404,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I think that too often, our public representations of women

4
0:00:25.246,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are enveloped in the language of the extraordinary.

5
0:00:29.441,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The first American woman to become a self-made millionaire:

6
0:00:32.325,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Madam C. J. Walker ...

7
0:00:34.794,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The dresses of the first ladies of the United States ...

8
0:00:39.086,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to seek

9
0:00:42.054,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the US Democratic party's presidential nomination --

10
0:00:44.544,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Applause)

11
0:00:47.701,000 --> 0:00:48,000
As a museum curator,

12
0:00:48.876,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I understand why these stories are so seductive.

13
0:00:52.179,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational.

14
0:00:57.166,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But those stories are limiting.

15
0:00:59.365,000 --> 0:01:02,000
By definition, being extraordinary is nonrepresentative.

16
0:01:03.11,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's atypical.

17
0:01:05.133,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Those stories do not create a broad base for incorporating women's history,

18
0:01:08.797,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and they don't reflect our daily realities.

19
0:01:12.276,000 --> 0:01:15,000
If we can collectively apply that radical notion

20
0:01:15.744,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that women are people,

21
0:01:17.631,000 --> 0:01:19,000
it becomes easier to show women as people are:

22
0:01:21.025,000 --> 0:01:25,000
familiar, diverse, present.

23
0:01:25.241,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In everyone's everyday throughout history,

24
0:01:28.923,000 --> 0:01:31,000
women exist positively --

25
0:01:31.986,000 --> 0:01:33,000
not as a matter of interpretation, but as a matter of fact.

26
0:01:35.721,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And beyond a more accurate representation of human life,

27
0:01:39.644,000 --> 0:01:41,000
including women considers the quotidian experiences

28
0:01:42.45,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of the almost 3.8 billion people identified as female on this planet.

29
0:01:48.827,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In this now notorious museum scene from the "Black Panther" movie,

30
0:01:52.787,000 --> 0:01:55,000
a white curator erroneously explains an artifact

31
0:01:56.091,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to Michael B. Jordan's character seen here,

32
0:01:58.249,000 --> 0:01:59,000
an artifact from his own culture.

33
0:02:01.042,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This fictional scene caused real debates in our museum communities

34
0:02:04.821,000 --> 0:02:08,000
about who is shaping the narratives and the bias that those narratives hold.

35
0:02:11.461,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Museums are actually rated

36
0:02:12.766,000 --> 0:02:16,000
one of the most trustworthy sources of information in the United States,

37
0:02:16.878,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and with hundreds of millions of visitors from all over the world,

38
0:02:20.293,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we should tell accurate histories,

39
0:02:22.869,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but we don't.

40
0:02:25.479,000 --> 0:02:27,000
There is a movement from within museums themselves

41
0:02:28.275,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to help combat this bias.

42
0:02:30.472,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The simple acknowledgment that museums are not neutral.

43
0:02:35.44,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Museums are didactic.

44
0:02:37.146,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Through the display of art and artifacts,

45
0:02:39.559,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we can incite creativity and foster inclusion,

46
0:02:42.867,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but we are guilty of historical misrepresentation.

47
0:02:46.418,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Our male-centered histories have left our herstories hidden.

48
0:02:52.359,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And there are hard truths about being a woman,

49
0:02:57.177,000 --> 0:02:59,000
especially a woman of color in this industry,

50
0:02:59.485,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that prevents us from centering inclusive examples of women's lives.

51
0:03:04.572,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Museum leadership:

52
0:03:06.47,000 --> 0:03:08,000
predominantly white and male,

53
0:03:08.81,000 --> 0:03:12,000
despite women comprising some 60 percent of museum staffs.

54
0:03:13.472,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Pipelines to leadership for women are bleak --

55
0:03:15.718,000 --> 0:03:16,000
bleakest for women of color.

56
0:03:18.721,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And the presence of women does not in and of itself guarantee

57
0:03:21.776,000 --> 0:03:23,000
an increase in women's public representation.

58
0:03:24.905,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Not all women are gender equity allies.

59
0:03:28.151,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In the words of feminist theorist bell hooks,

60
0:03:30.527,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"Patriarchy has no gender."

61
0:03:32.968,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Women can support the system of patriarchy

62
0:03:35.236,000 --> 0:03:37,000
just as men can support the fight for gender equity.

63
0:03:39.284,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And we often downplay the importance of intersectionality.

64
0:03:43.694,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Marian Anderson was one of the most celebrated voices of the 20th century,

65
0:03:48.876,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and the Smithsonian collected her 1939 outfit.

66
0:03:52.186,000 --> 0:03:55,000
After the white Daughters of the American Revolution denied her access

67
0:03:55.496,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to sing in Constitution Hall, because she was black,

68
0:03:58.966,000 --> 0:04:01,000
she famously sang instead on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial,

69
0:04:02.291,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to a crowd of over 75,000 people.

70
0:04:07.531,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And in libraries all over, including museums,

71
0:04:10.445,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you can still find the groundbreaking 1982 anthology, entitled

72
0:04:14.494,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"All the Women Are White,

73
0:04:16.603,000 --> 0:04:17,000
All the Blacks Are Men,

74
0:04:18.616,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But Some of Us Are Brave."

75
0:04:22.21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Demands for the increase of women's representation

76
0:04:24.569,000 --> 0:04:27,000
does not automatically include Afro-Latinas like me ...

77
0:04:28.422,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or immigrant women, or Asian women, or Native women,

78
0:04:31.968,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or trans women, or undocumented women,

79
0:04:34.213,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or women over 65, or girls --

80
0:04:36.636,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the list can go on and on and on.

81
0:04:40.09,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So what do we do?

82
0:04:43.307,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Targeted initiatives have helped incorporate perspectives

83
0:04:46.364,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that should have always been included.

84
0:04:48.547,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I arrived at the Smithsonian through a Latino curatorial initiative

85
0:04:52.226,000 --> 0:04:53,000
whose hiring of Latinx curators,

86
0:04:54.159,000 --> 0:04:56,000
mostly women, by the way,

87
0:04:56.368,000 --> 0:05:,000
has raised the profile for Latinx narratives across our institution.

88
0:05:01.234,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And it served as a model

89
0:05:02.464,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for our much larger Smithsonian American Women's History Initiative,

90
0:05:06.751,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which seeks to amplify diverse representations of women

91
0:05:10.163,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in every possible way,

92
0:05:12.497,000 --> 0:05:13,000
so that women show up,

93
0:05:13.763,000 --> 0:05:16,000
not only in the imagery of our contemporary realities,

94
0:05:16.927,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but in our historical representations,

95
0:05:19.352,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because we've always been here.

96
0:05:22.69,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Right now though, in 2018, I can still walk into professional spaces

97
0:05:27.489,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and be the only --

98
0:05:29.334,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the only person under 40, the only black person,

99
0:05:31.633,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the only black woman, the only Latina,

100
0:05:33.467,000 --> 0:05:34,000
sometimes, the only woman.

101
0:05:35.669,000 --> 0:05:38,000
My mother is African-American and my father is Afro-Panamanian.

102
0:05:40.023,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I am so proudly and inextricably both.

103
0:05:43.346,000 --> 0:05:45,000
As an Afro-Latina, I'm one of millions.

104
0:05:46.704,000 --> 0:05:49,000
As an Afro-Latina curator, I'm one of very few.

105
0:05:51.344,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And bringing my whole self into the professional realm

106
0:05:54.004,000 --> 0:05:56,000
can feel like an act of bravery,

107
0:05:56.512,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and I'll admit to you that I was not always up for that challenge,

108
0:05:59.633,000 --> 0:06:02,000
whether from fear of rejection or self-preservation.

109
0:06:04.615,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In meetings, I would only speak up

110
0:06:06.283,000 --> 0:06:08,000
when I had a fully developed comment to share.

111
0:06:09.197,000 --> 0:06:11,000
No audible brainstorming or riffing off of colleagues.

112
0:06:12.906,000 --> 0:06:13,000
For a long time,

113
0:06:14.081,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I denied myself the joy of wearing my beloved hoop earrings

114
0:06:17.877,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or nameplate necklace to work,

115
0:06:19.411,000 --> 0:06:22,000
thinking that they were too loud or unscholarly or unprofessional.

116
0:06:23.675,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:25.221,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I wondered how people would react to my natural hair,

118
0:06:28.566,000 --> 0:06:32,000
or if they viewed me as more acceptable or less authentic when I straightened it.

119
0:06:34.008,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And anyone who has felt outside of mainstream representations

120
0:06:36.935,000 --> 0:06:4,000
understands that there are basic elements just of our everyday being

121
0:06:41.082,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that can make other people uncomfortable.

122
0:06:44.692,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But because I am passionate

123
0:06:46.406,000 --> 0:06:49,000
about the everyday representation of women as we are,

124
0:06:49.898,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I stopped presenting an inauthentic representation of myself or my work.

125
0:06:55.694,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And I have been tested.

126
0:06:57.822,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is me pointing at my hoop earring in my office --

127
0:07:00.382,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:01.501,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Just last month, I was invited to keynote a Latino Heritage Month event.

129
0:07:05.675,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The week of the presentation, the organization expressed concerns.

130
0:07:10.069,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They called my slides "activist,"

131
0:07:12.496,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and they meant that negatively.

132
0:07:14.559,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:17.803,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Applause)

134
0:07:22.509,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Two days before the presentation,

135
0:07:24.147,000 --> 0:07:28,000
they requested that I not show a two-minute video affirming natural hair,

136
0:07:28.831,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because "it may create a barrier to the learning process

137
0:07:31.618,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for some of the participants."

138
0:07:33.759,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:34.881,000 --> 0:07:38,000
That poem, "Hair," was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo,

140
0:07:39.691,000 --> 0:07:42,000
a Dominican-American 2018 National Book Award winner,

141
0:07:43.412,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and it appeared in an award-winning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated.

142
0:07:47.601,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I canceled the talk,

143
0:07:48.967,000 --> 0:07:53,000
explaining to them that their censorship of me and my work made me uncomfortable.

144
0:07:54.11,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Applause and cheers)

145
0:08:03.66,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Respectability politics and idealized femininity

146
0:08:07.363,000 --> 0:08:08,000
influence how we display women

147
0:08:09.288,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and which women we choose to display.

148
0:08:12.09,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And that display has skewed toward successful and extraordinary

149
0:08:15.94,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and reputable and desirable,

150
0:08:18.664,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which maintains the systemic exclusion

151
0:08:20.902,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and marginalization of the everyday, the regular, the underrepresented

152
0:08:25.427,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and usually, the nonwhite.

153
0:08:27.59,000 --> 0:08:3,000
As a museum curator, I am empowered to change that narrative.

154
0:08:31.632,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I research, collect and interpret objects and images of significance.

155
0:08:36.114,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Celia Cruz, the queen of Salsa --

156
0:08:38.024,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Cheers)

157
0:08:39.049,000 --> 0:08:4,000
yes -- is significant.

158
0:08:40.899,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And an Afro-Latina.

159
0:08:42.857,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The Smithsonian has collected her costumes, her shoes,

160
0:08:46.584,000 --> 0:08:48,000
her portrait, her postage stamp

161
0:08:49.345,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and this reimagining ...

162
0:08:51.926,000 --> 0:08:52,000
by artist Tony Peralta.

163
0:08:54.023,000 --> 0:08:56,000
When I collected and displayed this work,

164
0:08:56.268,000 --> 0:08:58,000
it was a victory for symbolic contradictions.

165
0:08:59.59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Pride in displaying a dark-skinned Latina,

166
0:09:02.184,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a black woman,

167
0:09:03.715,000 --> 0:09:05,000
whose hair is in large rollers which straighten your hair,

168
0:09:06.455,000 --> 0:09:08,000
perhaps a nod to white beauty standards.

169
0:09:08.645,000 --> 0:09:11,000
A refined, glamorous woman in oversized, chunky gold jewelry.

170
0:09:13.728,000 --> 0:09:14,000
When this work was on view,

171
0:09:15.046,000 --> 0:09:17,000
it was one of our most Instagrammed pieces,

172
0:09:17.071,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and visitors told me they connected with the everyday elements

173
0:09:20.099,000 --> 0:09:22,000
of her brown skin or her rollers or her jewelry.

174
0:09:24.227,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Our collections include Celia Cruz

175
0:09:27.28,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and a rare portrait of a young Harriet Tubman ...

176
0:09:31.981,000 --> 0:09:33,000
iconic clothing from the incomparable Oprah Winfrey.

177
0:09:36.654,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But museums can literally change

178
0:09:38.396,000 --> 0:09:41,000
how hundreds of millions of people see women

179
0:09:41.473,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and which women they see.

180
0:09:43.454,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So rather than always the first or the famous,

181
0:09:47.118,000 --> 0:09:51,000
it's also our responsibility to show a regular Saturday at the beauty salon,

182
0:09:52.575,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the art of door-knocker earrings ...

183
0:09:54.583,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:56.038,000 --> 0:09:57,000
fashionable sisterhood ...

185
0:09:57.719,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:58.744,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and cultural pride at all ages.

187
0:10:01.196,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Stories of everyday women

188
0:10:02.929,000 --> 0:10:05,000
whose stories have been knowingly omitted from our national and global histories.

189
0:10:07.2,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And oftentimes in museums, you see women represented by clothing

190
0:10:10.687,000 --> 0:10:12,000
or portraits or photography ...

191
0:10:14.94,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but impactful, life-changing stories from everyday women

192
0:10:18.052,000 --> 0:10:2,000
can also look like this Esmeraldan boat seat.

193
0:10:21.764,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Esmeraldas, Ecuador was a maroon community.

194
0:10:24.523,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Its dense rainforest protected indigenous and African populations

195
0:10:28.25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
from Spanish colonizers.

196
0:10:30.282,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There are roads now,

197
0:10:31.456,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but there are some parts inland that are still only accessible by canoe.

198
0:10:35.4,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Débora Nazareno frequently traveled those Ecuadorian waterways by canoe,

199
0:10:39.155,000 --> 0:10:4,000
so she had her own boat seat.

200
0:10:41.279,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Hers personalized with a spiderweb and a spider,

201
0:10:44.396,000 --> 0:10:47,000
representing Anansi, a character in West African folklore.

202
0:10:48.874,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Débora also sat on this seat at home, telling stories to her grandson, Juan.

203
0:10:53.972,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And this intangible ritual of love

204
0:10:56.164,000 --> 0:10:58,000
in the form of intergenerational storytelling

205
0:10:58.592,000 --> 0:11:,000
is common in communities across the African diaspora.

206
0:11:02.378,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And this everyday act sparked in Juan the desire to collect and preserve

207
0:11:06.327,000 --> 0:11:09,000
over 50,000 documents related to Afro-Indian culture.

208
0:11:11.566,000 --> 0:11:14,000
In 2005, Juan García Salazar, Débora's grandson,

209
0:11:15.519,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and by now a world-renowned Afro-Ecuadorian scholar,

210
0:11:19.033,000 --> 0:11:2,000
traveled to Washington, D.C.

211
0:11:21.621,000 --> 0:11:24,000
He met with Lonnie Bunch, the director of the museum where I work,

212
0:11:24.931,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and toward the end of their conversation,

213
0:11:27.062,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Juan reached into his bag and said, "I'd like to give you a present."

214
0:11:32.558,000 --> 0:11:35,000
On that day, Débora Nazareno's humble wooden boat seat

215
0:11:36.271,000 --> 0:11:38,000
became the very first object donated

216
0:11:38.489,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture.

217
0:11:42.865,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It is encased, displayed and has been seen by almost five million visitors

218
0:11:48.108,000 --> 0:11:49,000
from all over the world.

219
0:11:50.9,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I will continue to collect from extraordinary historymakers.

220
0:11:54.224,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Their stories are important.

221
0:11:56.607,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But what drives me to show up today and every day

222
0:12:00.563,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is the simple passion to write our names in history,

223
0:12:04.216,000 --> 0:12:07,000
display them publicly for millions to see

224
0:12:07.356,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and walk in the ever-present light that is woman.

225
0:12:10.961,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Thank you.

226
0:12:12.136,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Applause and cheers)

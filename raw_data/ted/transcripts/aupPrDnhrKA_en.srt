1
0:00:12.857,000 --> 0:00:14,000
According to the theories of human social development,

2
0:00:15.719,000 --> 0:00:17,000
we're now living through the fourth great epoch

3
0:00:17.96,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of technological advancement,

4
0:00:20.08,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the Information Age.

5
0:00:22.24,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Connectivity through digital technology is a modern miracle.

6
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We can say it has broken down barriers of time and space which separate people,

7
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and it's created a condition for an age

8
0:00:32.92,000 --> 0:00:34,000
where information, ideas can be shared freely.

9
0:00:37.24,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But are these great accomplishments in digital technology

10
0:00:40.2,000 --> 0:00:42,000
really the endgame in terms of what can be achieved?

11
0:00:43.64,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I don't think so,

12
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and today I'd like to share with you

13
0:00:46.88,000 --> 0:00:49,000
how I believe digital technology can take us to even greater heights.

14
0:00:51.88,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm a surgeon by profession,

15
0:00:53.84,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and as I stand here today talking to all of you,

16
0:00:56.24,000 --> 0:01:,000
five billion people around the world lack access to safe surgical care.

17
0:01:00.64,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Five billion people.

18
0:01:03.08,000 --> 0:01:05,000
That's 70 percent of the world's population,

19
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who according to the WHO's Lancet Commission

20
0:01:08.2,000 --> 0:01:1,000
can't even access simple surgical procedures

21
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
as and when they need them.

22
0:01:13.76,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Let's zoom in on Sierra Leone,

23
0:01:15.84,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a country of six million people,

24
0:01:18.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
where a recent study showed that there are only 10 qualified surgeons.

25
0:01:22.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
That's one surgeon for every 600,000 people.

26
0:01:26.28,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The numbers are staggering,

27
0:01:28.68,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and we don't even need to look that far.

28
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
If we look around us here in the US,

29
0:01:33.32,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a recent study reported that we need an extra 100,000 surgeons by 2030

30
0:01:38.08,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to just keep up with the demand for routine surgical procedures.

31
0:01:42.12,000 --> 0:01:45,000
At the rate that we're going, we won't be meeting those numbers.

32
0:01:47.52,000 --> 0:01:49,000
As a surgeon, this is a global issue that bothers me.

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It bothers me a lot,

34
0:01:51.72,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because I've seen firsthand

35
0:01:53.56,000 --> 0:01:55,000
how lack of access to safe and affordable healthcare

36
0:01:56.44,000 --> 0:01:57,000
can blight the lives of ordinary people.

37
0:01:58.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
If you're a patient that needs an operation

38
0:02:01.08,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and there isn't a surgeon available,

39
0:02:02.84,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you're left with some really difficult choices:

40
0:02:05.84,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to wait, to travel,

41
0:02:09.2,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or not to have an operation at all.

42
0:02:12.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So what's the answer?

43
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, part of you are carrying some of that solution with you today:

44
0:02:19.12,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a smartphone, a tablet, a computer.

45
0:02:23.08,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Because for me,

46
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:28,000
digital communications technology has the power to do so much more

47
0:02:28.56,000 --> 0:02:3,000
than just to allow us to shop online,

48
0:02:30.84,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to connect through social media platforms and to stay up to date.

49
0:02:34.88,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It has the power to help us solve some of the key issues that we face,

50
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:41,000
like lack of access to vital surgical services.

51
0:02:42.44,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And today I'd like to share with you

52
0:02:44.2,000 --> 0:02:46,000
an example of how I think we can make that possible.

53
0:02:47.36,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The history of surgery is filled with breakthroughs

54
0:02:49.8,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in how science and technology was able to help the surgeons of the day

55
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
face their greatest challenges.

56
0:02:54.68,000 --> 0:02:55,000
If we go back several hundred years,

57
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:02:57,000
an understanding of microbiology

58
0:02:58.6,000 --> 0:03:,000
led to the development of antiseptic techniques,

59
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which played a big role in making sure

60
0:03:02.84,000 --> 0:03:04,000
patients were able to stay alive postsurgery.

61
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Fast-forward a few hundred years

62
0:03:06.8,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and we developed keyhole or arthroscopic surgery,

63
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which combines video technology and precision instruments

64
0:03:12.08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to make surgery less invasive.

65
0:03:15.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And more recently, a lot of you will be aware of robotic surgery,

66
0:03:19.12,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and what robotics brings to surgery is much like modern automated machinery,

67
0:03:23.8,000 --> 0:03:24,000
ultraprecision,

68
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the ability to carry out procedures at the tiniest scales

69
0:03:29.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with a degree of accuracy that even surpasses the human hand.

70
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But robotic surgery also introduced something else to surgery:

71
0:03:38.48,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the idea that a surgeon

72
0:03:39.96,000 --> 0:03:42,000
doesn't actually have to be standing at the patient's bedside to deliver care,

73
0:03:44.32,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that he could be looking at a screen

74
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and instructing a robot through a computer.

75
0:03:49.8,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We call this remote surgery.

76
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It is incumbent on us

77
0:03:56.52,000 --> 0:04:,000
to find solutions that solve these answers in a cost-effective and scalable way,

78
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so that everyone, no matter where they are in the world,

79
0:04:03.68,000 --> 0:04:04,000
can have these problems addressed.

80
0:04:06.44,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So what if I told you

81
0:04:08.12,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that you didn't really need a million-dollar robot

82
0:04:10.52,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to provide remote surgery?

83
0:04:12.72,000 --> 0:04:15,000
That all you needed was a phone, a tablet, or a computer,

84
0:04:17.68,000 --> 0:04:18,000
an internet connection,

85
0:04:19.8,000 --> 0:04:2,000
a confident colleague on the ground

86
0:04:21.64,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and one magic ingredient:

87
0:04:24.12,000 --> 0:04:26,000
an augmented reality collaboration software.

88
0:04:28.079,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Using this augmented reality collaboration software,

89
0:04:30.839,000 --> 0:04:33,000
an expert surgeon can now virtually transport himself

90
0:04:33.92,000 --> 0:04:34,000
into any clinical setting

91
0:04:35.72,000 --> 0:04:38,000
simply by using his phone or tablet or computer,

92
0:04:38.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and he can visually and practically interact in an operation

93
0:04:41.68,000 --> 0:04:42,000
from start to finish,

94
0:04:43.04,000 --> 0:04:46,000
guiding and mentoring a local doctor through the procedure step by step.

95
0:04:47.8,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Well, enough of me telling you about it.

96
0:04:50.04,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'd now like to show you.

97
0:04:54.84,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We're now going to go live to Dr. Marc Tompkins,

98
0:04:57.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
an orthopedic surgeon at the University of Minnesota.

99
0:05:01.8,000 --> 0:05:03,000
He's going to perform an arthroscopic surgery for us,

100
0:05:04.32,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a keyhole surgery of the knee,

101
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I'd like to disclose

102
0:05:08.08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that this patient has consented to having their operation streamed.

103
0:05:14.04,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I'd also like to point out that in the interest of time,

104
0:05:16.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
we're just going to go through the first steps,

105
0:05:18.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
marking up the patient

106
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and just identifying a few key anatomical landmarks.

107
0:05:24.96,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Hello, Dr. Tompkins, can you hear me?

108
0:05:28.2,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Dr. Mark Tompkins: Good morning, Nadine.

109
0:05:30.2,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Nadine Hachach-Haram: Everyone from TED says hello.

110
0:05:32.64,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Audience: Hi.

111
0:05:36.2,000 --> 0:05:38,000
NHH: Alright, Dr. Tompkins, let's get started.

112
0:05:38.52,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So let's start with our incisions and where we're going to make these,

113
0:05:41.84,000 --> 0:05:42,000
on either side of the patellar tendon.

114
0:05:43.8,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So if you can make your incisions there and there,

115
0:05:47.52,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that should hopefully get us into the knee.

116
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:52,000
MT: All right, I'm going in.

117
0:05:53.84,000 --> 0:05:54,000
NHH: Great.

118
0:05:57.48,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So we're just getting inside the joint now.

119
0:06:02.52,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So why don't we go around and have a quick look at the meniscus.

120
0:06:07.68,000 --> 0:06:08,000
MT: Perfect.

121
0:06:11.96,000 --> 0:06:14,000
NHH: Great, so we can see there's a small tear there on the meniscus,

122
0:06:15.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but otherwise it looks alright.

123
0:06:18.8,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And if you turn and head to this direction,

124
0:06:21.24,000 --> 0:06:22,000
follow my finger,

125
0:06:22.48,000 --> 0:06:24,000
let's have a quick look at the ACL and the PCL.

126
0:06:26.72,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That's your ACL there, that looks quite healthy,

127
0:06:29.96,000 --> 0:06:3,000
no problems there.

128
0:06:31.24,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So we've just identified that small meniscus tear there,

129
0:06:34.28,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but otherwise the fluid around the joint looks OK as well.

130
0:06:38.92,000 --> 0:06:41,000
All right, thank you very much, Dr. Tompkins. Thank you for your time.

131
0:06:42.28,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I'll let you continue.

132
0:06:43.92,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Have a good day. Bye.

133
0:06:46.28,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Applause)

134
0:06:54.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So I hope through this simple demonstration

135
0:06:56.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I was able to illustrate to you just how powerful this technology can be.

136
0:07:00.84,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And I'd like to point out that I wasn't using any special equipment,

137
0:07:04.08,000 --> 0:07:06,000
just my laptop and a really simple webcam.

138
0:07:06.56,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We're so used to using digital technology

139
0:07:08.56,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to communicate through voice and text and video,

140
0:07:11.76,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but augmented reality can do something so much deeper.

141
0:07:15.08,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It allows two people to virtually interact

142
0:07:17.4,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in a way that mimics how they would collaborate in person.

143
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Being able to show someone what you want to do,

144
0:07:23.44,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to illustrate and demonstrate and gesture,

145
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is so much more powerful than just telling them.

146
0:07:28.84,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And it can make for such a great learning tool,

147
0:07:31.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because we learn better through direct experience.

148
0:07:34.04,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So how is this making a difference around the world?

149
0:07:36.52,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Well, back in my teaching hospital,

150
0:07:38.6,000 --> 0:07:41,000
we've been using this to support local district general hospitals

151
0:07:41.72,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and providing skin cancer surgery and trauma treatment.

152
0:07:44.8,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, patients can access care at a local level.

153
0:07:48.2,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This reduces their travel time, improves their access,

154
0:07:51.56,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and saves money.

155
0:07:53.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We've even started seeing its use in wound care management with nurses

156
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and in outpatient management.

157
0:07:58.76,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Most recently, and quite exciting,

158
0:08:00.52,000 --> 0:08:04,000
it was used in supporting a surgeon through a cancer removal of a kidney.

159
0:08:06.32,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And I'd like to just share with you a very quick video here.

160
0:08:09.76,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I apologize for some of the gruesome views.

161
0:08:14.08,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Video) Doctor 1: OK. Show me again.

162
0:08:17.76,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Doctor 2: If you see here,

163
0:08:19.88,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that's the upper part, the most outer part of your tumor.

164
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Doctor 1: Yes.

165
0:08:25.24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Doctor 2: So it's three centimeters deep,

166
0:08:28.12,000 --> 0:08:29,000
so this should be three centimeters.

167
0:08:30.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Doctor 1: Yes, yes.

168
0:08:32.2,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Doctor 2: OK, so you need to get a 3.5 margin.

169
0:08:37.536,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Doctor 1: I'm going to show you anyway

170
0:08:39.56,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and tell me what you think about it.

171
0:08:42.88,000 --> 0:08:45,000
NHH: We're also seeing the use of this technology at a global scale,

172
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and one of the most heartwarming stories I can recall

173
0:08:48.84,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is from the town of Trujillo in the north of Lima in Peru,

174
0:08:52.84,000 --> 0:08:54,000
where this technology was used to support the provision

175
0:08:55.72,000 --> 0:08:57,000
of cleft lip and palate surgery to children,

176
0:08:58.36,000 --> 0:09:01,000
children from poor backgrounds who didn't have access to health insurance.

177
0:09:02.36,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And in this town, there was a hospital with one surgeon

178
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:06,000
working hard to provide this care,

179
0:09:06.96,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Dr. Soraya.

180
0:09:08.96,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now, Dr. Soraya was struggling under the sheer demand

181
0:09:11.48,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of her local population,

182
0:09:12.92,000 --> 0:09:15,000
as well as the fact that she wasn't specifically trained in this procedure.

183
0:09:16.52,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And so, with the help of a charity,

184
0:09:18.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we were able to connect her with a cleft surgeon in California,

185
0:09:21.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and using this technology, he was able to guide her and her colleagues

186
0:09:25.04,000 --> 0:09:26,000
through the procedure step by step,

187
0:09:26.76,000 --> 0:09:28,000
guiding them, training them and teaching them.

188
0:09:28.96,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Within a few months,

189
0:09:30.24,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they were able to perform 30 percent more operations

190
0:09:32.72,000 --> 0:09:34,000
with less and less complications.

191
0:09:34.84,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And now Dr. Soraya and her team can perform these operations

192
0:09:38.28,000 --> 0:09:4,000
independently, competently and confidently.

193
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I remember one quote from a mother who said,

194
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:46,000
"This technology gave my daughter her smile."

195
0:09:48.64,000 --> 0:09:5,000
For me, this is the real power of this technology.

196
0:09:51.8,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The beauty is that it breaks boundaries.

197
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It transcends all technological difficulties.

198
0:09:58.52,000 --> 0:10:,000
It connects people. It democratizes access.

199
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Wi-Fi and mobile technology are growing rapidly,

200
0:10:04.44,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and they should play a role in boosting surgical provision.

201
0:10:07.48,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We've even seen it used in conflict zones where there's considerable risk

202
0:10:10.96,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in getting specialist surgeons to certain locations.

203
0:10:13.52,000 --> 0:10:15,000
In a world where there are more mobile devices

204
0:10:16.44,000 --> 0:10:17,000
than there are human beings,

205
0:10:18.32,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it truly has a global reach.

206
0:10:20.92,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Of course, we've still got a long way

207
0:10:22.76,000 --> 0:10:25,000
before we can solve the problem of getting surgery to five billion people,

208
0:10:26.28,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and unfortunately,

209
0:10:27.56,000 --> 0:10:29,000
some people still don't have access to internet.

210
0:10:30.52,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But things are rapidly moving in the right direction.

211
0:10:34.36,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The potential for change is there.

212
0:10:36.84,000 --> 0:10:38,000
My team and I are growing our global footprint,

213
0:10:39.8,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and we're starting to see the potential of this technology.

214
0:10:44.44,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Through digital technology,

215
0:10:46.36,000 --> 0:10:49,000
through simple, everyday devices that we take for granted,

216
0:10:49.68,000 --> 0:10:51,000
through devices of the future,

217
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we can really do miraculous things.

218
0:10:54.36,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Thank you.

219
0:10:55.6,000 --> 0:10:58,000

1
0:00:15.306,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Almost 50 years ago,

2
0:00:17.78,000 --> 0:00:21,000
psychiatrists Richard Rahe and Thomas Holmes developed an inventory

3
0:00:22.53,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of the most distressing human experiences that we could have.

4
0:00:28.835,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Number one on the list? Death of a spouse.

5
0:00:32.309,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Number two, divorce. Three, marital separation.

6
0:00:35.506,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, generally, but not always,

7
0:00:38.7,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for those three to occur, we need what comes in number seven on the list,

8
0:00:42.809,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which is marriage.

9
0:00:44.305,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:46.421,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Fourth on the list is imprisonment in an institution.

11
0:00:51.955,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, some say number seven has been counted twice.

12
0:00:54.761,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:58.356,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I don't believe that.

14
0:01:00.845,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When the life stress inventory was built,

15
0:01:04.361,000 --> 0:01:1,000
back then, a long-term relationship pretty much equated to a marriage.

16
0:01:10.45,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Not so now.

17
0:01:11.63,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So for the purposes of this talk, I'm going to be including

18
0:01:16.282,000 --> 0:01:18,000
de facto relationships, common-law marriages

19
0:01:18.394,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and same-sex marriages,

20
0:01:21.152,000 --> 0:01:25,000
or same-sex relationships soon hopefully to become marriages.

21
0:01:26.432,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I can say from my work with same-sex couples,

22
0:01:28.823,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the principles I'm about to talk about are no different.

23
0:01:32.004,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They're the same across all relationships.

24
0:01:35.635,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So in a modern society,

25
0:01:38.249,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we know that prevention is better than cure.

26
0:01:42.149,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We vaccinate against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles.

27
0:01:47.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We have awareness campaigns for melanoma, stroke, diabetes --

28
0:01:51.603,000 --> 0:01:53,000
all important campaigns.

29
0:01:54.66,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But none of those conditions come close

30
0:01:58.743,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to affecting 45 percent of us.

31
0:02:02.86,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Forty-five percent: that's our current divorce rate.

32
0:02:06.616,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Why no prevention campaign for divorce?

33
0:02:11.312,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Well, I think it's because our policymakers don't believe

34
0:02:17.272,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that things like attraction and the way relationships are built

35
0:02:22.121,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is changeable or educable.

36
0:02:25.262,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Why?

37
0:02:27.204,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Well, our policymakers currently are Generation X.

38
0:02:31.658,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They're in their 30s to 50s.

39
0:02:34.931,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And when I'm talking to these guys about these issues,

40
0:02:38.513,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I see their eyes glaze over,

41
0:02:40.526,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I can see them thinking,

42
0:02:42.793,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Doesn't this crazy psychiatrist get it?

43
0:02:45.713,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You can't control the way in which people attract other people

44
0:02:49.577,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and build relationships."

45
0:02:52.359,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Not so, our dear millennials.

46
0:02:55.594,000 --> 0:03:,000
This is the most information-connected, analytical and skeptical generation,

47
0:03:01.511,000 --> 0:03:05,000
making the most informed decisions of any generation before them.

48
0:03:06.523,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And when I talk to millennials, I get a very different reaction.

49
0:03:10.389,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They actually want to hear about this.

50
0:03:12.269,000 --> 0:03:16,000
They want to know about how do we have relationships that last?

51
0:03:18.278,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So for those of you who want to embrace the post- "romantic destiny" era with me,

52
0:03:23.346,000 --> 0:03:27,000
let me talk about my three life hacks for preventing divorce.

53
0:03:28.356,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now, we can intervene to prevent divorce at two points:

54
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:36,000
later, once the cracks begin to appear in an established relationship;

55
0:03:37.316,000 --> 0:03:41,000
or earlier, before we commit, before we have children.

56
0:03:42.275,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And that's where I'm going to take us now.

57
0:03:46.128,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So my first life hack:

58
0:03:48.919,000 --> 0:03:52,000
millennials spend seven-plus hours on their devices a day.

59
0:03:54.116,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That's American data.

60
0:03:56.056,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And some say, probably not unreasonably,

61
0:03:58.425,000 --> 0:04:02,000
this has probably affected their face-to-face relationships.

62
0:04:03.139,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Indeed, and add to that the hookup culture,

63
0:04:06.878,000 --> 0:04:07,000
ergo apps like Tinder,

64
0:04:08.845,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it's no great surprise that the 20-somethings that I work with

65
0:04:12.408,000 --> 0:04:15,000
will often talk to me about how it is often easier for them

66
0:04:16.329,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to have sex with somebody that they've met

67
0:04:18.914,000 --> 0:04:2,000
than have a meaningful conversation.

68
0:04:21.628,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, some say this is a bad thing.

69
0:04:24.928,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I say this is a really good thing.

70
0:04:28.98,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's a particularly good thing

71
0:04:31.05,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to be having sex outside of the institution of marriage.

72
0:04:35.28,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, before you go out and get all moral on me,

73
0:04:38.21,000 --> 0:04:41,000
remember that Generation X, in the American Public Report,

74
0:04:42.138,000 --> 0:04:45,000
they found that 91 percent of women

75
0:04:45.565,000 --> 0:04:47,000
had had premarital sex by the age of 30.

76
0:04:48.301,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Ninety-one percent.

77
0:04:51.383,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's a particularly good thing that these relationships are happening later.

78
0:04:56.358,000 --> 0:04:58,000
See, boomers in the '60s --

79
0:04:59.921,000 --> 0:05:02,000
they were getting married at an average age for women of 20

80
0:05:03.23,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and 23 for men.

81
0:05:05.629,000 --> 0:05:07,000
2015 in Australia?

82
0:05:07.785,000 --> 0:05:11,000
That is now 30 for women and 32 for men.

83
0:05:13.759,000 --> 0:05:18,000
That's a good thing, because the older you are when you get married,

84
0:05:19.316,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the lower your divorce rate.

85
0:05:21.036,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Why?

86
0:05:22.228,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Why is it helpful to get married later?

87
0:05:24.739,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Three reasons.

88
0:05:25.932,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Firstly, getting married later allows the other two preventers of divorce

89
0:05:30.65,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to come into play.

90
0:05:31.905,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They are tertiary education

91
0:05:34.952,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and a higher income, which tends to go with tertiary education.

92
0:05:38.03,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So these three factors all kind of get mixed up together.

93
0:05:41.262,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Number two,

94
0:05:42.563,000 --> 0:05:44,000
neuroplasticity research tell us

95
0:05:44.949,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that the human brain is still growing until at least the age of 25.

96
0:05:51.207,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So that means how you're thinking and what you're thinking

97
0:05:54.033,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is still changing up until 25.

98
0:05:57.034,000 --> 0:06:,000
And thirdly, and most importantly to my mind, is personality.

99
0:06:00.903,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Your personality at the age of 20

100
0:06:03.236,000 --> 0:06:06,000
does not correlate with your personality at the age of 50.

101
0:06:07.004,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But your personality at the age of 30

102
0:06:09.569,000 --> 0:06:12,000
does correlate with your personality at the age of 50.

103
0:06:13.009,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So when I ask somebody who got married young why they broke up,

104
0:06:16.054,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and they say, "We grew apart,"

105
0:06:18.629,000 --> 0:06:19,000
they're being surprisingly accurate,

106
0:06:20.407,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because the 20s is a decade of rapid change and maturation.

107
0:06:25.197,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So the first thing you want to get before you get married is older.

108
0:06:30.973,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

109
0:06:34.218,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Number two,

110
0:06:35.998,000 --> 0:06:39,000
John Gottman, psychologist and relationship researcher,

111
0:06:40.23,000 --> 0:06:45,000
can tell us many factors that correlate with a happy, successful marriage.

112
0:06:46.853,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But the one that I want to talk about

113
0:06:48.835,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is a big one:

114
0:06:50.091,000 --> 0:06:56,000
81 percent of marriages implode, self-destruct, if this problem is present.

115
0:06:56.397,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And the second reason why I want to talk about it here

116
0:06:59.177,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is because it's something you can evaluate while you're dating.

117
0:07:03.095,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Gottman found that the relationships that were the most stable and happy

118
0:07:08.993,000 --> 0:07:09,000
over the longer term

119
0:07:10.219,000 --> 0:07:13,000
were relationships in which the couple shared power.

120
0:07:14.531,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They were influenceable:

121
0:07:18.854,000 --> 0:07:22,000
big decisions, like buying a house, overseas trips, buying a car,

122
0:07:23.101,000 --> 0:07:24,000
having children.

123
0:07:24.959,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But when Gottman drilled down on this data,

124
0:07:27.842,000 --> 0:07:32,000
what he found was that women were generally pretty influenceable.

125
0:07:33.639,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Guess where the problem lay?

126
0:07:35.792,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

127
0:07:36.839,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Yeah, there's only two options here, isn't there?

128
0:07:39.29,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Yeah, we men were to blame.

129
0:07:42.497,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The other thing that Gottman found

130
0:07:44.251,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is that men who are influenceable

131
0:07:48.486,000 --> 0:07:52,000
also tended to be "outstanding fathers."

132
0:07:53.323,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So women: How influenceable is your man?

133
0:07:58.987,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Men:

134
0:08:03.038,000 --> 0:08:05,000
you're with her because you respect her.

135
0:08:07.396,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Make sure that respect plays out in the decision-making process.

136
0:08:14.445,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Number three.

137
0:08:19.213,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I'm often intrigued by why couples come in to see me

138
0:08:23.712,000 --> 0:08:25,000
after they've been married for 30 or 40 years.

139
0:08:26.432,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is a time when they're approaching the infirmities and illness of old age.

140
0:08:31.399,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It's a time when they're particularly focused on caring for each other.

141
0:08:37.376,000 --> 0:08:39,000
They'll forgive things that have bugged them for years.

142
0:08:40.068,000 --> 0:08:43,000
They'll forgive all betrayals, even infidelities,

143
0:08:43.663,000 --> 0:08:45,000
because they're focused on caring for each other.

144
0:08:46.048,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So what pulls them apart?

145
0:08:47.698,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The best word I have for this is reliability,

146
0:08:50.47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or the lack thereof.

147
0:08:52.563,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Does your partner have your back?

148
0:08:54.458,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It takes two forms.

149
0:08:55.749,000 --> 0:09:,000
Firstly, can you rely on your partner to do what they say they're going to do?

150
0:09:01.529,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Do they follow through?

151
0:09:03.706,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Secondly,

152
0:09:06.356,000 --> 0:09:07,000
if, for example,

153
0:09:08.071,000 --> 0:09:1,000
you're out and you're being verbally attacked by somebody,

154
0:09:10.901,000 --> 0:09:15,000
or you're suffering from a really disabling illness,

155
0:09:16.047,000 --> 0:09:19,000
does your partner step up and do what needs to be done

156
0:09:19.947,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to leave you feeling cared for and protected?

157
0:09:23.497,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And here's the rub:

158
0:09:25.281,000 --> 0:09:26,000
if you're facing old age,

159
0:09:27.23,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and your partner isn't doing that for you --

160
0:09:29.637,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in fact, you're having to do that for them --

161
0:09:32.523,000 --> 0:09:35,000
then in an already-fragile relationship,

162
0:09:35.742,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it can look a bit like you might be better off out of it rather than in it.

163
0:09:41.834,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So is your partner there for you when it really matters?

164
0:09:49.141,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Not all the time, 80 percent of the time,

165
0:09:51.641,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but particularly if it's important to you.

166
0:09:55.821,000 --> 0:10:,000
On your side, think carefully before you commit to do something for your partner.

167
0:10:01.454,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It is much better to commit to as much as you can follow through

168
0:10:05.941,000 --> 0:10:07,000
than to commit to more sound-good-in-the-moment

169
0:10:08.755,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and then let them down.

170
0:10:14.244,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And if it's really important to your partner, and you commit to it,

171
0:10:18.27,000 --> 0:10:21,000
make sure you move hell and high water to follow through.

172
0:10:21.938,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, these are things that I'm saying you can look for.

173
0:10:24.647,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Don't worry, these are also things that can be built

174
0:10:27.597,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in existing relationships.

175
0:10:32.282,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I believe that the most important decision

176
0:10:37.234,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that you can make

177
0:10:38.812,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is who you choose as a life partner,

178
0:10:43.068,000 --> 0:10:45,000
who you choose as the other parent of your children.

179
0:10:47.137,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And of course, romance has to be there.

180
0:10:49.031,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Romance is a grand and beautiful and quirky thing.

181
0:10:54.001,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But we need to add to a romantic, loving heart

182
0:10:59.442,000 --> 0:11:03,000
an informed, thoughtful mind,

183
0:11:03.612,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as we make the most important decision of our life.

184
0:11:06.621,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Thank you.

185
0:11:07.837,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Applause)

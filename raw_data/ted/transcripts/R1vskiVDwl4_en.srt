1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:13,000
All right, I want to see a show of hands:

2
0:00:14.817,000 --> 0:00:16,000
how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook

3
0:00:17.24,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because they said something offensive about politics or religion,

4
0:00:21.12,000 --> 0:00:23,000
childcare, food?

5
0:00:23.28,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid

7
0:00:28.079,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because you just don't want to talk to them?

8
0:00:30.88,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:32.96,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation,

10
0:00:36.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":

11
0:00:39.44,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Stick to the weather and your health.

12
0:00:41.28,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --

13
0:00:44.68,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
are not safe either.

15
0:00:47.32,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So this world that we live in,

16
0:00:50.52,000 --> 0:00:52,000
this world in which every conversation

17
0:00:53.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
has the potential to devolve into an argument,

18
0:00:55.32,000 --> 0:00:57,000
where our politicians can't speak to one another

19
0:00:57.63,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and where even the most trivial of issues

20
0:00:59.96,000 --> 0:01:03,000
have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.

21
0:01:04.96,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults,

22
0:01:08.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized,

23
0:01:10.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we are more divided,

24
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
than we ever have been in history.

25
0:01:14.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We're less likely to compromise,

26
0:01:16.56,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which means we're not listening to each other.

27
0:01:18.76,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And we make decisions about where to live,

28
0:01:21.32,000 --> 0:01:23,000
who to marry and even who our friends are going to be,

29
0:01:23.96,000 --> 0:01:25,000
based on what we already believe.

30
0:01:26.08,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Again, that means we're not listening to each other.

31
0:01:29.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening,

32
0:01:32.44,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.

33
0:01:35.12,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, part of that is due to technology.

34
0:01:37.04,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The smartphones that you all either have in your hands

35
0:01:39.64,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.

36
0:01:42.32,000 --> 0:01:43,000
According to Pew Research,

37
0:01:43.64,000 --> 0:01:47,000
about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.

38
0:01:48.56,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends

39
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
than they are to talk to them face to face.

40
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There's this great piece in The Atlantic.

41
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.

42
0:02:01.04,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And he gave his kids a communication project.

43
0:02:03.2,000 --> 0:02:06,000
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.

44
0:02:06.96,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And he said this: "I came to realize..."

45
0:02:08.889,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:12.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
"I came to realize that conversational competence

47
0:02:15.4,000 --> 0:02:19,000
might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.

48
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens,

49
0:02:23.84,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but rarely do they have an opportunity

50
0:02:25.72,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to hone their interpersonal communications skills.

51
0:02:28.32,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves:

52
0:02:31.52,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Is there any 21st-century skill

53
0:02:33.48,000 --> 0:02:38,000
more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"

54
0:02:39.08,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now, I make my living talking to people:

55
0:02:41.32,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,

56
0:02:43.6,000 --> 0:02:45,000
billionaires, kindergarten teachers,

57
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
heads of state, plumbers.

58
0:02:48.76,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.

59
0:02:51.832,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.

60
0:02:55.64,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But I still have a great conversation with them.

61
0:02:58.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk

62
0:03:02.36,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and how to listen.

63
0:03:04.8,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this,

64
0:03:07.44,000 --> 0:03:08,000
things like look the person in the eye,

65
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:12,000
think of interesting topics to discuss in advance,

66
0:03:13.28,000 --> 0:03:17,000
look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention,

67
0:03:18.08,000 --> 0:03:2,000
repeat back what you just heard or summarize it.

68
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So I want you to forget all of that.

69
0:03:22.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It is crap.

70
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:27.04,000 --> 0:03:31,000
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention

72
0:03:31.32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
if you are in fact paying attention.

73
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:36.88,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Applause)

75
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer

76
0:03:43.48,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that I do in regular life.

77
0:03:46.44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people,

78
0:03:49.92,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.

79
0:03:53.76,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Learn to have a conversation

80
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
without wasting your time, without getting bored,

81
0:03:57.52,000 --> 0:04:,000
and, please God, without offending anybody.

82
0:04:00.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We've all had really great conversations.

83
0:04:03.08,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We've had them before. We know what it's like.

84
0:04:05.28,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired,

85
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or where you feel like you've made a real connection

86
0:04:11.48,000 --> 0:04:13,000
or you've been perfectly understood.

87
0:04:13.6,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There is no reason

88
0:04:14.84,000 --> 0:04:17,000
why most of your interactions can't be like that.

89
0:04:18.12,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them,

90
0:04:21.36,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it,

91
0:04:25.12,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you'll already enjoy better conversations.

92
0:04:27.88,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Number one: Don't multitask.

93
0:04:30.12,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone

94
0:04:32.32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.

95
0:04:35.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I mean, be present.

96
0:04:37.12,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Be in that moment.

97
0:04:39.4,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Don't think about your argument you had with your boss.

98
0:04:42.04,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.

99
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
If you want to get out of the conversation,

100
0:04:46.76,000 --> 0:04:47,000
get out of the conversation,

101
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but don't be half in it and half out of it.

102
0:04:50.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Number two: Don't pontificate.

103
0:04:52.92,000 --> 0:04:54,000
If you want to state your opinion

104
0:04:55.12,000 --> 0:05:,000
without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth,

105
0:05:01.08,000 --> 0:05:02,000
write a blog.

106
0:05:02.56,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:05.64,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show:

108
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Because they're really boring.

109
0:05:10.84,000 --> 0:05:13,000
If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.

110
0:05:14.722,000 --> 0:05:15,000
If they're liberal, they're going to hate

111
0:05:16.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.

112
0:05:18.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Totally predictable.

113
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And you don't want to be like that.

114
0:05:21.96,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.

115
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said

116
0:05:29.68,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.

117
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.

118
0:05:38.2,000 --> 0:05:41,000
He said that sensing this acceptance,

119
0:05:41.52,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the speaker will become less and less vulnerable

120
0:05:43.8,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses

121
0:05:46.68,000 --> 0:05:48,000
of his or her mind to the listener.

122
0:05:49.36,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Again, assume that you have something to learn.

123
0:05:52.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."

124
0:05:57.24,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I put it this way:

125
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Everybody is an expert in something.

126
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Number three: Use open-ended questions.

127
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In this case, take a cue from journalists.

128
0:06:08.08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.

129
0:06:11.2,000 --> 0:06:14,000
If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.

130
0:06:14.92,000 --> 0:06:16,000
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"

131
0:06:17.28,000 --> 0:06:2,000
you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence,

132
0:06:20.48,000 --> 0:06:23,000
which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."

133
0:06:23.84,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."

134
0:06:25.864,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Let them describe it. They're the ones that know.

135
0:06:28.96,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Try asking them things like, "What was that like?"

136
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:32,000
"How did that feel?"

137
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it,

138
0:06:37.76,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and you're going to get a much more interesting response.

139
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Number four: Go with the flow.

140
0:06:43.72,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That means thoughts will come into your mind

141
0:06:46.56,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and you need to let them go out of your mind.

142
0:06:49.64,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We've heard interviews often

143
0:06:51.64,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in which a guest is talking for several minutes

144
0:06:54.12,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then the host comes back in and asks a question

145
0:06:56.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.

146
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago

147
0:07:02.96,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because he thought of this really clever question,

148
0:07:06.4,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and he was just bound and determined to say that.

149
0:07:09.44,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And we do the exact same thing.

150
0:07:11.44,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We're sitting there having a conversation with someone,

151
0:07:14.08,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.

152
0:07:17.56,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:18.92,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And we stop listening.

154
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Stories and ideas are going to come to you.

155
0:07:22.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You need to let them come and let them go.

156
0:07:26.08,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.

157
0:07:30.8,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR,

158
0:07:33.12,000 --> 0:07:35,000
are much more aware that they're going on the record,

159
0:07:36.08,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in

160
0:07:39.68,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and what they claim to know for sure.

161
0:07:41.84,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Do that. Err on the side of caution.

162
0:07:44.24,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Talk should not be cheap.

163
0:07:46.64,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.

164
0:07:51.28,000 --> 0:07:53,000
If they're talking about having lost a family member,

165
0:07:54.08,000 --> 0:07:56,000
don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.

166
0:07:56.96,000 --> 0:07:58,000
If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work,

167
0:07:59.84,000 --> 0:08:01,000
don't tell them about how much you hate your job.

168
0:08:02.2,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It's not the same. It is never the same.

169
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
All experiences are individual.

170
0:08:05.96,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And, more importantly, it is not about you.

171
0:08:09.12,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are

172
0:08:13.04,000 --> 0:08:14,000
or how much you've suffered.

173
0:08:15.12,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said,

174
0:08:18.2,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."

175
0:08:21.12,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:23.08,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.

177
0:08:28.56,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Number seven:

178
0:08:31.44,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Try not to repeat yourself.

179
0:08:32.84,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's condescending, and it's really boring,

180
0:08:35.24,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and we tend to do it a lot.

181
0:08:36.92,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids,

182
0:08:40.88,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we have a point to make,

183
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
so we just keep rephrasing it over and over.

184
0:08:45.64,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Don't do that.

185
0:08:46.88,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.

186
0:08:49.2,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Frankly, people don't care

187
0:08:52.039,000 --> 0:08:54,000
about the years, the names,

188
0:08:54.679,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the dates, all those details

189
0:08:56.64,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that you're struggling to come up with in your mind.

190
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They don't care. What they care about is you.

191
0:09:01.88,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They care about what you're like,

192
0:09:04.08,000 --> 0:09:05,000
what you have in common.

193
0:09:05.8,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So forget the details. Leave them out.

194
0:09:08.88,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Number nine:

195
0:09:10.12,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is not the last one, but it is the most important one.

196
0:09:13.4,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Listen.

197
0:09:14.96,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said

198
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill

199
0:09:22.32,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that you could develop.

200
0:09:23.56,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,

201
0:09:25.48,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"If your mouth is open, you're not learning."

202
0:09:28.04,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."

203
0:09:32.68,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Why do we not listen to each other?

205
0:09:36.92,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Number one, we'd rather talk.

206
0:09:39.48,000 --> 0:09:4,000
When I'm talking, I'm in control.

207
0:09:41.32,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.

208
0:09:43.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I'm the center of attention.

209
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I can bolster my own identity.

210
0:09:47.12,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But there's another reason:

211
0:09:48.52,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We get distracted.

212
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The average person talks at about 225 word per minute,

213
0:09:53.56,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.

214
0:09:57.88,000 --> 0:10:,000
So our minds are filling in those other 275 words.

215
0:10:01.88,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy

216
0:10:05.08,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to actually pay attention to someone,

217
0:10:07.4,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.

218
0:10:10.4,000 --> 0:10:12,000
You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences

219
0:10:13.28,000 --> 0:10:14,000
in the same place.

220
0:10:14.56,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter)

221
0:10:16.48,000 --> 0:10:18,000
You have to listen to one another.

222
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.

223
0:10:20.92,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand.

224
0:10:24.88,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We listen with the intent to reply."

225
0:10:28.96,000 --> 0:10:31,000
One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.

226
0:10:32.84,000 --> 0:10:35,000
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest,

227
0:10:36.36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister]

228
0:10:38.8,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

229
0:10:40.04,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

230
0:10:42.48,000 --> 0:10:46,000
All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one:

231
0:10:47.32,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Be interested in other people.

232
0:10:50.2,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather,

233
0:10:52.64,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and there was kind of a ritual in my home.

234
0:10:54.72,000 --> 0:10:56,000
People would come over to talk to my grandparents,

235
0:10:57.2,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us,

236
0:11:00.08,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?

237
0:11:02.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
She was the runner-up to Miss America.

238
0:11:03.96,000 --> 0:11:04,000
He was the mayor of Sacramento.

239
0:11:05.68,000 --> 0:11:08,000
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."

240
0:11:08.88,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And I kind of grew up assuming

241
0:11:12.28,000 --> 0:11:14,000
everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them.

242
0:11:15.68,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host.

243
0:11:19.28,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can,

244
0:11:22.12,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I keep my mind open,

245
0:11:23.56,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and I'm always prepared to be amazed,

246
0:11:26.08,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and I'm never disappointed.

247
0:11:28.76,000 --> 0:11:29,000
You do the same thing.

248
0:11:30.64,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Go out, talk to people,

249
0:11:33.08,000 --> 0:11:34,000
listen to people,

250
0:11:34.32,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.

251
0:11:38.44,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Thanks.

252
0:11:39.68,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Applause)

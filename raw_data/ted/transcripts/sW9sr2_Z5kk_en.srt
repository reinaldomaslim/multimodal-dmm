1
0:00:12.42,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the 1600s, there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay

2
0:00:16.914,000 --> 0:00:17,000
off the east coast of the U.S.

3
0:00:18.741,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that apparently you could walk across their backs

4
0:00:22.389,000 --> 0:00:24,000
from one end of the bay to the other.

5
0:00:25.234,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Today, they number in the hundreds, and they're endangered.

6
0:00:28.573,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Like them, many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced

7
0:00:33.728,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by 200 years of whaling,

8
0:00:36.17,000 --> 0:00:41,000
where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.

9
0:00:43.009,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We only have whales in our waters today

10
0:00:45.412,000 --> 0:00:48,000
because of the Save the Whales movement of the '70s.

11
0:00:49.057,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling,

12
0:00:52.455,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and was built on the idea that if we couldn't save whales,

13
0:00:56.227,000 --> 0:00:57,000
what could we save?

14
0:00:58.154,000 --> 0:01:,000
It was ultimately a test of our political ability

15
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to halt environmental destruction.

16
0:01:04.683,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So in the early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling

17
0:01:08.236,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that came into force as a result of this campaign.

18
0:01:11.951,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Whales in our waters are still low in numbers, however,

19
0:01:14.76,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because they do face a range of other human-induced threats.

20
0:01:19.489,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Unfortunately, many people still think that whale conservationists like myself

21
0:01:27.136,000 --> 0:01:32,000
do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful.

22
0:01:33.939,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is actually a disservice,

23
0:01:36.025,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because whales are ecosystem engineers.

24
0:01:40.499,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They help maintain the stability and health of the oceans,

25
0:01:44.872,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and even provide services to human society.

26
0:01:49.299,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So let's talk about why saving whales is critical

27
0:01:53.275,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to the resiliency of the oceans.

28
0:01:56.806,000 --> 0:02:,000
It boils down to two main things:

29
0:02:01.334,000 --> 0:02:04,000
whale poop and rotting carcasses.

30
0:02:04.546,000 --> 0:02:09,000
As whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe,

31
0:02:10.012,000 --> 0:02:13,000
they actually release these enormous fecal plumes.

32
0:02:13.918,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This whale pump, as it's called,

33
0:02:15.662,000 --> 0:02:18,000
actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths

34
0:02:18.955,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,

35
0:02:22.975,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which forms the base of all marine food chains.

36
0:02:26.422,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So really, having more whales in the oceans pooping

37
0:02:29.127,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem.

38
0:02:33.208,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Whales are also known to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals.

39
0:02:38.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Gray whales off America migrate 16,000 kilometers

40
0:02:44.707,000 --> 0:02:5,000
between productive feeding areas and less productive calving, or birthing, areas

41
0:02:50.812,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and back every year.

42
0:02:53.902,000 --> 0:02:57,000
As they do so, they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces

43
0:02:58.886,000 --> 0:03:01,000
from places that have it to places that need it.

44
0:03:02.676,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So clearly, whales are really important in nutrient cycling,

45
0:03:06.115,000 --> 0:03:09,000
both horizontally and vertically, through the oceans.

46
0:03:09.807,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But what's really cool is that they're also really important after they're dead.

47
0:03:16.466,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Whale carcasses are some of the largest form of detritus

48
0:03:20.559,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to fall from the ocean's surface, and they're called whale fall.

49
0:03:25.409,000 --> 0:03:27,000
As these carcasses sink,

50
0:03:27.466,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they provide a feast to some 400-odd species,

51
0:03:30.495,000 --> 0:03:33,000
including the eel-shaped, slime-producing hagfish.

52
0:03:35.021,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So over the 200 years of whaling,

53
0:03:37.154,000 --> 0:03:41,000
when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans,

54
0:03:41.524,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls

55
0:03:47.246,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that would descend into deep oceans,

56
0:03:49.563,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and as a result, probably led to a number of extinctions

57
0:03:53.254,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of species that were most specialized

58
0:03:55.392,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and dependent on these carcasses for their survival.

59
0:03:59.876,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Whale carcasses are also known to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,

60
0:04:07.808,000 --> 0:04:09,000
which is the equivalent of that produced

61
0:04:10.106,000 --> 0:04:13,000
by 80,000 cars per year

62
0:04:13.171,000 --> 0:04:15,000
from the atmosphere to the deep oceans,

63
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and the deep oceans are what we call "carbon sinks,"

64
0:04:19.51,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere,

65
0:04:23.573,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and therefore help to delay global warming.

66
0:04:27.789,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches

67
0:04:31.468,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land.

68
0:04:36.54,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental

69
0:04:40.464,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and caused a reduction in the populations of whales

70
0:04:43.356,000 --> 0:04:46,000
between 60 to 90 percent.

71
0:04:46.476,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Clearly, the Save the Whales movement

72
0:04:48.302,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on,

73
0:04:52.713,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but we need to revise this.

74
0:04:55.854,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We need to address the more modern, pressing problems that these whales face

75
0:05:00.608,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in our waters today.

76
0:05:02.349,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Amongst other things, we need to stop them

77
0:05:04.482,000 --> 0:05:08,000
from getting plowed down by container ships when they're in their feeding areas,

78
0:05:09.187,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets

79
0:05:11.985,000 --> 0:05:13,000
as they float around in the ocean.

80
0:05:14.469,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages,

81
0:05:18.839,000 --> 0:05:24,000
so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures.

82
0:05:25.985,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So, let's save the whales again,

83
0:05:30.142,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but this time, let's not just do it for their sake.

84
0:05:34.275,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Let's also do it for ours.

85
0:05:36.806,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Thank you.

86
0:05:39.151,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.713,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Can I get a show of hands --

2
0:00:15.103,000 --> 0:00:18,000
how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year?

3
0:00:20.258,000 --> 0:00:21,000
That's pretty good.

4
0:00:21.435,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Well, it turns out that you share that experience

5
0:00:24.344,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with more than three billion people every year.

6
0:00:27.203,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes

7
0:00:30.364,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that fly all over the world,

8
0:00:31.974,000 --> 0:00:33,000
sometimes, things like this can happen

9
0:00:34.671,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and you get a disease epidemic.

10
0:00:37.116,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I first actually got into this topic

11
0:00:39.091,000 --> 0:00:41,000
when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year.

12
0:00:41.747,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And it turns out that,

13
0:00:43.231,000 --> 0:00:45,000
although Ebola spreads through these more range-limited,

14
0:00:46.085,000 --> 0:00:47,000
large-droplet routes,

15
0:00:47.443,000 --> 0:00:48,000
there's all these other sorts of diseases

16
0:00:49.445,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that can be spread in the airplane cabin.

17
0:00:51.445,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers,

18
0:00:54.653,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it's pretty scary.

19
0:00:56.09,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So with H1N1,

20
0:00:57.874,000 --> 0:00:59,000
there was this guy that decided to go on the plane

21
0:01:00.287,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and in the matter of a single flight

22
0:01:02.082,000 --> 0:01:04,000
actually spread the disease to 17 other people.

23
0:01:04.36,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And then there was this other guy with SARS,

24
0:01:06.512,000 --> 0:01:08,000
who managed to go on a three-hour flight

25
0:01:08.638,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and spread the disease to 22 other people.

26
0:01:11.504,000 --> 0:01:14,000
That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower.

27
0:01:15.658,000 --> 0:01:17,000
When we take a look at this, what we also find

28
0:01:18.246,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is that it's very difficult to pre-screen for these diseases.

29
0:01:21.619,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So when someone actually goes on a plane,

30
0:01:23.734,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they could be sick

31
0:01:24.964,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and they could actually be in this latency period

32
0:01:27.383,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in which they could actually have the disease

33
0:01:29.566,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but not exhibit any symptoms,

34
0:01:31.162,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and they could, in turn, spread the disease

35
0:01:33.377,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to many other people in the cabin.

36
0:01:35.074,000 --> 0:01:37,000
How that actually works is that right now

37
0:01:37.18,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin

38
0:01:39.49,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue.

39
0:01:41.94,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And then also, that air goes out through these very efficient filters

40
0:01:46.166,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets.

41
0:01:51.444,000 --> 0:01:52,000
What happens right now, though,

42
0:01:52.945,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is that we have this mixing airflow pattern.

43
0:01:55.036,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So if someone were to actually sneeze,

44
0:01:56.892,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that air would get swirled around multiple times

45
0:01:59.62,000 --> 0:02:02,000
before it even has a chance to go out through the filter.

46
0:02:03.785,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I thought: clearly, this is a pretty serious problem.

47
0:02:07.022,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane,

48
0:02:10.779,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so I decided to build a computer instead.

49
0:02:13.041,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics,

50
0:02:16.337,000 --> 0:02:18,000
what we're able to do is create these simulations

51
0:02:18.962,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that give us higher resolutions

52
0:02:20.78,000 --> 0:02:23,000
than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane.

53
0:02:24.836,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And so how, essentially, this works is you would start out

54
0:02:27.874,000 --> 0:02:28,000
with these 2D drawings --

55
0:02:29.57,000 --> 0:02:32,000
these are floating around in technical papers around the Internet.

56
0:02:32.722,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I take that and then I put it into this 3D-modeling software,

57
0:02:35.639,000 --> 0:02:36,000
really building that 3D model.

58
0:02:37.442,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces,

59
0:02:41.925,000 --> 0:02:44,000
essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it.

60
0:02:45.526,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin,

61
0:02:49.271,000 --> 0:02:5,000
throw in a bunch of physics

62
0:02:50.794,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation.

63
0:02:56.015,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So what we get, actually, with the conventional cabin is this:

64
0:02:59.666,000 --> 0:03:01,000
you'll notice the middle person sneezing,

65
0:03:02.767,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and we go "Splat!" -- it goes right into people's faces.

66
0:03:06.882,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's pretty disgusting.

67
0:03:08.727,000 --> 0:03:1,000
From the front, you'll notice those two passengers

68
0:03:11.099,000 --> 0:03:12,000
sitting next to the central passenger

69
0:03:12.909,000 --> 0:03:13,000
not exactly having a great time.

70
0:03:14.639,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And when we take a look at that from the side,

71
0:03:16.849,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin.

72
0:03:22.017,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The first thing I thought was, "This is no good."

73
0:03:24.391,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So I actually conducted more than 32 different simulations

74
0:03:27.923,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and ultimately, I came up with this solution right here.

75
0:03:31.312,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is what I call a -- patent pending -- Global Inlet Director.

76
0:03:34.852,000 --> 0:03:36,000
With this, we're able to reduce pathogen transmission

77
0:03:37.442,000 --> 0:03:38,000
by about 55 times,

78
0:03:39.234,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190 percent.

79
0:03:42.411,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So how this actually works

80
0:03:44.039,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is we would install this piece of composite material

81
0:03:47.192,000 --> 0:03:49,000
into these existing spots that are already in the plane.

82
0:03:50.184,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So it's very cost-effective to install

83
0:03:52.209,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and we can do this directly overnight.

84
0:03:54.081,000 --> 0:03:57,000
All we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go.

85
0:03:57.653,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And the results that we get are absolutely amazing.

86
0:04:00.536,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns,

87
0:04:04.096,000 --> 0:04:05,000
we can create these walls of air

88
0:04:05.862,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that come down in-between the passengers

89
0:04:08.056,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to create personalized breathing zones.

90
0:04:09.978,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again,

91
0:04:12.987,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but this time, we're able to effectively push that down

92
0:04:15.724,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to the filters for elimination.

93
0:04:18.461,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And same thing from the side,

94
0:04:19.881,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down.

95
0:04:23.682,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So if you take a look again now at the same scenario

96
0:04:27.2,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but with this innovation installed,

97
0:04:28.913,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you'll notice the middle passenger sneezes,

98
0:04:30.953,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and this time, we're pushing that straight down into the outlet

99
0:04:34.05,000 --> 0:04:37,000
before it gets a chance to infect any other people.

100
0:04:37.795,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy

101
0:04:40.943,000 --> 0:04:42,000
are breathing virtually no pathogens at all.

102
0:04:43.2,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Take a look at that from the side as well,

103
0:04:45.752,000 --> 0:04:46,000
you see a very efficient system.

104
0:04:47.331,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And in short, with this system, we win.

105
0:04:51.255,000 --> 0:04:53,000
When we take a look at what this means,

106
0:04:54.168,000 --> 0:04:57,000
what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes,

107
0:04:57.664,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but also if the window-seat passenger sneezes

108
0:05:00.462,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.

109
0:05:03.167,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And so with this solution, what does this mean for the world?

110
0:05:06.278,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, when we take a look at this

111
0:05:09.816,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from the computer simulation into real life,

112
0:05:12.409,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we can see with this 3D model that I built over here,

113
0:05:15.195,000 --> 0:05:17,000
essentially using 3D printing,

114
0:05:17.307,000 --> 0:05:19,000
we can see those same airflow patterns coming down,

115
0:05:20.29,000 --> 0:05:21,000
right to the passengers.

116
0:05:22.92,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In the past, the SARS epidemic actually cost the world

117
0:05:26.014,000 --> 0:05:27,000
about 40 billion dollars.

118
0:05:27.967,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And in the future,

119
0:05:29.15,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world

120
0:05:31.72,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in excess of three trillion dollars.

121
0:05:33.942,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So before, it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service

122
0:05:37.443,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for one to two months,

123
0:05:39.339,000 --> 0:05:42,000
spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars

124
0:05:42.935,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to try to change something.

125
0:05:44.282,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But now, we're able to install something essentially overnight

126
0:05:47.817,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and see results right away.

127
0:05:49.568,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification,

128
0:05:52.798,000 --> 0:05:53,000
flight testing,

129
0:05:54.012,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and going through all of these regulatory approvals processes.

130
0:05:57.028,000 --> 0:06:,000
But it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions

131
0:06:00.116,000 --> 0:06:01,000
are the simplest solutions.

132
0:06:01.935,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And two years ago, even,

133
0:06:05.149,000 --> 0:06:06,000
this project would not have happened,

134
0:06:06.942,000 --> 0:06:08,000
just because the technology then wouldn't have supported it.

135
0:06:09.792,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But now with advanced computing

136
0:06:12.285,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and how developed our Internet is,

137
0:06:14.495,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it's really the golden era for innovation.

138
0:06:17.158,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And so the question I ask all of you today is: why wait?

139
0:06:20.425,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Together, we can build the future today.

140
0:06:23.123,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Thanks.

141
0:06:24.298,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I come from one of the most liberal,

2
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:19,000
tolerant, progressive places in the United States,

3
0:00:19.56,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Seattle, Washington.

4
0:00:21.48,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites.

5
0:00:25.4,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor,

6
0:00:29.24,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,

7
0:00:31.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life

8
0:00:36.32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
exactly as I saw fit.

9
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And in point of fact,

10
0:00:40.36,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind.

11
0:00:43.48,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When I was 19, I dropped out of college --

12
0:00:47.12,000 --> 0:00:49,000
dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.

13
0:00:49.2,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:52.68,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I went on the road as a professional French horn player,

15
0:00:56.96,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which was my lifelong dream.

16
0:00:58.68,000 --> 0:01:,000
I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe,

17
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and I toured for a couple of years

18
0:01:03.4,000 --> 0:01:05,000
with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird.

19
0:01:06.4,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And by the end of my 20s,

20
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.

21
0:01:12.2,000 --> 0:01:13,000
What a great life.

22
0:01:13.44,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And you know, my parents never complained.

23
0:01:17.04,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They supported me all the way through it.

24
0:01:19.04,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It wasn't their dream.

25
0:01:20.96,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They used to tell their neighbors and friends,

26
0:01:23.127,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"Our son, he's taking a gap decade."

27
0:01:26.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:28.88,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And --

29
0:01:30.8,000 --> 0:01:34,000
There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle

30
0:01:35.72,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that I want to tell you about.

31
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,

32
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and I was visiting my parents for Christmas,

33
0:01:42.72,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen.

34
0:01:47.24,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And she was quiet, too quiet.

35
0:01:50.08,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Something was wrong.

36
0:01:51.56,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"

37
0:01:54.76,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you."

38
0:01:59.04,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point?

39
0:02:01.96,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me:

40
0:02:05.68,000 --> 0:02:06,000
have you been voting for Republicans?"

41
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:12.68,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, the truth is,

43
0:02:14.08,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player.

44
0:02:18.48,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But I had a bit of an epiphany,

45
0:02:22.039,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion.

46
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism,

47
0:02:30.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and I want to tell you why that is.

48
0:02:32.84,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It stems from a lifelong interest of mine

49
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in, believe it or not, poverty.

50
0:02:39.92,000 --> 0:02:41,000
See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle,

51
0:02:42.28,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I remember the first time I saw real poverty.

52
0:02:45.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty.

53
0:02:50.32,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That's not even close.

54
0:02:52.08,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face,

55
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
was when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s.

56
0:02:58.36,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.

57
0:03:02.92,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine

58
0:03:06.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of a kid who was my age in East Africa,

59
0:03:10.64,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and there were flies on his face and a distended belly.

60
0:03:13.24,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless.

61
0:03:18.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Some of you remember that picture,

62
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:22,000
not exactly that picture, one just like it.

63
0:03:22.76,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world.

64
0:03:28.24,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Well, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school

65
0:03:33.04,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and I dropped out and dropped in

66
0:03:34.84,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and started my family.

67
0:03:37.496,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?

68
0:03:39.52,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Or to people just like him all over the world?

69
0:03:43.2,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college,

70
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I was looking for the answer:

71
0:03:47.44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
what happened to the world's poorest people?

72
0:03:49.56,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Has it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?

73
0:03:51.84,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I found the answer, and it changed my life,

74
0:03:54.64,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and I want to share it with you.

75
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
See --

76
0:03:59.76,000 --> 0:04:03,000
most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse

77
0:04:04.04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
since we were children, since they saw that vision.

78
0:04:07.2,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?",

79
0:04:10.88,000 --> 0:04:13,000
70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.

80
0:04:14.24,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But here's the truth.

81
0:04:15.76,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking.

82
0:04:19.48,000 --> 0:04:21,000
From 1970 until today,

83
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the percentage of the world's population

84
0:04:25.76,000 --> 0:04:27,000
living in starvation levels,

85
0:04:27.8,000 --> 0:04:3,000
living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation,

86
0:04:31.48,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that percentage has declined

87
0:04:34.72,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by 80 percent.

88
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:39,000
There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty

89
0:04:40.08,000 --> 0:04:41,000
since I was a kid.

90
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I didn't even know about it.

91
0:04:42.92,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This, my friends, that's a miracle.

92
0:04:45.32,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That's something we ought to celebrate.

93
0:04:47.64,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind,

94
0:04:51.92,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and it happened in our lifetimes.

95
0:04:54.48,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Applause)

96
0:04:58.04,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible?

97
0:05:02.92,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.

98
0:05:05.76,000 --> 0:05:06,000
If you want to replicate it

99
0:05:07.12,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and get the next two billion people out of poverty,

100
0:05:09.68,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid,

101
0:05:12.48,000 --> 0:05:14,000
two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters,

102
0:05:15.316,000 --> 0:05:16,000
have been pulled out of poverty.

103
0:05:16.88,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why.

104
0:05:19.386,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And I went in search of an answer.

105
0:05:21.04,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.

106
0:05:23.72,000 --> 0:05:24,000
You know what, I still don't care.

107
0:05:25.4,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists

108
0:05:30.24,000 --> 0:05:32,000
left, right and center.

109
0:05:32.88,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And here it is.

110
0:05:34.56,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Here are the reasons.

111
0:05:35.84,000 --> 0:05:38,000
There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters

112
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:41,000
have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid.

113
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Number one: globalization.

114
0:05:45.08,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Number two: free trade.

115
0:05:47.2,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Number three: property rights.

116
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Number four: rule of law.

117
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Number five: entrepreneurship.

118
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world

119
0:05:59.4,000 --> 0:06:,000
after 1970 that did that.

120
0:06:01.2,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now, I'm not naive.

121
0:06:03.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,

122
0:06:06.12,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need

123
0:06:09.28,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to build a better world.

124
0:06:10.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But that is great.

125
0:06:13.08,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And that's beyond politics.

126
0:06:14.44,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Here's what I learned. This is the epiphany.

127
0:06:16.56,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.

128
0:06:19.6,000 --> 0:06:21,000
At its best, it's about aspiration,

129
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
which is what so many people on this stage talk about,

130
0:06:24.88,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is the aspiration that comes from dreams

131
0:06:28.12,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that are embedded in the free enterprise system.

132
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And we've got to share it with more people.

133
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, I want to tell you about a second epiphany

134
0:06:35.84,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that's related to that first one

135
0:06:38.36,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world,

136
0:06:41.44,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but right here at home.

137
0:06:43.84,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The best quote I've ever heard

138
0:06:45.88,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to summarize the thoughts that I've just given you

139
0:06:49.48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
about pulling people out of poverty

140
0:06:51.56,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is as follows:

141
0:06:53.68,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.

142
0:06:58.56,000 --> 0:07:,000
They have lifted billions out of poverty."

143
0:07:02.4,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Who said it?

144
0:07:03.68,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.

145
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Wrong.

146
0:07:09.48,000 --> 0:07:11,000
President Barack Obama said that.

147
0:07:12.44,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Why do I know it by heart?

148
0:07:14.96,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Because he said it to me.

149
0:07:17.64,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Crazy.

150
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I said, "Hallelujah."

151
0:07:22.8,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But more than that, I said,

152
0:07:25.32,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"What an opportunity."

153
0:07:27.04,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You know what I was thinking?

154
0:07:28.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It was at an event that we were doing on the subject

155
0:07:31.04,000 --> 0:07:32,000
at Georgetown University in May of 2015.

156
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And I thought, this is the solution

157
0:07:35.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to the biggest problem facing America today. What?

158
0:07:39.32,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's coming together around these ideas,

159
0:07:42.12,000 --> 0:07:43,000
liberals and conservatives,

160
0:07:43.88,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to help people who need us the most.

161
0:07:47.48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis,

162
0:07:50.8,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in America and many countries around the world with political polarization.

163
0:07:54.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It's risen to critical, crisis levels.

164
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's unpleasant. It's not right.

165
0:07:59.32,000 --> 0:08:,000
There was an article last year

166
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

167
0:08:03.64,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals

168
0:08:08.08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
published in the West.

169
0:08:09.36,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And it was an article in 2014

170
0:08:11.84,000 --> 0:08:13,000
on political motive asymmetry.

171
0:08:14.28,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon

172
0:08:17.019,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of assuming that your ideology is based in love

173
0:08:21.44,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but your opponents' ideology is based in hate.

174
0:08:24.92,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's common in world conflict.

175
0:08:27.76,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.

176
0:08:32.4,000 --> 0:08:34,000
What the authors of this article found

177
0:08:34.84,000 --> 0:08:38,000
was that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats

178
0:08:39.48,000 --> 0:08:41,000
suffer from political motive asymmetry.

179
0:08:42.08,000 --> 0:08:45,000
A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe

180
0:08:45.96,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate.

181
0:08:49.4,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Think about it. Think about it.

182
0:08:50.96,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Most people are walking around saying,

183
0:08:53.159,000 --> 0:08:56,000
"You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence,

184
0:08:56.36,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I want to help people,

185
0:08:57.6,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but the other guys, they're evil and out to get me."

186
0:09:01.2,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry.

187
0:09:06.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's impossible.

188
0:09:08.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
How do we solve it?

189
0:09:09.84,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences.

190
0:09:13.52,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Let's not minimize the differences. That would be really naïve.

191
0:09:17.24,000 --> 0:09:19,000
There's a lot of good research on this.

192
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:22,000
A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt.

193
0:09:22.48,000 --> 0:09:25,000
He's a psychology professor at New York University.

194
0:09:25.56,000 --> 0:09:29,000
He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people

195
0:09:30.52,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to see how they differ.

196
0:09:32.36,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals

197
0:09:35.194,000 --> 0:09:38,000
have a very different emphasis on what they think is important.

198
0:09:38.234,000 --> 0:09:41,000
For example, Jon Haidt has shown

199
0:09:41.56,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that liberals care about poverty

200
0:09:44.56,000 --> 0:09:46,000
59 percent more than they care about economic liberty.

201
0:09:48.28,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And conservatives care about economic liberty

202
0:09:50.8,000 --> 0:09:53,000
28 percent more than they care about poverty.

203
0:09:54.92,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Irreconcilable differences, right?

204
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We'll never come together. Wrong.

205
0:09:59.52,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That is diversity in which lies our strength.

206
0:10:02.92,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Remember what pulled up the poor.

207
0:10:07.08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It was the obsession with poverty,

208
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
accompanied by the method of economic freedom

209
0:10:14.4,000 --> 0:10:15,000
spreading around the world.

210
0:10:16.04,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We need each other, in other words,

211
0:10:18.6,000 --> 0:10:21,000
if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty.

212
0:10:22.244,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There's no other way.

213
0:10:24.56,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Hmm.

214
0:10:25.92,000 --> 0:10:26,000
How are we going to get that?

215
0:10:28.36,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's a tricky thing, isn't it.

216
0:10:30.04,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We need innovative thinking.

217
0:10:32.28,000 --> 0:10:33,000
A lot of it's on this stage.

218
0:10:33.96,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.

219
0:10:38.28,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We need investment overseas

220
0:10:40.64,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.

221
0:10:45.04,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But you know what we really need?

222
0:10:46.88,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We need a new day in flexible ideology.

223
0:10:51.52,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We need to be less predictable.

224
0:10:54.68,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Don't we?

225
0:10:55.92,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable?

226
0:11:00.52,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Kinda conventional?

227
0:11:02.28,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?

228
0:11:06.44,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Why is that dangerous?

229
0:11:08.2,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Because when we talk in this country about economics,

230
0:11:11.8,000 --> 0:11:12,000
on the right, conservatives,

231
0:11:13.48,000 --> 0:11:17,000
you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government.

232
0:11:18.88,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics,

233
0:11:21.64,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it's always about income inequality.

234
0:11:23.92,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Right? Now those are important things,

235
0:11:27.36,000 --> 0:11:29,000
really important to me, really important to you.

236
0:11:29.64,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But when it comes to lifting people up

237
0:11:32.2,000 --> 0:11:36,000
who are starving and need us today, those are distractions.

238
0:11:36.68,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We need to come together around the best ways

239
0:11:40.12,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal,

240
0:11:43.48,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals

241
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and their obsession with poverty,

242
0:11:49.64,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets.

243
0:11:55.24,000 --> 0:11:59,000
That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country,

244
0:11:59.76,000 --> 0:12:,000
if we choose to take it.

245
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?

246
0:12:05.84,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me.

247
0:12:09.4,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Number one. Action item number one:

248
0:12:12.32,000 --> 0:12:17,000
remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree.

249
0:12:17.56,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's not good enough.

250
0:12:19.28,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us,

251
0:12:23.2,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because there are people who need all of us

252
0:12:25.56,000 --> 0:12:27,000
who are still waiting for these tools.

253
0:12:28.68,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that?

254
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Where does this start? It starts here.

255
0:12:33.96,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You know, all of us in this room, we're blessed.

256
0:12:37.24,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We're blessed with people who listen to us.

257
0:12:39.32,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership.

258
0:12:42.24,000 --> 0:12:46,000
When people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology,

259
0:12:47.2,000 --> 0:12:49,000
then maybe people will listen.

260
0:12:49.64,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Maybe progress will start at that point.

261
0:12:51.84,000 --> 0:12:52,000
That's number one. Number two.

262
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me

263
0:12:58.68,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to be the person specifically who blurs the lines,

264
0:13:03.08,000 --> 0:13:06,000
who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.

265
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
If you're a conservative,

266
0:13:08.44,000 --> 0:13:11,000
be the conservative who is always going on about poverty

267
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.

268
0:13:14.84,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking

269
0:13:18.56,000 --> 0:13:22,000
about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems

270
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
when we use them responsibly.

271
0:13:25.32,000 --> 0:13:27,000
If we do that, we get two things.

272
0:13:28.08,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion

273
0:13:32.68,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past

274
0:13:36.24,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get.

275
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And the second is that we might just be able

276
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country

277
0:13:46.84,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and turn it into a competition of ideas

278
0:13:51.12,000 --> 0:13:53,000
based on solidarity and mutual respect.

279
0:13:54.12,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And then maybe, just maybe,

280
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
we'll all realize that our big differences

281
0:14:02.36,000 --> 0:14:04,000
aren't really that big after all.

282
0:14:05.4,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Thank you.

283
0:14:06.64,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

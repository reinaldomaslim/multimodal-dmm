1
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I have a pretty strong French accent,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so that's going to be clear in a moment.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Maybe a sobering thought

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and something you all know about.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I suspect many of you gave

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
something to the people of Haiti this year.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And there is something else

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I believe in the back of your mind

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you also know.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
That is, every day,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
25,000 children die

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of entirely preventable causes.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I suspect many of you probably gave something

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
towards that problem as well,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but somehow it doesn't happen

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
with the same intensity.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So why is that?

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Well, here is a thought experiment for you.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised --

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
maybe you're a politician in a developing country

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor:

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
How do you go about it?

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Do you believe the people who tell you

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that all we need to do is to spend money?

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
That we know how to eradicate poverty,

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we just need to do more?

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Or do you believe the people who tell you that

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt,

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Or maybe you turn to the past.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
After all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Maybe you look at the past and see.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Has it done any good?

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And, sadly, we don't know.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And worst of all, we will never know.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example.

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Africans have already got a lot of aid.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
These are the blue bars.

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Okay, fine. How do you know what

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
would have happened without the aid?

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Maybe it would have been much worse,

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or maybe it would have been better.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
There's only one Africa.

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So what do you do?

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Or do you focus on your everyday life

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and let the earthquake every eight days

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
continue to happen?

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The thing is, if we don't know

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
whether we are doing any good,

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we are not any better

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
than the Medieval doctors and their leeches.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Is it the leeches? Is it something else?

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We don't know.

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So here are some other questions.

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They're smaller questions,

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but they are not that small.

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Immunization, that's the cheapest way

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to save a child's life.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And the world has spent a lot of money on it:

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The GAVI and the Gates Foundations

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
are each pledging a lot of money towards it,

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And yet, every year

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
at least 25 million children

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
do not get the immunization they should get.

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So this is what you call a "last mile problem."

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The technology is there,

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the infrastructure is there,

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and yet it doesn't happen.

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So you have your million.

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
How do you use your million

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to solve this last mile problem?

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And here's another question:

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Malaria. Malaria kills almost

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
900,000 people every year,

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa,

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
most of them under five.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We already know how to kill malaria,

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but some people come to you and say,

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"You have your millions. How about bed nets?"

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Bed nets are very cheap.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
For 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
an insecticide treated bed net

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and you can teach someone to use them.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them,

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but they have these great contagion benefits.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
If half of a community sleeps under a net,

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the other half also benefits

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because the contagion of the disease spread.

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Societies should be willing to go out

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and subsidize the net, give them for free,

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or, for that matter, pay people to use them

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because of those contagion benefits.

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Not so fast," say other people.

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
"If you give the nets for free,

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
people are not going to value them.

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They're not going to use them,

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets,

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
maybe as fishing nets."

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So, what do you do?

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage,

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or do you make people pay

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in order to make sure that they really value them?

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
How do you know?

113
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And a third question: Education.

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Maybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But how do you do that?

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Do you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Do you provide school lunch?

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
How do you know?

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So here is the thing.

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I cannot answer the big question,

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
whether aid did any good or not.

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But these three questions, I can answer them.

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's not the Middle Ages anymore,

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it's the 21st century.

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And in the 20th century,

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
randomized, controlled trials

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
have revolutionized medicine

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
by allowing us to distinguish

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
between drugs that work

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and drugs that don't work.

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And you can do the same

132
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
randomized, controlled trial for social policy.

133
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You can put social innovation to the same

134
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
rigorous, scientific tests

135
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that we use for drugs.

136
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And in this way, you can take the guesswork

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
out of policy-making

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
by knowing what works,

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
what doesn't work and why.

140
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions.

141
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I start with immunization.

142
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Here's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.

143
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Well, when I started working there,

144
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
about one percent of children

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
were fully immunized.

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's bad, but there are places like that.

147
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, it's not because the vaccines are not there --

148
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
they are there and they are free --

149
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and it's not because parents do not care about their kids.

150
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The same child that is not immunized against measles,

151
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
if they do get measles, parents will spend

152
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
thousands of rupees to help them.

153
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So you get these empty village subcenters

154
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and crowded hospitals.

155
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So what is the problem?

156
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Well, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.

157
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
After all, in this country as well,

158
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
all sorts of myths and misconceptions

159
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
go around immunization.

160
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So if that's the case, that's difficult,

161
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because persuasion is really difficult.

162
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But maybe there is another problem as well.

163
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's going from intention to action.

164
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Imagine you are a mother

165
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in Udaipur District, Rajasthan.

166
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.

167
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And maybe when you get there, what you find is this:

168
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back,

169
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do,

170
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
you will always tend to postpone and postpone,

171
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and eventually it gets too late.

172
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Well, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.

173
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Because A, we can make it easy,

174
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and B, we can maybe

175
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
give people a reason to act today,

176
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
rather than wait till tomorrow.

177
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.

178
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So let's try them.

179
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial

180
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.

181
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So the blue dots

182
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
are selected randomly.

183
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We made it easy -- I'll tell you how in a moment.

184
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In the red dots, we made it easy

185
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and gave people a reason to act now.

186
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.

187
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So we make it easy by organizing

188
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
this monthly camp where people can

189
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
get their kids immunized.

190
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And then you make it easy

191
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and give a reason to act now

192
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.

193
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny.

194
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's never going to convince anybody

195
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to do something that they don't want to do.

196
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
On the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone,

197
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
then it might give you a reason to act today

198
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
rather than later.

199
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
So what do we find?

200
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Well, beforehand, everything is the same.

201
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
That's the beauty of randomization.

202
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Afterwards,

203
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the camp -- just having the camp --

204
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.

205
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's full immunization.

206
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
That's not bad, that's a good improvement.

207
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.

208
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So here you've got your answer.

209
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils,

210
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you multiply immunization rate by six.

211
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.

212
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We cannot keep giving lentils to people."

213
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Well, it turns out it's wrong economics,

214
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because it is cheaper

215
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to give lentils than not to give them.

216
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway,

217
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
the cost per immunization

218
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't.

219
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
How about bed nets?

220
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?

221
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So the answer hinges

222
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
on the answer to three simple questions.

223
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
One is: If people must pay for a bed net,

224
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
are they going to purchase them?

225
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The second one is:

226
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
If I give bed nets for free,

227
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
are people going to use them?

228
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And the third one is:

229
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Do free bed nets discourage future purchase?

230
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The third one is important

231
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because if we think people get used to handouts,

232
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.

233
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now this is a debate that has generated

234
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.

235
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's more ideological than practical,

236
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but it turns out it's an easy question.

237
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We can know the answer to this question.

238
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We can just run an experiment.

239
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results,

240
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
so I'm just going to talk to you about one.

241
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And this one that was in Kenya,

242
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
they went around and distributed to people

243
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
vouchers, discount vouchers.

244
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So people with their voucher

245
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
could get the bed net in the local pharmacy.

246
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And some people get 100 percent discount,

247
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and some people get 20 percent discounts,

248
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and some people get 50 percent discount, etc.

249
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And now we can see what happens.

250
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So, how about the purchasing?

251
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Well, what you can see is that

252
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
when people have to pay for their bed nets,

253
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the coverage rate really falls down a lot.

254
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So even with partial subsidy,

255
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net,

256
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets,

257
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you lose the health immunity, that's not great.

258
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Second thing is, how about the use?

259
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets,

260
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.

261
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
If they get it for free, they use it.

262
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If they have to pay for it, they use it.

263
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
How about the long term?

264
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
In the long term,

265
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
people who got the free bed nets,

266
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
one year later, were offered the option

267
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to purchase a bed net at two dollars.

268
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And people who got the free one

269
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
were actually more likely to purchase the second one

270
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
than people who didn't get a free one.

271
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.

272
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.

273
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So, that's for bed nets. So you will think, "That's great.

274
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."

275
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But what politicians need is a range of options.

276
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They need to know: Out of all the things I could do,

277
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
what is the best way to achieve my goals?

278
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school.

279
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms,

280
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
you could eliminate fees, you could build latrines,

281
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
you could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.

282
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So what's the best?

283
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Well, at some level, we think

284
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
all of these things should work.

285
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively,

286
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
should we go for them?

287
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.

288
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Consider for example

289
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
transporting goods.

290
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Before the canals were invented

291
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in Britain before the Industrial Revolution,

292
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
goods used to go on horse carts.

293
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And then canals were built,

294
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and with the same horseman and the same horse,

295
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
you could carry ten times as much cargo.

296
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So should they have continued

297
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground,

298
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that they would eventually get there?

299
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Well, if that had been the case,

300
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
there would have been no Industrial Revolution.

301
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?

302
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In technology, we spend so much time

303
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
experimenting, fine-tuning,

304
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
getting the absolute cheapest way to do something,

305
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
so why aren't we doing that with social policy?

306
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Well, with experiments, what you can do

307
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is answer a simple question.

308
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend

309
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
on various interventions.

310
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
How many extra years of education

311
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
do you get for your hundred dollars?

312
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Now I'm going to show you

313
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
what we get with various education interventions.

314
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects,

315
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
hire teachers, school meals,

316
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
school uniforms, scholarships.

317
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars,

318
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
you get between one and three extra years of education.

319
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Things that don't work so well is bribing parents,

320
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
just because so many kids are already going to school

321
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that you end up spending a lot of money.

322
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And here are the most surprising results.

323
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Tell people the benefits of education,

324
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that's very cheap to do.

325
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that,

326
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
you get 40 extra years of education.

327
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And, in places where there are worms,

328
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
intestinal worms,

329
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
cure the kids of their worms.

330
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And for every hundred dollars,

331
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
you get almost 30 extra years of education.

332
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So this is not your intuition,

333
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
this is not what people would have gone for,

334
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and yet, these are the programs that work.

335
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We need that kind of information, we need more of it,

336
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and then we need to guide policy.

337
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.

338
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And I cut it into smaller questions,

339
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and I have the answer to these smaller questions.

340
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And they are good, scientific, robust answers.

341
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So let's go back to Haiti for a moment.

342
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
In Haiti, about 200,000 people died --

343
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
actually, a bit more by the latest estimate.

344
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And the response of the world was great:

345
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Two billion dollars got pledged just last month,

346
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
so that's about 10,000 dollars per death.

347
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.

348
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars

349
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
for every child under five who dies,

350
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that would be 90 billion per year

351
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
just for that problem.

352
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And yet it doesn't happen.

353
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So, why is that?

354
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Well, I think what part of the problem is that,

355
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in Haiti, although the problem is huge,

356
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
somehow we understand it, it's localized.

357
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders,

358
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you give your money to Partners In Health,

359
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber,

360
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and they'll helicopter things out and in.

361
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And the problem of poverty is not like that.

362
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So, first, it's mostly invisible;

363
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
second, it's huge;

364
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.

365
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
There's no silver bullet.

366
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty.

367
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And that's very frustrating.

368
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
But look what we just did today.

369
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I gave you three simple answers to three questions:

370
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Give lentils to immunize people,

371
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
provide free bed nets, deworm children.

372
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
With immunization or bed nets,

373
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.

374
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
With deworming, you can get

375
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
an extra year of education for three dollars.

376
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet,

377
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but we can get started.

378
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And maybe we can get started small

379
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
with things that we know are effective.

380
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Here's an example of how this can be powerful.

381
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Deworming.

382
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.

383
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.

384
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And yet, when the young global leader in Davos

385
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
showed the numbers I gave you,

386
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
they started Deworm the World.

387
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And thanks to Deworm the World,

388
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and the effort of many country governments and foundations,

389
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.

390
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So this evidence is powerful.

391
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It can prompt action.

392
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So we should get started now.

393
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It's not going to be easy.

394
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It's a very slow process.

395
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
You have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology

396
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
has to be trumped by practicality.

397
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.

398
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So it's a slow process,

399
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
but there is no other way.

400
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
These economics I'm proposing,

401
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
it's like 20th century medicine.

402
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
It's a slow, deliberative process

403
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
of discovery.

404
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
There is no miracle cure,

405
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
but modern medicine is saving

406
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
millions of lives every year,

407
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and we can do the same thing.

408
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question

409
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
that I started with at the beginning.

410
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I cannot tell you

411
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference,

412
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but can we come back here in 30 years

413
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and say, "What we have done,

414
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
it really prompted a change for the better."

415
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I believe we can and I hope we will.

416
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Thank you.

417
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Applause)

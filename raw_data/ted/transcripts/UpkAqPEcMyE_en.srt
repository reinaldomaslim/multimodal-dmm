1
0:00:12.881,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I have a question.

2
0:00:15.422,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Can a computer write poetry?

3
0:00:18.959,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is a provocative question.

4
0:00:21.715,000 --> 0:00:22,000
You think about it for a minute,

5
0:00:23.457,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like:

6
0:00:26.769,000 --> 0:00:27,000
What is a computer?

7
0:00:28.71,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What is poetry?

8
0:00:30.707,000 --> 0:00:31,000
What is creativity?

9
0:00:33.65,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But these are questions

10
0:00:34.846,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer,

11
0:00:37.94,000 --> 0:00:39,000
not in a single TED Talk.

12
0:00:40.188,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So we're going to have to try a different approach.

13
0:00:42.657,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So up here, we have two poems.

14
0:00:45.839,000 --> 0:00:47,000
One of them is written by a human,

15
0:00:48.139,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and the other one's written by a computer.

16
0:00:50.754,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which.

17
0:00:53.858,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Have a go:

18
0:00:55.038,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.

19
0:00:59.118,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Am I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?

20
0:01:02.536,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Poem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning /

21
0:01:05.859,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)

22
0:01:10.13,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Alright, time's up.

23
0:01:11.513,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.

24
0:01:17.547,000 --> 0:01:18,000
OK, most of you.

25
0:01:19.061,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.

26
0:01:23.172,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Very brave of you,

27
0:01:24.855,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake.

28
0:01:29.784,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The second one was written by an algorithm

29
0:01:32.757,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day

30
0:01:36.473,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and then regenerated it algorithmically,

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on.

32
0:01:43.218,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So let's try another test.

33
0:01:46.398,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Again, you haven't got ages to read this,

34
0:01:48.515,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so just trust your gut.

35
0:01:50.151,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating

36
0:01:54.22,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals

37
0:01:58.547,000 --> 0:02:02,000
are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.

38
0:02:02.631,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful!

39
0:02:06.64,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)

40
0:02:11.022,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Alright, time's up.

41
0:02:12.204,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So if you think the first poem was written by a human,

42
0:02:15.365,000 --> 0:02:16,000
put your hand up.

43
0:02:17.687,000 --> 0:02:18,000
OK.

44
0:02:18.865,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And if you think the second poem was written by a human,

45
0:02:21.564,000 --> 0:02:22,000
put your hand up.

46
0:02:23.779,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.

47
0:02:28.157,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It was much harder.

48
0:02:29.617,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The answer is,

49
0:02:31.353,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter,

50
0:02:34.86,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that was created back in the 1970s,

51
0:02:37.886,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara,

52
0:02:41.099,000 --> 0:02:43,000
who happens to be one of my favorite human poets.

53
0:02:44.631,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:48.046,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry.

55
0:02:52.018,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,

56
0:02:56.589,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in order to answer the question,

57
0:02:58.177,000 --> 0:02:59,000
can computers think?

58
0:03:00.245,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able

59
0:03:03.039,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human,

60
0:03:06.141,000 --> 0:03:08,000
with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell

61
0:03:08.935,000 --> 0:03:1,000
whether they are talking to a computer or a human,

62
0:03:11.925,000 --> 0:03:13,000
then the computer can be said to have intelligence.

63
0:03:15.27,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I,

64
0:03:18.589,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we created a Turing test for poetry online.

65
0:03:21.601,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's called bot or not,

66
0:03:22.902,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and you can go and play it for yourselves.

67
0:03:24.97,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But basically, it's the game we just played.

68
0:03:27.245,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You're presented with a poem,

69
0:03:28.797,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer

70
0:03:31.849,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and you have to guess.

71
0:03:33.039,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online,

72
0:03:36.254,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so we have results.

73
0:03:37.727,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And what are the results?

74
0:03:39.704,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human

75
0:03:42.607,000 --> 0:03:45,000
30 percent of the time that it was a human,

76
0:03:45.65,000 --> 0:03:47,000
then it passes the Turing test for intelligence.

77
0:03:48.625,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We have poems on the bot or not database

78
0:03:51.087,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking

79
0:03:54.09,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it was written by a human.

80
0:03:55.959,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So, I think we have an answer to our question.

81
0:03:59.546,000 --> 0:04:01,000
According to the logic of the Turing test,

82
0:04:01.918,000 --> 0:04:02,000
can a computer write poetry?

83
0:04:03.87,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Well, yes, absolutely it can.

84
0:04:07.782,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable

85
0:04:10.152,000 --> 0:04:11,000
with this answer, that's OK.

86
0:04:12.103,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it,

87
0:04:14.443,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.

88
0:04:18.594,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Let's play our third and final test.

89
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Again, you're going to have to read

90
0:04:23.774,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and tell me which you think is human.

91
0:04:25.707,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Poem 1: Red flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons.

92
0:04:29.449,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Ribbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...)

93
0:04:33.794,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil

94
0:04:37.736,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; /

95
0:04:41.206,000 --> 0:04:44,000
'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...)

96
0:04:44.932,000 --> 0:04:45,000
OK, time is up.

97
0:04:46.555,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.

98
0:04:51.973,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.

99
0:04:55.035,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Whoa, that's a lot more people.

100
0:04:58.327,000 --> 0:05:,000
So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1

101
0:05:01.319,000 --> 0:05:04,000
was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein.

102
0:05:06.1,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP.

103
0:05:11.162,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply,

104
0:05:14.505,000 --> 0:05:15,000
how RKCP works.

105
0:05:16.873,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil,

106
0:05:20.747,000 --> 0:05:22,000
who's a director of engineering at Google

107
0:05:22.993,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and a firm believer in artificial intelligence.

108
0:05:25.822,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So, you give RKCP a source text,

109
0:05:29.837,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language,

110
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and then it regenerates language

111
0:05:36.302,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that emulates that first text.

112
0:05:38.854,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So in the poem we just saw before,

113
0:05:40.991,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human,

114
0:05:43.64,000 --> 0:05:44,000
it was fed a bunch of poems

115
0:05:45.214,000 --> 0:05:47,000
by a poet called Emily Dickinson

116
0:05:47.273,000 --> 0:05:49,000
it looked at the way she used language,

117
0:05:49.486,000 --> 0:05:5,000
learned the model,

118
0:05:50.675,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.

119
0:05:56.732,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But the important thing to know about RKCP

120
0:05:58.934,000 --> 0:06:,000
is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.

121
0:06:02.359,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The language is just raw material,

122
0:06:04.659,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish,

123
0:06:06.843,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day.

124
0:06:11.046,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's just raw material.

125
0:06:13.38,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And nevertheless, it's able to create a poem

126
0:06:16.101,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem,

127
0:06:19.452,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and Gertrude Stein is a human.

128
0:06:22.846,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test.

129
0:06:27.94,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem

130
0:06:33.143,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that fools a majority of human judges into thinking

131
0:06:36.905,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that it was written by a computer.

132
0:06:39.176,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Therefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test,

133
0:06:43.341,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Gertrude Stein is a computer.

134
0:06:45.281,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:47.358,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Feeling confused?

136
0:06:49.193,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I think that's fair enough.

137
0:06:51.546,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So far we've had humans that write like humans,

138
0:06:55.686,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we have computers that write like computers,

139
0:06:58.821,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we have computers that write like humans,

140
0:07:01.9,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but we also have, perhaps most confusingly,

141
0:07:05.556,000 --> 0:07:07,000
humans that write like computers.

142
0:07:08.938,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So what do we take from all of this?

143
0:07:11.611,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human

144
0:07:14.792,000 --> 0:07:15,000
than Gertrude Stein?

145
0:07:16.065,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?

146
0:07:19.135,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:20.711,000 --> 0:07:22,000
These are questions I've been asking myself

148
0:07:23.058,000 --> 0:07:24,000
for around two years now,

149
0:07:24.547,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and I don't have any answers.

150
0:07:26.88,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But what I do have are a bunch of insights

151
0:07:29.234,000 --> 0:07:31,000
about our relationship with technology.

152
0:07:32.999,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So my first insight is that, for some reason,

153
0:07:36.632,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we associate poetry with being human.

154
0:07:40.197,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?"

155
0:07:43.936,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we're also asking,

156
0:07:45.153,000 --> 0:07:46,000
"What does it mean to be human

157
0:07:46.975,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and how do we put boundaries around this category?

158
0:07:50.171,000 --> 0:07:53,000
How do we say who or what can be part of this category?"

159
0:07:54.376,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This is an essentially philosophical question, I believe,

160
0:07:57.751,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and it can't be answered with a yes or no test,

161
0:08:00.004,000 --> 0:08:01,000
like the Turing test.

162
0:08:01.805,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I also believe that Alan Turing understood this,

163
0:08:04.874,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and that when he devised his test back in 1950,

164
0:08:08.203,000 --> 0:08:1,000
he was doing it as a philosophical provocation.

165
0:08:13.124,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry,

166
0:08:18.689,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we're not really testing the capacity of the computers

167
0:08:22.173,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because poetry-generating algorithms,

168
0:08:25.09,000 --> 0:08:29,000
they're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s.

169
0:08:31.055,000 --> 0:08:34,000
What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather,

170
0:08:34.197,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness.

171
0:08:40.313,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So, what I've figured out,

172
0:08:43.066,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we've seen this when earlier today,

173
0:08:46.062,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we say that William Blake is more of a human

174
0:08:48.564,000 --> 0:08:49,000
than Gertrude Stein.

175
0:08:50.153,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake

176
0:08:52.639,000 --> 0:08:53,000
was actually more human

177
0:08:54.491,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer.

178
0:08:57.533,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It simply means that the category of the human is unstable.

179
0:09:03.45,000 --> 0:09:05,000
This has led me to understand

180
0:09:05.548,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that the human is not a cold, hard fact.

181
0:09:08.832,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions

182
0:09:11.988,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and something that changes over time.

183
0:09:16.671,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So my final insight is that the computer, more or less,

184
0:09:21.174,000 --> 0:09:25,000
works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human

185
0:09:25.204,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that we show it.

186
0:09:26.958,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We show it Emily Dickinson,

187
0:09:28.866,000 --> 0:09:3,000
it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.

188
0:09:31.768,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We show it William Blake,

189
0:09:33.626,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that's what it reflects back to us.

190
0:09:35.935,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We show it Gertrude Stein,

191
0:09:37.798,000 --> 0:09:39,000
what we get back is Gertrude Stein.

192
0:09:41.083,000 --> 0:09:43,000
More than any other bit of technology,

193
0:09:43.475,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.

194
0:09:50.061,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing

195
0:09:52.372,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a lot about artificial intelligence recently.

196
0:09:56.694,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And much of the conversation is,

197
0:10:00.292,000 --> 0:10:01,000
can we build it?

198
0:10:02.383,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Can we build an intelligent computer?

199
0:10:05.542,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Can we build a creative computer?

200
0:10:08.329,000 --> 0:10:1,000
What we seem to be asking over and over

201
0:10:10.466,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is can we build a human-like computer?

202
0:10:13.961,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But what we've seen just now

203
0:10:15.541,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is that the human is not a scientific fact,

204
0:10:18.653,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea

205
0:10:22.207,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and one that changes over time.

206
0:10:24.762,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas

207
0:10:27.938,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of artificial intelligence in the future,

208
0:10:30.348,000 --> 0:10:31,000
we shouldn't only be asking ourselves,

209
0:10:32.277,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"Can we build it?"

210
0:10:33.669,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But we should also be asking ourselves,

211
0:10:35.587,000 --> 0:10:38,000
"What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?"

212
0:10:39.82,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is an essentially philosophical idea,

213
0:10:42.537,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and it's one that can't be answered with software alone,

214
0:10:45.558,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.

215
0:10:51.04,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Thank you.

216
0:10:52.217,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Applause)

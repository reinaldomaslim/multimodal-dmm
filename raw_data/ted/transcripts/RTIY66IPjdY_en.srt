1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu --

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and we'll hear about that from the

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:31,000
brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is

5
0:00:34.358,000 --> 0:00:36,000
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension --

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
all of which are completely preventable for at

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
least 95 percent of people

8
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:42,000
just by changing diet and lifestyle.

9
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And what's happening is that there's a

10
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
globalization of illness occurring, that people

11
0:00:46.263,000 --> 0:00:48,000
are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and

12
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
die like us. And in one generation, for example,

13
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of

14
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one

15
0:00:56.167,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease

16
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
equals the HIV and AIDS deaths

17
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in most countries.

18
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So there's a critical window of opportunity we

19
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:06,000
have to make an important difference that can

20
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:08,000
affect the lives of literally millions of people,

21
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and practice preventive medicine on a global

22
0:01:11.12,000 --> 0:01:11,000
scale.

23
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more

24
0:01:14.215,000 --> 0:01:16,000
people -- not only in this country, but also

25
0:01:16.335,000 --> 0:01:18,000
worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet

26
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
it's completely preventable for almost everybody.

27
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's not only preventable; it's actually

28
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
reversible. And for the last almost 29 years,

29
0:01:26.167,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we've been able to show that by simply changing

30
0:01:28.43,000 --> 0:01:3,000
diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech,

31
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how

32
0:01:33.358,000 --> 0:01:35,000
powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost

33
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
interventions can be like -- quantitative

34
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
arteriography, before and after a year, and

35
0:01:40.072,000 --> 0:01:4,000
cardiac PET scans.

36
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We showed a few months ago -- we published the

37
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
first study showing you can actually stop or

38
0:01:45.12,000 --> 0:01:47,000
reverse the progression of prostate cancer by

39
0:01:47.287,000 --> 0:01:49,000
making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent

40
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of

41
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the

42
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:56,000
control group.

43
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the

44
0:01:59.12,000 --> 0:02:,000
prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can

45
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:02,000
see it diminishing after a year.

46
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now there is an epidemic of obesity: two-thirds of

47
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning

48
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the

49
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:13,000
past 10 years, and this may be the first

50
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:15,000
generation in which our kids live a shorter life

51
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's

52
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:18,000
preventable.

53
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now these are not election returns, these are the

54
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
people -- the number of the people who are obese

55
0:02:24.31,000 --> 0:02:27,000
by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are

56
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you

57
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96,

58
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:4,000
'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're

59
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:42,000
kind of devolving. (Laughter)

60
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now what can we do about this? Well, you know, the

61
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:49,000
diet that we've found that can reverse heart

62
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:51,000
disease and cancer is an Asian diet.

63
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we

64
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:54,000
are, which is why they're starting to get sick

65
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:55,000
like we are.

66
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So I've been working with a lot of the big food

67
0:02:58,000 --> 0:02:59,000
companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip

68
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods,

69
0:03:02.405,000 --> 0:03:04,000
like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's,

70
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon

71
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good

72
0:03:09.167,000 --> 0:03:09,000
business.

73
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from

74
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At

75
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came

76
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:15,000
from their better foods.

77
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And so if we can do that, then we can free up

78
0:03:18.167,000 --> 0:03:2,000
resources for buying drugs that you really do need

79
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for

80
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
preventing avian flu. Thank you.

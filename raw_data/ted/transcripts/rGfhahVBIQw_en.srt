1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which was to interview three politicians every day.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And from that much contact with politicians,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They have what I called "logorrhea dementia,"

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But what they do have is incredible social skills.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
When you meet them, they lock into you,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
they look you in the eye,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
they invade your personal space,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
they massage the back of your head.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who kept his hand on my inner thigh

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
throughout the whole meal -- squeezing it.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I once -- this was years ago --

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And they were friends, and they hugged each other

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And they were moving and grinding

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and moving their arms up and down each other.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this."

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But they have those social skills.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Another case:

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Last election cycle,

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons:

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And he's going into a diner.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and says, "What village are you from in New Hampshire?"

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And then he describes the home he owned in their village.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And so he goes around the room,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and then as he's leaving the diner,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
he first-names almost everybody he's just met.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was like, "Okay, that's social skill."

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But the paradox is,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that social awareness vanishes

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and they start talking like accountants.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So in the course of my career,

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I have covered a series of failures.

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
We sent economists in the Soviet Union

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
with privatization plans when it broke up,

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and what they really lacked was social trust.

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We invaded Iraq with a military

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We had a financial regulatory regime

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
based on the assumptions

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that traders were rational creatures

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
who wouldn't do anything stupid.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
For 30 years, I've been covering school reform

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes --

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
charters, private schools, vouchers --

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but we've had disappointing results year after year.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And the fact is, people learn from people they love.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And if you're not talking about the individual relationship

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
between a teacher and a student,

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you're not talking about that reality.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But that reality is expunged

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
from our policy-making process.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And so that's led to a question for me:

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
completely dehumanized

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
when they think about policy?

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And I came to the conclusion,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
this is a symptom of a larger problem.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
based on the notion

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that we're divided selves,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that reason is separated from the emotions

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and that society progresses

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to the extent that reason can suppress the passions.

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And it's led to a view of human nature

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that we're rational individuals

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
who respond in straightforward ways to incentives,

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it's led to ways of seeing the world

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
where people try to use the assumptions of physics

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to measure how human behavior is.

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it's produced a great amputation,

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a shallow view of human nature.

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We're really good at talking about material things,

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but we're really bad at talking about emotions.

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We're really good at talking about skills

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and safety and health;

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we're really bad at talking about character.

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher,

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
said that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of virtue, honor, goodness,

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but we no longer have a system

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
by which to connect them."

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so this has led to a shallow path in politics,

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but also in a whole range of human endeavors.

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You can see it in the way we raise our young kids.

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon

97
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and you watch the kids come out,

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.

100
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You see these cars that drive up --

101
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos,

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car,

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy --

104
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that's fine.

105
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms,

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
who are highly successful career women

107
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And you can usually tell the uber-moms

109
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
because they actually weigh less than their own children.

110
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So at the moment of conception,

112
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
they're doing little butt exercises.

113
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Babies flop out,

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Driving them home, and they want them to be enlightened,

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so they take them to Ben & Jerry's ice cream company

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
with its own foreign policy.

118
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In one of my books,

119
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I joke that Ben & Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste --

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
doesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave.

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It would be a big seller.

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula,

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International.

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They buy these seaweed-based snacks there

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
called Veggie Booty with Kale,

129
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
which is for kids who come home and say,

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer."

131
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And so the kids are raised in a certain way,

133
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure --

134
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
SAT prep, oboe, soccer practice.

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs,

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and sometimes they make a success of themselves

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And sometimes you can see them at vacation places

139
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
like Jackson Hole or Aspen.

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And they've become elegant and slender --

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
they don't really have thighs;

142
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
they just have one elegant calve on top of another.

143
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
They have kids of their own,

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people,

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein,

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
their daughters looks like Halle Berry -- I don't know how they've done that.

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They get there and they realize

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights.

150
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs --

151
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
all look like velociraptors,

152
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
all named after Jane Austen characters.

153
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life,

154
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but they've decided, "I've been successful at everything;

155
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I'm just not going to die."

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so they hire personal trainers;

157
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they're popping Cialis like breath mints.

158
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You see them on the mountains up there.

159
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They're cross-country skiing up the mountain

160
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with these grim expressions

161
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.

162
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

163
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And as they whiz by you,

164
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet

165
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
going up the hill.

166
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so this is part of what life is,

168
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but it's not all of what life is.

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And over the past few years,

170
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and a deeper view of who we are.

172
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And it's not based on theology or philosophy,

173
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it's in the study of the mind,

174
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
across all these spheres of research,

175
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists,

176
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
behavioral economists, psychologists,

177
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
sociology,

178
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we're developing a revolution in consciousness.

179
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And when you synthesize it all,

180
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it's giving us a new view of human nature.

181
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature,

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment.

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And I think when you synthesize this research,

184
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
you start with three key insights.

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The first insight is

186
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the unconscious mind does most of the work.

188
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And so one way to formulate that is

189
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,

190
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of which it can be consciously aware of about 40.

191
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And this leads to oddities.

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
One of my favorite is that people named Dennis

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
are disproportionately likely to become dentists,

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
people named Lawrence become lawyers,

195
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because unconsciously we gravitate toward things

196
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that sound familiar,

197
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.

198
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

199
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Another finding is that the unconscious,

200
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
far from being dumb and sexualized,

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is actually quite smart.

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.

203
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.

204
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And the way you should do that

205
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is study the furniture,

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and then a few days later, go with your gut,

208
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because unconsciously you've figured it out.

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The second insight

210
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is that emotions are at the center of our thinking.

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
People with strokes and lesions

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in the emotion-processing parts of the brain

213
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
are not super smart,

214
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
they're actually sometimes quite helpless.

215
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And the "giant" in the field is in the room tonight

216
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and is speaking tomorrow morning -- Antonio Damasio.

217
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And one of the things he's really shown us

218
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is that emotions are not separate from reason,

219
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
but they are the foundation of reason

220
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
because they tell us what to value.

221
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And so reading and educating your emotions

222
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is one of the central activities of wisdom.

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Now I'm a middle-aged guy.

224
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.

225
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys.

226
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They put them into a brain scan machine --

227
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care --

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and they had them watch a horror movie,

229
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.

230
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And the brain scans were identical in both activities.

231
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It was just sheer terror.

232
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So me talking about emotion

233
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is like Gandhi talking about gluttony,

234
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but it is the central organizing process

235
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
of the way we think.

236
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It tells us what to imprint.

237
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The brain is the record of the feelings of a life.

238
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And the third insight

239
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals.

240
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We're social animals, not rational animals.

241
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We emerge out of relationships,

242
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another.

243
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And so when we see another person,

244
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we reenact in our own minds

245
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
what we see in their minds.

246
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
When we watch a car chase in a movie,

247
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.

248
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
When we watch pornography,

249
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
it's a little like having sex,

250
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
though probably not as good.

251
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And we see this when lovers walk down the street,

252
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia

253
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
gets caught up in an emotional contagion,

254
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the deep interpenetration.

255
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And this revolution in who we are

256
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
gives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,

257
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
a different way, most importantly,

258
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
of seeing human capital.

259
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We are now children of the French Enlightenment.

260
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.

261
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But I think this research shows

262
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,

263
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
with David Hume, Adam Smith,

264
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
actually had a better handle on who we are --

265
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,

266
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and our sentiments are often trustworthy.

267
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And this work corrects that bias in our culture,

268
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that dehumanizing bias.

269
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It gives us a deeper sense

270
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of what it actually takes

271
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for us to thrive in this life.

272
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
When we think about human capital

273
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we think about the things we can measure easily --

274
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
things like grades, SAT's, degrees,

275
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the number of years in schooling.

276
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,

277
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
are things that are deeper,

278
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
things we don't really even have words for.

279
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And so let me list just a couple of the things

280
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I think this research points us toward trying to understand.

281
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
The first gift, or talent, is mindsight --

282
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the ability to enter into other people's minds

283
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and learn what they have to offer.

284
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Babies come with this ability.

285
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Meltzoff, who's at the University of Washington,

286
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.

287
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
He wagged his tongue at the baby.

288
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The baby wagged her tongue back.

289
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind

290
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and to download what they find --

291
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
their models of how to understand reality.

292
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In the United States, 55 percent of babies

293
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
have a deep two-way conversation with Mom

294
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and they learn models to how to relate to other people.

295
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And those people who have models of how to relate

296
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
have a huge head start in life.

297
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study

298
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
in which they could predict

299
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months,

300
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
who was going to graduate from high school,

301
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
based on who had good attachment with mom.

302
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships.

303
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
They are what we call avoidantly attached.

304
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
They have trouble relating to other people.

305
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
They go through life

306
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
like sailboats tacking into the wind --

307
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
wanting to get close to people,

308
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but not really having the models of how to do that.

309
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And so this is one skill

310
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another.

311
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
A second skill is equipoise,

312
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
the ability to have the serenity

313
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to read the biases and failures in your own mind.

314
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So for example, we are overconfidence machines.

315
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Ninety-five percent of our professors report

316
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that they are above-average teachers.

317
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Ninety-six percent of college students

318
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
say they have above-average social skills.

319
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Time magazine asked Americans, "Are you in the top one percent of earners?"

320
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners.

321
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Laughter)

322
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This is a gender-linked trait, by the way.

323
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Men drown at twice the rate of women,

324
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
because men think they can swim across that lake.

325
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But some people have the ability and awareness

326
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of their own biases, their own overconfidence.

327
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
They have epistemological modesty.

328
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.

329
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions

330
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to the strength of their evidence.

331
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
They are curious.

332
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ.

333
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The third trait is metis,

334
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word.

335
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's a sensitivity to the physical environment,

336
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
the ability to pick out patterns in an environment --

337
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
derive a gist.

338
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
One of my colleagues at the Times

339
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
did a great story about soldiers in Iraq

340
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
who could look down a street and detect somehow

341
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
whether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street.

342
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
They couldn't tell you how they did it,

343
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,

344
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and they were more often right than wrong.

345
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The third is what you might call sympathy,

346
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the ability to work within groups.

347
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And that comes in tremendously handy,

348
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
because groups are smarter than individuals.

349
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And face-to-face groups are much smarter

350
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
than groups that communicate electronically,

351
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.

352
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And the effectiveness of a group

353
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is not determined by the IQ of the group;

354
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
it's determined by how well they communicate,

355
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
how often they take turns in conversation.

356
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Then you could talk about a trait like blending.

357
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Any child can say, "I'm a tiger," pretend to be a tiger.

358
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It seems so elementary.

359
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
But in fact, it's phenomenally complicated

360
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
to take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger"

361
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and blend them together.

362
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But this is the source of innovation.

363
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
What Picasso did, for example,

364
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
was take the concept "Western art"

365
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and the concept "African masks"

366
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and blend them together --

367
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
not only the geometry,

368
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but the moral systems entailed in them.

369
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.

370
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And then the final thing I'll mention

371
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is something you might call limerence.

372
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And this is not an ability;

373
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
it's a drive and a motivation.

374
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.

375
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
The unconscious mind hungers

376
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
for those moments of transcendence,

377
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
when the skull line disappears

378
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and we are lost in a challenge or a task --

379
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
when a craftsman feels lost in his craft,

380
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
when a naturalist feels at one with nature,

381
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
when a believer feels at one with God's love.

382
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for.

383
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And many of us feel it in love

384
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
when lovers feel fused.

385
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And one of the most beautiful descriptions

386
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
I've come across in this research

387
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
of how minds interpenetrate

388
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
was written by a great theorist and scientist

389
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana.

390
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
He was married to a woman named Carol,

391
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and they had a wonderful relationship.

392
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
When their kids were five and two,

393
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.

394
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And Hofstadter wrote a book

395
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
called "I Am a Strange Loop."

396
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
In the course of that book, he describes a moment --

397
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
just months after Carol has died --

398
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
he comes across her picture on the mantel,

399
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
or on a bureau in his bedroom.

400
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And here's what he wrote:

401
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
"I looked at her face,

402
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and I looked so deeply

403
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that I felt I was behind her eyes.

404
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And all at once I found myself saying

405
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
as tears flowed,

406
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
'That's me. That's me.'

407
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And those simple words

408
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
brought back many thoughts that I had had before,

409
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
about the fusion of our souls

410
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
into one higher-level entity,

411
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
about the fact that at the core of both our souls

412
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children,

413
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
about the notion that those hopes

414
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
were not separate or distinct hopes,

415
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
but were just one hope,

416
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
one clear thing that defined us both,

417
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that welded us into a unit --

418
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined

419
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
before being married and having children.

420
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I realized that, though Carol had died,

421
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that core piece of her had not died at all,

422
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
but had lived on very determinedly in my brain."

423
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom.

424
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Through his suffering, Hofstadter understood

425
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
how deeply interpenetrated we are.

426
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Through the policy failures of the last 30 years,

427
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
we have come to acknowledge, I think,

428
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
how shallow our view of human nature has been.

429
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And now as we confront that shallowness

430
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and the failures that derive from our inability

431
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
to get the depths of who we are,

432
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
comes this revolution in consciousness --

433
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
these people in so many fields

434
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
exploring the depth of our nature

435
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and coming away with this enchanted,

436
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
this new humanism.

437
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious,

438
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
it had a vast effect on the climate of the times.

439
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Now we are discovering a more accurate vision

440
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
of the unconscious, of who we are deep inside,

441
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and it's going to have a wonderful and profound

442
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and humanizing effect on our culture.

443
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Thank you.

444
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
(Applause)

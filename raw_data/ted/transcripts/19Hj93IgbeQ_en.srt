1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs

2
0:00:15.461,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm going to show you today.

3
0:00:16.835,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It was taken 18 years ago.

4
0:00:18.437,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was 19 years old at the time.

5
0:00:19.962,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I had just returned

6
0:00:21.137,000 --> 0:00:23,000
from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time --

7
0:00:23.947,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a little over 200 feet.

8
0:00:25.129,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I had caught this little fish.

9
0:00:27.098,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It turns out that particular one was the first of its kind

10
0:00:29.892,000 --> 0:00:3,000
ever taken alive.

11
0:00:31.07,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm not just an ichthyologist, I'm a bona fide fish nerd.

12
0:00:33.768,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And to a fish nerd, this is some pretty exciting stuff.

13
0:00:36.489,000 --> 0:00:38,000
More exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo

14
0:00:39.434,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is a guy named Jack Randall,

15
0:00:40.794,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the greatest living ichthyologist on earth --

16
0:00:43.601,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the Grand Poobah of fish nerds, if you will.

17
0:00:46.165,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And so, it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time.

18
0:00:51.091,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It set the course for the rest of my life.

19
0:00:53.215,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But really, the most significant, most profound thing about this picture

20
0:00:56.686,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed

21
0:00:59.449,000 --> 0:01:,000
from the neck down.

22
0:01:00.635,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I made a really stupid kind of mistake

23
0:01:03.008,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that most 19-year-old males do when they think they're immortal,

24
0:01:06.072,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and I got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed,

25
0:01:08.667,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and had to be flown back for treatment.

26
0:01:12.316,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I learned two really important things that day.

27
0:01:14.79,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The first thing I learned -- well, I'm mortal. That's a really big one.

28
0:01:18.204,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And the second thing I learned was that I knew, with profound certainty,

29
0:01:21.677,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life.

30
0:01:24.941,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I had to focus all my energies

31
0:01:26.593,000 --> 0:01:29,000
towards going to find new species of things

32
0:01:29.736,000 --> 0:01:3,000
down on deep coral reefs.

33
0:01:31.508,000 --> 0:01:34,000
When you think of a coral reef, this is what most people think of:

34
0:01:34.649,000 --> 0:01:35,000
these big, hard, elaborate corals,

35
0:01:36.443,000 --> 0:01:38,000
lots of bright, colorful fishes and things.

36
0:01:38.486,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But this is really just the tip of the iceberg.

37
0:01:40.716,000 --> 0:01:42,000
If you look at this diagram of a coral reef,

38
0:01:42.831,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we know a lot about that part up near the top.

39
0:01:45.005,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The reason we know so much about it

40
0:01:47.36,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it.

41
0:01:50.224,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There is a problem with scuba, though,

42
0:01:52.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go.

43
0:01:55.152,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It turns out that depth is about 200 feet.

44
0:01:57.191,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I'll get into why that is in just a minute,

45
0:01:59.532,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but the point is, scuba divers generally stay less than 100 feet deep,

46
0:02:03.082,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and very rarely go much below this, at least, not with any kind of sanity.

47
0:02:06.63,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So to go deeper, most biologists have turned to submersibles.

48
0:02:10.186,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now, submersibles are great, wonderful things,

49
0:02:12.36,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but if you're going to spend 30,000 dollars a day to use one of these things

50
0:02:16.039,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and it's capable of going 2,000 feet,

51
0:02:17.857,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you're not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet,

52
0:02:21.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
you're going to go way down deep.

53
0:02:23.158,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So the bottom line is, almost all research using submersibles

54
0:02:26.051,000 --> 0:02:27,000
has taken place well below 500 feet.

55
0:02:27.815,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, it's pretty obvious at this point

56
0:02:29.661,000 --> 0:02:3,000
there's a zone here in the middle.

57
0:02:31.313,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That's the zone

58
0:02:32.608,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness.

59
0:02:35.338,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I want to find out what's in this zone; we know almost nothing about it.

60
0:02:38.76,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Scuba divers can't get there, submarines go right on past it.

61
0:02:41.761,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It took me a year to learn to walk again after my diving accident in Palau.

62
0:02:45.332,000 --> 0:02:46,000
During that year,

63
0:02:46.507,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving

64
0:02:49.97,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and how to overcome these limitations.

65
0:02:51.807,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm just going to show you a basic idea.

66
0:02:53.753,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We're all breathing air right now.

67
0:02:55.408,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,

68
0:02:57.344,000 --> 0:02:59,000
20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.

69
0:02:59.447,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's in our lungs.

70
0:03:00.621,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And there's a phenomenon called Henry's law,

71
0:03:02.709,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that says gases will dissolve into a fluid

72
0:03:04.739,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in proportion to the partial pressures you're exposing them to.

73
0:03:07.737,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, basically the gas dissolves into our body.

74
0:03:09.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The oxygen is bound by metabolism, we use it for energy.

75
0:03:12.572,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The nitrogen sort of floats around in our blood and tissues.

76
0:03:15.417,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That's fine, it's how we're designed.

77
0:03:17.36,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The problem happens when you go underwater.

78
0:03:19.395,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The deeper you go underwater, the higher the pressure is.

79
0:03:22.222,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet,

80
0:03:24.787,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers,

81
0:03:27.336,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you'd get this pressure effect.

82
0:03:28.858,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The effect of that pressure is you have an increased density of gas molecules

83
0:03:32.565,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in every breath you take.

84
0:03:33.805,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Over time, those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues

85
0:03:37.668,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and start to fill you up.

86
0:03:39.105,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now, if you were to go down to, say, 300 feet,

87
0:03:41.772,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs,

88
0:03:44.734,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you've got 10 times as many gas molecules in your lungs.

89
0:03:47.386,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And, sure enough, they dissolve into your blood and tissues as well.

90
0:03:50.691,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And if you were to go down to where there's 15 times as much --

91
0:03:53.796,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the deeper you go, the more exacerbating the problem becomes.

92
0:03:56.829,000 --> 0:04:,000
The limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body,

93
0:04:01.342,000 --> 0:04:02,000
all the nitrogen and all the oxygen.

94
0:04:03.135,000 --> 0:04:05,000
There are three basic limitations of scuba diving.

95
0:04:05.859,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The first limitation is the oxygen --

96
0:04:07.718,000 --> 0:04:08,000
oxygen toxicity.

97
0:04:09.069,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, we all know the song: "Love is like oxygen.

98
0:04:11.347,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You get too much, you get too high. Not enough, and you're gonna die."

99
0:04:14.666,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Well, in the context of diving, you get too much, you die also.

100
0:04:17.678,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You die because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure.

101
0:04:20.702,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It makes you convulse underwater -- not a good thing to happen underwater.

102
0:04:24.274,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body.

103
0:04:27.805,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The nitrogen has two problems.

104
0:04:29.471,000 --> 0:04:33,000
One of them is what Jacques Cousteau called "rapture of the deep."

105
0:04:33.868,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's nitrogen narcosis.

106
0:04:35.234,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It makes you loopy; the deeper you go, the loopier you get.

107
0:04:38.045,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You don't want to drive drunk, you don't want to dive drunk.

108
0:04:40.938,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So that's a real big problem.

109
0:04:42.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And of course, the third problem

110
0:04:43.927,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is the one I found out the hard way in Palau,

111
0:04:46.094,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which is the bends.

112
0:04:47.276,000 --> 0:04:48,000
One thing I forgot to mention

113
0:04:48.691,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is that to obviate the problem of nitrogen narcosis --

114
0:04:51.248,000 --> 0:04:52,000
all of those blue dots in our body --

115
0:04:53.058,000 --> 0:04:55,000
you remove the nitrogen and replace it with helium.

116
0:04:55.482,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Helium's a gas; there're a lot of reasons why helium's good,

117
0:04:58.339,000 --> 0:05:,000
it's a tiny molecule, it's inert, it doesn't give you narcosis.

118
0:05:01.35,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So that's the basic concept we use.

119
0:05:03.076,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But the theory's relatively easy.

120
0:05:04.679,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The tricky part is the implementation.

121
0:05:06.536,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So this is how I began about 15 years ago.

122
0:05:08.669,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I'll admit, it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts,

123
0:05:11.399,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but you've got to start somewhere.

124
0:05:13.089,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:14.121,000 --> 0:05:17,000
At the time, I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing.

126
0:05:17.343,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Almost nobody did.

127
0:05:18.526,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This rig was actually used for a dive of 300 feet.

128
0:05:20.89,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But over time we got better at it,

129
0:05:22.549,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig

130
0:05:25.265,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with four scuba tanks, five regulators and all the right gas mixtures,

131
0:05:28.596,000 --> 0:05:29,000
all that good stuff.

132
0:05:29.771,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It was fine and dandy, it allowed us to go down and find new species.

133
0:05:33.072,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This picture was taken at 300 feet, catching new species of fish.

134
0:05:36.148,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The problem was it didn't allow us much time.

135
0:05:38.275,000 --> 0:05:41,000
For all its bulk and size, it only gave us about 15 minutes at most

136
0:05:41.501,000 --> 0:05:42,000
down at those sorts of depths.

137
0:05:43.037,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We needed more time. There had to be a better way.

138
0:05:45.398,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And indeed, there is a better way.

139
0:05:47.096,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In 1994, I was fortunate enough to get access

140
0:05:49.28,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers.

141
0:05:52.687,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Closed-circuit rebreather: what makes it different from scuba,

142
0:05:55.728,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and why is it better?

143
0:05:56.913,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Well, there are three main advantages to a rebreather.

144
0:05:59.788,000 --> 0:06:01,000
One, they're quiet, they don't make any noise.

145
0:06:01.972,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Two, they allow you to stay underwater longer.

146
0:06:04.161,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Three, they allow you to go deeper.

147
0:06:06.058,000 --> 0:06:07,000
How is it that they do that?

148
0:06:07.439,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In order to really understand how they do that,

149
0:06:09.67,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you have to look underneath the hood and see what's going on.

150
0:06:12.583,000 --> 0:06:14,000
There are three basic systems to a closed-circuit rebreather.

151
0:06:15.478,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The most fundamental is called the breathing loop.

152
0:06:18.09,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it;

153
0:06:20.556,000 --> 0:06:23,000
it's a closed loop, and you breathe the same gas around and around.

154
0:06:23.737,000 --> 0:06:25,000
There's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth,

155
0:06:26.105,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and there's a counter lung, or in this case, two counter lungs.

156
0:06:29.154,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The counter lungs aren't high tech, they're simply flexible bags.

157
0:06:32.242,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They allow you to mechanically breathe, mechanically ventilate.

158
0:06:35.243,000 --> 0:06:37,000
When you exhale, it goes in the exhale counter lung;

159
0:06:37.718,000 --> 0:06:39,000
when you inhale, it comes from the inhale counter lung.

160
0:06:40.327,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It's just pure mechanics, allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop.

161
0:06:44.136,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The other component on a breathing loop is the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.

162
0:06:48.364,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now, as we breathe, we produce carbon dioxide,

163
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system.

164
0:06:54.285,000 --> 0:06:55,000
There's a chemical filter in there

165
0:06:55.957,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas,

166
0:06:58.562,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so that when it comes back to us, it's safe to breathe again.

167
0:07:01.974,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's the breathing loop in a nutshell.

168
0:07:04.216,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather

169
0:07:07.184,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is the gas system.

170
0:07:08.55,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen,

171
0:07:12.024,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to replenish the oxygen that your body consumes.

172
0:07:14.664,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So the main tank, the main critical thing,

173
0:07:16.779,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here.

174
0:07:19.644,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder,

175
0:07:22.025,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we wouldn't be able to go very deep,

176
0:07:23.765,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very quickly.

177
0:07:26.214,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So we need another gas, something to dilute the oxygen with.

178
0:07:29.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And that, fittingly enough, is called the diluent gas supply.

179
0:07:32.646,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In our applications, we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply,

180
0:07:37.106,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen.

181
0:07:39.83,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So that's where we get our nitrogen from.

182
0:07:41.831,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But if we want to go deeper, of course, we need another gas supply,

183
0:07:45.324,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and helium is what we really need to go deep.

184
0:07:47.459,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Usually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder,

185
0:07:49.631,000 --> 0:07:51,000
mounted exterior on the rebreather, like this.

186
0:07:51.822,000 --> 0:07:54,000
That's what we use to inject, as we start to do our deep dives.

187
0:07:54.869,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup;

188
0:07:58.059,000 --> 0:08:,000
if there's a problem with our first oxygen supply,

189
0:08:00.422,000 --> 0:08:01,000
we can continue to breathe.

190
0:08:01.755,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The way you manage all these different gases and different gas supplies

191
0:08:05.24,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is this really high-tech, sophisticated gas block up on the front here,

192
0:08:08.655,000 --> 0:08:09,000
where it's easy to reach.

193
0:08:09.887,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's got the valves and knobs and things you need

194
0:08:12.203,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to inject the right gases at the right time.

195
0:08:14.286,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Normally, you don't have to do that,

196
0:08:16.029,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because all of it's done automatically

197
0:08:17.866,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with the electronics, the third system of a rebreather.

198
0:08:20.518,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors.

199
0:08:23.467,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You need three, so if one goes bad, you know which one it is.

200
0:08:26.357,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You need voting logic.

201
0:08:27.535,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You also have three microprocessors.

202
0:08:29.464,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Any one of those computers can run the entire system,

203
0:08:31.968,000 --> 0:08:32,000
so if you have to lose two of them,

204
0:08:33.67,000 --> 0:08:34,000
there's back-up power supplies.

205
0:08:35.186,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And there are multiple displays, to get the information to the diver.

206
0:08:38.483,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do

207
0:08:41.999,000 --> 0:08:42,000
on these deep dives.

208
0:08:43.257,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife --

209
0:08:45.688,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but I want to move on to something much more interesting.

210
0:08:48.391,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I'm going to take you on a deep dive,

211
0:08:50.181,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and show you what it's like to do one.

212
0:08:52.016,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We start up on the boat,

213
0:08:53.191,000 --> 0:08:55,000
For all this high-tech, expensive equipment,

214
0:08:55.32,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this is still the best way to get in the water,

215
0:08:57.553,000 --> 0:08:58,000
just flop over the side of the boat.

216
0:08:59.316,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Now, as I showed you in the earlier diagram,

217
0:09:01.567,000 --> 0:09:04,000
these reefs that we dive on start out near the surface

218
0:09:04.956,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and they go almost vertically, completely straight down.

219
0:09:07.628,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff,

220
0:09:10.533,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then we start dropping, dropping, dropping.

221
0:09:12.771,000 --> 0:09:14,000
People ask if it takes a long time to get there.

222
0:09:15.105,000 --> 0:09:18,000
No; it only takes a couple minutes to get down to three or four hundred feet,

223
0:09:18.822,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which is what we're aiming for.

224
0:09:20.338,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's like skydiving in slow motion. It's really very interesting.

225
0:09:23.428,000 --> 0:09:24,000
You ever see "The Abyss,"

226
0:09:24.74,000 --> 0:09:26,000
where Ed Harris is sinking down along the side of the wall?

227
0:09:27.55,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That's what it feels like. Amazing.

228
0:09:29.297,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And down there, you find that the water is very clear, extremely clear,

229
0:09:32.718,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because there's hardly any plankton.

230
0:09:34.465,000 --> 0:09:36,000
When you turn on your light and look around the caves,

231
0:09:37.026,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity,

232
0:09:39.683,000 --> 0:09:4,000
much more than anyone used to believe.

233
0:09:41.52,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Now, not all of it is new species --

234
0:09:43.278,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that fish you see with the white stripe, that's a known species.

235
0:09:47.003,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices,

236
0:09:50.353,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you'll see little things scurrying all over the place.

237
0:09:53.457,000 --> 0:09:55,000
There's a just unbelievable diversity.

238
0:09:55.944,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It's not just fish, either.

239
0:09:57.294,000 --> 0:10:,000
These are crinoids, sponges, black corals. There're some more fishes.

240
0:10:00.796,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Those fishes that you see now are new species.

241
0:10:03.082,000 --> 0:10:04,000
They're still new species,

242
0:10:04.456,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because I had a video camera instead of my net,

243
0:10:06.702,000 --> 0:10:09,000
so they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them.

244
0:10:09.769,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But this is what it looks like.

245
0:10:11.313,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles.

246
0:10:14.471,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is Papua, New Guinea.

247
0:10:16.429,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Now little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there.

248
0:10:20.988,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We also see sharks,

249
0:10:22.286,000 --> 0:10:24,000
much more regularly than I would have expected to.

250
0:10:24.691,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We're not quite sure why.

251
0:10:25.916,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What I want you to do now is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater,

252
0:10:29.049,000 --> 0:10:31,000
with all this high-tech gear on your back,

253
0:10:31.081,000 --> 0:10:33,000
you're in a remote reef off Papua, New Guinea,

254
0:10:33.253,000 --> 0:10:35,000
thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber,

255
0:10:36.038,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and you're completely surrounded by sharks.

256
0:10:38.473,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice) Look at those ...

257
0:10:40.982,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Diver 2: Uh, oh ...

258
0:10:42.169,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Uh, oh!

259
0:10:43.344,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Audience: (Laughter)

260
0:10:44.582,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Video) Diver 1: I think we have their attention ...

261
0:10:47.131,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Richard Pyle: When you start talking like Donald Duck,

262
0:10:49.685,000 --> 0:10:51,000
there's no situation in the world that can seem tense.

263
0:10:52.282,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

264
0:10:54.24,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So we're down there -- this is at 400 feet.

265
0:10:57.178,000 --> 0:11:,000
That's looking straight up, by the way, to give a sense of how far the surface is.

266
0:11:01.076,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And if you're a biologist and know about sharks,

267
0:11:03.348,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and you want to assess, how much jeopardy am I really in here,

268
0:11:06.622,000 --> 0:11:1,000
there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately,

269
0:11:12.534,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which is --

270
0:11:13.714,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks?

271
0:11:16.19,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Diver 2: Silvertip sharks.

272
0:11:17.976,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Diver 1: Oh.

273
0:11:19.166,000 --> 0:11:21,000
RP: There are actually three species of sharks here.

274
0:11:21.687,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The silvertips are the ones with the white edges on the fins,

275
0:11:24.599,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and there're also gray reef sharks and hammerheads off in the distance.

276
0:11:28.107,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And yes, it's a little nerve-racking.

277
0:11:31.964,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Video) Diver 2: Hoo!

278
0:11:34.686,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That little guy is frisky!

279
0:11:36.545,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Audience: (Laughter)

280
0:11:39.842,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now, you've seen video like this on TV a lot, and it's very intimidating.

281
0:11:44.341,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks;

282
0:11:46.758,000 --> 0:11:48,000
they're actually not very dangerous animals.

283
0:11:48.868,000 --> 0:11:5,000
That's why we weren't worried much and were joking around.

284
0:11:51.626,000 --> 0:11:53,000
More people are killed by pigs, by lightning strikes,

285
0:11:54.327,000 --> 0:11:56,000
more people are killed at soccer games in England.

286
0:11:56.686,000 --> 0:11:58,000
There's a lot of other ways you can die.

287
0:11:58.757,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I'm not making that stuff up.

288
0:12:00.555,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark.

289
0:12:04.281,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be.

290
0:12:08.282,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Now, I don't know if any of you get US News and World Report --

291
0:12:11.361,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I got the recent issue.

292
0:12:12.583,000 --> 0:12:14,000
There's a cover story about the great explorers of our time.

293
0:12:15.424,000 --> 0:12:18,000
The last article is entitled, "No New Frontiers."

294
0:12:19.148,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there,

295
0:12:22.617,000 --> 0:12:25,000
whether there are any true, hardcore discoveries that can still be made.

296
0:12:26.045,000 --> 0:12:27,000
My favorite line from the article:

297
0:12:27.694,000 --> 0:12:3,000
[... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppy with an extra spine in its dorsal fin."]

298
0:12:31.587,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I have to laugh; they don't call us fish nerds for nothing.

299
0:12:34.378,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy.

300
0:12:37.742,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But it's much more than that.

301
0:12:39.163,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years.

302
0:12:42.763,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This one -- you can see how ugly it is.

303
0:12:44.913,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Laughter)

304
0:12:45.962,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing,

305
0:12:49.035,000 --> 0:12:5,000
look at the monetary value of this thing.

306
0:12:51.036,000 --> 0:12:54,000
A couple of these were sold through the aquarium trade to Japan,

307
0:12:54.113,000 --> 0:12:56,000
where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.

308
0:12:56.25,000 --> 0:12:58,000
That's half a million dollars a pound.

309
0:12:59.485,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Here's another new angelfish we discovered.

310
0:13:01.532,000 --> 0:13:04,000
This one we first discovered back in the air days -- the bad old air days,

311
0:13:05.042,000 --> 0:13:07,000
when we were doing these kind of dives with air.

312
0:13:07.455,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We were at 360 feet.

313
0:13:08.637,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I remember coming up from one of these deep dives and I had this fog,

314
0:13:11.919,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and the narcosis takes a little while to fade away, sort of like sobering up.

315
0:13:16.18,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I had this vague recollection of seeing this yellow fish with a black spot,

316
0:13:19.91,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and thought, "Damn, I should have caught one --

317
0:13:22.281,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I think that's a new species."

318
0:13:23.747,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Eventually, I looked in my bucket.

319
0:13:25.398,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Sure enough, I had caught one, I just completely forgot.

320
0:13:28.403,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So this one, we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to.

321
0:13:32.281,000 --> 0:13:33,000
That's its official scientific name,

322
0:13:34.268,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in reference to its deep-dwelling habits.

323
0:13:36.254,000 --> 0:13:37,000
This is another neat one.

324
0:13:37.471,000 --> 0:13:38,000
When we first found it,

325
0:13:38.654,000 --> 0:13:4,000
we weren't even sure what family it belonged to,

326
0:13:40.937,000 --> 0:13:41,000
so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,

327
0:13:42.874,000 --> 0:13:44,000
since it looked like something from one of those books.

328
0:13:45.476,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now, this one's pretty cool.

329
0:13:46.85,000 --> 0:13:48,000
If you go to Papua, New Guinea and go down 300 feet,

330
0:13:49.316,000 --> 0:13:5,000
you'll see these big mounds.

331
0:13:50.696,000 --> 0:13:53,000
This may be hard to see, but they're a couple meters in diameter.

332
0:13:53.967,000 --> 0:13:56,000
If you look closely, you'll see there's a little white and gray fish

333
0:13:57.328,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that hangs out near them.

334
0:13:58.559,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds,

335
0:14:01.594,000 --> 0:14:02,000
one pebble at a time.

336
0:14:03.142,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's extraordinary to find something like this.

337
0:14:05.36,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It's not just new species, it's new behaviors, new ecology,

338
0:14:08.155,000 --> 0:14:09,000
all kind of new things.

339
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
What I'm going to show you now, quickly,

340
0:14:11.279,000 --> 0:14:13,000
is a sampling of the new species we've discovered.

341
0:14:13.7,000 --> 0:14:16,000
What's extraordinary is not just the number of species we're finding --

342
0:14:17.081,000 --> 0:14:19,000
though as you can see, that's pretty amazing;

343
0:14:19.251,000 --> 0:14:2,000
this is only half of what we've found --

344
0:14:21.188,000 --> 0:14:23,000
what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them.

345
0:14:24.108,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth.

346
0:14:27.467,000 --> 0:14:31,000
If you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree, you may get a lot of bugs,

347
0:14:31.811,000 --> 0:14:33,000
but for fishes, there's nowhere in the world

348
0:14:33.932,000 --> 0:14:35,000
you can get seven new species per hour of time.

349
0:14:36.813,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Now, we've done some back-of-the-envelope calculations,

350
0:14:39.424,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and we're predicting there are probably about 2,000 to 2,500 new species

351
0:14:42.872,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in the Indo-Pacific alone.

352
0:14:44.245,000 --> 0:14:46,000
There are only five to six thousand known species,

353
0:14:46.923,000 --> 0:14:49,000
so a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known.

354
0:14:50.519,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not.

355
0:14:54.123,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I'm going to just close on a very somber note.

356
0:14:56.369,000 --> 0:14:59,000
At the beginning, I said I'd show you two extraordinary photographs.

357
0:15:00.353,000 --> 0:15:03,000
This is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you.

358
0:15:03.536,000 --> 0:15:07,000
This one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks.

359
0:15:07.748,000 --> 0:15:09,000
This was taken exactly 300 feet above my head.

360
0:15:11.236,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The reason this photograph is extraordinary

361
0:15:13.36,000 --> 0:15:14,000
is because it captures a moment

362
0:15:14.902,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in the very last minute of a person's life.

363
0:15:17.36,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Less than 60 seconds after this picture was taken, this guy was dead.

364
0:15:21.778,000 --> 0:15:24,000
When we recovered his body, we figured out what had gone wrong.

365
0:15:24.965,000 --> 0:15:25,000
He had made a very simple mistake;

366
0:15:26.629,000 --> 0:15:28,000
he turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder.

367
0:15:29.185,000 --> 0:15:32,000
he had 80 percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had 40.

368
0:15:32.214,000 --> 0:15:34,000
He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned.

369
0:15:34.894,000 --> 0:15:36,000
The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything --

370
0:15:37.842,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general,

371
0:15:41.755,000 --> 0:15:42,000
which is that we all have two goals.

372
0:15:43.517,000 --> 0:15:46,000
The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet,

373
0:15:46.785,000 --> 0:15:47,000
which is to survive.

374
0:15:47.969,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I call it perpetuation: the survival of the species and survival of ourselves,

375
0:15:51.873,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And those are both about perpetuating the genome.

376
0:15:54.363,000 --> 0:15:57,000
The second goal, for those of us who have mastered the first goal --

377
0:15:57.631,000 --> 0:16:01,000
call it spiritual fulfillment, call it financial success,

378
0:16:02.034,000 --> 0:16:04,000
you can call it any number of different things.

379
0:16:04.385,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I call it seeking joy, this pursuit of happiness.

380
0:16:07.094,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So, I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest,

381
0:16:10.757,000 --> 0:16:11,000
he absolutely did.

382
0:16:11.951,000 --> 0:16:12,000
You have to balance those two goals.

383
0:16:13.761,000 --> 0:16:14,000
If you live your whole life in fear --

384
0:16:15.652,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I mean, life is a sexually transmitted disease with 100 percent mortality.

385
0:16:20.225,000 --> 0:16:22,000
So you can't live your life in fear.

386
0:16:22.409,000 --> 0:16:24,000
(Laughter)

387
0:16:24.653,000 --> 0:16:26,000
I thought that was an old one!

388
0:16:26.921,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Applause)

389
0:16:27.996,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But at the same time, you don't want to get so focused on rule number two,

390
0:16:32.161,000 --> 0:16:33,000
goal number two,

391
0:16:33.637,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that you neglect goal number one.

392
0:16:35.36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Because once you're dead, you really can't enjoy anything after that.

393
0:16:38.629,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance

394
0:16:41.629,000 --> 0:16:42,000
in your future endeavors.

395
0:16:42.845,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Thanks.

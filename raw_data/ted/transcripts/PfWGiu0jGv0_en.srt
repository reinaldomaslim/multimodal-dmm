1
0:00:12.72,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to introduce you to my badass friends.

2
0:00:16.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Meet Thelma and Louise.

3
0:00:18.24,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm passionate about cows.

5
0:00:22.04,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And although they've been getting a lot of crap lately

6
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:26,000
due to methane emissions and climate change,

7
0:00:27.04,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I hope that I can redeem their reputation in part

8
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:31,000
by showing you how incredibly important they are

9
0:00:32.12,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in solving one of the world's biggest problems: food security.

10
0:00:35.24,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But more importantly, for Africa --

11
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it's resultant childhood stunting.

12
0:00:40.92,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Nutritional stunting manifests itself

13
0:00:43.36,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in a reduction of growth rate in human development.

14
0:00:46.24,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And according to UNICEF,

15
0:00:48.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
stunting doesn't come easy.

16
0:00:49.84,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It doesn't come quickly.

17
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It happens over a long period of time

18
0:00:53.32,000 --> 0:00:56,000
during which a child endures painful and debilitating cycles of illness,

19
0:00:57.6,000 --> 0:00:58,000
depressed appetite,

20
0:00:59.36,000 --> 0:01:,000
insufficient nutrition

21
0:01:00.96,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and inadequate care.

22
0:01:03.08,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And most kids simply can't endure such rigors.

23
0:01:06.76,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But those that do survive,

24
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they carry forward long-term cognitive problems

25
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
as well as losses of stature.

26
0:01:16.84,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The numbers of stunted children under the age of five,

27
0:01:20.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in most regions of the world,

28
0:01:22.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
has been declining.

29
0:01:23.92,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I really hate to say this,

30
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but the only place where they haven't been declining is here,

31
0:01:28.88,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in Africa.

32
0:01:30.96,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Here, 59 million children,

33
0:01:34.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
three in 10 in that age group,

34
0:01:36.68,000 --> 0:01:38,000
struggle to meet their genetic potential --

35
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:4,000
their full genetic potential.

36
0:01:43.24,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Protein is one of our most important dietary requirements,

37
0:01:46.76,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and evidence shows that lack of essential amino acids,

38
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the building blocks of proteins, in young children's diets,

39
0:01:52.6,000 --> 0:01:53,000
can result in stunting.

40
0:01:54.56,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Essential amino acids are called essential

41
0:01:56.6,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because we can't synthesize them in our bodies.

42
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
We have to get them from our foods

43
0:02:01.56,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the best sources are animal-derived:

44
0:02:04.64,000 --> 0:02:06,000
milk, meat and eggs.

45
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Most protein consumed on the African continent is crop-based.

46
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And although we have millions of smallholder farmers rearing animals,

47
0:02:16.88,000 --> 0:02:19,000
livestock production is not as easy as we think.

48
0:02:20.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The big livestock gaps between rich countries and poor countries

49
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are due to poor animal health.

50
0:02:27.64,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Endemic livestock diseases,

51
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
some of them transmissible to humans,

52
0:02:32.56,000 --> 0:02:36,000
threaten not only livestock producers in those poor countries,

53
0:02:37.6,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but all human health across all countries.

54
0:02:42.08,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is a global pathogens network.

55
0:02:44.6,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It shows the pathogens found across the world

56
0:02:47.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
according to the Enhanced Infectious Diseases database.

57
0:02:50.52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it shows those pathogens that share hosts.

58
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In a nutshell,

59
0:02:55.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we share pathogens, and thus diseases,

60
0:02:58.08,000 --> 0:03:,000
with the species we live closest to:

61
0:03:00.52,000 --> 0:03:01,000
our livestock.

62
0:03:01.8,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And we call these zoonotic diseases.

63
0:03:04.08,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Recent reports show

64
0:03:05.88,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that the deadly dozen zoonotic diseases kill 2.2 million people

65
0:03:09.96,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and sicken 2.4 billion people annually.

66
0:03:13.6,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And Jimmy says,

67
0:03:14.88,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"The greatest burden of zoonoses

68
0:03:17.36,000 --> 0:03:19,000
falls on one billion poor livestock keepers."

69
0:03:20.88,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We totally underestimate the importance of our smallholder farmers.

70
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We're beginning to recognize how important they are

71
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and how they influence our medical health,

72
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
our biosafety

73
0:03:32.92,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and more recently, our cognitive and our physical health.

74
0:03:37.32,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They stand at the frontline of zoonotic epidemics.

75
0:03:42.48,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They pretty much underpin our existence.

76
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And they need to know so much,

77
0:03:48.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
yet most lack knowledge

78
0:03:53.28,000 --> 0:03:55,000
on livestock disease prevention and treatment.

79
0:03:56.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So how do they learn?

80
0:03:58.2,000 --> 0:04:,000
Apart from shared experiences,

81
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:02,000
trial and error,

82
0:04:02.28,000 --> 0:04:06,000
conventional farming extension services are boots on the ground and radio --

83
0:04:07.52,000 --> 0:04:11,000
expensive and hard to scale in the face of population growth.

84
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Sounds pretty gloomy, doesn't it?

85
0:04:15.72,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But we're at an interesting point in Africa.

86
0:04:18.52,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We're changing that narrative using innovative solutions,

87
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
riding across scalable technologies.

88
0:04:26.36,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Knowledge doesn't have to be expensive.

89
0:04:29.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
My company developed an agricultural platform called iCow.

90
0:04:33.92,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We teach farmers best livestock practices using SMS

91
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
over simple, low-end phones.

92
0:04:40.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Farmers receive three SMSs a week on best livestock practices,

93
0:04:43.64,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and those that execute the messages go on to see increases in productivity

94
0:04:47.8,000 --> 0:04:5,000
within as short a time as three months.

95
0:04:52.68,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The first increases in productivity, of course, are improved animal health.

96
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We use SMS because it is retentive.

97
0:05:01.36,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Farmers store their messages,

98
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they write them down in books,

99
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and in effect,

100
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we're drip-feeding agricultural manuals into the fields.

101
0:05:10.44,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We recognize that we are all part of the global food network:

102
0:05:16.92,000 --> 0:05:17,000
producers and consumers,

103
0:05:18.76,000 --> 0:05:2,000
you and me, and every farmer.

104
0:05:22.44,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We're focusing now on trying to bring together producers and consumers

105
0:05:28.4,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to take action and take responsibility for not only food security,

106
0:05:33.6,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but for food safety.

107
0:05:35.84,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This beautiful animal is an African-Asian Sahiwal crossed with a Dutch Fleckvieh.

108
0:05:41.24,000 --> 0:05:43,000
She's milkier than her Sahiwal mom,

109
0:05:43.68,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and she's sturdier and more resistant to disease than her Fleckvieh father.

110
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
In Ethiopia and Tanzania,

111
0:05:51.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the African Dairy Genetic Gains program is using SMS and cutting-edge genomics

112
0:05:57.08,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and pioneering Africa's first tropically adapted dairy breeding centers

113
0:06:02.56,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and dairy performance recording centers.

114
0:06:06.68,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Farmers contribute their production data --

115
0:06:09.84,000 --> 0:06:1,000
milking records,

116
0:06:11.12,000 --> 0:06:12,000
breeding records and feeding records --

117
0:06:13.04,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to the ADGG platform.

118
0:06:14.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
This stage is synthesized through algorithms

119
0:06:16.96,000 --> 0:06:19,000
from some of the top livestock institutions in the world

120
0:06:20.52,000 --> 0:06:22,000
before it lands back in the farmers' hands

121
0:06:23.32,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in actionable SMSs.

122
0:06:26.52,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Customized data,

123
0:06:27.76,000 --> 0:06:28,000
customized responses

124
0:06:29.36,000 --> 0:06:31,000
all aimed at increasing productivity

125
0:06:32.04,000 --> 0:06:33,000
based on the potential on the ground.

126
0:06:34.96,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We're at a very interesting place in agriculture in Africa.

127
0:06:38.92,000 --> 0:06:39,000
By the end of this year,

128
0:06:40.2,000 --> 0:06:43,000
we'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions.

129
0:06:44.04,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We have the power in our hands

130
0:06:46.64,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to ensure that livestock production systems are not only healthy,

131
0:06:50.92,000 --> 0:06:52,000
productive and profitable,

132
0:06:53.6,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but that farmers are knowledgeable,

133
0:06:55.96,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and more importantly,

134
0:06:57.8,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that our farmers are safe.

135
0:07:00.44,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Working with smallholder farmers

136
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is one of the best ways to guarantee food security.

137
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways

138
0:07:08.84,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to guarantee each and every child their full opportunity

139
0:07:12.84,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and ability to reach their full genetic potential.

140
0:07:15.92,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And harnessing the power of millions of smallholder farmers

141
0:07:19.8,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and their badass cows like mine,

142
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we should be able to bring a halt to stunting in Africa.

143
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Thank you.

144
0:07:28.4,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Applause)

145
0:07:31.72,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
One morning, in the year 1957,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
saw himself like this,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
a weird freak with huge hands,

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
huge mouth,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and a tiny bottom.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Actually this creature

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is the result of the Penfield research.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
He named it homunculus.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Basically the homunculus is

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the visualization of a human being

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
where each part of the body is proportional

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to the surface it takes in the brain.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's you. It's me.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's our invisible reality.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This visualization could explain, for example,

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
why newborns, or smokers,

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.

20
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Unfortunately it doesn't explain why

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
so many designers remain mainly interested

22
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in designing chairs.

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely,

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
for my design I essentially refer to it.

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm fascinated by its ability to

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
deeply investigate the human being,

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
its way of working, its way of feeling.

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And it really helps me to understand

29
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
how we see, how we hear,

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's a great tool for me

32
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to understand what could be our real needs.

33
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Marketing people have never been able to do that.

34
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies.

35
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Marketing creates user groups.

36
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And scientists, amidst complexity,

37
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
amidst fluctuation and uniqueness.

38
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What could be our real needs?

39
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Maybe the silence.

40
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by

41
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
aggressive sounds.

42
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And you know all those kind of sound puts us

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in a kind of stressful state,

44
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and prevent us from being quiet and focused.

45
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So I wanted to create a kind of

46
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
sound filter,

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.

48
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But I didn't want it to make it by

49
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
isolating people, without any earmuffs

50
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
or those kind of things.

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Or neither with including complex technology.

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I just wanted to, using the complexity

53
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and the technology of the brain, of the human brain.

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I worked with white noise.

55
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
dB is basically --

56
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
dB is the name of the product,

57
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
basically a white noise diffuser.

58
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is white noise.

59
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The white noise is the sum of all frequencies

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
that are audible by the human being,

61
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
brought to the same intensity.

62
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.

63
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And this noise is the most neutral.

64
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.

65
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So when you hear this sound

66
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you feel like a kind of shelter,

67
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
preserved from noise pollution.

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.

69
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.

70
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It seems to be magic.

71
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.

72
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And in mine, I hope.

73
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So in order to make this white noise

74
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
a little bit active and reactive,

75
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I create a ball, a rolling ball

76
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
able to analyze and find

77
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
where does aggressive sound come from,

78
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and roll, at home or at work,

79
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
towards aggressive noise,

80
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and emits white noise in order to neutralize it.

81
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It works.

83
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You feel the effect of the white noise?

84
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's too in silence.

85
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
If you make some noise you can feel the effect.

86
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So even if this object,

87
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
even if this product includes some technology,

88
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones

89
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and some electronic devices,

90
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
this object is not a very smart object.

91
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I don't want to make a very smart object.

92
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.

93
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I want to create an object like you and me.

94
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So, definitely not perfect.

95
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So imagine, for instance, you are at home.

96
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.

97
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?"

98
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And dB will probably roll toward you.

99
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And turning around you is "shhhhhhh," like that.

100
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Definitely not perfect. So you would probably

102
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
shut it, at this point.

103
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Anyway, in this same kind of approach,

105
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I designed K.

106
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
K is a daylight receiver transmitter.

107
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,

108
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or on your piano, where you are supposed

109
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to spend most of your time in the day.

110
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And this object will be

111
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,

112
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and able to give you the quantity of light you need.

113
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This object is completely covered by

114
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
fiber opticals.

115
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,

116
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but creates the idea of an

117
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
eye sensibility of the object.

118
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I want, by this design

119
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
feel, when you see it,

120
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
you see, instinctively,

121
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
this object seems to be very sensitive,

122
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
very reactive.

123
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And this object knows, better than you

124
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and probably before you, what you really need.

125
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You have to know that the lack of daylight

126
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
can provoke some

127
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
problem of energy, or problem of libido.

128
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So, a huge problem.

129
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Most of the projects I work on --

131
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I live in collaboration with scientists.

132
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I'm just a designer. So I need them.

133
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So there can be some biologists,

134
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
psychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.

135
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And I submit them, my intuitions,

136
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
my hypothesis, my first ideas.

137
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.

138
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And together we improve the original concept.

139
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And we build the project to the end.

140
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist

141
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
started when I was at school.

142
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig

143
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
for a pharmaceutical industry.

144
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And the irony for me was

145
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.

146
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
I just do that to make money.

147
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Anyway, this project, or this experience,

148
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
make me start a new project on the design of medicine.

149
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills

150
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is not taken correctly.

151
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So even if the active constituents

152
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in pharmaceuticals made constant progress

153
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in terms of chemistry, target of stability,

154
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the behavior of the patients

155
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
goes more and more unstable.

156
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So we took too many of them.

157
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We took irregular dosage.

158
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We do not follow instructions. And so on.

159
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So I wanted to create a

160
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
new kind of medicine,

161
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in order to create a new kind of relationship

162
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
between the patient and the treatment.

163
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So I turned traditional pills into this.

164
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I'm going to give you some example.

165
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This one is an antibiotic.

166
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And its purpose is to help patient

167
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to go to the end of the treatment.

168
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And the concept is to

169
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
create a kind of onion,

170
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
a kind of structure in layers.

171
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So, you start with the darkest one.

172
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.

173
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.

174
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So the first day, this is the big one.

175
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And you have to peel and eat one layer a day.

176
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.

177
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.

178
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And you follow the treatment like that,

179
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to the end of the treatment.

180
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And here you can get the white core.

181
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And it means, right, you are in the recovery.

182
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Applause) Thank you.

183
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This one is a "third lung,"

184
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.

185
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.

186
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
So the idea of this one is to create

187
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a relationship between the patient of the treatment

188
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but a relationship of dependency.

189
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.

190
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is, the kids will feel

191
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the therapeutic object needs him.

192
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So the idea is, all night long

193
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the elastic skin of the third lung

194
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
will slowly inflate itself,

195
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
including air and molecules, for sure.

196
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And when the kids wake up,

197
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,

198
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and breathe the air it contains.

199
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So by this way,

200
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the kid, to take care of himself,

201
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is to take care of this living object.

202
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,

203
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
as the asthma treatment needs him.

204
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Applause)

205
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In this guise of living object approach,

206
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I like the idea of a kind of invisible design,

207
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
as if the function of the object

208
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
exists in a kind of invisible field

209
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
just around the objects themselves.

210
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We could talk about a kind of soul,

211
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
of a ghost accompanying them.

212
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And almost a kind of poltergeist effect.

213
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,

214
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
because it is -- woosh -- starting to move.

215
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I remember an exhibition design

216
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I made for John Maeda,

217
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.

218
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And John Maeda was supposed to show

219
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
several graphic animations in this exhibition.

220
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And my idea for this exhibition design was to create

221
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
a real pong game, like this one.

222
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And the idea was to create some self-moving benches

223
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in the main exhibition room.

224
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So the living benches would be exactly like the ball.

225
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go."

226
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I remember the day of the opening.

227
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I was a little bit late.

228
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches

229
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in the exhibition room, John was just beside me,

230
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and was like, "Hmm. Hmm."

231
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And he told me, after a long silence,

232
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"I wonder, Mathieu, if

233
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
people won't be more fascinated by your benches

234
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
than by my videos."

235
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

236
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,

237
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
if he hadn't decided to take all them off

238
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
two hours before the opening.

239
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So, huge tragedy.

240
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you

241
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that Pinocchio is one of my great influences.

242
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.

243
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience,

244
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
able to be modified by its surroundings,

245
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and able to modify it as well.

246
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The other great influence is the mine's canary.

247
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
In coal mines, this canary

248
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
was supposed to be close to the miners.

249
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.

250
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So this canary was a living alarm,

251
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and a very efficient one.

252
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
A very natural technology,

253
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in order to say to the miners,

254
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency."

255
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So it's, for me, a great product.

256
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I tried to design a kind of canary.

257
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Andrea is one.

258
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses

259
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
from air, contaminated indoor air.

260
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So it uses some plants to do this job,

261
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
selected for their gas-filtering ability.

262
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
You have to know, or you probably already know,

263
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.

264
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So while I'm talking to you,

265
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some

266
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)

267
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So you are currently breathing formaldehyde.

268
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It's the same for me with the carpet.

269
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And this is exactly the same at home.

270
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Because all the product we get constantly give away

271
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
the volatile component of which they're made of.

272
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So let's have a look at your home.

273
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So your sofa, your plastic chair,

274
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
your kid's toys

275
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.

276
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This is the reason why

277
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I created, with David Edward,

278
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
a scientist of Harvard University,

279
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.

280
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But the idea is to force

281
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the air to go in the effective part of the plants.

282
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Because the roots of the plant are not very effective.

283
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Bill Wolverton from NASA

284
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
analyzed it cleverly in the '70s.

285
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So the idea is to create an object

286
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed

287
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.

288
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So this is the final object.

289
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It will be launched next September.

290
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

291
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This one is kind of the same approach

292
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
because I include, in a product

293
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
like Andrea, some plants.

294
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.

295
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And it includes some fishes as well.

296
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But here, unlike Andrea,

297
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
here are supposed to be eaten.

298
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Indeed, this object is a domestic farm,

299
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
for fishes and green.

300
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So the idea of this object

301
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
is to be able to get at home

302
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
very local food.

303
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The locavores

304
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
used to get food

305
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
taken in a radius of 100 miles.

306
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Local River is able to provide you

307
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
food directly in your living room.

308
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So the principle of this object

309
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
is to create an ecosystem

310
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
called aquaponics.

311
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,

312
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
by a water pump, feeds the plants above.

313
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And the plants will filter, by the roots,

314
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the dirty water of the fish.

315
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
After, it goes back into the fish tank.

316
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
After that you have two options.

317
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.

318
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Amazing channel.

319
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Or you start fishing.

320
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And you make some sushis with a fish

321
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and the aromatic plants above.

322
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Because you can grow some potatoes.

323
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
No, not potatoes, but tomatoes,

324
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
aromatic plants and so on.

325
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So now we can breathe safely.

326
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Now we can eat local food.

327
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now we can be treated by smart medicine.

328
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm

329
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
with daylight.

330
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But it was important to create a perfect place,

331
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
so I tried to,

332
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
in order to work and create.

333
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,

334
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.

335
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
I wanted to create a perfect place

336
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
where you can work and play,

337
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and where your body and your brain can work together.

338
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
So, in this office,

339
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
you do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.

340
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Your seat, your sleep and your play

341
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
on a big geodesic island made of leather.

342
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
See, like this one?

343
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,

344
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,

345
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
like a prehistoric scientist.

346
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So you, like that, can make some sport during your work.

347
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
In this office

348
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
you do not need to go out

349
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in order to be in contact with nature.

350
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
You include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office.

351
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
You can see it there.

352
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
This is an inspiration image

353
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
to lead this project of the office.

354
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
It really helped me to design it.

355
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid.

356
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Laughter)

357
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Just for my workshop.

358
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was.

359
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
But it's maybe the conviction

360
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
as monkey and homunculus we are.

361
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
All of us need to be considered according to our real nature.

362
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Thank you very much.

363
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, a big question that we're facing now

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and have been for quite a number of years now:

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
are we at risk of a nuclear attack?

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now, there's a bigger question

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that's probably actually more important than that,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is the notion of permanently eliminating

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the possibility of a nuclear attack,

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
eliminating the threat altogether.

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I would like to make a case to you that

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
until this very moment,

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that's characterized by two phases,

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which I'm going to go through with you right now.

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
through the Manhattan Project,

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the idea was very straightforward:

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
we would use the power of the atom

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to end the atrocities and the horror

21
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of this unending World War II

22
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And in 1945,

24
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we were the only nuclear power.

25
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We had a few nuclear weapons,

26
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,

27
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,

28
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
killing about 250,000 people between those two.

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And for a few years,

30
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we were the only nuclear power on Earth.

31
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided

32
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,

33
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and they began to match what the United States had developed.

34
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And from 1949 to 1985

35
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
was an extraordinary time

36
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal

37
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that no one could possibly have imagined

38
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
back in the 1940s.

39
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here

40
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
is equivalent of a thousands warheads --

41
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the world had

42
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
65,000 nuclear warheads,

43
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and seven members of something

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that came to be known as the "nuclear club."

45
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And it was an extraordinary time,

46
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and I am going to go through some of the mentality

47
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that we -- that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.

48
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent

49
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of the nuclear weapons at any particular time

50
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
since 1985 -- going forward, of course --

51
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
were part of the arsenals

52
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of the United States and the Soviet Union.

53
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,

54
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we began to disarm

55
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
from a nuclear point of view.

56
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We began to counter-proliferate,

57
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world

58
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to about a total of 21,000.

59
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's a very difficult number to deal with,

60
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because what we've done is

61
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we've quote unquote "decommissioned" some of the warheads.

62
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They're still probably usable. They could be "re-commissioned,"

63
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but the way they count things, which is very complicated,

64
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we think we have about a third

65
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of the nuclear weapons we had before.

66
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But we also, in that period of time,

67
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
added two more members to the nuclear club:

68
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Pakistan and North Korea.

69
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal

70
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
among many countries around the world,

71
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but a very different set of circumstances.

72
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So I'm going to talk about

73
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a nuclear threat story in two chapters.

74
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Chapter one is 1949 to 1991,

75
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
when the Soviet Union broke up,

76
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,

77
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was a superpowers' nuclear arms race.

78
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It was characterized by

79
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
a nation-versus-nation,

80
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
very fragile standoff.

81
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And basically,

82
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we lived for all those years,

83
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and some might argue that we still do,

84
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in a situation of

85
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
being on the brink, literally,

86
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.

87
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's incredible that we actually lived through all that.

88
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We were totally dependent during those years

89
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on this amazing acronym, which is MAD.

90
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It stands for mutually assured destruction.

91
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So it meant

92
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
if you attacked us, we would attack you

93
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
virtually simultaneously,

94
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and the end result would be a destruction

95
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of your country and mine.

96
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So the threat of my own destruction

97
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
kept me from launching

98
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.

99
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And the danger of that, of course, is that

100
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a misreading of a radar screen

101
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
could actually cause a counter-launch,

102
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
even though the first country had not actually launched anything.

103
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
During this chapter one,

104
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
there was a high level of public awareness

105
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
about the potential of nuclear catastrophe,

106
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and an indelible image was implanted

107
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in our collective minds

108
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust

109
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
would be absolutely globally destructive

110
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.

111
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So this was chapter one.

112
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now the odd thing is that even though

113
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we knew that there would be

114
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that kind of civilization obliteration,

115
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
we engaged in America in a series --

116
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and in fact, in the Soviet Union --

117
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in a series of response planning.

118
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It was absolutely incredible.

119
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So premise one is we'd be destroying the world,

120
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?

121
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So what

122
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we offered ourselves

123
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things,

124
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
just to jog your memories.

125
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If you're born after 1950, this is just --

126
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.

127
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This was Bert the Turtle. (Video)

128
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This was basically an attempt

129
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to teach our schoolchildren

130
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that if we did get engaged

131
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,

132
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
then we wanted our school children

133
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to kind of basically duck and cover.

134
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That was the principle. You --

135
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
there would be a nuclear conflagration

136
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
about to hit us, and if you get under your desk,

137
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
things would be OK.

138
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I didn't do all that well

140
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,

141
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and I think this was seriously delusional.

142
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Secondly, we told people

144
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to go down in their basements

145
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and build a fallout shelter.

146
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,

147
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,

148
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.

149
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.

150
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter

151
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that you could simply bury in the ground.

152
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now, the bomb shelters at that point --

153
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
let's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars,

154
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.

155
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Yet, what percentage of Americans

156
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?

157
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?

158
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent

159
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
of the population, as far as anyone knows,

160
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
did anything,

161
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
either making a space in their basement

162
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
or actually building a bomb shelter.

163
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Many buildings, public buildings, around the country --

164
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
this is New York City -- had these little civil defense signs,

165
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and the idea was that you would

166
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
run into one of these shelters and be safe

167
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
from the nuclear weaponry.

168
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And one of the greatest governmental delusions

169
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
of all time was something that happened

170
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in the early days of

171
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,

172
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.

173
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Here is their first big public

174
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
announcement.

175
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They would propose --

176
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
actually there were about six volumes written on this --

177
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
a crisis relocation plan

178
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that was dependent upon

179
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the United States having three to four days warning

180
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that the Soviets were going to attack us.

181
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities.

182
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We would move people out of the target cities

183
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
into the countryside.

184
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate

185
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
about the absolute ludicrous idea

186
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that we would actually evacuate,

187
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
and actually have three or four days' warning.

188
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It was just completely off the wall.

189
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Turns out that they had another idea

190
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
behind it, even though this was --

191
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
they were telling the public it was to save us.

192
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The idea was that we would force the Soviets

193
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive --

194
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and potentially double their arsenal,

195
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to not only take out the original site,

196
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but take out sites where people were going.

197
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.

198
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It was just really, really frightening.

199
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The main point here is we were dealing with

200
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
a complete disconnect from reality.

201
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The civil defense programs were disconnected

202
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.

203
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,

204
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.

205
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,

206
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and they'd say, "Here's a map of your city.

207
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit."

208
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So no possibility of medical response to,

209
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or meaningful preparedness for

210
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
all-out nuclear war.

211
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
So we had to prevent nuclear war

212
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
if we expected to survive.

213
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
This disconnect was never actually resolved.

214
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And what happened was --

215
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
when we get in to chapter two

216
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of the nuclear threat era,

217
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which started back in 1945.

218
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Chapter two starts in 1991.

219
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
When the Soviet Union broke up,

220
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we effectively lost that adversary

221
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.

222
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.

223
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But from 1991

224
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
through the present time,

225
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
emphasized by the attacks of 2001,

226
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the idea of an all-out nuclear war

227
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
has diminished and the idea of a single event,

228
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
act of nuclear terrorism

229
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is what we have instead.

230
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Although the scenario has changed

231
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
very considerably, the fact is

232
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that we haven't changed our mental image

233
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
of what a nuclear war means.

234
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.

235
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So, what is a nuclear terror threat?

236
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And there's four key ingredients to describing that.

237
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
First thing is that the global nuclear weapons,

238
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,

239
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
happen to be not uniformly secure.

240
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And it's particularly not secure

241
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.

242
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
There are many, many sites where warheads are stored

243
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,

244
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
like highly enriched uranium and plutonium,

245
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
are absolutely not safe.

246
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.

247
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
They're acquirable, let me put it that way.

248
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
From 1993 through 2006,

249
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the International Atomic Energy Agency

250
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
documented 175 cases of nuclear theft,

251
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,

252
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.

253
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium

254
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is about 1,300, at the low end,

255
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to about 2,100 metric tons.

256
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
More than 100 megatons of this

257
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is stored in particularly insecure

258
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Russian facilities.

259
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
How much of that do you think it would take

260
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?

261
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.

262
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So, what I'd like to show you

263
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is

264
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
what it would take to hold 75 pounds

265
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
of highly enriched uranium.

266
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This is not a product placement. It's just --

267
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this --

268
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

269
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
-- but

270
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
basically, this is it.

271
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This is what you would need to steal or buy

272
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile

273
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that's relatively insecure

274
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to create the type of bomb

275
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that was used in Hiroshima.

276
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now you might want to look at plutonium

277
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.

278
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
That -- you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.

279
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:

280
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
this. This is enough plutonium

281
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.

282
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Now this situation, already I --

283
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
you know, I don't really like thinking about this,

284
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
although somehow I got myself a job

285
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
where I have to think about it. So

286
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
the point is that we're very, very insecure

287
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in terms of developing this material.

288
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
The second thing is, what about the know-how?

289
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And there's a lot of controversy about

290
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
whether terror organizations have the know-how

291
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to actually make a nuclear weapon.

292
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Well, there's a lot of know-how out there.

293
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.

294
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
There's detailed information on how to assemble

295
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
a nuclear weapon from parts.

296
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.

297
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
There are plans for how to create a terror farm

298
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
where you could actually manufacture and develop

299
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
all the components and assemble it.

300
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
All of this information is relatively available.

301
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
If you have an undergraduate degree in physics,

302
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I would suggest --

303
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
although I don't, so maybe it's not even true --

304
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but something close to that would allow you,

305
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
with the information that's currently available,

306
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to actually build a nuclear weapon.

307
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
The third element of the nuclear terror threat

308
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
is that, who would actually do such a thing?

309
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism

310
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that involves individuals who are highly organized.

311
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
They are very dedicated and committed.

312
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
They are stateless.

313
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Somebody once said, Al Qaeda

314
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
does not have a return address,

315
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,

316
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
what's the response, and to whom is the response?

317
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And they're retaliation-proof.

318
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Since there is no real retribution possible

319
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that would make any difference,

320
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
since there are people willing to actually give up their lives

321
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in order to do a lot of damage to us,

322
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it becomes apparent

323
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that the whole notion

324
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
of this mutually assured destruction would not work.

325
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith,

326
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden.

327
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
He wrote many, many times statements to this effect:

328
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"we have the right to kill four million Americans,

329
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
two million of whom should be children."

330
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And we don't have to go overseas

331
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons.

332
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
McVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack

333
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
in the 1990s

334
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
was a good example of homegrown terrorists.

335
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon?

336
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The fourth element

337
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
is that the high-value U.S. targets

338
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
are accessible, soft and plentiful.

339
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness

340
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that the United States has achieved

341
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
since 9/11 of '01

342
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
is unbelievably inadequate.

343
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
What you saw after Katrina

344
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
is a very good indicator

345
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
of how little prepared the United States is

346
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
for any kind of major attack.

347
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Seven million ship cargo containers

348
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
come into the United States every year.

349
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Five to seven percent only are inspected --

350
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
five to seven percent.

351
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
This is Alexander Lebed,

352
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
who was a general that worked with Yeltsin,

353
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
who talked about, and presented to Congress,

354
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
this idea that the Russians had developed --

355
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield --

356
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
0.1 to one kiloton,

357
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons --

358
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage.

359
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And Lebed came to the United States

360
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and told us that many, many --

361
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
more than 80 of the suitcase bombs

362
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
were actually not accountable.

363
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements.

364
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You put the elements into a suitcase.

365
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It becomes very portable.

366
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
The suitcase can be conveniently dropped

367
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in your trunk of your car.

368
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.

369
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
You don't want to build a suitcase bomb,

370
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and you happen to get one of those insecure

371
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
nuclear warheads that exist.

372
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
This is the size of

373
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.

374
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
It was 9.8 feet long,

375
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to

376
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
your local rent-a-truck

377
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and for 50 bucks or so,

378
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
you rent a truck that's got the right capacity,

379
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and you take your bomb,

380
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
you put it in the truck and you're ready to go.

381
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive?

382
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability,

383
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
but what I'm trying to say is that

384
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
we have all the elements of that happening.

385
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Anybody who dismisses the thought

386
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
of a nuclear weapon

387
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.

388
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community --

389
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
a lot of people who deal with this work in general

390
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things

391
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
to really try to defuse the risk,

392
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
like better interdiction, better prevention,

393
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
better fixing, you know, better screening

394
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth.

395
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.

396
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
At this particular moment,

397
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
we actually could end up

398
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities.

399
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war

400
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
any time soon, although even that is not completely off the table.

401
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
There's still enough nuclear weapons

402
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
in the arsenals of the superpowers

403
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to destroy the Earth many, many times over.

404
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
There are flash points in India and Pakistan,

405
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
in the Middle East, in North Korea,

406
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
other places where the use of nuclear weapons,

407
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
while initially locally,

408
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
could very rapidly

409
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
go into a situation

410
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war.

411
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It's very unsettling.

412
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Here we go. OK.

413
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.

414
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
We're coming down,

415
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and we bring that truck

416
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
that you just saw

417
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
somewhere in here, in the Financial District.

418
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
This is a 10-kiloton bomb,

419
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
slightly smaller than was used

420
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this

421
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
by just giving you some information. I think --

422
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
"news you could use" kind of concept here.

423
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
So, first of all, this would be horrific

424
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
beyond anything we can possibly imagine.

425
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
This is the ultimate.

426
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And if you're in the half-mile radius

427
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
of where this bomb went off,

428
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
you have a 90 percent chance of not making it.

429
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
If you're right where the bomb went off,

430
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
you will be vaporized. And that's --

431
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
I'm just telling you, this is not good.

432
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
(Laughter)

433
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
You assume that.

434
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance

435
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
of being killed,

436
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and up to about eight miles away --

437
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
now I'm talking about killed instantly --

438
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent

439
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
chance of getting killed.

440
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
The thing about this is that

441
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
the experience of the nuclear detonation is --

442
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit

443
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
at the core here, where it goes off,

444
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and an extraordinary amount of energy

445
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
in the form of heat, acute radiation

446
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and blast effects.

447
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
An enormous hurricane-like wind,

448
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and destruction of buildings almost totally,

449
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
within this yellow circle here.

450
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here,

451
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
is that, what happens to you

452
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
if you're in here?

453
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Well, if we're talking about the old days

454
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
of an all-out nuclear attack,

455
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
you, up here,

456
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.

457
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
My point now, though, is that there is a lot

458
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
that we could do for you who are in here,

459
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
if you've survived the initial blast.

460
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
You have, when the blast goes off --

461
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.

462
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
(Laughter)

463
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
If you look at it, you're going to be blind,

464
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
either temporarily or permanently.

465
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
So if there's any way that you can avoid,

466
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.

467
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
If you find yourself alive, but

468
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon,

469
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
you have -- that's gone off --

470
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size

471
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
and exactly where it went off,

472
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
to get out of the way before

473
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
a lethal amount of radiation

474
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.

475
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do --

476
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and I mean this seriously --

477
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
is go about a mile

478
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
away from the blast.

479
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
And what happens is -- this is --

480
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes,

481
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
it comes straight down. Within 24 hours,

482
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds,

483
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and it's mostly in this particular direction --

484
0:20:06.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
it's going northeast.

485
0:20:08.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away.

486
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
So you're feeling the wind --

487
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
and there's tremendous wind now

488
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
that you're going to be feeling -- and you want to go

489
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
perpendicular to the wind

490
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
[not upwind or downwind].

491
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:24,000
if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you.

492
0:20:24.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
You've got to get out of there.

493
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed

494
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:3,000
to lethal radiation in very short order.

495
0:20:30.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
If you can't get out of there,

496
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
we want you to go into a shelter and stay there.

497
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Now, in a shelter in an urban area means

498
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible,

499
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
or you have to be on a floor -- on a high floor --

500
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
if it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be,

501
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher,

502
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:51,000
or in the basement.

503
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible.

504
0:20:55.16,000 --> 0:20:57,000
And if you do that,

505
0:20:57.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
you actually can survive a nuclear blast.

506
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:03,000
Over the next few days to a week,

507
0:21:03.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
there will be a radiation cloud,

508
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:07,000
again, going with the wind, and settling down

509
0:21:07.16,000 --> 0:21:09,000
for another 15 or 20 miles out --

510
0:21:09.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
in this case, over Long Island.

511
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
And if you're in the direct fallout zone here,

512
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there,

513
0:21:16.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
and that's clear. But if you are sheltered,

514
0:21:19.16,000 --> 0:21:21,000
you can actually survive.

515
0:21:21.16,000 --> 0:21:23,000
The difference between knowing information

516
0:21:23.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
of what you're going to do personally,

517
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:27,000
and not knowing information, can save your life,

518
0:21:27.16,000 --> 0:21:29,000
and it could mean the difference between

519
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
150,000 to 200,000 fatalities

520
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
from something like this

521
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:37,000
and half a million to 700,000 fatalities.

522
0:21:37.16,000 --> 0:21:4,000
So, response planning in the twenty-first century

523
0:21:40.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
is both possible and is essential.

524
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
But in 2008, there isn't one single American city

525
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:48,000
that has done effective plans

526
0:21:48.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.

527
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:53,000
Part of the problem is that

528
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
the emergency planners themselves, personally,

529
0:21:55.16,000 --> 0:21:57,000
are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought

530
0:21:57.16,000 --> 0:21:59,000
of nuclear catastrophe.

531
0:21:59.16,000 --> 0:22:01,000
They are paralyzed.

532
0:22:01.16,000 --> 0:22:03,000
You say "nuclear" to them, and they're thinking,

533
0:22:03.16,000 --> 0:22:06,000
"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile."

534
0:22:06.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
And we're trying to tell them, "It's not futile.

535
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:1,000
We can change the survival rates

536
0:22:10.16,000 --> 0:22:13,000
by doing some commonsensical things."

537
0:22:13.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
So the goal here is to minimize fatalities.

538
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:18,000
And I just want to leave you with the personal points

539
0:22:18.16,000 --> 0:22:2,000
that I think you might be interested in.

540
0:22:20.16,000 --> 0:22:22,000
The key to surviving a nuclear blast

541
0:22:22.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
is getting out,

542
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
and not going into harm's way.

543
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:29,000
That's basically all we're going to be talking about here.

544
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:32,000
And the farther you are away in distance,

545
0:22:32.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
the longer it is in time

546
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:36,000
from the initial blast;

547
0:22:36.16,000 --> 0:22:38,000
and the more separation between you

548
0:22:38.16,000 --> 0:22:4,000
and the outside atmosphere, the better.

549
0:22:40.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
So separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete,

550
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:45,000
or being in a basement --

551
0:22:45.16,000 --> 0:22:47,000
distance and time is what will save you.

552
0:22:47.16,000 --> 0:22:49,000
So here's what you do. First of all,

553
0:22:49.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
as I said, don't stare at the light flash,

554
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:53,000
if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.

555
0:22:53.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
But let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.

556
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:22:57,000
You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums

557
0:22:57.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
don't burst from the pressures.

558
0:23:00.16,000 --> 0:23:03,000
If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,

559
0:23:03.16,000 --> 0:23:05,000
like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.

560
0:23:05.16,000 --> 0:23:08,000
And you want to get under something so that you're not injured

561
0:23:08.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
or killed by objects, if that's at all possible.

562
0:23:10.16,000 --> 0:23:12,000
You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,

563
0:23:12.16,000 --> 0:23:14,000
I said, in just a few minutes.

564
0:23:14.16,000 --> 0:23:17,000
And shelter and place. You want to move [only]

565
0:23:17.16,000 --> 0:23:19,000
crosswind for 1.2 miles.

566
0:23:19.16,000 --> 0:23:22,000
You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed

567
0:23:22.16,000 --> 0:23:24,000
and down in that direction,

568
0:23:24.16,000 --> 0:23:26,000
less destroyed here,

569
0:23:26.16,000 --> 0:23:28,000
then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,

570
0:23:28.16,000 --> 0:23:32,000
as long as you're going crosswise to the wind.

571
0:23:32.16,000 --> 0:23:34,000
Once you're out and evacuating,

572
0:23:34.16,000 --> 0:23:35,000
you want to keep as much of your skin,

573
0:23:36.16,000 --> 0:23:38,000
your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering

574
0:23:38.16,000 --> 0:23:41,000
doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.

575
0:23:41.16,000 --> 0:23:44,000
And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.

576
0:23:44.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,

577
0:23:46.16,000 --> 0:23:48,000
you're going to get showered down some place

578
0:23:48.16,000 --> 0:23:5,000
and remove the radiation that would be --

579
0:23:50.16,000 --> 0:23:53,000
the radioactive material that might be on you.

580
0:23:53.16,000 --> 0:23:57,000
And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,

581
0:23:57.16,000 --> 0:23:59,000
but you're going to wait hopefully -- you'll have your little wind-up,

582
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:01,000
battery-less radio,

583
0:24:01.16,000 --> 0:24:03,000
and you'll be waiting for people to tell you

584
0:24:03.16,000 --> 0:24:05,000
when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.

585
0:24:05.16,000 --> 0:24:07,000
In conclusion,

586
0:24:07.16,000 --> 0:24:09,000
nuclear war is less likely than before,

587
0:24:09.16,000 --> 0:24:12,000
but by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.

588
0:24:12.16,000 --> 0:24:15,000
Nuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable --

589
0:24:15.16,000 --> 0:24:17,000
but is survivable.

590
0:24:17.16,000 --> 0:24:19,000
And this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes

591
0:24:19.16,000 --> 0:24:22,000
of the U.S. public health community.

592
0:24:22.16,000 --> 0:24:24,000
And Jack said the only way to deal

593
0:24:24.16,000 --> 0:24:26,000
with nuclear anything,

594
0:24:26.16,000 --> 0:24:28,000
whether it's war or terrorism,

595
0:24:28.16,000 --> 0:24:3,000
is abolition of nuclear weapons.

596
0:24:30.16,000 --> 0:24:33,000
And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,

597
0:24:33.16,000 --> 0:24:35,000
I urge you to think about the fact that

598
0:24:35.16,000 --> 0:24:37,000
we have to do something about this

599
0:24:37.16,000 --> 0:24:39,000
unacceptable, inhumane

600
0:24:39.16,000 --> 0:24:41,000
reality of nuclear weapons

601
0:24:41.16,000 --> 0:24:43,000
in our world.

602
0:24:43.16,000 --> 0:24:45,000
Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I --

603
0:24:45.16,000 --> 0:24:47,000
(Laughter)

604
0:24:47.16,000 --> 0:24:49,000
-- I don't want to be indelicate, but

605
0:24:49.16,000 --> 0:24:51,000
this --

606
0:24:51.16,000 --> 0:24:54,000
he's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK.

607
0:24:54.16,000 --> 0:24:56,000
This was sent to me by somebody

608
0:24:56.16,000 --> 0:24:59,000
who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures,

609
0:24:59.16,000 --> 0:25:01,000
but the fact of the matter is that

610
0:25:01.16,000 --> 0:25:03,000
America's gone through a very hard time.

611
0:25:03.16,000 --> 0:25:06,000
We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do,

612
0:25:06.16,000 --> 0:25:09,000
and now we're facing the potential of

613
0:25:09.16,000 --> 0:25:11,000
bad, hell on Earth.

614
0:25:11.16,000 --> 0:25:13,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:12.825,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Have you heard the news?

2
0:00:14.488,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We're in a clean energy revolution.

3
0:00:17.462,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And where I live in Berkeley, California,

4
0:00:19.476,000 --> 0:00:23,000
it seems like every day I see a new roof with new solar panels going up,

5
0:00:23.784,000 --> 0:00:24,000
electric car in the driveway.

6
0:00:25.812,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Germany sometimes gets half its power from solar,

7
0:00:29.051,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and India is now committed to building 10 times more solar

8
0:00:33.568,000 --> 0:00:34,000
than we have in California,

9
0:00:34.92,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by the year 2022.

10
0:00:36.896,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Even nuclear seems to be making a comeback.

11
0:00:39.874,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Bill Gates is in China working with engineers,

12
0:00:42.943,000 --> 0:00:44,000
there's 40 different companies that are working together

13
0:00:45.764,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to try to race to build the first reactor that runs on waste,

14
0:00:49.113,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that can't melt down

15
0:00:50.374,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and is cheaper than coal.

16
0:00:52.492,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And so you might start to ask:

17
0:00:55.43,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Is this whole global warming problem

18
0:00:57.251,000 --> 0:00:59,000
going to be a lot easier to solve than anybody imagined?

19
0:01:00.504,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That was the question we wanted to know,

20
0:01:02.479,000 --> 0:01:05,000
so my colleagues and I decided to take a deep dive into the data.

21
0:01:05.745,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We were a little skeptical of some parts

22
0:01:07.796,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of the clean energy revolution story,

23
0:01:09.827,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but what we found really surprised us.

24
0:01:12.611,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The first thing is that clean energy has been increasing.

25
0:01:16.545,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is electricity from clean energy sources over the last 20 years.

26
0:01:21.023,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But when you look at the percentage of global electricity

27
0:01:24.765,000 --> 0:01:25,000
from clean energy sources,

28
0:01:26.128,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it's actually been in decline from 36 percent to 31 percent.

29
0:01:30.718,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And if you care about climate change,

30
0:01:32.924,000 --> 0:01:34,000
you've got to go in the opposite direction

31
0:01:35.094,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to 100 percent of our electricity from clean energy sources,

32
0:01:38.668,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as quickly as possible.

33
0:01:40.29,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, you might wonder,

34
0:01:41.471,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"Come on, how much could five percentage points of global electricity be?"

35
0:01:45.364,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well, it turns out to be quite a bit.

36
0:01:47.155,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants

37
0:01:50.322,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the size of Diablo Canyon, California's last nuclear plant,

38
0:01:53.957,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz,

39
0:01:57.65,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which is one of the biggest solar farms in the world,

40
0:02:00.203,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and certainly our biggest in California.

41
0:02:03.587,000 --> 0:02:06,000
A big part of this is simply that fossil fuels are increasing

42
0:02:06.855,000 --> 0:02:07,000
faster than clean energy.

43
0:02:08.132,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And that's understandable.

44
0:02:09.395,000 --> 0:02:1,000
There's just a lot of poor countries

45
0:02:11.134,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that are still using wood and dung and charcoal

46
0:02:13.611,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as their main source of energy,

47
0:02:15.22,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and they need modern fuels.

48
0:02:16.695,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But there's something else going on,

49
0:02:18.668,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which is that one of those clean energy sources in particular

50
0:02:22.747,000 --> 0:02:25,000
has actually been on the decline in absolute terms,

51
0:02:26.179,000 --> 0:02:27,000
not just relatively.

52
0:02:27.704,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And that's nuclear.

53
0:02:28.942,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You can see its generation has declined seven percent

54
0:02:32.615,000 --> 0:02:33,000
over the last 10 years.

55
0:02:34.476,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, solar and wind have been making huge strides,

56
0:02:37.108,000 --> 0:02:39,000
so you hear a lot of talk about how it doesn't really matter,

57
0:02:40.04,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because solar and wind is going to make up the difference.

58
0:02:42.802,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But the data says something different.

59
0:02:44.682,000 --> 0:02:47,000
When you combine all the electricity from solar and wind,

60
0:02:47.751,000 --> 0:02:51,000
you see it actually barely makes up half of the decline from nuclear.

61
0:02:53.758,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Let's take a closer look in the United States.

62
0:02:56.1,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Over the last couple of years -- really 2013, 2014 --

63
0:02:59.915,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we prematurely retired four nuclear power plants.

64
0:03:03.408,000 --> 0:03:05,000
They were almost entirely replaced with fossil fuels,

65
0:03:06.231,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and so the consequence was that we wiped out

66
0:03:09.761,000 --> 0:03:13,000
almost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar.

67
0:03:14.711,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And it's not unique to us.

68
0:03:18.113,000 --> 0:03:21,000
People think of California as a clean energy and climate leader,

69
0:03:21.208,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but when we looked at the data,

70
0:03:23.24,000 --> 0:03:24,000
what we found is that, in fact,

71
0:03:24.765,000 --> 0:03:27,000
California reduced emissions more slowly than the national average,

72
0:03:27.992,000 --> 0:03:28,000
between 2000 and 2015.

73
0:03:30.359,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What about Germany?

74
0:03:31.618,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They're doing a lot of clean energy.

75
0:03:33.675,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But when you look at the data,

76
0:03:35.43,000 --> 0:03:38,000
German emissions have actually been going up since 2009,

77
0:03:38.732,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and there's really not anybody who's going to tell you

78
0:03:41.331,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that they're going to meet their climate commitments in 2020.

79
0:03:45.137,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The reason isn't hard to understand.

80
0:03:46.913,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Solar and wind provide power about 10 to 20 percent of the time,

81
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which means that when the sun's not shining,

82
0:03:52.312,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the wind's not blowing,

83
0:03:53.688,000 --> 0:03:55,000
you still need power for your hospitals,

84
0:03:55.863,000 --> 0:03:57,000
your homes, your cities, your factories.

85
0:03:58.617,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And while batteries have made some really cool improvements lately,

86
0:04:02.545,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the truth is, they're just never going to be as efficient

87
0:04:05.277,000 --> 0:04:06,000
as the electrical grid.

88
0:04:06.5,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Every time you put electricity into a battery and take it out,

89
0:04:09.651,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you lose about 20 to 40 percent of the power.

90
0:04:13.47,000 --> 0:04:15,000
That's why when, in California,

91
0:04:16.087,000 --> 0:04:18,000
we try to deal with all the solar we've brought online --

92
0:04:18.825,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we now get about 10 percent of electricity from solar --

93
0:04:21.613,000 --> 0:04:23,000
when the sun goes down, and people come home from work

94
0:04:24.279,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and turn on their air conditioners and their TV sets,

95
0:04:26.793,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and every other appliance in the house,

96
0:04:28.715,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we need a lot of natural gas backup.

97
0:04:31.2,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So what we've been doing

98
0:04:32.389,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is stuffing a lot of natural gas into the side of a mountain.

99
0:04:35.616,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And that worked pretty well for a while,

100
0:04:37.889,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but then late last year, it sprung a leak.

101
0:04:40.904,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is Aliso Canyon.

102
0:04:42.768,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So much methane gas was released,

103
0:04:45.806,000 --> 0:04:48,000
it was the equivalent of putting half a million cars on the road.

104
0:04:49.016,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It basically blew through all of our climate commitments for the year.

105
0:04:53.681,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Well, what about India?

106
0:04:55.029,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Sometimes you have to go places to really get the right data,

107
0:04:58.304,000 --> 0:04:59,000
so we traveled to India a few months ago.

108
0:05:00.309,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We met with all the top officials -- solar, nuclear, the rest --

109
0:05:03.464,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and what they told us is,

110
0:05:05.029,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"We're actually having more serious problems

111
0:05:07.107,000 --> 0:05:08,000
than both Germany and California.

112
0:05:08.806,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We don't have backup; we don't have all the natural gas.

113
0:05:12.363,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And that's just the start of it.

114
0:05:14.919,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Say we want to get to 100 gigawatts by 2022.

115
0:05:17.832,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But last year we did just five,

116
0:05:19.808,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the year before that, we did five."

117
0:05:21.87,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So, let's just take a closer look at nuclear.

118
0:05:24.77,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

119
0:05:28.017,000 --> 0:05:3,000
has looked at the carbon content of all these different fuels,

120
0:05:31.012,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and nuclear comes out really low -- it's actually lower even than solar.

121
0:05:34.969,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And nuclear obviously provides a lot of power --

122
0:05:38.888,000 --> 0:05:4,000
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

123
0:05:41.465,000 --> 0:05:44,000
During a year, a single plant can provide power 92 percent of the time.

124
0:05:45.423,000 --> 0:05:47,000
What's interesting is that when you look at countries

125
0:05:48.019,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that have deployed different kinds of clean energies,

126
0:05:50.585,000 --> 0:05:51,000
there's only a few that have done so

127
0:05:52.509,000 --> 0:05:54,000
at a pace consistent with dealing with the climate crisis.

128
0:05:55.388,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So nuclear seems like a pretty good option,

129
0:05:57.463,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but there's this big problem with it,

130
0:05:59.525,000 --> 0:06:01,000
which all of you, I'm sure, are aware of,

131
0:06:01.579,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which is that people really don't like it.

132
0:06:04.431,000 --> 0:06:07,000
There was a study, a survey done of people around the world,

133
0:06:07.646,000 --> 0:06:09,000
not just in the United States or Europe,

134
0:06:10.173,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about a year and a half ago.

135
0:06:11.728,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And what they found

136
0:06:13.086,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is that nuclear is actually one of the least popular forms of energy.

137
0:06:16.902,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Even oil is more popular than nuclear.

138
0:06:19.356,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And while nuclear kind of edges out coal, the thing is,

139
0:06:22.546,000 --> 0:06:25,000
people don't really fear coal in the same way they fear nuclear,

140
0:06:26.387,000 --> 0:06:28,000
which really operates on our unconscious.

141
0:06:28.828,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So what is it that we fear?

142
0:06:30.487,000 --> 0:06:31,000
There's really three things.

143
0:06:32.061,000 --> 0:06:34,000
There's the safety of the plants themselves --

144
0:06:34.325,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the fears that they're going to melt down and cause damage;

145
0:06:37.154,000 --> 0:06:38,000
there's the waste from them;

146
0:06:38.523,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and there's the association with weapons.

147
0:06:41.562,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And I think, understandably,

148
0:06:43.022,000 --> 0:06:47,000
engineers look at those concerns and look for technological fixes.

149
0:06:47.088,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That's why Bill Gates is in China developing advanced reactors.

150
0:06:50.095,000 --> 0:06:53,000
That's why 40 different entrepreneurs are working on this problem.

151
0:06:53.243,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And I, myself, have been very excited about it.

152
0:06:55.498,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We did a report: "How to Make Nuclear Cheap."

153
0:06:57.664,000 --> 0:06:59,000
In particular, the thorium reactor shows a lot of promise.

154
0:07:00.586,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So when the climate scientist, James Hansen,

155
0:07:02.714,000 --> 0:07:04,000
asked if I wanted to go to China with him

156
0:07:05.007,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and look at the Chinese advanced nuclear program,

157
0:07:07.415,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I jumped at the chance.

158
0:07:08.689,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We were there with MIT and UC Berkeley engineers.

159
0:07:11.904,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I had in my mind

160
0:07:13.604,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that the Chinese would be able to do with nuclear

161
0:07:15.94,000 --> 0:07:17,000
what they did with so many other things --

162
0:07:18.011,000 --> 0:07:21,000
start to crank out small nuclear reactors on assembly lines,

163
0:07:21.964,000 --> 0:07:25,000
ship them up like iPhones or MacBooks and send them around the world.

164
0:07:26.376,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I would get one at home in Berkeley.

165
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But what I found was somewhat different.

166
0:07:31.105,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The presentations were all very exciting and very promising;

167
0:07:34.033,000 --> 0:07:36,000
they have multiple reactors that they're working on.

168
0:07:36.543,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The time came for the thorium reactor, and a bunch of us were excited.

169
0:07:39.872,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They went through the whole presentation, they got to the timeline,

170
0:07:43.295,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they said,

171
0:07:44.576,000 --> 0:07:47,000
"We're going to have a thorium molten salt reactor

172
0:07:48.118,000 --> 0:07:5,000
ready for sale to the world

173
0:07:50.307,000 --> 0:07:51,000
by 2040."

174
0:07:52.85,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And I was like, "What?"

175
0:07:54.487,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:55.526,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I looked at my colleagues and I was like,

177
0:07:57.558,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"Excuse me --

178
0:07:59.05,000 --> 0:08:01,000
can you guys speed that up a little bit?

179
0:08:01.404,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Because we're in a little bit of a climate crisis right now.

180
0:08:04.502,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And your cities are really polluted, by the way."

181
0:08:07.252,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And they responded back, they were like,

182
0:08:09.594,000 --> 0:08:11,000
"I'm not sure what you've heard about our thorium program,

183
0:08:12.398,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but we don't have a third of our budget,

184
0:08:14.337,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and your department of energy hasn't been particularly forthcoming

185
0:08:17.473,000 --> 0:08:2,000
with all that data you guys have on testing reactors."

186
0:08:21.382,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And I said, "Well, I've got an idea.

187
0:08:23.764,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You know how you've got 10 years where you're demonstrating that reactor?

188
0:08:27.384,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Let's just skip that part,

189
0:08:28.98,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and let's just go right to commercializing it.

190
0:08:31.354,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That will save money and time."

191
0:08:33.379,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And the engineer just looked at me and said,

192
0:08:35.995,000 --> 0:08:36,000
"Let me ask you a question:

193
0:08:37.645,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Would you buy a car that had never been demonstrated before?"

194
0:08:41.913,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So what about the other reactors?

195
0:08:43.534,000 --> 0:08:46,000
There's a reactor that's coming online now, they're starting to sell it.

196
0:08:47.01,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's a high-temperature gas reactor.

197
0:08:48.82,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It can't melt down.

198
0:08:50.845,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But it's really big and bulky, that's part of the safety,

199
0:08:53.604,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and nobody thinks it's going to ever get cheaper

200
0:08:55.916,000 --> 0:08:56,000
than the reactors that we have.

201
0:08:57.88,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The ones that use waste as fuel are really cool ideas, but the truth is,

202
0:09:01.98,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we don't actually know how to do that yet.

203
0:09:04.052,000 --> 0:09:06,000
There's some risk that you'll actually make more waste,

204
0:09:06.671,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and most people think that if you're including

205
0:09:09.489,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that waste part of the process,

206
0:09:11.595,000 --> 0:09:13,000
it's just going to make the whole machine a lot more expensive,

207
0:09:14.586,000 --> 0:09:16,000
it's just adding another complicated step.

208
0:09:17.765,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The truth is,

209
0:09:19.695,000 --> 0:09:22,000
there's real questions about how much of that we're going to do.

210
0:09:22.869,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I mean, we went to India and asked about the nuclear program.

211
0:09:25.779,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The government said before the Paris climate talks

212
0:09:28.201,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that they were going to do something like 30 new nuclear plants.

213
0:09:31.281,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But when we got there and interviewed people

214
0:09:33.376,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and even looked at the internal documents,

215
0:09:35.481,000 --> 0:09:37,000
they're now saying they're going to do about five.

216
0:09:37.957,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And in most of the world, especially the rich world,

217
0:09:40.527,000 --> 0:09:42,000
they're not talking about building new reactors.

218
0:09:42.837,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We're actually talking about taking reactors down

219
0:09:45.149,000 --> 0:09:46,000
before their lifetimes are over.

220
0:09:46.839,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Germany's actually pressuring its neighbors to do that.

221
0:09:49.651,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I mentioned the United States --

222
0:09:51.482,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we could lose half of our reactors over the next 15 years,

223
0:09:55.849,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which would wipe out 40 percent of the emissions reductions

224
0:09:58.69,000 --> 0:10:,000
we're supposed to get under the Clean Power Plan.

225
0:10:01.058,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Of course, in Japan, they took all their nuclear plants offline,

226
0:10:04.149,000 --> 0:10:06,000
replaced them with coal, natural gas, oil burning,

227
0:10:06.526,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and they're only expected to bring online about a third to two-thirds.

228
0:10:10.112,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So when we went through the numbers,

229
0:10:12.681,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and just added that up --

230
0:10:14.028,000 --> 0:10:17,000
how much nuclear do we see China and India bringing online

231
0:10:17.173,000 --> 0:10:18,000
over the next 15 years,

232
0:10:19.159,000 --> 0:10:22,000
how much do we see at risk of being taken offline --

233
0:10:22.739,000 --> 0:10:24,000
this was the most startling finding.

234
0:10:25.052,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What we found is that the world is actually at risk

235
0:10:28.567,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of losing four times more clean energy than we lost over the last 10 years.

236
0:10:34.055,000 --> 0:10:37,000
In other words: we're not in a clean energy revolution;

237
0:10:37.429,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we're in a clean energy crisis.

238
0:10:40.992,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So it's understandable that engineers would look for a technical fix

239
0:10:45.188,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to the fears that people have of nuclear.

240
0:10:47.166,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But when you consider that these are big challenges to do,

241
0:10:49.966,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that they're going to take a long time to solve,

242
0:10:52.275,000 --> 0:10:53,000
there's this other issue, which is:

243
0:10:54.045,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Are those technical fixes really going to solve people's fears?

244
0:10:57.828,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Let's take safety.

245
0:10:59.41,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You know, despite what people think,

246
0:11:01.919,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it's hard to figure out how to make nuclear power much safer.

247
0:11:05.076,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I mean, every medical journal that looks at it --

248
0:11:07.418,000 --> 0:11:1,000
this is the most recent study from the British journal, "Lancet,"

249
0:11:10.55,000 --> 0:11:12,000
one of the most respected journals in the world --

250
0:11:13.027,000 --> 0:11:15,000
nuclear is the safest way to make reliable power.

251
0:11:15.57,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Everybody's scared of the accidents.

252
0:11:17.375,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So you go look at the accident data --

253
0:11:19.693,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Fukushima, Chernobyl --

254
0:11:21.212,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the World Health Organization finds the same thing:

255
0:11:23.939,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the vast majority of harm is caused by people panicking,

256
0:11:27.938,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and they're panicking because they're afraid.

257
0:11:30.282,000 --> 0:11:31,000
In other words,

258
0:11:31.531,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the harm that's caused isn't actually caused by the machines

259
0:11:35.088,000 --> 0:11:36,000
or the radiation.

260
0:11:36.493,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's caused by our fears.

261
0:11:38.573,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And what about the waste?

262
0:11:40.042,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Everyone worries about the waste.

263
0:11:41.658,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Well, the interesting thing about the waste

264
0:11:43.865,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is how little of it there is.

265
0:11:45.308,000 --> 0:11:46,000
This is just from one plant.

266
0:11:46.709,000 --> 0:11:49,000
If you take all the nuclear waste we've ever made in the United States,

267
0:11:50.11,000 --> 0:11:52,000
put it on a football field, stacked it up,

268
0:11:52.333,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it would only reach 20 feet high.

269
0:11:54.58,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And people say it's poisoning people or doing something --

270
0:11:57.878,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it's not, it's just sitting there, it's just being monitored.

271
0:12:00.801,000 --> 0:12:01,000
There's not very much of it.

272
0:12:02.212,000 --> 0:12:05,000
By contrast, the waste that we don't control from energy production --

273
0:12:06.059,000 --> 0:12:09,000
we call it "pollution," and it kills seven million people a year,

274
0:12:09.207,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and it's threatening very serious levels of global warming.

275
0:12:12.06,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel,

276
0:12:16.036,000 --> 0:12:18,000
there's always going to be some fuel left over.

277
0:12:18.335,000 --> 0:12:21,000
That means there's always going to be people that think it's a big problem

278
0:12:22.23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for reasons that maybe don't have as much to do with the actual waste

279
0:12:25.558,000 --> 0:12:26,000
as we think.

280
0:12:26.851,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Well, what about the weapons?

281
0:12:29.052,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Maybe the most surprising thing is that we can't find any examples

282
0:12:32.369,000 --> 0:12:33,000
of countries that have nuclear power

283
0:12:34.346,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and then, "Oh!" decide to go get a weapon.

284
0:12:36.798,000 --> 0:12:37,000
In fact, it works the opposite.

285
0:12:38.524,000 --> 0:12:4,000
What we find is the only way we know

286
0:12:40.714,000 --> 0:12:42,000
how to get rid large numbers of nuclear weapons

287
0:12:43.19,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is by using the plutonium in the warheads

288
0:12:46.014,000 --> 0:12:48,000
as fuel in our nuclear power plants.

289
0:12:48.49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And so, if you are wanting to get the world rid of nuclear weapons,

290
0:12:52.428,000 --> 0:12:54,000
then we're going to need a lot more nuclear power.

291
0:12:55.955,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

292
0:13:01.515,000 --> 0:13:02,000
As I was leaving China,

293
0:13:02.905,000 --> 0:13:05,000
the engineer that brought Bill Gates there kind of pulled me aside,

294
0:13:06.118,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and he said, "You know, Michael, I appreciate your interest

295
0:13:08.923,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in all the different nuclear supply technologies,

296
0:13:11.654,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but there's this more basic issue,

297
0:13:14.6,000 --> 0:13:16,000
which is that there's just not enough global demand.

298
0:13:17.163,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I mean, we can crank out these machines on assembly lines,

299
0:13:20.112,000 --> 0:13:21,000
we do know how to make things cheap,

300
0:13:21.88,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but there's just not enough people that want them."

301
0:13:24.302,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And so, let's do solar and wind and efficiency and conservation.

302
0:13:29.268,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Let's accelerate the advanced nuclear programs.

303
0:13:31.576,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I think we should triple the amount of money we're spending on it.

304
0:13:35.054,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But I just think the most important thing,

305
0:13:37.467,000 --> 0:13:39,000
if we're going to overcome the climate crisis,

306
0:13:39.647,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is to keep in mind that the cause of the clean energy crisis

307
0:13:44.922,000 --> 0:13:46,000
isn't from within our machines,

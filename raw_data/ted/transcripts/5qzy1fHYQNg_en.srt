1
0:00:13.23,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We've got a big problem on our hands with global warming.

2
0:00:16.794,000 --> 0:00:21,000
A lot of you, a lot of people have been watching the floods,

3
0:00:21.839,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the droughts, the storms, the fires.

4
0:00:26.712,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When I leave this stage today, I don't want you to have hope.

5
0:00:32.053,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I want you to have certainty, real certainty

6
0:00:36.077,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that we can make a dent in this problem and live to see it.

7
0:00:42.046,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I want to give you a vision of what that would look like.

8
0:00:46.736,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is the first time we've shared this publicly.

9
0:00:50.498,000 --> 0:00:52,000
You're the first audience to hear it.

10
0:00:54.204,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We are going to launch a rocket.

11
0:00:57.347,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And on that rocket will be a satellite.

12
0:00:59.284,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And that satellite will collect data about pollution

13
0:01:02.79,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that is warming the planet.

14
0:01:05.441,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We will put that data in the hands of people

15
0:01:08.466,000 --> 0:01:11,000
who can make simple fixes

16
0:01:12.149,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that will change the course of global warming in our lifetime.

17
0:01:17.592,000 --> 0:01:2,000
That's a lot to take in, maybe I should back up.

18
0:01:21.626,000 --> 0:01:22,000
First, let me introduce myself, I'm Fred,

19
0:01:23.636,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I've been an environmentalist since I was a kid,

20
0:01:26.096,000 --> 0:01:29,000
when I watched the fish and the frogs in my neighborhood pond

21
0:01:29.635,000 --> 0:01:3,000
die from a chemical spill.

22
0:01:32.673,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That bothered me.

23
0:01:34.728,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Later, a professor inspired me to think about environmentalism differently.

24
0:01:41.542,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How the best solutions come from

25
0:01:44.86,000 --> 0:01:46,000
answering people's aspirations for prosperity,

26
0:01:47.59,000 --> 0:01:52,000
things like being safe and healthy and thriving in this world.

27
0:01:54.014,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I joined the Environmental Defense Fund to build those kind of solutions.

28
0:01:59.296,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I've worked my whole career for a moment like this --

29
0:02:03.899,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the moment, when we can stop fighting headwinds

30
0:02:07.617,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and start to have the wind at our backs.

31
0:02:10.949,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because of the power of information,

32
0:02:13.641,000 --> 0:02:15,000
information from technology

33
0:02:15.974,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that is coming down in price and going up in precision.

34
0:02:21.014,000 --> 0:02:24,000
You see, there's something about climate change that we didn't grasp

35
0:02:24.839,000 --> 0:02:25,000
just a decade ago.

36
0:02:26.855,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The world was so focused on carbon dioxide

37
0:02:30.971,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that we overlooked another important gas.

38
0:02:34.312,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We didn't appreciate methane.

39
0:02:37.236,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Methane pollution causes one quarter of the global warming

40
0:02:40.307,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that we're experiencing right now.

41
0:02:43.641,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Pound for pound, its immediate impact is far greater than carbon dioxide.

42
0:02:49.173,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Eighty four times greater over a 20-year period.

43
0:02:56.022,000 --> 0:02:58,000
One of the largest sources of methane pollution

44
0:02:58.618,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is the oil and gas industry.

45
0:03:01.038,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But that's not obvious, because methane is invisible.

46
0:03:05.411,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Let's take a look at this natural gas storage facility

47
0:03:08.323,000 --> 0:03:09,000
outside of Los Angeles.

48
0:03:10.657,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Can you see the methane?

49
0:03:14.022,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Neither can I.

50
0:03:15.783,000 --> 0:03:16,000
How about now?

51
0:03:17.53,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We shot this using an infrared camera, at the same spot,

52
0:03:21.696,000 --> 0:03:25,000
exposing one of the worst methane leaks in the history of the United States.

53
0:03:26.847,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That's a very different picture.

54
0:03:29.251,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It turns out that natural gas is displacing our dependence on coal,

55
0:03:33.934,000 --> 0:03:35,000
which emits far more carbon dioxide.

56
0:03:37.466,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But natural gas is mostly methane.

57
0:03:40.427,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So, as it's produced and processed

58
0:03:42.991,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and transported to homes and businesses across America,

59
0:03:47.562,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it escapes from wells and pipes and other equipment.

60
0:03:53.435,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It gets up into the sky and contributes

61
0:03:56.237,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to the disasters that we're now experiencing.

62
0:04:00.467,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That does not have to happen.

63
0:04:03.712,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But nobody had paid much attention to it

64
0:04:05.752,000 --> 0:04:08,000
until we launched a nationwide study to understand the problem.

65
0:04:10.061,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We used drones, planes, helicopters, even Google Street View cars.

66
0:04:16.537,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It turns out there's far more of this methane pollution

67
0:04:19.958,000 --> 0:04:21,000
than what the government is reporting.

68
0:04:22.789,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It also turns out that when we find where the gas is being vented and leaked,

69
0:04:29.512,000 --> 0:04:33,000
most of those sources can be fixed easily and inexpensively,

70
0:04:33.68,000 --> 0:04:36,000
saving the gas that would have otherwise been wasted.

71
0:04:38.116,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And finally, we learn that when you put information like that into people's hands,

72
0:04:43.323,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they act.

73
0:04:45.68,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Leading companies replaced valves and tightened loose-fitting pipes.

74
0:04:50.393,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Colorado became the first state in the nation to limit methane pollution;

75
0:04:54.673,000 --> 0:04:57,000
California followed suit, and the public joined in.

76
0:04:59.967,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Tweets started flying -- #cutmethane.

77
0:05:04.825,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And everybody's paying more attention now.

78
0:05:09.094,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're doing this because we can't wait for Washington, especially not now.

79
0:05:16.847,000 --> 0:05:21,000
In fact, we have to take what we've done so far

80
0:05:22.244,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and go higher, to the sky.

81
0:05:25.371,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The United Stated represents about 10 percent of this pollution.

82
0:05:30.308,000 --> 0:05:32,000
To find the rest, we have to go global.

83
0:05:33.911,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Remember that rocket I mentioned?

84
0:05:35.64,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It will launch a compact satellite, called MethaneSAT,

85
0:05:39.101,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to do what no one has been able to do until now:

86
0:05:43.109,000 --> 0:05:48,000
measure methane pollution from oil and gas facilities worldwide,

87
0:05:48.236,000 --> 0:05:49,000
with exacting precision.

88
0:05:50.664,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Its data stream will allow us to map that pollution,

89
0:05:54.18,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so that everyone can see it.

90
0:05:56.712,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Then it's all about turning data into action,

91
0:05:59.117,000 --> 0:06:01,000
just as we did in the United States.

92
0:06:01.513,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We've seen that when we present companies with data,

93
0:06:06.752,000 --> 0:06:08,000
many of them will cut the pollution.

94
0:06:10.379,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Citizens will be empowered to take action;

95
0:06:13.458,000 --> 0:06:15,000
governments will tighten the regulations.

96
0:06:17.331,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And because all of our data will be free and public,

97
0:06:21.173,000 --> 0:06:22,000
there will be transparency --

98
0:06:22.578,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we'll all be able to see how much progress is being made and where.

99
0:06:27.609,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Which brings me to our goal:

100
0:06:29.474,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to cut this methane pollution by 45 percent by 2025.

101
0:06:35.526,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Applause)

102
0:06:42.387,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That will have the same near-term impact

103
0:06:46.006,000 --> 0:06:5,000
as shutting down 1,300 coal-fired power plants.

104
0:06:51.482,000 --> 0:06:55,000
That's one third of all the coal-fired power plants in the world.

105
0:06:55.997,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Nothing else can have this sort of near-term impact at such a low cost.

106
0:07:02.302,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The fact that a single satellite

107
0:07:04.969,000 --> 0:07:08,000
can help us put the brakes on global warming is truly remarkable.

108
0:07:10.482,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is our chance to create change in our lifetimes,

109
0:07:14.847,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and we can do it now.

110
0:07:17.648,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Thanks to the generous giving of the Audacious Project,

111
0:07:20.506,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we are on a path toward liftoff.

112
0:07:23.665,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But my time is running short, and I promised you a vision

113
0:07:27.665,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of what a critical piece of the solution would look like.

114
0:07:32.744,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Can you see it?

115
0:07:35.378,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Can you see how this satellite leverages

116
0:07:37.45,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the best of science and data and technology?

117
0:07:42.252,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Can you see we're entering a whole new era of innovation

118
0:07:45.506,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that is supercharging progress?

119
0:07:47.998,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Can you see that it's in our hands?

120
0:07:51.752,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We've set an aggressive goal of three years till liftoff,

121
0:07:55.315,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and when that satellite is ready, we'll have a launch party.

122
0:08:00.284,000 --> 0:08:01,000
A literal launch party.

123
0:08:03.3,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So imagine a blue-sky day, crowds of people,

124
0:08:08.399,000 --> 0:08:09,000
television cameras,

125
0:08:10.323,000 --> 0:08:12,000
kids staring up toward the sky

126
0:08:12.88,000 --> 0:08:14,000
at a thing that will change their future.

127
0:08:16.117,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What an amazing day that will be.

128
0:08:18.752,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What a big opportunity we have.

129
0:08:21.514,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I can't wait.

130
0:08:23.037,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Thank you.

131
0:08:24.212,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The first question is this.

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Our country has two exploration programs.

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
One is NASA, with a mission to explore the great beyond,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to explore the heavens, which we all want to go to if we're lucky.

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And you can see we have Sputnik, and we have Saturn,

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we have other manifestations of space exploration.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Well, there's also another program,

8
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in another agency within our government, in ocean exploration.

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's in NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

10
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And my question is this: "why are we ignoring the oceans?"

11
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Here's the reason, or not the reason, but here's why I ask that question.

12
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens,

13
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that one-year budget would fund NOAA's budget

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to explore the oceans for 1,600 years.

15
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Why? Why are we looking up? Is it because it's heaven?

16
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue?

17
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Why are people afraid of the ocean?

18
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark, gloomy place

19
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that has nothing to offer?

20
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet, so buckle up.

21
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
OK. And what we're going to do

22
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world.

23
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And what I'm going to try -- I hope I make the following points.

24
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'm going to make it right now in case I forget.

25
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Everything I'm going to present to you

26
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
was not in my textbooks when I went to school.

27
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And most of all, it was not even in my college textbooks.

28
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I'm a geophysicist, and all my Earth science books when I was a student --

29
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I had to give the wrong answer to get an A.

30
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at.

31
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle, which is a bunch of crap.

32
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
In today's context, it was a bunch of crap,

33
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but it was the law of geology, vertical tectonics.

34
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
All the things we're going to walk through

35
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans

36
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
were mostly discoveries made by accident.

37
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Mostly discoveries made by accident.

38
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We were looking for something and found something else.

39
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And everything we're going to talk about

40
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse, because that's all we've seen.

41
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I have a characterization.

42
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.

43
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It gives you the false impression it's a map.

44
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It is not a map.

45
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In fact, I have another version at my office

46
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and I ask people, "Why are there mountains here, on this area here,

47
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but there are none over here?" And they go, "Well, gee,

48
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
I don't know," saying,

49
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?"

50
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
No, no, that's the only place a ship's been.

51
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored.

52
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We had more exploration ships down there

53
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing.

54
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves

55
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in the 72 percent of the planet because, you know,

56
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny

57
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
put all the resources on the continents.

58
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You know, it's just ludicrous.

60
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We are always, constantly playing the zero sum game.

61
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You know, we're going to do this, we're going to take it away from something else.

62
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I believe in just enriching the economy.

63
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And we're leaving so much on the table, 72 percent of the planet.

64
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And as I will point out later in the presentation,

65
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
50 percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.

66
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
50 percent of our country that we own, have all legal jurisdiction,

67
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have all rights to do whatever we want, lies beneath the sea

68
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and we have better maps of Mars than that 50 percent.

69
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Why? OK. Now, I began my explorations the hard way.

70
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Back then -- actually my first expedition

71
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
was when I was 17 years old. It was 49 years ago.

72
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Do the math, I'm 66. And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship

73
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave,

74
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and I was too young to be -- you know, I thought it was great!

75
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I was a body surfer and I thought, "Wow, that was an incredible wave!"

76
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And we almost sank the ship, but I became enraptured

77
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with mounting expeditions. And over the last 49 years,

78
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I've done about 120, 121 -- I keep doing them -- expeditions.

79
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But in the early days, the only way I could get to the bottom

80
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
was to crawl into a submarine, a very small submarine,

81
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and go down to the bottom.

82
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles.

83
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana,

84
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and all the major deep submersibles we have, which are about eight.

85
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In fact, on a good day, we might have four or five human beings

86
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
at the average depth of the Earth --

87
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going.

88
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And so it's very difficult to get there, if you do it physically.

89
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But I was enraptured, and in my graduate years

90
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized

91
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea.

92
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball.

93
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is on a Mercator projection.

94
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But if you were to put it on an equal area projection,

95
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent

96
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of the Earth's total surface area.

97
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range

98
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong

99
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon.

100
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So we went to the moon, played golf up there,

101
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.

102
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days,

103
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet,

104
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.

105
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge

106
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
where the great crustal plates are separating.

107
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And like a living organism, you tear it open,

108
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound

109
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
from the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally.

110
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But no one had actually gone down

111
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it --

112
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
into the Rift Valley -- until a group of seven of us

113
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
crawled in our little submarines in the summer of 1973, 1974

114
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley.

115
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We went down into the Rift Valley.

116
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This is all accurate except for one thing -- it's pitch black.

117
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's absolutely pitch black, because

118
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean,

119
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which is 12,000 feet. In the Rift Valley, it's 9,000 feet.

120
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun.

121
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Most of our planet is in eternal darkness.

122
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And for that reason, you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea.

123
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And with the absence of photosynthesis

124
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
you have no plant life, and as a result,

125
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you have very little animal life living in this underworld.

126
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations,

127
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation,

128
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
looking at the volcanic features running along that entire 42,000 miles.

129
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Running along this entire 42,000 miles

130
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
are tens of thousands of active volcanoes.

131
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Tens of thousands of active volcanoes.

132
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea

133
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
than on land by two orders of magnitude.

134
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, it's a phenomenally active region,

135
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
it's not just a dark, boring place. It's a very alive place.

136
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And it's then being ripped open.

137
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then.

138
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension.

139
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In plate tectonic theory, we knew that if you had plates collide,

140
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it made sense: they would crush into one another,

141
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
you would thicken the crust, you'd uplift it.

142
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That's why you get, you know, you get seashells up on Mount Everest.

143
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's not a flood, it was pushed up there.

144
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We understood mountains under compression,

145
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension.

146
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said,

147
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"It looks to me like a thermal blister, and the mid-ocean ridge

148
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
must be a cooling curve." We said, "Let's go find out."

149
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense,

150
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
except, at the axis, there was missing heat. It was missing heat.

151
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It was hot. It wasn't hot enough.

152
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So, we came up with multiple hypotheses:

153
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
there's little green people down there taking it;

154
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
there's all sorts of things going on.

155
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But the only logical [explanation] was that there were hot springs.

156
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, there must be underwater hot springs.

157
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat.

158
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And so we went along this mountain range, in an area along Galapagos Rift,

159
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and did we find the missing heat.

160
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It was amazing. These giant chimneys, huge giant chimneys.

161
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We went up to them with our submersible.

162
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We wanted to get a temperature probe, we stuck it in there,

163
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
looked at it -- it pegged off scale.

164
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The pilot made this great observation: "That's hot."

165
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff --

167
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature

168
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
was 650 degrees F, hot enough to melt lead.

169
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This is what a real one looks like, on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.

170
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ

171
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of chemicals coming out of the ocean.

172
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade:

173
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
copper, lead, silver, zinc and gold.

174
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor,

175
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and you have massive heavy metal deposits

176
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that we're making in this mountain range.

177
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore

178
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
along this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered.

179
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We discovered a profusion of life,

180
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.

181
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I remember having to use vodka -- my own vodka -- to pickle it

182
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because we don't carry formaldehyde.

183
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We went and found these incredible clam beds

184
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
sitting on the barren rock. Large clams,

185
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and when we opened them, they didn't look like a clam.

186
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And when we cut them open, they didn't have the anatomy of a clam.

187
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
No mouth, no gut, no digestive system.

188
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Their bodies had been totally taken over

189
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
by another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out

190
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark,

191
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
through a process we now call chemosynthesis.

192
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks.

193
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We did not know about this life system.

194
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We were not predicting it.

195
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat.

196
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So, we wanted to accelerate this process.

197
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We wanted to get away from this silly trip, up and down on a submarine:

198
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
average depth of the ocean, 12,000 feet;

199
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
two and half hours to get to work in the morning;

200
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work.

201
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Three hours of bottom time, average distance traveled -- one mile.

202
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Laughter)

203
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
On a 42,000 mile mountain range. Great job security, but not the way to go.

204
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So, I began designing a new technology of telepresence,

205
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
using robotic systems to replicate myself,

206
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system.

207
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We began to introduce that in our explorations,

208
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries

209
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
with our new robotic technologies. Again, looking for something else,

210
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
moving from one part of the mid-ocean ridge to another.

211
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms.

212
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They came across new creatures they had not seen before.

213
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But more importantly, they discovered

214
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
edifices down there that they did not understand.

215
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber.

216
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City.

217
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations

218
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and upside down pools. Look at that.

219
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
How do you do that? That's water upside down.

220
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We went in underneath and tapped it, and we found that it had the pH of Drano.

221
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The pH of 11, and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it

222
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and at this extreme environment.

223
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment.

224
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
All the way at the other end, in an alkaline environment,

225
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
at a pH of 11, life existed.

226
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So life was much more creative than we had ever thought.

227
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Again, discovered by accident. Just two years ago

228
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
working off Santorini, where people are sunning themselves on the beach,

229
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby,

230
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems

231
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and more life systems.

232
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe,

233
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and they were oblivious to the existence of this system.

234
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge.

235
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Recently, diving off -- in the Gulf of Mexico, finding pools of water,

236
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
this time not upside down, right side up.

237
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Bingo. You'd think you're in air, until a fish swims by.

238
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs.

239
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Near that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane.

240
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Instead of belching out lava, they were belching out

241
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
big, big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes,

242
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and there were flows, not of lava,

243
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by --

244
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I've never seen this before.

245
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Moving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea --

246
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic.

247
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.

248
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.

249
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And yet we're only now penetrating it.

250
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Finding the state of preservation.

251
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We found the Bismarck in 16,000 feet. We then found the Yorktown.

252
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
People always ask, "Did you find the right ship?"

253
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It said Yorktown on the stern.

254
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Laughter)

255
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
More recently, finding ancient history.

256
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
How many ancient mariners have had a bad day? The number's a million.

257
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes,

258
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
where they're not supposed to be.

259
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
This shipwreck sank 100 years before the birth of Christ.

260
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
This one sank carrying a prefabricated, Home Depot Roman temple.

261
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer, at 750 B.C.

262
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
More recently, into the Black Sea, where we're exploring.

263
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Because there's no oxygen there, it's the largest reservoir

264
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved.

265
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
All their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them.

266
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA.

267
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Look at the state of preservation --

268
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts.

269
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped, they sealed it.

270
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This ship sank 1,500 years ago.

271
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Fortunately, we've been able to convince Congress.

272
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We begin to go on the Hill and lobby.

273
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy.

274
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The Okeanos Explorer on its mission.

275
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Its mission is as good as you could get.

276
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth.

277
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK.

278
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Applause)

279
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It comes online this summer,

280
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and it begins its journey of exploration.

281
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.

282
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
But certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America.

283
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea.

284
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We own all of that blue and yet,

285
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
like I say, particularly the western territorial trust,

286
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them.

287
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We have maps of Venus, but not of the western territorial trust.

288
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The way we're going to run this -- we have no idea what we're going to discover.

289
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We have no idea what we're going to discover.

290
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
We're going to discover an ancient shipwreck, a Phoenician off Brazil,

291
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
or a new rock formation, a new life.

292
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So, we're going to run it like an emergency hospital.

293
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We're going to connect our command center,

294
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
via a high-bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building

295
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
at the University of Rhode Island, called the Interspace Center.

296
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And within that, we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine,

297
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
blue-gold team, switching them off and on, running 24 hours a day.

298
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
A discovery is made, that discovery is instantly seen

299
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
in the command center a second later.

300
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But then it's connected through Internet too --

301
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the new Internet highway that makes Internet one

302
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
look like a dirt road on the information highway --

303
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
with 10 gigabits of bandwidth.

304
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.

305
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours,

306
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
have the maps disseminated out to the major universities.

307
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It turns out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect

308
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
in this country are at 12 universities. They're all on I-2.

309
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
We can then build a command center.

310
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
This is a remote center at the University of Washington.

311
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
She's talking to the pilot. She's 5,000 miles away, but she's assumed command.

312
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
But the beauty of this, too, is we can then disseminate it to children.

313
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
We can disseminate.

314
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
They can follow this expedition. I've started a program --

315
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
where are you Jim? Jim Young who helped me start a program

316
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
called the Jason Project. More recently, we've started a program

317
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America,

318
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
so that we can use exploration,

319
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and the excitement of live exploration, to motivate them and excite them

320
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and then give them what they're already ready for.

321
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I would not let an adult drive my robot.

322
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
You don't have enough gaming experience.

323
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system.

324
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Applause)

325
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Because we want to create --

326
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
we want to create the classroom of tomorrow.

327
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done.

328
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.

329
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
The game is not over -- it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning.

330
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
We need to be not only proud of our universities.

331
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
We need to be proud of our middle schools.

332
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And when we have the best middle schools in the world,

333
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system, let me tell you.

334
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Because this is what we want. This is what we want.

335
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
This is a young lady, not watching a football game,

336
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
not watching a basketball game.

337
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away,

338
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing.

339
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.

340
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
You can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode.

341
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
(Applause)

342
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
This, I hope, will be a future engineer

343
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
or a future scientist in the battle for truth.

344
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And my final question, my final question --

345
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea?

346
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars,

347
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon,

348
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet?

349
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And the technology is at hand.

350
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Thank you very much.

351
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Applause)

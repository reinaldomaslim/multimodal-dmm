1
0:00:12.647,000 --> 0:00:14,000
You've all been in a bar, right?

2
0:00:14.913,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:16.759,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But have you ever gone to a bar

4
0:00:19.477,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and come out with a $200 million business?

5
0:00:24.276,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's what happened to us about 10 years ago.

6
0:00:27.445,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We'd had a terrible day.

7
0:00:30.012,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We had this huge client that was killing us.

8
0:00:34.1,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We're a software consulting firm,

9
0:00:36.728,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we couldn't find a very specific programming skill

10
0:00:39.734,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to help this client deploy a cutting-edge cloud system.

11
0:00:43.798,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We have a bunch of engineers,

12
0:00:45.243,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but none of them could please this client.

13
0:00:49.274,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And we were about to be fired.

14
0:00:51.888,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So we go out to the bar,

15
0:00:54.247,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and we're hanging out with our bartender friend Jeff,

16
0:00:58.318,000 --> 0:01:,000
and he's doing what all good bartenders do:

17
0:01:00.343,000 --> 0:01:03,000
he's commiserating with us, making us feel better,

18
0:01:03.389,000 --> 0:01:05,000
relating to our pain,

19
0:01:05.705,000 --> 0:01:07,000
saying, "Hey, these guys are overblowing it.

20
0:01:07.777,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Don't worry about it."

21
0:01:08.984,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And finally, he deadpans us and says,

22
0:01:11.222,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Why don't you send me in there?

23
0:01:13.539,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I can figure it out."

24
0:01:15.585,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So the next morning, we're hanging out in our team meeting,

25
0:01:19.901,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and we're all a little hazy ...

26
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:24.504,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I half-jokingly throw it out there.

28
0:01:26.648,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I say, "Hey, I mean, we're about to be fired."

29
0:01:29.256,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So I say,

30
0:01:30.582,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"Why don't we send in Jeff, the bartender?"

31
0:01:32.688,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:35.789,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And there's some silence, some quizzical looks.

33
0:01:39.874,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Finally, my chief of staff says, "That is a great idea."

34
0:01:43.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:45.201,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"Jeff is wicked smart. He's brilliant.

36
0:01:48.168,000 --> 0:01:49,000
He'll figure it out.

37
0:01:50.328,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Let's send him in there."

38
0:01:52.189,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, Jeff was not a programmer.

39
0:01:54.739,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In fact, he had dropped out of Penn as a philosophy major.

40
0:01:59.491,000 --> 0:02:,000
But he was brilliant,

41
0:02:01.509,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and he could go deep on topics,

42
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and we were about to be fired.

43
0:02:06.216,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So we sent him in.

44
0:02:09.839,000 --> 0:02:1,000
After a couple days of suspense,

45
0:02:11.849,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Jeff was still there.

46
0:02:15.002,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They hadn't sent him home.

47
0:02:17.166,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I couldn't believe it.

48
0:02:19.256,000 --> 0:02:2,000
What was he doing?

49
0:02:21.281,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Here's what I learned.

50
0:02:23.318,000 --> 0:02:27,000
He had completely disarmed their fixation on the programming skill.

51
0:02:29.004,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And he had changed the conversation,

52
0:02:31.949,000 --> 0:02:33,000
even changing what we were building.

53
0:02:33.989,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The conversation was now about what we were going to build and why.

54
0:02:41.059,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And yes, Jeff figured out how to program the solution,

55
0:02:46.441,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and the client became one of our best references.

56
0:02:50.782,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Back then, we were 200 people,

57
0:02:52.783,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and half of our company was made up of computer science majors or engineers,

58
0:02:59.127,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but our experience with Jeff left us wondering:

59
0:03:02.627,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Could we repeat this through our business?

60
0:03:06.017,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So we changed the way we recruited and trained.

61
0:03:11.766,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And while we still sought after computer engineers and computer science majors,

62
0:03:17.774,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we sprinkled in artists, musicians, writers ...

63
0:03:24.818,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and Jeff's story started to multiply itself throughout our company.

64
0:03:29.216,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Our chief technology officer is an English major,

65
0:03:34.168,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and he was a bike messenger in Manhattan.

66
0:03:38.68,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And today, we're a thousand people,

67
0:03:41.935,000 --> 0:03:46,000
yet still less than a hundred have degrees in computer science or engineering.

68
0:03:48.984,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And yes, we're still a computer consulting firm.

69
0:03:52.191,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We're the number one player in our market.

70
0:03:54.341,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We work with the fastest-growing software package

71
0:03:56.718,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to ever reach 10 billion dollars in annual sales.

72
0:04:01.015,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So it's working.

73
0:04:05.426,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Meanwhile, the push for STEM-based education in this country --

74
0:04:11.181,000 --> 0:04:14,000
science, technology, engineering, mathematics --

75
0:04:14.539,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is fierce.

76
0:04:15.775,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's in all of our faces.

77
0:04:18.355,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And this is a colossal mistake.

78
0:04:21.707,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Since 2009, STEM majors in the United States

79
0:04:25.96,000 --> 0:04:27,000
have increased by 43 percent,

80
0:04:28.04,000 --> 0:04:3,000
while the humanities have stayed flat.

81
0:04:30.492,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Our past president

82
0:04:33.047,000 --> 0:04:36,000
dedicated over a billion dollars towards STEM education

83
0:04:36.574,000 --> 0:04:38,000
at the expense of other subjects,

84
0:04:39.437,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and our current president

85
0:04:42.337,000 --> 0:04:46,000
recently redirected 200 million dollars of Department of Education funding

86
0:04:47.228,000 --> 0:04:48,000
into computer science.

87
0:04:49.788,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And CEOs are continually complaining about an engineering-starved workforce.

88
0:04:57.717,000 --> 0:04:58,000
These campaigns,

89
0:05:00.583,000 --> 0:05:03,000
coupled with the undeniable success of the tech economy --

90
0:05:04.155,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I mean, let's face it,

91
0:05:05.427,000 --> 0:05:1,000
seven out of the 10 most valuable companies in the world by market cap

92
0:05:10.959,000 --> 0:05:11,000
are technology firms --

93
0:05:13.662,000 --> 0:05:14,000
these things create an assumption

94
0:05:16.805,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that the path of our future workforce will be dominated by STEM.

95
0:05:24.583,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I get it.

96
0:05:26.692,000 --> 0:05:27,000
On paper, it makes sense.

97
0:05:29.498,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's tempting.

98
0:05:33.597,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But it's totally overblown.

99
0:05:35.554,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's like, the entire soccer team chases the ball into the corner,

100
0:05:41.629,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because that's where the ball is.

101
0:05:44.841,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We shouldn't overvalue STEM.

102
0:05:48.133,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We shouldn't value the sciences any more than we value the humanities.

103
0:05:52.544,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And there are a couple of reasons.

104
0:05:55.058,000 --> 0:06:,000
Number one, today's technologies are incredibly intuitive.

105
0:06:01.068,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The reason we've been able to recruit from all disciplines

106
0:06:05.092,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and swivel into specialized skills

107
0:06:08.377,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is because modern systems can be manipulated without writing code.

108
0:06:13.155,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They're like LEGO: easy to put together, easy to learn, even easy to program,

109
0:06:19.033,000 --> 0:06:22,000
given the vast amounts of information that are available for learning.

110
0:06:23.173,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Yes, our workforce needs specialized skill,

111
0:06:27.242,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but that skill requires a far less rigorous and formalized education

112
0:06:32.06,000 --> 0:06:33,000
than it did in the past.

113
0:06:34.876,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Number two, the skills that are imperative and differentiated

114
0:06:40.639,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in a world with intuitive technology

115
0:06:43.812,000 --> 0:06:46,000
are the skills that help us to work together as humans,

116
0:06:49.184,000 --> 0:06:52,000
where the hard work is envisioning the end product

117
0:06:54.193,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and its usefulness,

118
0:06:55.709,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which requires real-world experience and judgment and historical context.

119
0:07:03.232,000 --> 0:07:05,000
What Jeff's story taught us

120
0:07:05.542,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is that the customer was focused on the wrong thing.

121
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's the classic case:

122
0:07:12.661,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the technologist struggling to communicate with the business and the end user,

123
0:07:16.947,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and the business failing to articulate their needs.

124
0:07:22.033,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I see it every day.

125
0:07:25.448,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We are scratching the surface

126
0:07:27.394,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in our ability as humans to communicate and invent together,

127
0:07:32.227,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and while the sciences teach us how to build things,

128
0:07:36.831,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it's the humanities that teach us what to build and why to build them.

129
0:07:43.612,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And they're equally as important,

130
0:07:46.24,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and they're just as hard.

131
0:07:50.476,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It irks me ...

132
0:07:54.532,000 --> 0:07:59,000
when I hear people treat the humanities as a lesser path,

133
0:08:00.049,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as the easier path.

134
0:08:01.84,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Come on!

135
0:08:04.258,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The humanities give us the context of our world.

136
0:08:10.573,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They teach us how to think critically.

137
0:08:14.034,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They are purposely unstructured,

138
0:08:16.027,000 --> 0:08:18,000
while the sciences are purposely structured.

139
0:08:19.745,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They teach us to persuade, they give us our language,

140
0:08:23.357,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which we use to convert our emotions to thought and action.

141
0:08:32.267,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And they need to be on equal footing with the sciences.

142
0:08:36.555,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And yes, you can hire a bunch of artists

143
0:08:40.571,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and build a tech company

144
0:08:43.166,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and have an incredible outcome.

145
0:08:46.616,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now, I'm not here today to tell you that STEM's bad.

146
0:08:52.778,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I'm not here today to tell you that girls shouldn't code.

147
0:08:57.111,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

148
0:08:58.174,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Please.

149
0:09:00.355,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And that next bridge I drive over

150
0:09:02.947,000 --> 0:09:05,000
or that next elevator we all jump into --

151
0:09:07.602,000 --> 0:09:09,000
let's make sure there's an engineer behind it.

152
0:09:09.833,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

153
0:09:14.233,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But to fall into this paranoia

154
0:09:17.552,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that our future jobs will be dominated by STEM,

155
0:09:22.448,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that's just folly.

156
0:09:24.526,000 --> 0:09:28,000
If you have friends or kids or relatives or grandchildren

157
0:09:28.641,000 --> 0:09:29,000
or nieces or nephews ...

158
0:09:30.464,000 --> 0:09:33,000
encourage them to be whatever they want to be.

159
0:09:34.336,000 --> 0:09:4,000

160
0:09:41.607,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The jobs will be there.

161
0:09:45.741,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Those tech CEOs

162
0:09:48.235,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that are clamoring for STEM grads,

163
0:09:51.593,000 --> 0:09:52,000
you know what they're hiring for?

164
0:09:54.43,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Google, Apple, Facebook.

165
0:09:57.468,000 --> 0:10:,000
Sixty-five percent of their open job opportunities

166
0:10:01.119,000 --> 0:10:02,000
are non-technical:

167
0:10:03.845,000 --> 0:10:07,000
marketers, designers, project managers, program managers,

168
0:10:08.758,000 --> 0:10:11,000
product managers, lawyers, HR specialists,

169
0:10:12.163,000 --> 0:10:15,000
trainers, coaches, sellers, buyers, on and on.

170
0:10:15.512,000 --> 0:10:18,000
These are the jobs they're hiring for.

171
0:10:20.602,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And if there's one thing that our future workforce needs --

172
0:10:26.031,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and I think we can all agree on this --

173
0:10:29.056,000 --> 0:10:3,000
it's diversity.

174
0:10:31.706,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But that diversity shouldn't end with gender or race.

175
0:10:35.804,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We need a diversity of backgrounds

176
0:10:39.192,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and skills,

177
0:10:42.1,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with introverts and extroverts

178
0:10:45.862,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and leaders and followers.

179
0:10:48.839,000 --> 0:10:49,000
That is our future workforce.

180
0:10:51.767,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And the fact that the technology is getting easier and more accessible

181
0:10:57.49,000 --> 0:10:58,000
frees that workforce up

182
0:10:59.332,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to study whatever they damn well please.

183
0:11:03.273,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Thank you.

184
0:11:04.448,000 --> 0:11:1,000

1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is your conference,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So, I'm just going to grab a chair here.

5
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Two years ago at TED, I think --

6
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I've come to this conclusion --

7
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.

8
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I think that I may have believed unconsciously,

9
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
then, that I was kind of a business hero.

10
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;

11
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it was a magazine publishing company.

12
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It had recently gone public

13
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,

14
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a number I didn't really understand.

15
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
A magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0

16
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
was fatter than a telephone directory,

17
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
busy pumping hot air into the bubble.

18
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom

20
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.

21
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And all this had come from nothing.

22
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at

23
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."

24
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them

25
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.

26
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The date was February 2000.

27
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I thought the little graph of my business life

28
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law --

29
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.

30
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.

31
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The dotcom, ironically called Snowball,

32
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
was the very last consumer web company to go public

33
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.

34
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I watched everything that I'd built crumbling,

35
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it looked like all this stuff was going to die

36
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and 15 years work would have come for nothing.

37
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And it was gut wrenching.

38
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,

39
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
something which I was very proud of in the business.

40
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people,

41
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs

42
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
from my companies. I felt sick.

43
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I watched my own net worth falling

44
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.

45
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And worse than that, far worse than that,

46
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.

47
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER."

48
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

49
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,

50
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is how the hell did I let my personal happiness

51
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
get so tied up with this business thing?

52
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball,

53
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but I was, at that point, ready to move on.

54
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.

55
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,

56
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster --

57
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years.

58
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
This has been a big, big transition time,

59
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us

60
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.

61
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The theme next year is re-birth.

62
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It was at the same TED two years ago

63
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.

64
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,

65
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:

66
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I started to read again.

67
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,

68
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:

69
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology

70
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to ... all this stuff had changed.

71
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And the way in which you could think about us as a species

72
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.

73
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And what was really most exciting --

74
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did --

75
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
was that all this stuff is connected.

76
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's connected; it all hooks into each other.

77
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We talk about this a lot,

78
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:

79
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,

80
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?"

81
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And she answered, "A penis."

82
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And when you think about it, it's very true:

83
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
what we all most desire is a penis --

84
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or "happiness" as we say in English.

85
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

86
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.

87
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

88
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Applause)

89
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But something as basic as happiness,

90
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion

91
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in the church or mosque or synagogue,

92
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions

93
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that you can ask about it, which are really interesting.

94
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You can ask about what causes it biochemically:

95
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.

96
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You can ask what are the psychological causes of it:

97
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
nature? Nurture? Current circumstance?

98
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.

99
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:

100
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
do you need to incorporate

101
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?

102
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms

103
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet

104
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,

105
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and whereas almost all the rest of them,

106
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever --

107
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
are almost equally happy on average?

108
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:

109
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
did our genes invent this as a kind of trick

110
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,

111
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?

112
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Are we the victims of a mass delusion?

113
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And so on, and so on.

114
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
To understand even something as important to us as happiness,

115
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,

116
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED --

117
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.

118
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:

119
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;

120
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
a little bit about everything that surrounds it.

121
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And so, gradually over these three days,

122
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
you start off kind of trying to figure out,

123
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"

124
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And at the end of the four days,

125
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,

126
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and it's because all these different bits have been put together.

127
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...

128
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.

129
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

130
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Every mental organ addressed. It really is.

131
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Enough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?

132
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So, I will. Here's the vision for TED.

133
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.

134
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,

135
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"Chris, TED is a really great conference.

136
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."

137
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

138
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,

139
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and I will promise you right here and now

140
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.

141
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,

142
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
no bandwagoning, no platforms.

143
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,

144
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
across all the disciplines that are represented here.

145
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
That's not going to be changed at all.

146
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Number two: I am going to put together

147
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
an incredible line up of speakers for next year.

148
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic

149
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.

150
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
There's a year to do this, and already --

151
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I hope to show you a bit later --

152
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.

153
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I'm getting fantastic help from the community;

154
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts

155
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.

156
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's true.

157
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a way

158
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.

159
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.

160
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years,

161
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
and that's a gift that I would like to pass on.

162
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package

163
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.

164
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
They may well be by a TED speaker,

165
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and so we can get the conversation going during the year

166
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.

167
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I think it will be great.

168
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,

169
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which is the new owner of TED.

170
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED

171
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.

172
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here

173
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.

174
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Already, just in the last few days,

175
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,

176
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,

177
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and the idea of getting this group of people together --

178
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
some of the causes that we believe in,

179
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the money that this conference can raise and the ideas --

180
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.

181
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I'm incredibly excited about that.

182
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.

183
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I'm in this for the long run,

184
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and I would be greatly honored and excited

185
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
if you'll come on this journey with me.

1
0:00:25.738,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm going to give you four specific examples,

2
0:00:28.367,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm going to cover at the end

3
0:00:30.257,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about how a company called Silk tripled their sales;

4
0:00:32.932,000 --> 0:00:35,000
how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact;

6
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect.

7
0:00:42.5,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years --

8
0:00:46.119,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce."

9
0:00:50.126,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread,

10
0:00:53.078,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.

11
0:00:54.801,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s

12
0:00:58.084,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I wonder what they said?

13
0:01:00.055,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something.

14
0:01:03.175,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread,

15
0:01:06.467,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.

16
0:01:11.89,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this --

17
0:01:14.747,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available

18
0:01:18.836,000 --> 0:01:2,000
no one bought it; no one knew about it;

19
0:01:21.226,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it was a complete and total failure.

20
0:01:23.923,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And the reason is that until Wonder came along

21
0:01:28.5,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread,

22
0:01:32.266,000 --> 0:01:33,000
no one wanted it.

23
0:01:33.855,000 --> 0:01:34,000
That the success of sliced bread,

24
0:01:35.5,000 --> 0:01:38,000
like the success of almost everything we've talked about at this conference,

25
0:01:39.17,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is not always about what the patent is like, or what the factory is like --

26
0:01:45.834,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it's about can you get your idea to spread, or not.

27
0:01:49.234,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I think that the way you're going to get what you want,

28
0:01:52.512,000 --> 0:01:54,000
or cause the change that you want to change, to happen,

29
0:01:55.456,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.

30
0:01:57.948,000 --> 0:02:,000
And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop

31
0:02:01.22,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or you're an intellectual, or you're in business,

32
0:02:03.534,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or you're flying hot air balloons.

33
0:02:06.077,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do.

34
0:02:12.242,000 --> 0:02:16,000
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.

35
0:02:17.06,000 --> 0:02:21,000
That people who can spread ideas, regardless of what those ideas are, win.

36
0:02:21.723,000 --> 0:02:23,000
When I talk about it I usually pick business,

37
0:02:23.918,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation,

38
0:02:27.447,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.

39
0:02:30.137,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples

40
0:02:32.719,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.

41
0:02:36.344,000 --> 0:02:4,000
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV.

42
0:02:41.348,000 --> 0:02:47,000
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.

43
0:02:47.97,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I call it the "TV-industrial complex."

44
0:02:50.319,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads,

45
0:02:53.462,000 --> 0:02:55,000
interrupt some people, that gets you distribution.

46
0:02:56.535,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You use the distribution you get to sell more products.

47
0:03:00.303,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You take the profit from that to buy more ads.

48
0:03:03.938,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And it goes around and around and around,

49
0:03:05.938,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.

50
0:03:09.439,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That model of, and we heard it yesterday --

51
0:03:11.51,000 --> 0:03:13,000
if we could only get onto the homepage of Google,

52
0:03:13.827,000 --> 0:03:15,000
if we could only figure out how to get promoted there,

53
0:03:16.39,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or grab that person by the throat,

54
0:03:18.128,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and tell them about what we want to do.

55
0:03:20.917,000 --> 0:03:23,000
If we did that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.

56
0:03:24.869,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.

57
0:03:30.299,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out

58
0:03:35.092,000 --> 0:03:38,000
how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting,

59
0:03:38.18,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad,

60
0:03:40.544,000 --> 0:03:42,000
over and over again until they bought it.

61
0:03:42.797,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.

62
0:03:47.302,000 --> 0:03:49,000
That just over the last few years,

63
0:03:49.628,000 --> 0:03:51,000
what anybody who markets anything has discovered

64
0:03:52.476,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is that it's not working the way that it used to.

65
0:03:54.92,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.

66
0:03:58.533,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

67
0:04:00.112,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child.

68
0:04:03.631,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I go to the deli; I'm sick; I need to buy some medicine.

69
0:04:07.02,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars

70
0:04:10.381,000 --> 0:04:11,000
trying to interrupt me in one year.

71
0:04:12.088,000 --> 0:04:15,000
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials

72
0:04:15.378,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and magazine ads and Spam

73
0:04:17.27,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff --

74
0:04:20.094,000 --> 0:04:22,000
all so I could ignore every single message.

75
0:04:23.014,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I ignored every message

76
0:04:25.071,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because I don't have a pain reliever problem.

77
0:04:27.213,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have.

78
0:04:29.893,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem,

79
0:04:34.172,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because I don't care.

80
0:04:36.156,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Here's a magazine called "Hydrate." It's 180 pages about water.

81
0:04:41.743,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:42.768,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Articles about water, ads about water.

83
0:04:45.482,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago,

84
0:04:48.618,000 --> 0:04:5,000
with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek.

85
0:04:51.366,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now there are magazines about water.

86
0:04:53.154,000 --> 0:04:55,000
New product from Coke Japan: water salad.

87
0:04:56.336,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:57.385,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks,

89
0:05:02.043,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not.

90
0:05:05.583,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I couldn't have written this better myself.

91
0:05:07.692,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It came out four days ago --

92
0:05:09.234,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I circled the important parts so you can see them here.

93
0:05:13.106,000 --> 0:05:14,000
They've come out...

94
0:05:14.289,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Arby's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt

95
0:05:18.854,000 --> 0:05:2,000
with the voice of Tom Arnold,

96
0:05:21.203,000 --> 0:05:25,000
hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.

97
0:05:26.075,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:27.105,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial

99
0:05:32.653,000 --> 0:05:35,000
featuring Tom Arnold, that would get you to get in your car,

100
0:05:36.185,000 --> 0:05:39,000
drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich.

101
0:05:39.399,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:40.796,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right,

103
0:05:44.2,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea.

104
0:05:46.961,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"The world revolves around me."

105
0:05:48.637,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Me, me, me, me. My favorite person -- me.

106
0:05:51.652,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I don't want to get email from anybody; I want to get "memail."

107
0:05:54.962,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:56.5,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So consumers, and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway;

109
0:06:02.174,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something,

110
0:06:05.31,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or people at, you know, the New Yorker who might print your article.

111
0:06:08.556,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Consumers don't care about you at all; they just don't care.

112
0:06:13.375,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Part of the reason is -- they've got way more choices than they used to,

113
0:06:17.192,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and way less time.

114
0:06:19.34,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time,

115
0:06:23.333,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.

116
0:06:27.868,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And my parable here is you're driving down the road

117
0:06:31.447,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and you see a cow, and you keep driving because you've seen cows before.

118
0:06:35.32,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Cows are invisible. Cows are boring.

119
0:06:38.178,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Who's going to stop and pull over and say -- "Oh, look, a cow."

120
0:06:41.604,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Nobody.

121
0:06:42.779,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:44.5,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But if the cow was purple -- isn't that a great special effect?

123
0:06:48.168,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I could do that again if you want.

124
0:06:49.851,000 --> 0:06:53,000
If the cow was purple, you'd notice it for a while.

125
0:06:54.5,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.

126
0:06:57.873,000 --> 0:07:,000
The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about,

127
0:07:01.392,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what gets done, what gets changed,

128
0:07:03.119,000 --> 0:07:05,000
what gets purchased, what gets built,

129
0:07:05.577,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is: "Is it remarkable?"

130
0:07:08.502,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And "remarkable" is a really cool word,

131
0:07:10.863,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because we think it just means "neat,"

132
0:07:12.932,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but it also means "worth making a remark about."

133
0:07:16.776,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.

134
0:07:21.078,000 --> 0:07:23,000
That two of the hottest cars in the United States

135
0:07:24.097,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is a 55,000-dollar giant car,

136
0:07:27.278,000 --> 0:07:3,000
big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk.

137
0:07:30.413,000 --> 0:07:32,000
People are paying full price for both,

138
0:07:32.53,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and the only thing they have in common

139
0:07:35.343,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is that they don't have anything in common.

140
0:07:38.303,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:39.501,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Every week, the number one best-selling DVD in America changes.

142
0:07:45.202,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's never "The Godfather," it's never "Citizen Kane,"

143
0:07:48.051,000 --> 0:07:51,000
it's always some third-rate movie with some second-rate star.

144
0:07:51.915,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out.

145
0:07:56.5,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Because it's new, because it's fresh.

146
0:07:58.5,000 --> 0:08:,000
People saw it and said "I didn't know that was there"

147
0:08:01.004,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and they noticed it.

148
0:08:02.275,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail --

149
0:08:05.452,000 --> 0:08:07,000
one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box,

150
0:08:08.438,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them.

151
0:08:11.914,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The only thing they have in common is that they're different.

152
0:08:14.804,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We're now in the fashion business, no matter what we do for a living,

153
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we're in the fashion business.

154
0:08:19.714,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And people in the fashion business

155
0:08:21.5,000 --> 0:08:24,000
know what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it.

156
0:08:24.927,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.

157
0:08:27.578,000 --> 0:08:28,000
How to understand

158
0:08:28.824,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads,

159
0:08:32.131,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or insisting on meetings with people.

160
0:08:34.733,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But it's a totally different sort of process

161
0:08:37.573,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that determines which ideas spread, and which ones don't.

162
0:08:40.5,000 --> 0:08:43,000
They sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs

163
0:08:44.47,000 --> 0:08:47,000
by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair.

164
0:08:47.86,000 --> 0:08:5,000
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought,

165
0:08:51.105,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work.

166
0:08:55.692,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This guy, Lionel Poilâne, the most famous baker in the world --

167
0:08:58.945,000 --> 0:09:,000
he died two and a half months ago,

168
0:09:01.056,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.

169
0:09:03.128,000 --> 0:09:04,000
He lived in Paris.

170
0:09:04.342,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Last year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.

171
0:09:08.588,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned,

172
0:09:11.1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.

173
0:09:14.22,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.

174
0:09:18.022,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They didn't want to buy his bread.

175
0:09:19.706,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It didn't look like "French bread."

176
0:09:21.471,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It wasn't what they expected.

177
0:09:22.876,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It was neat; it was remarkable;

178
0:09:25.77,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and slowly, it spread from one person to another person

179
0:09:29.107,000 --> 0:09:33,000
until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.

180
0:09:33.397,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now he's in London, and he ships by FedEx all around the world.

181
0:09:36.967,000 --> 0:09:4,000
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people.

182
0:09:42.134,000 --> 0:09:43,000
That's what mass marketing is.

183
0:09:43.951,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Smooth out the edges; go for the center; that's the big market.

184
0:09:48.103,000 --> 0:09:52,000
They would ignore the geeks, and God forbid, the laggards.

185
0:09:52.5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It was all about going for the center.

186
0:09:54.999,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken,

187
0:09:58.191,000 --> 0:10:,000
I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.

188
0:10:00.835,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people

189
0:10:04.633,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because they're really good at ignoring you.

190
0:10:06.943,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But market to these people because they care.

191
0:10:10.5,000 --> 0:10:13,000
These are the people who are obsessed with something.

192
0:10:14.68,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And when you talk to them, they'll listen,

193
0:10:16.744,000 --> 0:10:18,000
because they like listening -- it's about them.

194
0:10:19.387,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And if you're lucky, they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve,

195
0:10:23.366,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and it'll spread.

196
0:10:24.577,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It'll spread to the entire curve.

197
0:10:26.38,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They have something I call "otaku" -- it's a great Japanese word.

198
0:10:30.043,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say,

199
0:10:33.065,000 --> 0:10:35,000
drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place,

200
0:10:35.922,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because that's what they do: they get obsessed with it.

201
0:10:38.88,000 --> 0:10:4,000
To make a product, to market an idea,

202
0:10:41.261,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to come up with any problem you want to solve

203
0:10:43.381,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku,

204
0:10:46.714,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is almost impossible.

205
0:10:48.301,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Instead, you have to find a group that really, desperately cares

206
0:10:51.967,000 --> 0:10:52,000
about what it is you have to say.

207
0:10:53.634,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.

208
0:10:56.741,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There's a hot sauce otaku, but there's no mustard otaku.

209
0:11:00.883,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That's why there's lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces,

210
0:11:03.582,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and not so many kinds of mustard.

211
0:11:05.193,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard --

212
0:11:07.7,000 --> 0:11:08,000
you could make interesting mustard --

213
0:11:09.515,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but people don't, because no one's obsessed with it,

214
0:11:12.014,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and thus no one tells their friends.

215
0:11:13.819,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out.

216
0:11:16.222,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It has a strategy, and what they do is,

217
0:11:18.126,000 --> 0:11:2,000
they enter a city, they talk to the people, with the otaku,

218
0:11:20.957,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and then they spread through the city

219
0:11:22.903,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to the people who've just crossed the street.

220
0:11:25.023,000 --> 0:11:29,000
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars, but it sleeps for 12 minutes.

221
0:11:29.481,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Not everybody wants it but they don't care.

222
0:11:31.542,000 --> 0:11:34,000
They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.

223
0:11:35.093,000 --> 0:11:38,000
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.

224
0:11:38.5,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Laughter)

225
0:11:40.5,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It's as loud as a 747 jet.

226
0:11:42.668,000 --> 0:11:44,000
You can't get in, the car's got bulletproof glass,

227
0:11:45.643,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise.

228
0:11:47.906,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But the fact remains

229
0:11:49.233,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car,

230
0:11:52.391,000 --> 0:11:55,000
if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does,

231
0:11:55.415,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they go ahead and they pick this.

232
0:11:57.096,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It's really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening,

233
0:12:00.111,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and just maybe, those people tell their friends.

234
0:12:02.457,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote,

235
0:12:05.738,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who are all tuned in from 130 countries

236
0:12:08.382,000 --> 0:12:1,000
watching his two-hour commercial --

237
0:12:10.5,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that's the only thing keeping his company in business --

238
0:12:13.144,000 --> 0:12:15,000
it's that those 50,000 people care desperately enough

239
0:12:15.817,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to watch a two-hour commercial, and then tell their friends.

240
0:12:18.651,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Pearl Jam, 96 albums released in the last two years.

241
0:12:21.356,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Every one made a profit. How?

242
0:12:23.737,000 --> 0:12:24,000
They only sell them on their website.

243
0:12:25.548,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Those people who buy them have the otaku,

244
0:12:27.674,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.

245
0:12:30.751,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.

246
0:12:35.082,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model.

247
0:12:37.78,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Hard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody,

248
0:12:40.5,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy.

249
0:12:44.003,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company,

250
0:12:49.67,000 --> 0:12:5,000
making them a fortune.

251
0:12:50.983,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It costs 35 percent more than regular paint

252
0:12:53.054,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.

253
0:12:57.119,000 --> 0:12:59,000
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product;

254
0:12:59.286,000 --> 0:13:01,000
they changed what it meant to build a paint product.

255
0:13:01.803,000 --> 0:13:05,000
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site,

256
0:13:06.5,000 --> 0:13:09,000
run by two volunteers, and I can tell you they are hard graders --

257
0:13:10.5,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter)

258
0:13:14.334,000 --> 0:13:17,000
They didn't get this way by advertising a lot.

259
0:13:17.406,000 --> 0:13:19,000
They got this way by being remarkable,

260
0:13:20.194,000 --> 0:13:21,000
sometimes a little too remarkable.

261
0:13:21.983,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back,

262
0:13:26.306,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and you plug it into the wall.

263
0:13:27.979,000 --> 0:13:28,000
My father has this on his desk,

264
0:13:29.852,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and he sees his grandchildren everyday, changing constantly.

265
0:13:34.312,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And every single person who walks into his office

266
0:13:36.883,000 --> 0:13:38,000
hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.

267
0:13:39.836,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And one person at a time, the idea spreads.

268
0:13:42.5,000 --> 0:13:44,000
These are not diamonds, not really.

269
0:13:45.732,000 --> 0:13:46,000
They're made from "cremains."

270
0:13:47.827,000 --> 0:13:49,000
After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem.

271
0:13:50.661,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

272
0:13:51.732,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.

273
0:13:54.042,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

274
0:13:59.755,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry.

275
0:14:03.244,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne --

276
0:14:05.293,000 --> 0:14:07,000
you don't have to be super-outrageous to do this.

277
0:14:07.603,000 --> 0:14:08,000
What you have to do

278
0:14:08.841,000 --> 0:14:1,000
is figure out what people really want and give it to them.

279
0:14:11.632,000 --> 0:14:12,000
A couple of quick rules to wrap up.

280
0:14:13.323,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The first one is: Design is free when you get to scale.

281
0:14:17.066,000 --> 0:14:19,000
The people who come up with stuff that's remarkable

282
0:14:19.478,000 --> 0:14:22,000
more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them.

283
0:14:22.692,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Number two: The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe.

284
0:14:27.572,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?

285
0:14:29.5,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble

286
0:14:31.572,000 --> 0:14:33,000
is always about average products for average people.

287
0:14:34.027,000 --> 0:14:35,000
That's risky.

288
0:14:35.521,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes,

289
0:14:38.399,000 --> 0:14:39,000
be remarkable.

290
0:14:40.11,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.

291
0:14:44.181,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Very good is boring. Very good is average.

292
0:14:47.007,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album,

293
0:14:49.61,000 --> 0:14:51,000
or you're an architect, or you have a tract on sociology.

294
0:14:52.331,000 --> 0:14:55,000
If it's very good, it's not going to work, because no one's going to notice it.

295
0:14:56.223,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So my three stories.

296
0:14:57.623,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section

297
0:15:02.139,000 --> 0:15:04,000
next to the milk in the refrigerated section.

298
0:15:04.48,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Sales tripled. Why?

299
0:15:06.29,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk.

300
0:15:09.662,000 --> 0:15:12,000
For the people who were there and looking at that section,

301
0:15:12.754,000 --> 0:15:13,000
it was remarkable.

302
0:15:13.984,000 --> 0:15:15,000
They didn't triple their sales with advertising;

303
0:15:16.247,000 --> 0:15:18,000
they tripled it by doing something remarkable.

304
0:15:18.453,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That is a remarkable piece of art.

305
0:15:20.237,000 --> 0:15:21,000
You don't have to like it,

306
0:15:21.531,000 --> 0:15:25,000
but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City

307
0:15:26.119,000 --> 0:15:27,000
is remarkable.

308
0:15:27.294,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

309
0:15:28.389,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum;

310
0:15:30.331,000 --> 0:15:32,000
he changed an entire city's economy

311
0:15:33.241,000 --> 0:15:37,000
by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see.

312
0:15:37.823,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Now, at countless meetings at, you know,

313
0:15:39.752,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the Portland City Council, or who knows where,

314
0:15:42.5,000 --> 0:15:45,000
they said, we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry?

315
0:15:45.785,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Because he did something that was at the fringes.

316
0:15:48.5,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And my big failure? I came out with an entire --

317
0:15:50.767,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Music)

318
0:15:53.5,000 --> 0:15:55,000
A record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums

319
0:15:56.291,000 --> 0:15:58,000
in SACD, this remarkable new format --

320
0:15:58.96,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos.

321
0:16:02.285,000 --> 0:16:07,000
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don't like new music.

322
0:16:07.405,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Laughter)

323
0:16:11.888,000 --> 0:16:15,000
So what you need to do is figure out who does care.

324
0:16:17.137,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Who is going to raise their hand and say,

325
0:16:19.152,000 --> 0:16:2,000
"I want to hear what you're doing next,"

326
0:16:21.105,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and sell something to them.

327
0:16:22.965,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The last example I want to give you.

328
0:16:24.704,000 --> 0:16:26,000
This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.

329
0:16:26.933,000 --> 0:16:29,000
As you can see, if that's nowhere, it's in the middle of it.

330
0:16:30.5,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Laughter)

331
0:16:36.043,000 --> 0:16:38,000
But they do have a lake.

332
0:16:38.452,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.

333
0:16:41.382,000 --> 0:16:42,000
They don't anymore.

334
0:16:42.571,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So the founding fathers said, "We've got some money to spend.

335
0:16:45.478,000 --> 0:16:46,000
What can we build here?"

336
0:16:46.953,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And like most committees,

337
0:16:48.471,000 --> 0:16:5,000
they were going to build something pretty safe.

338
0:16:50.687,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist's rendering --

339
0:16:54.045,000 --> 0:16:59,000
he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town.

340
0:16:59.646,000 --> 0:17:02,000
That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.

341
0:17:02.948,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I don't know about you,

342
0:17:04.131,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.

343
0:17:06.536,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Thank you very much for your attention.

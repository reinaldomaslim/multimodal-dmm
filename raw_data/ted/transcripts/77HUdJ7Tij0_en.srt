1
0:00:13.737,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So right now, nearly one billion people globally

2
0:00:17.038,000 --> 0:00:19,000
don't have access to electricity in their homes.

3
0:00:19.991,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And in sub-Saharan Africa,

4
0:00:21.537,000 --> 0:00:23,000
more than half of the population remain in the dark.

5
0:00:25.869,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So you probably all know this image from NASA.

6
0:00:28.784,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There's a name for this darkness.

7
0:00:30.438,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's called "energy poverty,"

8
0:00:31.962,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it has massive implications for economic development

9
0:00:35.375,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and social well-being.

10
0:00:36.764,000 --> 0:00:39,000
One unique aspect of the energy poverty problem in sub-Saharan Africa --

11
0:00:40.473,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and by the way, in this talk when I "energy," I mean "electricity" --

12
0:00:44.363,000 --> 0:00:45,000
one thing that's unique about it is

13
0:00:46.347,000 --> 0:00:48,000
there isn't much legacy infrastructure already in place

14
0:00:48.953,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in many countries of the region.

15
0:00:51.322,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So, for example, according to 2015 data,

16
0:00:54.422,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the total installed electricity capacity in sub-Saharan Africa

17
0:00:57.724,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is only about 100 gigawatts.

18
0:01:00.044,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's similar to that of the UK.

19
0:01:02.615,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So this actually presents a unique opportunity

20
0:01:05.399,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to build an energy system in the 21st century

21
0:01:08.653,000 --> 0:01:09,000
almost from scratch.

22
0:01:10.54,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The question is: How do you do that?

23
0:01:13.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We could look back to the past and replicate the ways

24
0:01:16.385,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in which we've managed to bring stable, affordable electricity

25
0:01:19.649,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to a big part of the world's population.

26
0:01:22.518,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But we all know that that has some well-known terrible side effects,

27
0:01:25.738,000 --> 0:01:27,000
such as pollution and climate change,

28
0:01:28.012,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in addition to being costly and inefficient.

29
0:01:30.629,000 --> 0:01:33,000
With Africa's population set to quadruple by the end of the century,

30
0:01:34.447,000 --> 0:01:36,000
this is not a theoretical question.

31
0:01:36.742,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Africa needs a lot of energy, and it needs it fast,

32
0:01:39.379,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because its population is booming and its economy needs to develop.

33
0:01:44.212,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So for most countries, the general trajectory of electrification

34
0:01:47.953,000 --> 0:01:48,000
has been as follows.

35
0:01:49.375,000 --> 0:01:52,000
First, large-scale grid infrastructure is put in place,

36
0:01:52.493,000 --> 0:01:54,000
usually with significant public investment.

37
0:01:54.938,000 --> 0:01:56,000
That infrastructure then powers productive centers,

38
0:01:57.542,000 --> 0:01:59,000
such as factories, agricultural mechanization,

39
0:02:00.548,000 --> 0:02:02,000
commercial enterprises and the like.

40
0:02:03.184,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And this then stimulates economic growth,

41
0:02:05.733,000 --> 0:02:07,000
creating jobs, raising incomes

42
0:02:08.024,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and producing a virtuous cycle

43
0:02:09.542,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that helps more people afford more appliances,

44
0:02:12.241,000 --> 0:02:15,000
which then creates residential demand for electricity.

45
0:02:15.946,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But in sub-Saharan Africa, despite decades of energy projects,

46
0:02:19.439,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we haven't really seen these benefits.

47
0:02:22.657,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The energy projects have often been characterized by waste,

48
0:02:25.486,000 --> 0:02:27,000
corruption and inefficiency;

49
0:02:27.608,000 --> 0:02:29,000
our rural electrification rates are really low,

50
0:02:30.436,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and our urban rates could be better;

51
0:02:32.808,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the reliability of our electricity is terrible;

52
0:02:36.064,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we have some of the highest electricity prices in the whole world.

53
0:02:39.553,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And on top of all of this,

54
0:02:41.257,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we are now facing the impacts of the growing climate catastrophe head-on.

55
0:02:46.145,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So Africa will need to find a different path.

56
0:02:49.588,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And, as it turns out, we are now witnessing

57
0:02:51.711,000 --> 0:02:54,000
some pretty exciting disruption in the African energy space.

58
0:02:55.547,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This new path is called off-grid solar,

59
0:02:58.043,000 --> 0:03:,000
and it's enabled by cheap solar panels,

60
0:03:00.288,000 --> 0:03:02,000
advances in LED and battery technology,

61
0:03:02.733,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and combined with innovative business models.

62
0:03:05.059,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So these off-grid solar products typically range from a single light

63
0:03:09.051,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to home system kits that can charge phones,

64
0:03:12.157,000 --> 0:03:13,000
power a television

65
0:03:14.054,000 --> 0:03:15,000
or run a fan.

66
0:03:15.561,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I want to be clear:

67
0:03:16.994,000 --> 0:03:18,000
off-grid solar is a big deal in Africa.

68
0:03:19.659,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I have worked in the sector for years,

69
0:03:21.568,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and these products are enabling us to extend basic energy services

70
0:03:25.002,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to some of the world's poorest,

71
0:03:26.762,000 --> 0:03:27,000
raising their quality of life.

72
0:03:28.675,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is a very good and a very important thing.

73
0:03:31.942,000 --> 0:03:35,000
However, off-grid solar will not solve energy poverty in Africa,

74
0:03:36.602,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and for that matter,

75
0:03:37.821,000 --> 0:03:4,000
neither will a top-down effort to connect every unserved household

76
0:03:40.984,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to the grid.

77
0:03:42.258,000 --> 0:03:46,000
See, I'm not here to rehash that played-out "on-versus-off-grid"

78
0:03:46.937,000 --> 0:03:47,000
or "old-versus-new" debate.

79
0:03:48.629,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Instead,

80
0:03:49.808,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I believe that our inability to grapple with and truly address

81
0:03:53.183,000 --> 0:03:54,000
energy poverty in Africa

82
0:03:54.417,000 --> 0:03:55,000
stems from three main sources.

83
0:03:56.616,000 --> 0:03:58,000
First, we don't really have a clear understanding

84
0:03:59.59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
of what energy poverty is, or how deep it goes.

85
0:04:03.023,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Second, we are avoiding complex systemic issues

86
0:04:05.907,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and prefer quick fixes.

87
0:04:07.707,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And third, we are misdirecting concerns about climate change.

88
0:04:11.694,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Combined, these three mistakes are leading us to impose a Western debate

89
0:04:15.506,000 --> 0:04:16,000
on the future of energy

90
0:04:16.801,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and falling back on paternalistic attitudes towards Africa.

91
0:04:20.378,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So let me try and unpack these three questions.

92
0:04:22.662,000 --> 0:04:24,000
First, what exactly is energy poverty?

93
0:04:25.005,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The main energy poverty targeted indicator

94
0:04:27.547,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is enshrined in the UN's Seventh Sustainable Development Goal,

95
0:04:30.512,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or SDG 7.

96
0:04:31.766,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It calls for 100 percent of the world's population

97
0:04:34.451,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to have access to electricity by the year 2030.

98
0:04:37.457,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This binary threshold, however,

99
0:04:39.146,000 --> 0:04:43,000
ignores the quality, reliability or utility of the power,

100
0:04:43.479,000 --> 0:04:45,000
though indicators are currently being developed

101
0:04:45.744,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that will try and capture these things.

102
0:04:47.962,000 --> 0:04:5,000
However, the question of when a household is considered "connected"

103
0:04:51.211,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is not quite clear-cut.

104
0:04:53.032,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, for example, last year the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi

105
0:04:56.787,000 --> 0:04:58,000
declared all of the villages in India electrified,

106
0:04:59.526,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the criteria for electrification being

107
0:05:01.56,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a transformer in every village plus its public centers

108
0:05:04.655,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and 10 percent -- 10 percent -- of its households connected.

109
0:05:09.452,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Meanwhile,

110
0:05:10.647,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the International Energy Agency, which tracks progress against SDG 7,

111
0:05:15.207,000 --> 0:05:19,000
defines energy access as 50 kilowatt hours per person per year.

112
0:05:20.597,000 --> 0:05:23,000
That's enough to power some light bulbs and charge a phone,

113
0:05:24.346,000 --> 0:05:28,000
perhaps run a low-watt TV or fan for a few hours a day.

114
0:05:28.846,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, providing entry-level access is an important first step,

115
0:05:33.077,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but let's not romanticize the situation.

116
0:05:35.838,000 --> 0:05:38,000
By any standard, a few lights and not much else

117
0:05:39.106,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is still living in energy poverty.

118
0:05:41.979,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And what's more,

119
0:05:43.462,000 --> 0:05:45,000
these energy poverty indicators and targets

120
0:05:46.308,000 --> 0:05:48,000
cover only residential use.

121
0:05:48.506,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And yet, households account for just about one quarter

122
0:05:51.799,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of the world's electricity consumption.

123
0:05:53.71,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That's because most of our power is used in industries and for commerce.

124
0:05:57.793,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Which brings me to my main point:

125
0:06:00.064,000 --> 0:06:03,000
countries cannot grow out of poverty without access to abundant,

126
0:06:03.931,000 --> 0:06:07,000
affordable and reliable electricity to power these productive centers,

127
0:06:08.187,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or what I call "Energy for Growth."

128
0:06:10.536,000 --> 0:06:11,000
As you can see from this graph,

129
0:06:12.18,000 --> 0:06:15,000
there's simply no such thing as a low-energy, high-income country.

130
0:06:15.764,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It doesn't exist.

131
0:06:17.165,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And yet, three billion people in the world

132
0:06:19.7,000 --> 0:06:22,000
currently live in countries without reliable, affordable electricity --

133
0:06:23.399,000 --> 0:06:26,000
not just to power their homes but also their factories,

134
0:06:26.715,000 --> 0:06:28,000
their office buildings, their data centers

135
0:06:29.081,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and other economic activities.

136
0:06:31.529,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Merely electrifying households and microenterprises

137
0:06:34.549,000 --> 0:06:36,000
cannot solve this deeper energy poverty.

138
0:06:37.169,000 --> 0:06:38,000
To solve energy poverty,

139
0:06:38.718,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we need to deliver reliable, affordable electricity at scale,

140
0:06:43.305,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to power economy-wide job creation and income growth.

141
0:06:47.279,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This need, however, bumps against an emerging narrative that,

142
0:06:51.525,000 --> 0:06:52,000
faced with climate change,

143
0:06:52.894,000 --> 0:06:55,000
we all need to transition from large, centralized power systems

144
0:06:56.565,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to small-scale distributed power.

145
0:06:59.722,000 --> 0:07:,000
The growth of off-grid solar in Africa --

146
0:07:01.723,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and let me repeat, off-grid solar is a good thing --

147
0:07:04.288,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but that growth fits nicely into this narrative

148
0:07:07.34,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and has led to those claims that Africa is leapfrogging the old ways of energy

149
0:07:11.465,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and building its power system from the ground up,

150
0:07:14.215,000 --> 0:07:15,000
one solar panel at a time.

151
0:07:16.942,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's a nice, solicitous narrative, but also quite naïve.

152
0:07:21.66,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Like many narratives of technological disruption,

153
0:07:24.654,000 --> 0:07:25,000
often inspired by Silicon Valley,

154
0:07:26.676,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it takes for granted the existing systems that underpin all of this transformation.

155
0:07:32.067,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You see, when it comes to innovating and energy,

156
0:07:35.409,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the West is working around the edges of a system that is tried and tested.

157
0:07:39.824,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And so all the sexy stuff --

158
0:07:41.815,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the rooftop solar,

159
0:07:43.331,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the smart household devices, the electric vehicles --

160
0:07:46.816,000 --> 0:07:5,000
all of this is built on top of a massive and absolutely essential grid,

161
0:07:50.965,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which itself exists within a proven governance framework.

162
0:07:55.608,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Even the most advanced countries in the world

163
0:07:57.837,000 --> 0:08:01,000
don't have an example of an energy system that is all edges and no center at scale.

164
0:08:03.163,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So ultimately, no approach --

165
0:08:05.825,000 --> 0:08:08,000
be it centralized or distributed, renewable or fossil-based --

166
0:08:09.611,000 --> 0:08:11,000
can succeed in solving energy poverty

167
0:08:12.226,000 --> 0:08:16,000
without finding a way to deliver reliable, affordable electricity

168
0:08:16.404,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to Africa's emerging industrial and commercial sectors.

169
0:08:20.312,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, it's not just lights in every rural home.

170
0:08:23.908,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's power for Africa's cities that are growing fast

171
0:08:27.278,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and increasingly full of young, capable people

172
0:08:29.932,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in desperate need of a job.

173
0:08:32.303,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This in turn will require significant interconnectivity

174
0:08:36.083,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and economies of scale,

175
0:08:37.63,000 --> 0:08:38,000
making a robust and modern grid

176
0:08:39.595,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a crucial piece of any energy poverty solution.

177
0:08:43.821,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So, our second mistake is falling for the allure of the quick fix.

178
0:08:48.417,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You see, energy poverty exists

179
0:08:50.324,000 --> 0:08:53,000
within a complex socioeconomic and political context.

180
0:08:54.121,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And part of the appeal of new electrification models

181
0:08:57.221,000 --> 0:08:58,000
such as off-grid solar, for example,

182
0:08:59.017,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is they can often bypass the glacial pace and inefficiency of government.

183
0:09:03.625,000 --> 0:09:07,000
See, with small systems you can skip the bureaucracies and the utilities

184
0:09:08.145,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and sell directly to customers.

185
0:09:10.914,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But to confront energy poverty,

186
0:09:13.706,000 --> 0:09:16,000
you cannot ignore governments, you cannot ignore institutions,

187
0:09:16.904,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you cannot ignore the many players involved in making, moving

188
0:09:20.636,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and using electricity at scale,

189
0:09:23.251,000 --> 0:09:26,000
which is a way to say that when it comes to providing energy for growth,

190
0:09:26.914,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it's not just about innovating the technology,

191
0:09:29.516,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it's about the slow and hard work of improving governance, institutions

192
0:09:34.071,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and the broader macroenvironment.

193
0:09:37.022,000 --> 0:09:4,000
OK, so this is all good and nice, you say.

194
0:09:40.743,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But what about climate change?

195
0:09:42.968,000 --> 0:09:45,000
How do we ensure a high-energy future for everyone

196
0:09:46.396,000 --> 0:09:47,000
while also curbing our emissions?

197
0:09:49.411,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Well, we'll have to make some complex tradeoffs,

198
0:09:52.583,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but I believe that a high-energy future for Africa

199
0:09:54.981,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is not mutually exclusive to a low-carbon future.

200
0:09:58.239,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And make no mistake:

201
0:09:59.671,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the world cannot expect Africa to remain in energy poverty

202
0:10:02.635,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because of climate change.

203
0:10:04.173,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Applause)

204
0:10:11.949,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Actually, the facts show that the opposite is true.

205
0:10:15.269,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Energy will be essential for Africa to adapt to climate change

206
0:10:18.487,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and build resilience.

207
0:10:19.992,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You see, rising temperatures will mean increased demand for space cooling

208
0:10:24.02,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and cold storage.

209
0:10:25.217,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Declining water tables will mean increased pumped irrigation.

210
0:10:28.917,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And extreme weather and rising sea levels will require a significant expansion

211
0:10:32.803,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and reinforcement of our infrastructure.

212
0:10:35.058,000 --> 0:10:37,000
These are all energy-intensive activities.

213
0:10:38.535,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So balancing climate change and Africa's pressing need

214
0:10:42.065,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to transition to a high-energy future

215
0:10:44.13,000 --> 0:10:45,000
will be tough.

216
0:10:45.385,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But doing so is nonnegotiable; we will have to find a way.

217
0:10:49.79,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The first step is broadening the terms of the debate

218
0:10:52.389,000 --> 0:10:54,000
away from this either-or framing.

219
0:10:55.102,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And we also must stop romanticizing solutions

220
0:10:57.709,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that distract us from the core challenges.

221
0:11:01.572,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And let's not also forget that Africa is endowed with vast natural resources,

222
0:11:05.944,000 --> 0:11:07,000
including significant renewable potential.

223
0:11:08.979,000 --> 0:11:1,000
For example, in Kenya, where I'm from,

224
0:11:11.744,000 --> 0:11:14,000
geothermal power accounts for half of our electricity generation,

225
0:11:15.532,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and with hydro being the other major source,

226
0:11:17.625,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we are already mainly powered by renewable energy.

227
0:11:20.1,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We also just brought online Africa's largest wind farm

228
0:11:23.408,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and East Africa's biggest solar facility.

229
0:11:26.346,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

230
0:11:30.906,000 --> 0:11:31,000
In addition,

231
0:11:32.319,000 --> 0:11:35,000
new technology means that we can now run and design our power systems

232
0:11:36.132,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and use energy more efficiently than ever,

233
0:11:38.614,000 --> 0:11:39,000
doing more with less.

234
0:11:40.322,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Energy efficiency will be an important tool

235
0:11:42.503,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in the fight against climate change.

236
0:11:45.998,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So in closing, I'd just like to say that Africa is a real place with real people,

237
0:11:51.295,000 --> 0:11:54,000
navigating complex challenges and major transitions,

238
0:11:54.526,000 --> 0:11:56,000
just like any other region of the world.

239
0:11:56.846,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Applause)

240
0:12:02.39,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And while each country and each region

241
0:12:05.079,000 --> 0:12:07,000
has its social, economic and political quirks,

242
0:12:08.011,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the physics of electricity are the same everywhere.

243
0:12:10.601,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

244
0:12:14.378,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And the energy needs of our economies

245
0:12:17.424,000 --> 0:12:2,000
are just as intensive as those of any other economy.

246
0:12:21.535,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So, the expansion of household electrification

247
0:12:24.384,000 --> 0:12:26,000
through a mix of on- and off-grid solutions

248
0:12:26.566,000 --> 0:12:28,000
has had an incredible impact in Africa.

249
0:12:28.932,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But they are nowhere near sufficient for solving energy poverty.

250
0:12:32.628,000 --> 0:12:33,000
To solve energy poverty,

251
0:12:34.35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we need generation of electricity from diverse sources at scale

252
0:12:38.504,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and modern grids to power a high-energy future,

253
0:12:40.995,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in which Africans can enjoy modern living standards

254
0:12:43.771,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and well-paying jobs.

255
0:12:45.744,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Africans deserve this,

256
0:12:47.556,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and with one of every four people in the world projected to be African

257
0:12:51.667,000 --> 0:12:52,000
by the year 2100,

258
0:12:53.337,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the planet needs it.

259
0:12:54.612,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Thank you.

260
0:12:55.802,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

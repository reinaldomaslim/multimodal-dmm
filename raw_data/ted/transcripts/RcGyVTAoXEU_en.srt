1
0:00:12.841,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have a confession to make.

2
0:00:16.968,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But first, I want you to make a little confession to me.

3
0:00:23.779,000 --> 0:00:25,000
In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand

4
0:00:26.557,000 --> 0:00:29,000
if you've experienced relatively little stress.

5
0:00:29.971,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Anyone?

6
0:00:32.604,000 --> 0:00:34,000
How about a moderate amount of stress?

7
0:00:35.84,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Who has experienced a lot of stress?

8
0:00:38.441,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Yeah. Me too.

9
0:00:40.849,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But that is not my confession.

10
0:00:42.997,000 --> 0:00:43,000
My confession is this:

11
0:00:44.782,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I am a health psychologist,

12
0:00:46.803,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.

13
0:00:51.699,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But I fear that something I've been teaching

14
0:00:54.926,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good,

15
0:00:59.254,000 --> 0:01:,000
and it has to do with stress.

16
0:01:01.826,000 --> 0:01:04,000
For years I've been telling people, stress makes you sick.

17
0:01:04.853,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It increases the risk of everything from the common cold

18
0:01:07.748,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to cardiovascular disease.

19
0:01:10.134,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy.

20
0:01:14.383,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But I have changed my mind about stress,

21
0:01:17.095,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and today, I want to change yours.

22
0:01:21.01,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Let me start with the study that made me rethink

23
0:01:23.39,000 --> 0:01:24,000
my whole approach to stress.

24
0:01:26.004,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years,

25
0:01:30.663,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and they started by asking people,

26
0:01:33.19,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"

27
0:01:37.088,000 --> 0:01:38,000
They also asked,

28
0:01:38.652,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?"

29
0:01:44.43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And then they used public death records to find out who died.

30
0:01:48.01,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:49.215,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Okay.

32
0:01:51.037,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Some bad news first.

33
0:01:53.211,000 --> 0:01:56,000
People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year

34
0:01:56.636,000 --> 0:01:58,000
had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.

35
0:02:00.612,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But that was only true for the people

36
0:02:04.395,000 --> 0:02:07,000
who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.

37
0:02:08.056,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:10.84,000 --> 0:02:12,000
People who experienced a lot of stress

39
0:02:13.14,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but did not view stress as harmful

40
0:02:15.104,000 --> 0:02:16,000
were no more likely to die.

41
0:02:16.805,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying

42
0:02:20.372,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of anyone in the study,

43
0:02:21.696,000 --> 0:02:23,000
including people who had relatively little stress.

44
0:02:24.896,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years

45
0:02:27.54,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they were tracking deaths,

46
0:02:29.134,000 --> 0:02:32,000
182,000 Americans died prematurely,

47
0:02:32.334,000 --> 0:02:33,000
not from stress,

48
0:02:33.796,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but from the belief that stress is bad for you.

49
0:02:37.001,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:38.257,000 --> 0:02:41,000
That is over 20,000 deaths a year.

51
0:02:41.931,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, if that estimate is correct,

52
0:02:44.759,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that would make believing stress is bad for you

53
0:02:47.022,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year,

54
0:02:51.117,000 --> 0:02:54,000
killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS and homicide.

55
0:02:57.172,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:59.311,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You can see why this study freaked me out.

57
0:03:02.136,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Here I've been spending so much energy telling people

58
0:03:06.209,000 --> 0:03:07,000
stress is bad for your health.

59
0:03:09.09,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So this study got me wondering:

60
0:03:10.786,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier?

61
0:03:14.882,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And here the science says yes.

62
0:03:16.726,000 --> 0:03:18,000
When you change your mind about stress,

63
0:03:18.808,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you can change your body's response to stress.

64
0:03:22.084,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now to explain how this works,

65
0:03:24.441,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I want you all to pretend that you are participants

66
0:03:27.322,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in a study designed to stress you out.

67
0:03:29.929,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's called the social stress test.

68
0:03:32.613,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You come into the laboratory,

69
0:03:34.667,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and you're told you have to give

70
0:03:36.662,000 --> 0:03:4,000
a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses

71
0:03:41.301,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you,

72
0:03:44.958,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and to make sure you feel the pressure,

73
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
there are bright lights and a camera in your face,

74
0:03:49.811,000 --> 0:03:5,000
kind of like this.

75
0:03:51.294,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:52.476,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And the evaluators have been trained

77
0:03:55.38,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to give you discouraging, non-verbal feedback,

78
0:03:59.096,000 --> 0:04:,000
like this.

79
0:04:05.334,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Exhales)

80
0:04:06.359,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:09.264,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now that you're sufficiently demoralized,

82
0:04:11.356,000 --> 0:04:13,000
time for part two: a math test.

83
0:04:14.156,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And unbeknownst to you,

84
0:04:16.257,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.

85
0:04:20.285,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now we're going to all do this together.

86
0:04:22.659,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's going to be fun.

87
0:04:24.404,000 --> 0:04:25,000
For me.

88
0:04:25.451,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Okay.

89
0:04:26.492,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:27.723,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I want you all to count backwards from 996

91
0:04:31.746,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in increments of seven.

92
0:04:33.138,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You're going to do this out loud,

93
0:04:34.766,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as fast as you can,

94
0:04:36.774,000 --> 0:04:38,000
starting with 996.

95
0:04:38.89,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Go!

96
0:04:39.952,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Audience counting)

97
0:04:41.333,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Go faster. Faster please.

98
0:04:44.146,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You're going too slow.

99
0:04:45.536,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Audience counting)

100
0:04:46.598,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

101
0:04:48.114,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That guy made a mistake.

102
0:04:49.544,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We are going to have to start all over again.

103
0:04:51.766,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:52.791,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You're not very good at this, are you?

105
0:04:55.027,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Okay, so you get the idea.

106
0:04:56.501,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If you were actually in this study,

107
0:04:58.34,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you'd probably be a little stressed out.

108
0:05:00.286,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Your heart might be pounding,

109
0:05:01.825,000 --> 0:05:04,000
you might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.

110
0:05:05.229,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And normally, we interpret these physical changes as anxiety

111
0:05:09.825,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.

112
0:05:13.142,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But what if you viewed them instead

113
0:05:15.015,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as signs that your body was energized,

114
0:05:17.362,000 --> 0:05:19,000
was preparing you to meet this challenge?

115
0:05:21.064,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now that is exactly what participants were told

116
0:05:23.65,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in a study conducted at Harvard University.

117
0:05:26.596,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Before they went through the social stress test,

118
0:05:29.417,000 --> 0:05:32,000
they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.

119
0:05:32.623,000 --> 0:05:35,000
That pounding heart is preparing you for action.

120
0:05:36.408,000 --> 0:05:38,000
If you're breathing faster, it's no problem.

121
0:05:38.761,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's getting more oxygen to your brain.

122
0:05:41.846,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And participants who learned to view the stress response

123
0:05:44.543,000 --> 0:05:46,000
as helpful for their performance,

124
0:05:46.78,000 --> 0:05:49,000
well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident,

125
0:05:50.287,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but the most fascinating finding to me

126
0:05:52.38,000 --> 0:05:54,000
was how their physical stress response changed.

127
0:05:55.906,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now, in a typical stress response,

128
0:05:57.655,000 --> 0:05:58,000
your heart rate goes up,

129
0:05:59.471,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and your blood vessels constrict like this.

130
0:06:04.343,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress

131
0:06:06.95,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.

132
0:06:09.809,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.

133
0:06:13.518,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But in the study,

134
0:06:14.63,000 --> 0:06:17,000
when participants viewed their stress response as helpful,

135
0:06:17.661,000 --> 0:06:19,000
their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this.

136
0:06:21.176,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Their heart was still pounding,

137
0:06:22.977,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.

138
0:06:25.728,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It actually looks a lot like what happens

139
0:06:28.383,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in moments of joy and courage.

140
0:06:33.391,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Over a lifetime of stressful experiences,

141
0:06:35.935,000 --> 0:06:38,000
this one biological change

142
0:06:39.125,000 --> 0:06:4,000
could be the difference

143
0:06:40.429,000 --> 0:06:42,000
between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50

144
0:06:43.433,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and living well into your 90s.

145
0:06:46.356,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And this is really what the new science of stress reveals,

146
0:06:49.441,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that how you think about stress matters.

147
0:06:53.197,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So my goal as a health psychologist has changed.

148
0:06:56.11,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I no longer want to get rid of your stress.

149
0:06:58.272,000 --> 0:07:,000
I want to make you better at stress.

150
0:07:01.23,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And we just did a little intervention.

151
0:07:03.935,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If you raised your hand and said

152
0:07:05.483,000 --> 0:07:07,000
you'd had a lot of stress in the last year,

153
0:07:07.552,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we could have saved your life,

154
0:07:09.395,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress,

155
0:07:12.946,000 --> 0:07:13,000
you're going to remember this talk

156
0:07:14.793,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and you're going to think to yourself,

157
0:07:16.955,000 --> 0:07:2,000
this is my body helping me rise to this challenge.

158
0:07:22.129,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And when you view stress in that way,

159
0:07:24.468,000 --> 0:07:26,000
your body believes you,

160
0:07:26.525,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and your stress response becomes healthier.

161
0:07:30.204,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress

162
0:07:34.38,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to redeem myself from,

163
0:07:36.354,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so we are going to do one more intervention.

164
0:07:38.964,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I want to tell you

165
0:07:40.092,000 --> 0:07:43,000
about one of the most under-appreciated aspects of the stress response,

166
0:07:43.987,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the idea is this:

167
0:07:45.846,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Stress makes you social.

168
0:07:49.266,000 --> 0:07:5,000
To understand this side of stress,

169
0:07:51.05,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,

170
0:07:53.917,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get.

171
0:07:58.865,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone,

172
0:08:02.204,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because it's released when you hug someone.

173
0:08:04.89,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.

174
0:08:09.572,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.

175
0:08:11.87,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.

176
0:08:15.978,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It primes you to do things

177
0:08:17.975,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that strengthen close relationships.

178
0:08:21.486,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family.

179
0:08:26.334,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It enhances your empathy.

180
0:08:27.92,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It even makes you more willing to help and support

181
0:08:30.628,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the people you care about.

182
0:08:33.672,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin...

183
0:08:39.179,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to become more compassionate and caring.

184
0:08:43.34,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.

185
0:08:48.164,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It's a stress hormone.

186
0:08:51.13,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out

187
0:08:54.248,000 --> 0:08:55,000
as part of the stress response.

188
0:08:55.796,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's as much a part of your stress response

189
0:08:58.047,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.

190
0:09:02.271,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And when oxytocin is released in the stress response,

191
0:09:04.969,000 --> 0:09:06,000
it is motivating you to seek support.

192
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Your biological stress response

193
0:09:10.383,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is nudging you to tell someone how you feel,

194
0:09:13.926,000 --> 0:09:14,000
instead of bottling it up.

195
0:09:16.306,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Your stress response wants to make sure you notice

196
0:09:19.41,000 --> 0:09:21,000
when someone else in your life is struggling

197
0:09:21.729,000 --> 0:09:22,000
so that you can support each other.

198
0:09:24.299,000 --> 0:09:25,000
When life is difficult,

199
0:09:25.983,000 --> 0:09:29,000
your stress response wants you to be surrounded

200
0:09:30.594,000 --> 0:09:31,000
by people who care about you.

201
0:09:33.158,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?

202
0:09:37.686,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.

203
0:09:40.271,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It also acts on your body,

204
0:09:42.662,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and one of its main roles in your body

205
0:09:44.861,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.

206
0:09:49.956,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's a natural anti-inflammatory.

207
0:09:52.524,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.

208
0:09:55.969,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.

209
0:09:59.366,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Your heart has receptors for this hormone,

210
0:10:03.328,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate

211
0:10:06.806,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and heal from any stress-induced damage.

212
0:10:10.774,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This stress hormone strengthens your heart.

213
0:10:15.591,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits

214
0:10:18.857,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support.

215
0:10:23.907,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So when you reach out to others under stress,

216
0:10:26.826,000 --> 0:10:29,000
either to seek support or to help someone else,

217
0:10:30.099,000 --> 0:10:31,000
you release more of this hormone,

218
0:10:32.107,000 --> 0:10:34,000
your stress response becomes healthier,

219
0:10:34.369,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and you actually recover faster from stress.

220
0:10:37.658,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I find this amazing,

221
0:10:39.801,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that your stress response has a built-in mechanism

222
0:10:43.729,000 --> 0:10:45,000
for stress resilience,

223
0:10:46.634,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and that mechanism is human connection.

224
0:10:51.174,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I want to finish by telling you about one more study.

225
0:10:54.398,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And listen up, because this study could also save a life.

226
0:10:58.651,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This study tracked about 1,000 adults in the United States,

227
0:11:01.93,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,

228
0:11:06.093,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and they started the study by asking,

229
0:11:08.362,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"

230
0:11:12.779,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They also asked,

231
0:11:14.304,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"How much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors,

232
0:11:18.963,000 --> 0:11:19,000
people in your community?"

233
0:11:22.133,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And then they used public records for the next five years

234
0:11:24.908,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to find out who died.

235
0:11:27.531,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Okay, so the bad news first:

236
0:11:30.212,000 --> 0:11:32,000
For every major stressful life experience,

237
0:11:33.171,000 --> 0:11:36,000
like financial difficulties or family crisis,

238
0:11:36.22,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent.

239
0:11:40.451,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But -- and I hope you are expecting a "but" by now --

240
0:11:44.445,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but that wasn't true for everyone.

241
0:11:46.876,000 --> 0:11:49,000
People who spent time caring for others

242
0:11:50.538,000 --> 0:11:54,000
showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying.

243
0:11:55.065,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Zero.

244
0:11:56.738,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Caring created resilience.

245
0:12:00.233,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And so we see once again

246
0:12:01.716,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that the harmful effects of stress on your health

247
0:12:04.354,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are not inevitable.

248
0:12:06.578,000 --> 0:12:08,000
How you think and how you act

249
0:12:09.038,000 --> 0:12:12,000
can transform your experience of stress.

250
0:12:12.998,000 --> 0:12:16,000
When you choose to view your stress response as helpful,

251
0:12:17.936,000 --> 0:12:2,000
you create the biology of courage.

252
0:12:22.547,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And when you choose to connect with others under stress,

253
0:12:25.988,000 --> 0:12:27,000
you can create resilience.

254
0:12:29.606,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life,

255
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress.

256
0:12:41.237,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Stress gives us access to our hearts.

257
0:12:45.897,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning

258
0:12:49.58,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in connecting with others,

259
0:12:51.118,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and yes, your pounding physical heart,

260
0:12:54.68,000 --> 0:12:57,000
working so hard to give you strength and energy.

261
0:12:59.945,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And when you choose to view stress in this way,

262
0:13:03.288,000 --> 0:13:05,000
you're not just getting better at stress,

263
0:13:05.8,000 --> 0:13:07,000
you're actually making a pretty profound statement.

264
0:13:09.627,000 --> 0:13:14,000
You're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges.

265
0:13:15.928,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone.

266
0:13:21.659,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Thank you.

267
0:13:22.733,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Applause)

268
0:13:32.014,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Chris Anderson: This is kind of amazing, what you're telling us.

269
0:13:35.086,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress

270
0:13:39.017,000 --> 0:13:42,000
can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.

271
0:13:43.5,000 --> 0:13:45,000
How would that extend to advice,

272
0:13:45.726,000 --> 0:13:47,000
like, if someone is making a lifestyle choice

273
0:13:47.893,000 --> 0:13:5,000
between, say, a stressful job and a non-stressful job,

274
0:13:51.772,000 --> 0:13:53,000
does it matter which way they go?

275
0:13:54.453,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It's equally wise to go for the stressful job

276
0:13:56.982,000 --> 0:13:58,000
so long as you believe that you can handle it, in some sense?

277
0:13:59.919,000 --> 0:14:01,000
KM: Yeah, and one thing we know for certain

278
0:14:02.203,000 --> 0:14:04,000
is that chasing meaning is better for your health

279
0:14:04.611,000 --> 0:14:05,000
than trying to avoid discomfort.

280
0:14:06.215,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions,

281
0:14:09.287,000 --> 0:14:11,000
is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life

282
0:14:12.034,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.

283
0:14:15.758,000 --> 0:14:17,000
CA: Thank you so much, Kelly. It's pretty cool.

284
0:14:18.154,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.235,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The Kraken, a beast so terrifying

3
0:00:19.271,000 --> 0:00:22,000
it was said to devour men and ships and whales,

4
0:00:22.368,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.

5
0:00:26.295,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In assessing the merits of such tales,

6
0:00:28.551,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw

7
0:00:31.436,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story

8
0:00:35.059,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time,"

9
0:00:37.696,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit." (Laughter)

10
0:00:42.929,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Every fish that gets away

11
0:00:44.707,000 --> 0:00:46,000
grows with every telling of the tale.

12
0:00:46.855,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,

13
0:00:49.342,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we now have video proof,

14
0:00:51.371,000 --> 0:00:55,000
as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.

15
0:00:55.993,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition

16
0:00:58.63,000 --> 0:01:,000
that took place last summer off Japan.

17
0:01:00.826,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'm the short one.

18
0:01:03.322,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.

19
0:01:07.38,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I owe my participation in this now-historic event

20
0:01:10.91,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to TED.

21
0:01:12.716,000 --> 0:01:15,000
In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue

22
0:01:15.791,000 --> 0:01:17,000
held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos

23
0:01:18.525,000 --> 0:01:21,000
as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.

24
0:01:22.367,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,

25
0:01:25.156,000 --> 0:01:29,000
one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.

26
0:01:29.933,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Mike deGruy was also invited,

27
0:01:32.229,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,

28
0:01:35.784,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and he also talked to me about applying my approach

29
0:01:38.197,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to something he's been involved with for a very long time,

30
0:01:40.853,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which is the hunt for the giant squid.

31
0:01:44.287,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,

32
0:01:48.167,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel

33
0:01:52.292,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter)

34
0:01:57.081,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing

35
0:01:59.497,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and optical luring of deep sea squid

36
0:02:02.04,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in which I emphasized the importance

37
0:02:03.817,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.

38
0:02:09.067,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made,

39
0:02:11.792,000 --> 0:02:13,000
farting around in the dark

40
0:02:14.118,000 --> 0:02:16,000
using these platforms,

41
0:02:16.896,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and my impression that I saw more animals

42
0:02:20.479,000 --> 0:02:21,000
working from the submersible

43
0:02:22.36,000 --> 0:02:24,000
than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.

44
0:02:25.28,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.

45
0:02:28.65,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But I also felt like I saw more animals

46
0:02:30.339,000 --> 0:02:31,000
working with the Tiburon than the Ventana,

47
0:02:32.19,000 --> 0:02:34,000
two vehicles with the same field of view

48
0:02:34.375,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but different propulsion systems.

49
0:02:36.413,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.

50
0:02:40.444,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,

51
0:02:42.7,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance

52
0:02:45.86,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and recorded the sound they made.

53
0:02:48.292,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --

54
0:02:49.929,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which you can probably just barely hear here,

55
0:02:52.524,000 --> 0:02:55,000
uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.

56
0:02:56.124,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.

57
0:02:59.479,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)

58
0:03:04.558,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics

59
0:03:07.761,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise)

60
0:03:11.199,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.

61
0:03:14.625,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So for the deep sea squid hunt,

62
0:03:17.118,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I proposed using an optical lure

63
0:03:19.275,000 --> 0:03:21,000
attached to a camera platform

64
0:03:21.435,000 --> 0:03:25,000
with no thrusters, no motors,

65
0:03:26.203,000 --> 0:03:28,000
just a battery-powered camera,

66
0:03:28.812,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the only illumination coming from red light

67
0:03:31.832,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that's invisible to most deep-sea animals

68
0:03:34.324,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that are adapted to see primarily blue.

69
0:03:37.016,000 --> 0:03:38,000
That's visible to our eye,

70
0:03:38.278,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.

71
0:03:41.619,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,

72
0:03:44.46,000 --> 0:03:46,000
could just be thrown off the back of the ship,

73
0:03:46.589,000 --> 0:03:51,000
attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,

74
0:03:52.175,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it would just float around passively carried by the currents,

75
0:03:56.254,000 --> 0:04:,000
and the only light visible to the animals in the deep

76
0:04:00.651,000 --> 0:04:03,000
would be the blue light of the optical lure,

77
0:04:04.638,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,

78
0:04:08.418,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because it was designed to imitate

79
0:04:11.278,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the bioluminescent display

80
0:04:13.534,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.

81
0:04:16.879,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces

82
0:04:20.44,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm

83
0:04:23.423,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and is a form of defense.

84
0:04:25.701,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure

85
0:04:28.882,000 --> 0:04:3,000
is not because giant squid eat jellyfish,

86
0:04:31.785,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light

87
0:04:36.214,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when it's being chewed on by a predator

88
0:04:38.591,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and its only hope for escape

89
0:04:41.27,000 --> 0:04:43,000
may be to attract the attention of a larger predator

90
0:04:44.245,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that will attack its attacker

91
0:04:46.307,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.

92
0:04:48.85,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,

93
0:04:52.742,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and a common form of defense in the deep sea.

94
0:04:56.15,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The approach worked.

95
0:04:58.263,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner

96
0:05:01.774,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a single video glimpse of the giant,

97
0:05:04.222,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.

98
0:05:08.887,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.

99
0:05:22.105,000 --> 0:05:25,000
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --

100
0:05:25.241,000 --> 0:05:27,000
now you see me, now you don't --

101
0:05:27.286,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we had four such teasing appearances,

102
0:05:30.289,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.

103
0:05:35.698,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese)

104
0:05:39.971,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!

105
0:05:52.259,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Applause)

106
0:05:54.513,000 --> 0:05:58,000
EW: The full monty.

107
0:05:59.367,000 --> 0:06:,000
What really wowed me about that

108
0:06:00.712,000 --> 0:06:02,000
was the way it came in up over the e-jelly

109
0:06:02.886,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and then attacked the enormous thing next to it,

110
0:06:05.206,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.

111
0:06:08.512,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But even more incredible was the footage shot

112
0:06:10.931,000 --> 0:06:12,000
from the Triton submersible.

113
0:06:13.576,000 --> 0:06:15,000
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary

114
0:06:16.36,000 --> 0:06:19,000
was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,

115
0:06:19.806,000 --> 0:06:22,000
a one-meter long diamondback squid

116
0:06:23.408,000 --> 0:06:25,000
had a light attached to it, a squid jig

117
0:06:26.12,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of the type that longline fishermen use,

118
0:06:28.704,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and I think it was this light

119
0:06:30.742,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that brought the giant in.

120
0:06:33.291,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now, what you're seeing

121
0:06:34.756,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is the intensified camera's view under red light,

122
0:06:39.854,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.

123
0:06:43.976,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And then he got so excited,

124
0:06:46.431,000 --> 0:06:49,000
he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,

125
0:06:49.926,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the giant didn't run away,

126
0:06:52.11,000 --> 0:06:55,000
so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,

127
0:06:55.351,000 --> 0:06:57,000
bringing a creature of legend

128
0:06:57.887,000 --> 0:07:01,000
from the misty history into high-resolution video.

129
0:07:02.858,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It was absolutely breathtaking,

130
0:07:06.126,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact

131
0:07:09.055,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and fully extended,

132
0:07:10.52,000 --> 0:07:13,000
it would have been as tall as a two-story house.

133
0:07:13.772,000 --> 0:07:15,000
How could something that big

134
0:07:16.431,000 --> 0:07:2,000
live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?

135
0:07:21.031,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.

136
0:07:24.655,000 --> 0:07:27,000
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there,

137
0:07:27.791,000 --> 0:07:31,000
fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution

138
0:07:32.413,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and possibly bioactive compounds

139
0:07:34.51,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.

140
0:07:38.325,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction

141
0:07:41.373,000 --> 0:07:44,000
of the money on ocean exploration

142
0:07:44.742,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that we've spent on space exploration.

143
0:07:47.149,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,

144
0:07:50.794,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because we need to be exploring and protecting

145
0:07:53.629,000 --> 0:07:55,000
our life support systems here on Earth.

146
0:07:56.221,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We need — thank you. (Applause)

147
0:08:02.453,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.

148
0:08:05.307,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Innovation drives economic growth.

149
0:08:08.278,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So let's all go exploring,

150
0:08:09.801,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away,

151
0:08:12.902,000 --> 0:08:14,000
or, as Mike deGruy once said,

152
0:08:15.235,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"If you want to get away from it all

153
0:08:17.021,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and see something you've never seen,

154
0:08:18.635,000 --> 0:08:21,000
or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen,

155
0:08:22.22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
get in a sub."

156
0:08:23.75,000 --> 0:08:25,000

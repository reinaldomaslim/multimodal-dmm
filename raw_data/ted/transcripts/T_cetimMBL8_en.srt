1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The conventional wisdom about our world today

2
0:00:15.6,000 --> 0:00:18,000
is that this is a time of terrible decline.

3
0:00:19.64,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And that's not surprising, given the bad news all around us,

4
0:00:23.72,000 --> 0:00:25,000
from ISIS to inequality,

5
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:27,000
political dysfunction, climate change,

6
0:00:28.28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Brexit, and on and on.

7
0:00:31.76,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But here's the thing, and this may sound a little weird.

8
0:00:35.64,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I actually don't buy this gloomy narrative,

9
0:00:38.96,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and I don't think you should either.

10
0:00:40.76,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Look, it's not that I don't see the problems.

11
0:00:43.28,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I read the same headlines that you do.

12
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What I dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them,

13
0:00:49.84,000 --> 0:00:5,000
namely that we're all screwed

14
0:00:51.76,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because the problems are unsolvable

15
0:00:54.88,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and our governments are useless.

16
0:00:57.24,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, why do I say this?

17
0:00:58.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's not like I'm particularly optimistic by nature.

18
0:01:02.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But something about the media's constant doom-mongering

19
0:01:06.08,000 --> 0:01:09,000
with its fixation on problems and not on answers

20
0:01:09.8,000 --> 0:01:11,000
has always really bugged me.

21
0:01:11.96,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So a few years ago I decided,

22
0:01:14.08,000 --> 0:01:15,000
well, I'm a journalist,

23
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I should see if I can do any better

24
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
by going around the world and actually asking folks

25
0:01:21.56,000 --> 0:01:22,000
if and how they've tackled

26
0:01:22.84,000 --> 0:01:24,000
their big economic and political challenges.

27
0:01:26.76,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And what I found astonished me.

28
0:01:29.28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It turns out that there are remarkable signs of progress out there,

29
0:01:33.72,000 --> 0:01:36,000
often in the most unexpected places,

30
0:01:36.8,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and they've convinced me that our great global challenges

31
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
may not be so unsolvable after all.

32
0:01:43.04,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Not only are there theoretical fixes;

33
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:47,000
those fixes have been tried.

34
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They've worked.

35
0:01:49.64,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And they offer hope for the rest of us.

36
0:01:52.4,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'm going to show you what I mean

37
0:01:54.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
by telling you about how three of the countries I visited --

38
0:01:56.92,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Canada, Indonesia and Mexico --

39
0:01:58.56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
overcame three supposedly impossible problems.

40
0:02:02.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Their stories matter because they contain tools the rest of us can use,

41
0:02:06.84,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and not just for those particular problems,

42
0:02:09.8,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but for many others, too.

43
0:02:13.12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When most people think about my homeland, Canada, today,

44
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:18,000
if they think about Canada at all,

45
0:02:19.004,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they think cold, they think boring, they think polite.

46
0:02:22.639,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They think we say "sorry" too much in our funny accents.

47
0:02:26.8,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And that's all true.

48
0:02:28.04,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:29.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Sorry.

50
0:02:30.84,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:32.36,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But Canada's also important

52
0:02:35.24,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because of its triumph over a problem

53
0:02:37.08,000 --> 0:02:39,000
currently tearing many other countries apart:

54
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:4,000
immigration.

55
0:02:41.08,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Consider, Canada today is among the world's most welcoming nations,

56
0:02:45.52,000 --> 0:02:48,000
even compared to other immigration-friendly countries.

57
0:02:49.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Its per capita immigration rate is four times higher than France's,

58
0:02:53.96,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and its percentage of foreign-born residents

59
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is double that of Sweden.

60
0:02:58.08,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Meanwhile, Canada admitted

61
0:02:59.84,000 --> 0:03:02,000
10 times more Syrian refugees in the last year

62
0:03:03.6,000 --> 0:03:04,000
than did the United States.

63
0:03:05.32,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Applause)

64
0:03:12.48,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And now Canada is taking even more.

65
0:03:14.96,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And yet, if you ask Canadians

66
0:03:16.84,000 --> 0:03:18,000
what makes them proudest of their country,

67
0:03:19.52,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they rank "multiculturalism,"

68
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a dirty word in most places,

69
0:03:24.24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
second,

70
0:03:25.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
ahead of hockey.

71
0:03:27.72,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Hockey.

72
0:03:28.96,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In other words, at a time when other countries

74
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are now frantically building new barriers to keep foreigners out,

75
0:03:37.44,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Canadians want even more of them in.

76
0:03:41.32,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now, here's the really interesting part.

77
0:03:43.52,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Canada wasn't always like this.

78
0:03:45.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy.

79
0:03:52.48,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They called it "White Canada,"

80
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and as you can see, they were not just talking about the snow.

81
0:03:59.48,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So how did that Canada become today's Canada?

82
0:04:05.32,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Well, despite what my mom in Ontario will tell you,

83
0:04:07.76,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the answer had nothing to do with virtue.

84
0:04:09.76,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Canadians are not inherently better than anyone else.

85
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The real explanation involves the man who became Canada's leader in 1968,

86
0:04:17.84,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Pierre Trudeau, who is also the father of the current prime minister.

87
0:04:21.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Applause)

88
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The thing to know about that first Trudeau

89
0:04:27.04,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is that he was very different from Canada's previous leaders.

90
0:04:29.959,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He was a French speaker in a country long-dominated by its English elite.

91
0:04:34.48,000 --> 0:04:35,000
He was an intellectual.

92
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
He was even kind of groovy.

93
0:04:38.88,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.

94
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:42,000
He hung out with the Beatles.

95
0:04:42.965,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:44.08,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And like all hipsters, he could be infuriating at times.

97
0:04:48.68,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But he nevertheless pulled off

98
0:04:50.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
one of the most progressive transformations any country has ever seen.

99
0:04:56.36,000 --> 0:04:58,000
His formula, I've learned, involved two parts.

100
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:05:01,000
First, Canada threw out its old race-based immigration rules,

101
0:05:02.72,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it replaced them with new color-blind ones

102
0:05:05.56,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that emphasized education, experience and language skills instead.

103
0:05:10.76,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And what that did was greatly increase the odds

104
0:05:13.28,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that newcomers would contribute to the economy.

105
0:05:16.68,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Then part two, Trudeau created the world's first policy

106
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of official multiculturalism to promote integration

107
0:05:24.44,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and the idea that diversity was the key to Canada's identity.

108
0:05:29.56,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, in the years that followed, Ottawa kept pushing this message,

109
0:05:33.04,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but at the same time, ordinary Canadians

110
0:05:35.84,000 --> 0:05:39,000
soon started to see the economic, the material benefits of multiculturalism

111
0:05:40.36,000 --> 0:05:41,000
all around them.

112
0:05:41.64,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And these two influences soon combined

113
0:05:44.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to create the passionately open-minded Canada of today.

114
0:05:49.68,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Let's now turn to another country and an even tougher problem,

115
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Islamic extremism.

116
0:05:55.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
In 1998, the people of Indonesia took to the streets

117
0:05:58.72,000 --> 0:06:,000
and overthrew their longtime dictator, Suharto.

118
0:06:02.36,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It was an amazing moment,

119
0:06:04.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but it was also a scary one.

120
0:06:06.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
With 250 million people,

121
0:06:08.12,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Indonesia is the largest Muslim-majority country on Earth.

122
0:06:12.24,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's also hot, huge and unruly,

123
0:06:15.24,000 --> 0:06:17,000
made up of 17,000 islands,

124
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:19,000
where people speak close to a thousand languages.

125
0:06:20.64,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now, Suharto had been a dictator,

126
0:06:23.2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and a nasty one.

127
0:06:24.84,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But he'd also been a pretty effective tyrant,

128
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and he'd always been careful to keep religion out of politics.

129
0:06:31.28,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So experts feared that without him keeping a lid on things,

130
0:06:34.88,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the country would explode,

131
0:06:36.64,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or religious extremists would take over

132
0:06:38.56,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and turn Indonesia into a tropical version of Iran.

133
0:06:43.6,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And that's just what seemed to happen at first.

134
0:06:46.36,000 --> 0:06:49,000
In the country's first free elections, in 1999,

135
0:06:49.48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Islamist parties scored 36 percent of the vote,

136
0:06:52.88,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and the islands burned

137
0:06:54.56,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as riots and terror attacks killed thousands.

138
0:06:58.64,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Since then, however, Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.

139
0:07:03.92,000 --> 0:07:06,000
While ordinary folks have grown more pious on a personal level --

140
0:07:07.52,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I saw a lot more headscarves on a recent visit

141
0:07:09.72,000 --> 0:07:1,000
than I would have a decade ago --

142
0:07:11.68,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the country's politics have moved in the opposite direction.

143
0:07:15.96,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Indonesia is now a pretty decent democracy.

144
0:07:20.32,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And yet, its Islamist parties have steadily lost support,

145
0:07:23.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
from a high of about 38 percent in 2004

146
0:07:26.64,000 --> 0:07:29,000
down to 25 percent in 2014.

147
0:07:30.6,000 --> 0:07:33,000
As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.

148
0:07:34.04,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And while a few Indonesians have recently joined ISIS,

149
0:07:37.44,000 --> 0:07:38,000
their number is tiny,

150
0:07:39.84,000 --> 0:07:41,000
far fewer in per capita terms

151
0:07:42.84,000 --> 0:07:44,000
than the number of Belgians.

152
0:07:46.28,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Try to think of one other Muslim-majority country

153
0:07:48.76,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that can say all those same things.

154
0:07:51.2,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In 2014, I went to Indonesia to ask its current president,

155
0:07:54.12,000 --> 0:07:57,000
a soft-spoken technocrat named Joko Widodo,

156
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
"Why is Indonesia thriving when so many other Muslim states are dying?"

157
0:08:03.12,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"Well, what we realized," he told me,

158
0:08:04.96,000 --> 0:08:08,000
"is that to deal with extremism, we needed to deal with inequality first."

159
0:08:09.84,000 --> 0:08:12,000
See, Indonesia's religious parties, like similar parties elsewhere,

160
0:08:13.4,000 --> 0:08:16,000
had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption.

161
0:08:18.04,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So that's what Joko and his predecessors did too,

162
0:08:20.64,000 --> 0:08:21,000
thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.

163
0:08:23.48,000 --> 0:08:25,000
They also cracked down hard on terrorism,

164
0:08:26.12,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but Indonesia's democrats have learned a key lesson

165
0:08:28.72,000 --> 0:08:29,000
from the dark years of dictatorship,

166
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:34,000
namely that repression only creates more extremism.

167
0:08:36.08,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy.

168
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They used the police instead of the army.

169
0:08:42.08,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They only detained suspects if they had enough evidence.

170
0:08:45.12,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They held public trials.

171
0:08:46.72,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They even sent liberal imams into the jails

172
0:08:49.44,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to persuade the jihadists that terror is un-Islamic.

173
0:08:52.76,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And all of this paid off in spectacular fashion,

174
0:08:55.88,000 --> 0:08:58,000
creating the kind of country that was unimaginable 20 years ago.

175
0:09:00.6,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So at this point, my optimism should, I hope,

176
0:09:03.72,000 --> 0:09:04,000
be starting to make a bit more sense.

177
0:09:05.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Neither immigration nor Islamic extremism are impossible to deal with.

178
0:09:10.44,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Join me now on one last trip,

179
0:09:12.52,000 --> 0:09:13,000
this time to Mexico.

180
0:09:14.96,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, of our three stories, this one probably surprised me the most,

181
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
since as you all know,

182
0:09:19.6,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the country is still struggling with so many problems.

183
0:09:22.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And yet, a few years ago, Mexico did something

184
0:09:25.4,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that many other countries from France to India to the United States

185
0:09:30.56,000 --> 0:09:31,000
can still only dream of.

186
0:09:32.48,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years.

187
0:09:37.2,000 --> 0:09:39,000
To understand how, we need to rewind to the year 2000,

188
0:09:40.2,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when Mexico finally became a democracy.

189
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Rather than use their new freedoms to fight for reform,

190
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Mexico's politicians used them to fight one another.

191
0:09:50.36,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Congress deadlocked, and the country's problems --

192
0:09:53.32,000 --> 0:09:56,000
drugs, poverty, crime, corruption --

193
0:09:56.4,000 --> 0:09:57,000
spun out of control.

194
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
Things got so bad that in 2008,

195
0:10:00.64,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the Pentagon warned that Mexico risked collapse.

196
0:10:04.68,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Then in 2012, this guy named Enrique Peña Nieto

197
0:10:09.08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
somehow got himself elected president.

198
0:10:11.6,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now, this Peña hardly inspired much confidence at first.

199
0:10:16.68,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Sure, he was handsome,

200
0:10:18.96,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but he came from Mexico's corrupt old ruling party, the PRI,

201
0:10:22.88,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and he was a notorious womanizer.

202
0:10:26.52,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In fact, he seemed like such a pretty boy lightweight

203
0:10:29.6,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that women called him "bombón," sweetie,

204
0:10:32.4,000 --> 0:10:33,000
at campaign rallies.

205
0:10:35.36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And yet this same bombón soon surprised everyone

206
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:4,000
by hammering out a truce

207
0:10:40.28,000 --> 0:10:43,000
between the country's three warring political parties.

208
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And over the next 18 months, they together passed

209
0:10:45.92,000 --> 0:10:47,000
an incredibly comprehensive set of reforms.

210
0:10:48.88,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They busted open Mexico's smothering monopolies.

211
0:10:51.96,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They liberalized its rusting energy sector.

212
0:10:55.2,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They restructured its failing schools, and much more.

213
0:10:58.44,000 --> 0:11:,000
To appreciate the scale of this accomplishment,

214
0:11:00.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
try to imagine the US Congress passing immigration reform,

215
0:11:04.92,000 --> 0:11:06,000
campaign finance reform and banking reform.

216
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now, try to imagine Congress doing it all at the same time.

217
0:11:11.92,000 --> 0:11:12,000
That's what Mexico did.

218
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Not long ago, I met with Peña and asked how he managed it all.

219
0:11:18.32,000 --> 0:11:21,000
The President flashed me his famous twinkly smile --

220
0:11:21.44,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Laughter)

221
0:11:24.64,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and told me that the short answer was "compromiso," compromise.

222
0:11:29.6,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Of course, I pushed him for details,

223
0:11:31.36,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and the long answer that came out was essentially

224
0:11:33.92,000 --> 0:11:35,000
"compromise, compromise and more compromise."

225
0:11:37.28,000 --> 0:11:39,000
See, Peña knew that he needed to build trust early,

226
0:11:40.08,000 --> 0:11:43,000
so he started talking to the opposition just days after his election.

227
0:11:43.88,000 --> 0:11:45,000
To ward off pressure from special interests,

228
0:11:46.24,000 --> 0:11:48,000
he kept their meetings small and secret,

229
0:11:49.04,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and many of the participants later told me that it was this intimacy,

230
0:11:53.36,000 --> 0:11:54,000
plus a lot of shared tequila,

231
0:11:55.04,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that helped build confidence.

232
0:11:57.6,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So did the fact that all decisions had to be unanimous,

233
0:12:00.48,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and that Peña even agreed to pass some of the other party's priorities

234
0:12:04.64,000 --> 0:12:05,000
before his own.

235
0:12:06.8,000 --> 0:12:09,000
As Santiago Creel, an opposition senator, put it to me,

236
0:12:09.88,000 --> 0:12:13,000
"Look, I'm not saying that I'm special or that anyone is special,

237
0:12:14.56,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but that group, that was special."

238
0:12:18.04,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The proof?

239
0:12:19.28,000 --> 0:12:22,000
When Peña was sworn in, the pact held,

240
0:12:22.64,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and Mexico moved forward for the first time in years.

241
0:12:27.52,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Bueno.

242
0:12:28.76,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So now we've seen how these three countries

243
0:12:31.08,000 --> 0:12:33,000
overcame three of their great challenges.

244
0:12:33.64,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And that's very nice for them, right?

245
0:12:35.48,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But what good does it do the rest of us?

246
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Well, in the course of studying these and a bunch of other success stories,

247
0:12:42.6,000 --> 0:12:46,000
like the way Rwanda pulled itself back together after civil war

248
0:12:46.76,000 --> 0:12:48,000
or Brazil has reduced inequality,

249
0:12:49.52,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or South Korea has kept its economy growing faster and for longer

250
0:12:53.28,000 --> 0:12:54,000
than any other country on Earth,

251
0:12:55.24,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I've noticed a few common threads.

252
0:12:57.72,000 --> 0:13:,000
Now, before describing them, I need to add a caveat.

253
0:13:00.84,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I realize, of course, that all countries are unique.

254
0:13:03.48,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So you can't simply take what worked in one,

255
0:13:06.2,000 --> 0:13:08,000
port it to another and expect it to work there too.

256
0:13:08.92,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Nor do specific solutions work forever.

257
0:13:11.28,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You've got to adapt them as circumstances change.

258
0:13:14.88,000 --> 0:13:17,000
That said, by stripping these stories to their essence,

259
0:13:18.52,000 --> 0:13:22,000
you absolutely can distill a few common tools for problem-solving

260
0:13:23.2,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that will work in other countries

261
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and in boardrooms

262
0:13:27.48,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and in all sorts of other contexts, too.

263
0:13:30.64,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Number one, embrace the extreme.

264
0:13:33.96,000 --> 0:13:34,000
In all the stories we've just looked at,

265
0:13:35.92,000 --> 0:13:37,000
salvation came at a moment of existential peril.

266
0:13:39.76,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And that was no coincidence.

267
0:13:41.64,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Take Canada: when Trudeau took office, he faced two looming dangers.

268
0:13:46.64,000 --> 0:13:48,000
First, though his vast, underpopulated country

269
0:13:49.32,000 --> 0:13:5,000
badly needed more bodies,

270
0:13:50.96,000 --> 0:13:52,000
its preferred source for white workers, Europe,

271
0:13:53.6,000 --> 0:13:57,000
had just stopped exporting them as it finally recovered from World War II.

272
0:13:57.68,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The other problem was that Canada's long cold war

273
0:14:00.2,000 --> 0:14:02,000
between its French and its English communities

274
0:14:03.04,000 --> 0:14:04,000
had just become a hot one.

275
0:14:05.28,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Quebec was threatening to secede,

276
0:14:07.48,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and Canadians were actually killing other Canadians over politics.

277
0:14:11.28,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now, countries face crises all the time. Right?

278
0:14:14.76,000 --> 0:14:15,000
That's nothing special.

279
0:14:16.96,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But Trudeau's genius was to realize that Canada's crisis

280
0:14:20.76,000 --> 0:14:23,000
had swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform.

281
0:14:24.88,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Canada had to open up. It had no choice.

282
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And it had to rethink its identity.

283
0:14:30.84,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Again, it had no choice.

284
0:14:32.56,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And that gave Trudeau a once-in-a-generation opportunity

285
0:14:36.12,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to break the old rules and write new ones.

286
0:14:39.36,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And like all our other heroes, he was smart enough to seize it.

287
0:14:44.36,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Number two, there's power in promiscuous thinking.

288
0:14:48.2,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Another striking similarity among good problem-solvers

289
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is that they're all pragmatists.

290
0:14:53.2,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They'll steal the best answers from wherever they find them,

291
0:14:56.4,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and they don't let details

292
0:14:57.8,000 --> 0:15:02,000
like party or ideology or sentimentality get in their way.

293
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
As I mentioned earlier, Indonesia's democrats were clever enough

294
0:15:06.48,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to steal many of the Islamists' best campaign promises for themselves.

295
0:15:11.28,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They even invited some of the radicals into their governing coalition.

296
0:15:15.2,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Now, that horrified a lot of secular Indonesians.

297
0:15:19.84,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But by forcing the radicals to actually help govern,

298
0:15:24.72,000 --> 0:15:27,000
it quickly exposed the fact that they weren't any good at the job,

299
0:15:28.6,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and it got them mixed up in all of the grubby compromises

300
0:15:31.64,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and petty humiliations that are part of everyday politics.

301
0:15:34.72,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And that hurt their image so badly that they've never recovered.

302
0:15:39.24,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Number three,

303
0:15:40.64,000 --> 0:15:42,000
please all of the people some of the time.

304
0:15:44.2,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I know I just mentioned how crises can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.

305
0:15:49.32,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And that's true, but problem-solving often requires more than just boldness.

306
0:15:53.32,000 --> 0:15:55,000
It takes showing restraint, too,

307
0:15:55.92,000 --> 0:15:57,000
just when that's the last thing you want to do.

308
0:15:58.6,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Take Trudeau: when he took office,

309
0:16:00.56,000 --> 0:16:02,000
he could easily have put his core constituency,

310
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that is Canada's French community, first.

311
0:16:05.84,000 --> 0:16:08,000
He could have pleased some of the people all of the time.

312
0:16:09.92,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And Peña could have used his power to keep attacking the opposition,

313
0:16:13.48,000 --> 0:16:14,000
as was traditional in Mexico.

314
0:16:15.28,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Yet he chose to embrace his enemies instead,

315
0:16:18.44,000 --> 0:16:2,000
while forcing his own party to compromise.

316
0:16:20.96,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And Trudeau pushed everyone to stop thinking in tribal terms

317
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and to see multiculturalism, not language and not skin color,

318
0:16:29.68,000 --> 0:16:31,000
as what made them quintessentially Canadian.

319
0:16:32.96,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Nobody got everything they wanted,

320
0:16:35.48,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but everyone got just enough that the bargains held.

321
0:16:40.56,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So at this point you may be thinking,

322
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:44,000
"OK, Tepperman,

323
0:16:44.24,000 --> 0:16:46,000
if the fixes really are out there like you keep insisting,

324
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:49,000
then why aren't more countries already using them?"

325
0:16:50.64,000 --> 0:16:52,000
It's not like they require special powers to pull off.

326
0:16:53.24,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I mean, none of the leaders we've just looked at were superheroes.

327
0:16:56.84,000 --> 0:16:58,000
They didn't accomplish anything on their own,

328
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and they all had plenty of flaws.

329
0:17:01.2,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Take Indonesia's first democratic president,

330
0:17:03.64,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Abdurrahman Wahid.

331
0:17:05.32,000 --> 0:17:08,000
This man was so powerfully uncharismatic

332
0:17:08.56,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that he once fell asleep

333
0:17:10.68,000 --> 0:17:11,000
in the middle of his own speech.

334
0:17:12.48,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Laughter)

335
0:17:14.12,000 --> 0:17:15,000
True story.

336
0:17:19.96,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability,

337
0:17:23.68,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and it's not circumstances.

338
0:17:25.52,000 --> 0:17:27,000
It's something much simpler.

339
0:17:27.599,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Making big changes involves taking big risks,

340
0:17:31.599,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and taking big risks is scary.

341
0:17:34.48,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Overcoming that fear requires guts,

342
0:17:37.839,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and as you all know,

343
0:17:39.2,000 --> 0:17:41,000
gutsy politicians are painfully rare.

344
0:17:43.12,000 --> 0:17:45,000
But that doesn't mean we voters

345
0:17:45.24,000 --> 0:17:47,000
can't demand courage from our political leaders.

346
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I mean, that's why we put them in office in the first place.

347
0:17:51.52,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And given the state of the world today, there's really no other option.

348
0:17:55.88,000 --> 0:17:57,000
The answers are out there,

349
0:17:58.72,000 --> 0:18:,000
but now it's up to us

350
0:18:01.08,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to elect more women and men

351
0:18:03.64,000 --> 0:18:05,000
brave enough to find them,

352
0:18:06.04,000 --> 0:18:07,000
to steal them

353
0:18:07.44,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and to make them work.

354
0:18:09.08,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Thank you.

355
0:18:10.48,000 --> 0:18:15,000
(Applause)

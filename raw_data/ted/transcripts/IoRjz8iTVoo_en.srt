1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
In 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring,"

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I think for people like me in the world of the making of things,

3
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the canary in the mine wasn't singing.

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And so the question that we might not have birds

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around

6
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.

7
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And the question was, were the birds singing?

8
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.

9
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.

10
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:,000
What is a bird?

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck.

12
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It comes in California with a warning --

13
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"This product contains chemicals known by the State of California

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."

15
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This is a bird.

16
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind

17
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and then label it and sell it to children?

18
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I think we have a design problem.

19
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave

20
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:41,000
called "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note --

21
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"We realize that design is a signal of intention,

22
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but it also has to occur within a world,

23
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and we have to understand that world in order to

24
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
imbue our designs with inherent intelligence,

25
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs

26
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition

27
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,

28
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,

29
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because the news is the news of abundance,

30
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and not the news of limits,

31
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I think as our culture tortures itself now

32
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:28,000
with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,

33
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,

34
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
driven by the sun, and start to imagine

35
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:42,000
what that would be like to share."

36
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
That was a nice thing to get.

37
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That was one sentence.

38
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Henry James would be proud.

39
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This is -- I put it down at the bottom,

40
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but that was extemporaneous, obviously.

41
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The fundamental issue is that, for me,

42
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
design is the first signal of human intentions.

43
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be --

44
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world --

45
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
well, what would our intention be as a species

46
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
now that we're the dominant species?

47
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate,

48
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship --

49
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because how could you dominate something you had killed?

50
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And stewardship's implicit in dominion,

51
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.

52
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So the question is, what is the first question for designers?

53
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Now, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example,

54
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on --

55
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the question we're asking the guardian at this point is

56
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
are we meant, how are we meant,

57
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to secure local societies, create world peace

58
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and save the environment?

59
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But I don't know that that's the common debate.

60
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick,

61
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
essentially creative, highly effective and efficient,

62
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange

63
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
value for very long if we don't trust each other.

64
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work,

65
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but the question we bring to it is,

66
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
how do we love all the children of all species for all time?

67
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And so we start our designs with that question.

68
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Because what we realize today is that modern culture

69
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.

70
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend

71
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to cause global warming on the way here,"

72
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and we say, "That's not part of my plan,"

73
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
then we realize it's part of our de facto plan.

74
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.

75
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And I was at the White House for President Bush,

76
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
meeting with every federal department and agency,

77
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.

78
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
If the end game is global warming, they're doing great.

79
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children

80
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,

81
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,

82
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"Brain death for all children. No child left behind."

83
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Applause)

84
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So, the question is, how many federal officials

85
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?

86
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,

87
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
then you're just moving chess pieces around,

88
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:12,000
if you don't know you're taking the king.

89
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,

90
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which requires humility. And in my business as an architect,

91
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect"

92
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
have not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead."

93
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,

94
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years

95
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to put wheels on our luggage.

96
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.

97
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.

98
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And so we call it "cradle to cradle,"

99
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and our goal is very simple.

100
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is what I presented to the White House.

101
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world,

102
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with clean air, clean water, soil and power --

103
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.

104
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

105
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
What don't you like about this?

106
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Which part of this don't you like?

107
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So we realized we want full diversity,

108
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said

109
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
when asked what it was like to be President of France.

110
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?"

111
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.

112
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we've designed products

113
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.

114
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition

115
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
instead of Alzheimer's later in life.

116
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We can ask ourselves, what is justice,

117
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and is justice blind, or is justice blindness?

118
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?

119
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations.

120
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.

121
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe?

122
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones

123
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in the Gulf of Mexico.

124
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
A fundamental issue that's not being addressed.

125
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
We've seen the first form of solar energy

126
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind

127
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.

128
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,

129
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
they asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?"

130
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,

131
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."

132
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We see that companies acting ethically in this world

133
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:24,000
are outperforming those that don't.

134
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.

135
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.

136
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,

137
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,

138
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
which is from copper.

139
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
On the other hand, we see great signs of hope.

140
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out

141
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
how to do mass-produced health.

142
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
He has given eyesight to two million people for free.

143
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again

144
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because of the contaminants of the coatings --

145
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
bismuth, antimony, copper and so on.

146
0:07:58,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They become building steel.

147
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway,

148
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet,

149
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the largest carpet company in the world.

150
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable,

151
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
down to the parts per million.

152
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam,

153
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
the bottom, a polyolephine -- infinitely recyclable thermoplastic.

154
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.

155
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap

156
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
with an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds.

157
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong,

158
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
with six million people in 40 square miles.

159
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.

160
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been

161
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.

162
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries

163
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
without understanding nutrient flow.

164
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,

165
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
among the first growth and big growth.

166
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,

167
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:01,000
so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off.

168
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I went to Yale for graduate school,

169
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,

170
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
affectionately known in our business as Brutalism.

171
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If we look at the world of architecture,

172
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,

173
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?"

174
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,

175
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and the windows are all closed. And with most products

176
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
appearing not to have been designed for indoor use,

177
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
this is actually a vertical gas chamber.

178
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
When I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis,

179
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland

180
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
as a student, which I then built --

181
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
which would give you a sense of my ambition.

182
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,

183
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,

184
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- --

185
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:51,000
solar energy has nothing to do with architecture."

186
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius.

187
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:57,000
In 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in America

188
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for Environmental Defense.

189
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.

190
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away."

191
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time

192
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:08,000
was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,

193
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and it was to prove there was no danger

194
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
from secondhand smoke in the workplace.

195
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969,

196
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and this happens, and we realize that "away" went away.

197
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?

198
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example --

199
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
you see that little blue thing above Hawaii?

200
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That's the Pacific Gyre.

201
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists,

202
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and they found six times as much plastic as plankton.

203
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:39,000
When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."

204
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Perhaps that's away.

205
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So we're looking for the design rules of this --

206
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya,

207
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
259 species of tree, and we described this

208
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in the book, "Cradle to Cradle."

209
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.

210
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That's the name of the first chapter -- "This Book is Not a Tree."

211
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,

212
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
"we write our history on the skin of fish

213
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
with the blood of bears."

214
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And with so much polymer, what we really need

215
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is technical nutrition, and to use something

216
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment:

217
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,

218
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:17,000
fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,

219
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:21,000
makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,

220
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:27,000
changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates.

221
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it?

222
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Laughter)

223
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So, we're looking at the same criteria

224
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
as most people -- you know, can I afford it?

225
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Does it work? Do I like it?

226
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville,

227
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:47,000
where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.

228
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

229
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Now if we look at the word "competition,"

230
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I'm sure most of you've used it.

231
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:57,000
You know, most people don't realize it comes from

232
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
the Latin competere, which means strive together.

233
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.

234
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
They get fit together, and then they compete.

235
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon.

236
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So we've been looking at the idea of competition

237
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:15,000
as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.

238
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And the Chinese government has now --

239
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I work with the Chinese government now --

240
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
has taken this up.

241
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We're also looking at survival of the fittest,

242
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
not in just competition terms in our modern context

243
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
of destroy the other or beat them to the ground,

244
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but really to fit together and build niches

245
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and have growth that is good.

246
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good,

247
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.

248
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But if we look at asphalt as our growth,

249
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
then we realize that all we're doing is destroying

250
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:47,000
the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.

251
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,

252
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,

253
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and all of a sudden, you get this biology.

254
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,

255
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through

256
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
all these toxic materials that we disgorge,

257
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
we will never be able to recover that.

258
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years

259
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,

260
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that life itself has to have growth as a precondition --

261
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
it has to have free energy, sunlight

262
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and it needs to be an open system of chemicals.

263
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,

264
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight

265
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and we want an open metabolism for chemicals.

266
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth,

267
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but what do you want to grow?

268
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So instead of just growing destruction,

269
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
we want to grow the things that we might enjoy,

270
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.

271
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So therefore, we have these two metabolisms,

272
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,

273
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.

274
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The biological one I'm sure you understand,

275
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but also the technical one, where we take materials

276
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and put them into closed cycles.

277
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.

278
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.

279
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,

280
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,

281
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
the world would run out of cork and dry up.

282
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So we need materials in closed cycles,

283
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million

284
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,

285
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,

286
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them

287
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and their production and so on.

288
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals

289
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:3,000
in the textile industry.

290
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]

291
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We were left with 38 chemicals.

292
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals

293
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:45,000
in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.

294
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So designers all over the world can analyze their products

295
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:52,000
down to the parts per million for human and ecological health.

296
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Applause)

297
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:,000
We've developed a protocol so that companies can send

298
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
these same messages all the way through their supply chains,

299
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars

300
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
-- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers."

301
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
"And where does it go?"

302
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"Customers."

303
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So we need some help there.

304
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics --

305
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the water coming out was clean enough to drink.

306
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet.

307
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.

308
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor,

309
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
a cradle to cradle car -- concept car.

310
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable,

311
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
the bottoms are biodegradable soles.

312
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Wear your old shoes in, your new shoes out.

313
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,000
There is no finish line.

314
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials

315
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:44,000
go back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil --

316
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
it's all solar-powered.

317
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed

318
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.

319
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses

320
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:58,000
of San Bruno, California, are on the roof.

321
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
And this is our project for Ford Motor Company.

322
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:02,000
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.

323
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:06,000
This is obviously a color photograph.

324
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:1,000
These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford.

325
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,

326
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus

327
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:19,000
at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.

328
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.

329
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
This is the roof, saving money,

330
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer.

331
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
They showed up in five days.

332
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And we now have 350-pound auto workers

333
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:38,000
learning bird songs on the Internet.

334
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:4,000
We're developing now protocols for cities --

335
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that's the home of technical nutrients.

336
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together.

337
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And so I will finish by showing you a new city

338
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:49,000
we're designing for the Chinese government.

339
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We're doing 12 cities for China right now,

340
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:54,000
based on cradle to cradle as templates.

341
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing

342
0:16:57,000 --> 0:16:59,000
for 400 million people in 12 years.

343
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick,

344
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.

345
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
They'll have cities with no energy and no food.

346
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding --

347
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter --

348
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
for China to adopt cradle to cradle.

349
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,

350
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --

351
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that

352
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:24,000
we have what, effectively, when I was a student,

353
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:27,000
was called mutually assured destruction.

354
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities.

355
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:33,000
We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.

356
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
This is the site.

357
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:39,000
We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,

358
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:41,000
so they brought us in to intercede.

359
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:43,000
This is their plan.

360
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:46,000
It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.

361
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And they brought us in and said, "What would you do?"

362
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:53,000
This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.

363
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:56,000
So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,

364
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and here's our proposal.

365
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:02,000
(Applause)

366
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:04,000
So the way we approached this

367
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:06,000
is we studied the hydrology very carefully.

368
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:08,000
We studied the biota, the ancient biota,

369
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:1,000
the current farming and the protocols.

370
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:12,000
We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city

371
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:18,000
will have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight

372
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:21,000
in every single apartment at some point during the day.

373
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:25,000
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.

374
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:28,000
We lay out the building areas.

375
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:29,000
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use

376
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:32,000
so the people all have centers and places to be.

377
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:34,000
The transportation is all very simple,

378
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:37,000
everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.

379
0:18:37,000 --> 0:18:42,000
We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.

380
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:44,000
The waste systems all connect.

381
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:49,000
If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,

382
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:51,000
which are sold as assets, not liabilities.

383
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?

384
0:18:55,000 --> 0:19:,000
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.

385
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:04,000
And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city

386
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:08,000
to power the fuel for the cooking for the city.

387
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:1,000
So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants.

388
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:13,000
And then the compost is all taken back

389
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:15,000
to the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,

390
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:19,000
because what we've done is lifted up the city,

391
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:26,000
the landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscape

392
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
on the roofs of the buildings.

393
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:31,000
The solar power of all the factory centers

394
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:34,000
and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.

395
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And this is the concept for the top of the city.

396
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:4,000
We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.

397
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:44,000
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.

398
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:48,000
We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.

399
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:53,000
And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.

400
0:19:53,000 --> 0:20:07,000
(Applause)

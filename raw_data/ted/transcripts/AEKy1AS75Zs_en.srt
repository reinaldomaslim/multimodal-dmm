1
0:00:12.962,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We do not choose where to be born.

2
0:00:17.07,000 --> 0:00:2,000
We do not choose who our parents are.

3
0:00:21.264,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But we do choose how we are going to live our lives.

4
0:00:26.81,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I did not choose to be born in South Sudan,

5
0:00:29.551,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a country rife with conflict.

6
0:00:32.511,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I did not choose my name --

7
0:00:35.304,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Nyiriak,

8
0:00:36.866,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which means "war."

9
0:00:39.308,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I've always rejected it

10
0:00:41.295,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and all the legacy it was born into.

11
0:00:44.754,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I choose to be called Mary.

12
0:00:48.154,000 --> 0:00:51,000
As a teacher, I've stood in front of 120 students,

13
0:00:51.861,000 --> 0:00:53,000
so this stage does not intimidate me.

14
0:00:55.996,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My students come from war-torn countries.

15
0:01:00.101,000 --> 0:01:02,000
They're so different from each other,

16
0:01:02.662,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but they have one thing in common:

17
0:01:05.504,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they fled their homes in order to stay alive.

18
0:01:10.616,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Some of them belong to parents back home in South Sudan

19
0:01:14.151,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who are killing each other

20
0:01:15.497,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because they belong to a different tribe or they have a different belief.

21
0:01:20.922,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Others come from other African countries devastated by war.

22
0:01:25.823,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But when they enter my class, they make friends,

23
0:01:28.882,000 --> 0:01:29,000
they walk home together,

24
0:01:31.149,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they do their homework together.

25
0:01:33.711,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There is no hatred allowed in my class.

26
0:01:38.078,000 --> 0:01:42,000
My story is like that of so many other refugees.

27
0:01:43.063,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The war came when I was still a baby.

28
0:01:46.131,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And my father,

29
0:01:47.372,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who had been absent in most of my early childhood,

30
0:01:50.251,000 --> 0:01:52,000
was doing what other men were doing:

31
0:01:52.851,000 --> 0:01:53,000
fighting for the country.

32
0:01:55.283,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He had two wives and many children.

33
0:02:00.459,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My mother was his second wife,

34
0:02:02.812,000 --> 0:02:04,000
married to him at the age of 16.

35
0:02:05.588,000 --> 0:02:09,000
This is simply because my mother came from a poor background,

36
0:02:10.279,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and she had no choice.

37
0:02:12.103,000 --> 0:02:14,000
My father, on the other hand, was rich.

38
0:02:15.069,000 --> 0:02:16,000
He had many cows.

39
0:02:18.987,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Gunshots were the order of the day.

40
0:02:24.713,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My community was constantly under attack.

41
0:02:28.526,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Communities would fight each other as they took water along the Nile.

42
0:02:33.19,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But that was not all.

43
0:02:35.257,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Planes would drop the spinning and terrifying bombs

44
0:02:39.185,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that chopped off people's limbs.

45
0:02:41.435,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But the most terrifying thing for every single parent

46
0:02:44.735,000 --> 0:02:5,000
was to see their children being abducted and turned into young soldiers.

47
0:02:51.877,000 --> 0:02:53,000
My mother dug a trench

48
0:02:54.222,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that soon became our home.

49
0:02:57.15,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But yet, we did not feel protected.

50
0:03:00.455,000 --> 0:03:03,000
She had to flee in search of a safe place for us.

51
0:03:04.429,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I was four years old, and my younger sister was two.

52
0:03:09.267,000 --> 0:03:11,000
We joined a huge mass of people,

53
0:03:11.304,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and together we walked for many agonizing days

54
0:03:15.244,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in search of a secure place.

55
0:03:17.19,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But we could barely rest

56
0:03:19.954,000 --> 0:03:21,000
before we were attacked again.

57
0:03:24.159,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I remember my mother was pregnant,

58
0:03:26.627,000 --> 0:03:29,000
when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister.

59
0:03:30.362,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We finally made it across the Kenyan border, yes.

60
0:03:33.887,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But that was the longest journey that I have ever had in my whole life.

61
0:03:40.028,000 --> 0:03:43,000
My feet were raw with blisters.

62
0:03:45.63,000 --> 0:03:46,000
To our surprise,

63
0:03:47.21,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we found other family members who had fled into the camp earlier on,

64
0:03:50.545,000 --> 0:03:51,000
where you all are today,

65
0:03:52.236,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the Kakuma camp.

66
0:03:53.966,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now, I want you all to be very quiet just for a moment.

67
0:04:00.574,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Do you hear that?

68
0:04:04.022,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The sound of silence.

69
0:04:08.268,000 --> 0:04:09,000
No gunshots.

70
0:04:11.157,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Peace, at last.

71
0:04:14.279,000 --> 0:04:17,000
That was my first memory of this camp.

72
0:04:19.154,000 --> 0:04:21,000
When you move from a war zone

73
0:04:21.531,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and come to a secure place like Kakuma,

74
0:04:24.078,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you've really gone far.

75
0:04:27.655,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I only stayed in the camp for three years, though.

76
0:04:30.58,000 --> 0:04:33,000
My father, who had been absent in most of my early childhood,

77
0:04:33.668,000 --> 0:04:34,000
came back into my life.

78
0:04:35.697,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And he organized for me to move with my uncle

79
0:04:39.11,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to our family in Nakuru.

80
0:04:41.328,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There, I found my father's first wife,

81
0:04:43.795,000 --> 0:04:46,000
my half sisters and my half brothers.

82
0:04:47.4,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I got enrolled in school.

83
0:04:49.503,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I remember my first day in school -- I could sing and laugh again --

84
0:04:54.105,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and my first set of school uniforms, you bet.

85
0:04:58.317,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It was amazing.

86
0:05:01.36,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But then I came to realize

87
0:05:04.622,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that my uncle did not find it fit for me to go to school,

88
0:05:10.194,000 --> 0:05:12,000
simply because I was a girl.

89
0:05:14.649,000 --> 0:05:16,000
My half brothers were his first priority.

90
0:05:18.622,000 --> 0:05:21,000
He would say, "Educating a girl is a waste of time."

91
0:05:22.773,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And for that reason, I missed many days of school,

92
0:05:27.758,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because the fees were not paid.

93
0:05:31.364,000 --> 0:05:32,000
My father stepped in

94
0:05:33.305,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and organized for me to go to boarding school.

95
0:05:37.253,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I remember the faith that he put in me over the couple of years to come.

96
0:05:41.337,000 --> 0:05:46,000
He would say, "Education is an animal that you have to overcome.

97
0:05:47.779,000 --> 0:05:5,000
With an education, you can survive.

98
0:05:51.838,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Education shall be your first husband."

99
0:05:56.557,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And with these words came in his first big investment.

100
0:06:01.657,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I felt lucky!

101
0:06:03.627,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But I was missing something:

102
0:06:08.462,000 --> 0:06:09,000
my mother.

103
0:06:11.064,000 --> 0:06:13,000
My mother had been left behind in the camp,

104
0:06:14.511,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and I had not seen her since I left it.

105
0:06:18.197,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Six years without seeing her was really long.

106
0:06:24.245,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I was alone,

107
0:06:26.178,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in school,

108
0:06:28.117,000 --> 0:06:29,000
when I heard of her death.

109
0:06:32.128,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I've seen many people back in South Sudan

110
0:06:36.316,000 --> 0:06:37,000
lose their lives.

111
0:06:38.001,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I've heard from neighbors

112
0:06:39.948,000 --> 0:06:41,000
lose their sons, their husbands,

113
0:06:43.159,000 --> 0:06:44,000
their children.

114
0:06:45.104,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But I never thought that that would ever come into my life.

115
0:06:49.84,000 --> 0:06:52,000
A month earlier, my stepmother,

116
0:06:53.42,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who had been so good to me back in Nakuru, died first.

117
0:06:59.764,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Then I came to realize that after giving birth to four girls,

118
0:07:05.226,000 --> 0:07:08,000
my mother had finally given birth to something

119
0:07:08.565,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that could have made her be accepted into the community --

120
0:07:12.3,000 --> 0:07:13,000
a baby boy,

121
0:07:13.871,000 --> 0:07:14,000
my baby brother.

122
0:07:16.731,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But he, too,

123
0:07:18.742,000 --> 0:07:2,000
joined the list of the dead.

124
0:07:23.982,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The most hurting part for me

125
0:07:27.409,000 --> 0:07:3,000
was the fact that I wasn't able to attend my mother's burial.

126
0:07:31.984,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I wasn't allowed.

127
0:07:34.654,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They said her family did not find it fit

128
0:07:39.378,000 --> 0:07:42,000
for her children, who are all girls, to attend her burial,

129
0:07:44.016,000 --> 0:07:45,000
simply because we were girls.

130
0:07:46.806,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They would lament to me and say,

131
0:07:49.634,000 --> 0:07:5,000
"We are sorry, Mary, for your loss.

132
0:07:52.689,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We are sorry that your parents never left behind any children."

133
0:07:59.415,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I would wonder:

134
0:08:01.792,000 --> 0:08:02,000
What are we?

135
0:08:04.061,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Are we not children?

136
0:08:06.858,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In the mentality of my community,

137
0:08:09.784,000 --> 0:08:1,000
only the boy child counted.

138
0:08:13.419,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And for that reason, I knew this was the end of me.

139
0:08:19.606,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But I was the eldest girl.

140
0:08:21.794,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I had to take care of my siblings.

141
0:08:23.754,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I had to ensure they went to school.

142
0:08:26.674,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I was 13 years old.

143
0:08:29.745,000 --> 0:08:31,000
How could I have made that happen?

144
0:08:33.208,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I came back to the camp to take care of my siblings.

145
0:08:36.835,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I've never felt so stuck.

146
0:08:39.8,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But then, one of my aunts, Auntie Okoi,

147
0:08:44.201,000 --> 0:08:45,000
decided to take my sisters.

148
0:08:46.643,000 --> 0:08:49,000
My father sent me money from Juba for me to go back to school.

149
0:08:50.829,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Boarding school was heaven, but it was also so hard.

150
0:08:55.154,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I remember during the visiting days when parents would come to school,

151
0:08:58.751,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and my father would miss.

152
0:09:00.179,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But when he did come,

153
0:09:01.913,000 --> 0:09:02,000
he repeated the same faith in me.

154
0:09:03.724,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This time he would say,

155
0:09:05.054,000 --> 0:09:07,000
"Mary, you cannot go astray,

156
0:09:07.787,000 --> 0:09:1,000
because you are the future of your siblings."

157
0:09:12.142,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But then, in 2012,

158
0:09:15.788,000 --> 0:09:18,000
life took away the only thing that I was clinging on.

159
0:09:20.395,000 --> 0:09:21,000
My father died.

160
0:09:23.783,000 --> 0:09:25,000
My grades in school started to collapse,

161
0:09:27.643,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and when I sat for my final high school exams in 2015,

162
0:09:33.648,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I was devastated to receive a C grade.

163
0:09:37.264,000 --> 0:09:39,000
OK, I keep telling students in my class,

164
0:09:39.589,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"It's not about the A's; it's about doing your best."

165
0:09:43.461,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That was not my best.

166
0:09:45.887,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I was determined.

167
0:09:47.176,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I wanted to go back and try again.

168
0:09:50.664,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But my parents were gone.

169
0:09:52.972,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I had no one to take care of me,

170
0:09:54.551,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and I had no one to pay that fee.

171
0:09:56.863,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I felt so hopeless.

172
0:10:00.412,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But then, one of my best friends,

173
0:10:02.586,000 --> 0:10:05,000
a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha,

174
0:10:05.963,000 --> 0:10:07,000
called me during this devastating moment,

175
0:10:08.051,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and she was like, "Mary, you have a strong will.

176
0:10:11.436,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And I have a plan, and it's going to work."

177
0:10:14.261,000 --> 0:10:17,000
OK, when you're in those devastating moments, you accept anything, right?

178
0:10:18.282,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So the plan was, she organized some travel money

179
0:10:21.417,000 --> 0:10:24,000
for us to travel to Anester Victory Girls High School.

180
0:10:25.262,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I remember that day so well.

181
0:10:26.717,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It was raining when we entered the principal's office.

182
0:10:30.198,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We were shaking like two chickens that had been rained on,

183
0:10:33.318,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and we looked at him.

184
0:10:34.516,000 --> 0:10:35,000
He was asking, "What do you want?"

185
0:10:36.89,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And we looked at him with the cat face.

186
0:10:39.132,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"We just want to go back to school."

187
0:10:41.257,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Well, believe it or not, he not only paid our school fees

188
0:10:45.62,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but also our uniform and pocket money for food.

189
0:10:49.757,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Clap for him.

190
0:10:51.004,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

191
0:10:53.766,000 --> 0:10:55,000
When I finished my high school career,

192
0:10:55.872,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I became the head girl.

193
0:10:57.984,000 --> 0:11:,000
And when I sat for the KCSE for a second time,

194
0:11:01.373,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I was able to receive a B minus. Clap.

195
0:11:04.047,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause)

196
0:11:06.311,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Thank you.

197
0:11:07.49,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So I really want to say thank you to Anester Victory, Mr. Gatimu

198
0:11:11.924,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and the whole Anester fraternity for giving me that chance.

199
0:11:17.084,000 --> 0:11:18,000
From time to time,

200
0:11:18.767,000 --> 0:11:22,000
members of my family will insist that my sister and I should get married

201
0:11:23.594,000 --> 0:11:25,000
so that somebody will take care of us.

202
0:11:26.722,000 --> 0:11:27,000
They will say,

203
0:11:28.049,000 --> 0:11:29,000
"We have a man for you."

204
0:11:30.153,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I really hate the fact that people took us as property rather than children.

205
0:11:36.092,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Sometimes they will jokingly say,

206
0:11:38.111,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"You are going to lose your market value

207
0:11:40.247,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the more educated you become."

208
0:11:42.457,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But the truth is,

209
0:11:44.463,000 --> 0:11:47,000
an educated woman is feared in my community.

210
0:11:47.916,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But I told them, this is not what I want.

211
0:11:51.056,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I don't want to get kids at 16 like my mother did.

212
0:11:55.494,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is not my life.

213
0:11:57.528,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Even though my sisters and I are suffering,

214
0:11:59.628,000 --> 0:12:01,000
there's no way we are heading in that direction.

215
0:12:02.528,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I refuse to repeat history.

216
0:12:06.094,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Educating a girl will create equal and stable societies.

217
0:12:11.266,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And educated refugees will be the hope

218
0:12:15.593,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of rebuilding their countries someday.

219
0:12:18.956,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Girls and women have a part to play in this

220
0:12:22.733,000 --> 0:12:23,000
just as much as men.

221
0:12:24.578,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Well, we have men in my family that encourage me to move on:

222
0:12:28.283,000 --> 0:12:3,000
my half brothers and also my half sisters.

223
0:12:32.726,000 --> 0:12:33,000
When I finished my high school career,

224
0:12:35.285,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I moved my sisters to Nairobi, where they live with my stepsister.

225
0:12:41.411,000 --> 0:12:43,000
They live 17 people in a house.

226
0:12:44.138,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But don't pity us.

227
0:12:45.935,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The most important thing is that they all get a decent education.

228
0:12:53.534,000 --> 0:12:54,000
The winners of today

229
0:12:56.09,000 --> 0:12:57,000
are the losers of yesterday,

230
0:12:58.557,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but who never gave up.

231
0:13:00.82,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And that is who we are,

232
0:13:02.733,000 --> 0:13:03,000
my sisters and I.

233
0:13:04.15,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I'm so proud of that.

234
0:13:06.175,000 --> 0:13:07,000
My biggest investment in life --

235
0:13:07.98,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

236
0:13:09.044,000 --> 0:13:11,000
is the education of my sisters.

237
0:13:12.868,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Education creates an equal and fair chance for everyone to make it.

238
0:13:18.128,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I personally believe education is not all about the syllabus.

239
0:13:21.841,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It's about friendship.

240
0:13:23.746,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It's about discovering our talents.

241
0:13:26.005,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's about discovering our destiny.

242
0:13:29.914,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I will, for example, not forget the joy that I had

243
0:13:32.492,000 --> 0:13:34,000
when I first had singing lessons in school,

244
0:13:34.754,000 --> 0:13:35,000
which is still a passion of mine.

245
0:13:36.421,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But I wouldn't have gotten that

246
0:13:38.502,000 --> 0:13:39,000
anywhere else.

247
0:13:41.061,000 --> 0:13:45,000
As a teacher, I see my classroom as a laboratory

248
0:13:45.492,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that not only generates skills and knowledge

249
0:13:48.461,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but also understanding and hope.

250
0:13:51.881,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Let's take a tree.

251
0:13:53.894,000 --> 0:13:55,000
A tree may have its branches cut,

252
0:13:57.022,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but give it water, and it will grow new branches.

253
0:14:01.475,000 --> 0:14:02,000
For the child of war,

254
0:14:03.102,000 --> 0:14:09,000
an education can turn their tears of loss into a passion for peace.

255
0:14:09.153,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And for that reason, I refuse to give up on a single student in my class.

256
0:14:14.187,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

257
0:14:16.527,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Education heals.

258
0:14:19.079,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The school environment

259
0:14:21.129,000 --> 0:14:24,000
gives you a focus to focus ahead.

260
0:14:25.245,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Let's take it this way:

261
0:14:26.592,000 --> 0:14:28,000
when you're busy solving mathematical equations,

262
0:14:29.079,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and you are memorizing poetry,

263
0:14:31.388,000 --> 0:14:35,000
you forget the violence that you witnessed back home.

264
0:14:35.931,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And that is the power of education.

265
0:14:39.44,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It creates this place for peace.

266
0:14:42.856,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Kakuma is teeming with learners.

267
0:14:44.849,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Over 85,000 students are enrolled in schools here,

268
0:14:50.05,000 --> 0:14:53,000
which makes up 40 percent of the refugee population.

269
0:14:54.04,000 --> 0:15:,000
It includes children who lost years of education because of the war back home.

270
0:15:01.584,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And I want to ask you a question:

271
0:15:04.568,000 --> 0:15:08,000
If education is about building a generation of hope,

272
0:15:09.754,000 --> 0:15:13,000
why are there 120 students packed in my classroom?

273
0:15:16.288,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Why is it that only six percent of the primary school students

274
0:15:20.331,000 --> 0:15:21,000
are making it to high school,

275
0:15:22.091,000 --> 0:15:25,000
simply because we do not have enough places for them?

276
0:15:26.376,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And why is it that only one percent of the secondary school graduates

277
0:15:31.459,000 --> 0:15:32,000
are making it to university?

278
0:15:34.458,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I began by saying that I am a teacher.

279
0:15:37.692,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But once again, I have become a student.

280
0:15:42.247,000 --> 0:15:44,000
In March, I moved to Rwanda

281
0:15:45.192,000 --> 0:15:48,000
on a scholarship program called "Bridge2Rwanda."

282
0:15:49.503,000 --> 0:15:51,000
It prepares scholars for universities.

283
0:15:53.173,000 --> 0:15:57,000
They are able to get a chance to compete for universities abroad.

284
0:15:57.961,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I am now having teachers telling me what to do,

285
0:16:00.796,000 --> 0:16:02,000
instead of the other way round.

286
0:16:02.869,000 --> 0:16:05,000
People are once again investing in me.

287
0:16:07.587,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So I want to ask you all to invest in young refugees.

288
0:16:12.818,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Think of the tree that we mentioned earlier.

289
0:16:15.995,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We are the generation to plant it,

290
0:16:19.422,000 --> 0:16:22,000
so that the next generation can water it,

291
0:16:23.498,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and the one that follows will enjoy the shade.

292
0:16:28.36,000 --> 0:16:29,000
They will reap the benefits.

293
0:16:31.016,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And the greatest benefit of them all

294
0:16:34.263,000 --> 0:16:37,000
is an education that will last.

295
0:16:38.084,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Thank you.

296
0:16:39.648,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Applause)

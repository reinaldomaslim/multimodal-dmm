1
0:00:13.057,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Einstein said that

2
0:00:14.497,000 --> 0:00:17,000
"I never think about the future — it comes soon enough."

3
0:00:17.954,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And he was right, of course.

4
0:00:19.655,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So today, I'm here to ask you to think of

5
0:00:22.199,000 --> 0:00:24,000
how the future is happening now.

6
0:00:25.059,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Over the past 200 years, the world has experienced

7
0:00:27.822,000 --> 0:00:28,000
two major waves of innovation.

8
0:00:29.752,000 --> 0:00:31,000
First, the Industrial Revolution

9
0:00:31.981,000 --> 0:00:33,000
brought us machines and factories, railways,

10
0:00:34.502,000 --> 0:00:36,000
electricity, air travel,

11
0:00:36.832,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and our lives have never been the same.

12
0:00:39.152,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Then the Internet revolution

13
0:00:41.578,000 --> 0:00:44,000
brought us computing power, data networks,

14
0:00:44.811,000 --> 0:00:46,000
unprecedented access

15
0:00:47.146,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to information and communication,

16
0:00:49.499,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and our lives have never been the same.

17
0:00:52.774,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now we are experiencing

18
0:00:54.387,000 --> 0:00:55,000
another metamorphic change:

19
0:00:56.151,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the industrial Internet.

20
0:00:58.338,000 --> 0:01:,000
It brings together intelligent machines,

21
0:01:01.313,000 --> 0:01:02,000
advanced analytics,

22
0:01:02.853,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the creativity of people at work.

23
0:01:05.219,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's the marriage of minds and machines.

24
0:01:08.419,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And our lives will never be the same.

25
0:01:10.975,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In my current role, I see up close

26
0:01:13.968,000 --> 0:01:15,000
how technology is beginning to transform

27
0:01:16.801,000 --> 0:01:18,000
industrial sectors that play a huge role

28
0:01:19.332,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in our economy and in our lives:

29
0:01:21.725,000 --> 0:01:25,000
energy, aviation, transportation, health care.

30
0:01:26.412,000 --> 0:01:28,000
For an economist, this is highly unusual,

31
0:01:28.703,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and it's extremely exciting,

32
0:01:30.242,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because this is a transformation

33
0:01:32.131,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more,

34
0:01:36.153,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and before the Industrial Revolution,

35
0:01:37.612,000 --> 0:01:39,000
there was no economic growth to speak of.

36
0:01:40.562,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So what is this industrial Internet?

37
0:01:43.917,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Industrial machines are being equipped

38
0:01:45.78,000 --> 0:01:47,000
with a growing number of electronic sensors

39
0:01:48.04,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that allow them to see, hear, feel

40
0:01:51.489,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a lot more than ever before,

41
0:01:53.195,000 --> 0:01:56,000
generating prodigious amounts of data.

42
0:01:56.266,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Increasingly sophisticated analytics

43
0:01:58.233,000 --> 0:01:59,000
then sift through the data,

44
0:02:00.074,000 --> 0:02:02,000
providing insights that allow us

45
0:02:02.83,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to operate the machines in entirely new ways,

46
0:02:05.864,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a lot more efficiently.

47
0:02:07.77,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And not just individual machines,

48
0:02:09.759,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but fleets of locomotives, airplanes,

49
0:02:12.544,000 --> 0:02:15,000
entire systems like power grids, hospitals.

50
0:02:15.716,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It is asset optimization and system optimization.

51
0:02:19.942,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Of course, electronic sensors

52
0:02:21.952,000 --> 0:02:22,000
have been around for some time,

53
0:02:23.657,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but something has changed:

54
0:02:25.569,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a sharp decline in the cost of sensors

55
0:02:28.42,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and, thanks to advances in cloud computing,

56
0:02:30.897,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a rapid decrease in the cost of storing

57
0:02:33.913,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and processing data.

58
0:02:36.28,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So we are moving to a world

59
0:02:37.99,000 --> 0:02:38,000
where the machines we work with

60
0:02:39.783,000 --> 0:02:43,000
are not just intelligent; they are brilliant.

61
0:02:44.024,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They are self-aware, they are predictive,

62
0:02:46.782,000 --> 0:02:49,000
reactive and social.

63
0:02:50.141,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines,

64
0:02:54.099,000 --> 0:02:56,000
medical devices, communicating seamlessly

65
0:02:56.88,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with each other and with us.

66
0:02:59.205,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's a world where information itself

67
0:03:01.209,000 --> 0:03:03,000
becomes intelligent and comes to us

68
0:03:03.396,000 --> 0:03:04,000
automatically when we need it

69
0:03:05.325,000 --> 0:03:08,000
without having to look for it.

70
0:03:08.523,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We are beginning to deploy

71
0:03:10.05,000 --> 0:03:12,000
throughout the industrial system

72
0:03:12.505,000 --> 0:03:14,000
embedded virtualization,

73
0:03:14.55,000 --> 0:03:16,000
multi-core processor technology,

74
0:03:16.752,000 --> 0:03:19,000
advanced cloud-based communications,

75
0:03:20.192,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a new software-defined machine infrastructure

76
0:03:22.934,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which allows machine functionality

77
0:03:25.678,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to become virtualized in software,

78
0:03:28.252,000 --> 0:03:31,000
decoupling machine software from hardware,

79
0:03:31.414,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and allowing us to remotely and automatically

80
0:03:35.021,000 --> 0:03:4,000
monitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.

81
0:03:40.345,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Why does any of this matter at all?

82
0:03:43.479,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Well first of all, it's already allowing us

83
0:03:45.95,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to shift towards preventive,

84
0:03:48.151,000 --> 0:03:49,000
condition-based maintenance,

85
0:03:50.029,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which means fixing machines

86
0:03:51.991,000 --> 0:03:53,000
just before they break,

87
0:03:54.279,000 --> 0:03:56,000
without wasting time

88
0:03:56.295,000 --> 0:03:58,000
servicing them on a fixed schedule.

89
0:03:58.623,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And this, in turn, is pushing us towards

90
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
zero unplanned downtime,

91
0:04:04.115,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which means there will be no more power outages,

92
0:04:06.98,000 --> 0:04:08,000
no more flight delays.

93
0:04:09.02,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So let me give you a few examples

94
0:04:10.664,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of how these brilliant machines work,

95
0:04:12.543,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and some of the examples may seem trivial,

96
0:04:14.841,000 --> 0:04:15,000
some are clearly more profound,

97
0:04:16.837,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact.

98
0:04:20.962,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Let's start with aviation.

99
0:04:22.916,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Today, 10 percent of all flights

100
0:04:25.184,000 --> 0:04:27,000
cancellations and delays

101
0:04:27.302,000 --> 0:04:29,000
are due to unscheduled maintenance events.

102
0:04:30.003,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Something goes wrong unexpectedly.

103
0:04:32.035,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This results in eight billion dollars in costs

104
0:04:35.231,000 --> 0:04:37,000
for the airline industry globally every year,

105
0:04:37.643,000 --> 0:04:39,000
not to mention the impact on all of us:

106
0:04:39.945,000 --> 0:04:41,000
stress, inconvenience,

107
0:04:42.03,000 --> 0:04:44,000
missed meetings as we sit helplessly

108
0:04:44.925,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in an airport terminal.

109
0:04:46.834,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So how can the industrial Internet help here?

110
0:04:50.252,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We've developed a preventive maintenance system

111
0:04:52.887,000 --> 0:04:53,000
which can be installed on any aircraft.

112
0:04:54.877,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's self-learning and able to predict issues

113
0:04:58.128,000 --> 0:05:,000
that a human operator would miss.

114
0:05:01.084,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The aircraft, while in flight,

115
0:05:03.438,000 --> 0:05:05,000
will communicate with technicians on the ground.

116
0:05:05.788,000 --> 0:05:06,000
By the time it lands, they will already know

117
0:05:07.748,000 --> 0:05:09,000
if anything needs to be serviced.

118
0:05:10.234,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Just in the U.S., a system like this can prevent

119
0:05:13.85,000 --> 0:05:16,000
over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,

120
0:05:17.557,000 --> 0:05:18,000
helping seven million passengers

121
0:05:19.519,000 --> 0:05:21,000
get to their destinations on time.

122
0:05:22.055,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Or take healthcare.

123
0:05:23.708,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Today, nurses spend an average

124
0:05:25.439,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of 21 minutes per shift

125
0:05:28.082,000 --> 0:05:29,000
looking for medical equipment.

126
0:05:29.775,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That seems trivial, but it's less time spent

127
0:05:34.158,000 --> 0:05:36,000
caring for patients.

128
0:05:36.867,000 --> 0:05:38,000
St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,

129
0:05:39.741,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which has deployed industrial Internet technology

130
0:05:42.668,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to electronically monitor and connect

131
0:05:44.733,000 --> 0:05:47,000
patients, staff and medical equipment,

132
0:05:47.932,000 --> 0:05:49,000
has reduced bed turnaround times

133
0:05:50.242,000 --> 0:05:51,000
by nearly one hour.

134
0:05:51.977,000 --> 0:05:53,000
If you need surgery, one hour matters.

135
0:05:54.787,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It means more patients can be treated,

136
0:05:57.114,000 --> 0:05:58,000
more lives can be saved.

137
0:05:59.104,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Another medical center, in Washington state,

138
0:06:02.068,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is piloting an application that allows

139
0:06:03.956,000 --> 0:06:06,000
medical images from city scanners and MRIs

140
0:06:07.049,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to be analyzed in the cloud,

141
0:06:09.164,000 --> 0:06:11,000
developing better analytics

142
0:06:11.801,000 --> 0:06:13,000
at a lower cost.

143
0:06:14.362,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Imagine a patient

144
0:06:15.986,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who has suffered a severe trauma,

145
0:06:17.42,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and needs the attention of several specialists:

146
0:06:20.175,000 --> 0:06:21,000
a neurologist, a cardiologist,

147
0:06:21.984,000 --> 0:06:22,000
an orthopedic surgeon.

148
0:06:23.595,000 --> 0:06:26,000
If all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access

149
0:06:26.921,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to scans and images as they are taken,

150
0:06:29.707,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.

151
0:06:34.405,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So all of this translates into better health outcomes,

152
0:06:37.483,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.

153
0:06:40.923,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies

154
0:06:44.409,000 --> 0:06:47,000
could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars

155
0:06:47.915,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to the healthcare industry worldwide,

156
0:06:50.712,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and that is just a drop in the sea

157
0:06:53.071,000 --> 0:06:55,000
compared to what we need to do to make healthcare

158
0:06:55.807,000 --> 0:06:57,000
affordable on a sustainable basis.

159
0:06:58.228,000 --> 0:07:,000
Similar advances are happening in energy,

160
0:07:00.486,000 --> 0:07:02,000
including renewable energy.

161
0:07:02.966,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics

162
0:07:07.659,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that allow wind turbines to talk to each other

163
0:07:10.254,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way,

164
0:07:14.103,000 --> 0:07:16,000
depending on how the wind is blowing,

165
0:07:16.222,000 --> 0:07:17,000
can now produce electricity at a cost

166
0:07:18.198,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.

167
0:07:21.376,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents,

168
0:07:23.393,000 --> 0:07:24,000
six times as much.

169
0:07:25.345,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The list goes on, and it will grow fast,

170
0:07:28.249,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because industrial data are now growing exponentially.

171
0:07:30.95,000 --> 0:07:32,000
By 2020, they will account for over 50 percent

172
0:07:33.802,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of all digital information.

173
0:07:36.03,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But this is not just about data, so let me switch gears

174
0:07:39.209,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and tell you how this is impacting already

175
0:07:42.05,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the jobs we do every day,

176
0:07:43.493,000 --> 0:07:44,000
because this new wave of innovation

177
0:07:45.214,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is bringing about new tools and applications

178
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that will allow us to collaborate

179
0:07:50.846,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in a smarter and faster way,

180
0:07:52.416,000 --> 0:07:55,000
making our jobs not just more efficient

181
0:07:55.549,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but more rewarding.

182
0:07:57.338,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm

183
0:08:00.242,000 --> 0:08:01,000
with a handheld device telling her

184
0:08:01.928,000 --> 0:08:03,000
which turbines need servicing.

185
0:08:04.226,000 --> 0:08:05,000
She already has all the spare parts,

186
0:08:05.704,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because the problems were diagnosed in advanced.

187
0:08:08.246,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And if she faces an unexpected issue,

188
0:08:10.72,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the same handheld device will allow her to

189
0:08:13.323,000 --> 0:08:15,000
communicate with colleagues at the service center,

190
0:08:15.831,000 --> 0:08:17,000
let them see what she sees,

191
0:08:17.931,000 --> 0:08:19,000
transmit data that they can run through diagnostics,

192
0:08:20.686,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and they can stream videos that will guide her,

193
0:08:22.983,000 --> 0:08:24,000
step by step, through whatever complex procedure

194
0:08:25.351,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is needed to get the machines back up and running.

195
0:08:27.813,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And their interaction gets documented

196
0:08:29.829,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and stored in a searchable database.

197
0:08:34.246,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Let's stop and think about this for a minute,

198
0:08:36.001,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because this is a very important point.

199
0:08:37.722,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This new wave of innovation is fundamentally

200
0:08:39.948,000 --> 0:08:41,000
changing the way we work.

201
0:08:42.427,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And I know that many of you will be concerned about the impact that innovation might have on jobs.

202
0:08:47.627,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Unemployment is already high,

203
0:08:49.124,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and there is always a fear that innovation will destroy jobs.

204
0:08:52.36,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And innovation is disruptive.

205
0:08:54.491,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But let me stress two things here.

206
0:08:56.944,000 --> 0:08:57,000
First, we've already lived through

207
0:08:58.875,000 --> 0:09:,000
mechanization of agriculture, automation of industry,

208
0:09:01.638,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and employment has gone up,

209
0:09:03.663,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because innovation is fundamentally about growth.

210
0:09:05.956,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It makes products more affordable.

211
0:09:07.849,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It creates new demand, new jobs.

212
0:09:10.509,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Second, there is a concern that in the future,

213
0:09:13.091,000 --> 0:09:15,000
there will only be room for engineers,

214
0:09:15.247,000 --> 0:09:18,000
data scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.

215
0:09:18.267,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.

216
0:09:21.836,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But think about it:

217
0:09:23.555,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Just as a child can easily figure out

218
0:09:26.174,000 --> 0:09:27,000
how to operate an iPad,

219
0:09:27.93,000 --> 0:09:29,000
so a new generation of mobile and intuitive

220
0:09:30.055,000 --> 0:09:32,000
industrial applications will make life easier

221
0:09:32.779,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for workers of all skill levels.

222
0:09:35.198,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man

223
0:09:38.4,000 --> 0:09:41,000
than the Charlie Chaplin of "Modern Times."

224
0:09:41.526,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:

225
0:09:44.57,000 --> 0:09:45,000
mechanical digital engineers who understand

226
0:09:46.446,000 --> 0:09:48,000
both the machines and the data;

227
0:09:48.578,000 --> 0:09:5,000
managers who understand their industry

228
0:09:50.861,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the analytics and can reorganize the business

229
0:09:53.722,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to take full advantage of the technology.

230
0:09:56.844,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But now let's take a step back.

231
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Let's look at the big picture.

232
0:10:01.204,000 --> 0:10:03,000
There are people who argue that today's innovation

233
0:10:03.627,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is all about social media and silly games,

234
0:10:05.976,000 --> 0:10:06,000
with nowhere near the transformational power

235
0:10:07.866,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of the Industrial Revolution.

236
0:10:09.945,000 --> 0:10:11,000
They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations

237
0:10:12.7,000 --> 0:10:13,000
are behind us.

238
0:10:14.126,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that

239
0:10:17.44,000 --> 0:10:18,000
even back in the Stone Age,

240
0:10:19.408,000 --> 0:10:21,000
there must have been a group of cavemen

241
0:10:21.697,000 --> 0:10:22,000
sitting around a fire one day

242
0:10:23.576,000 --> 0:10:24,000
looking very grumpy,

243
0:10:25.102,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen

244
0:10:27.828,000 --> 0:10:29,000
rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,

245
0:10:29.997,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and saying to each other,

246
0:10:31.806,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"Yeah, this wheel thing,

247
0:10:34.087,000 --> 0:10:36,000
cool toy, sure, but compared to fire,

248
0:10:36.878,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it will have no impact.

249
0:10:38.994,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The big discoveries are all behind us."

250
0:10:41.318,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

251
0:10:43.205,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This technological revolution

252
0:10:44.753,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is as inspiring and transformational

253
0:10:47.281,000 --> 0:10:49,000
as anything we have ever seen.

254
0:10:49.294,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward.

255
0:10:52.684,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They've created jobs.

256
0:10:54.131,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They've raised living standards.

257
0:10:55.52,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They've made our lives

258
0:10:57.323,000 --> 0:10:59,000
healthier and more rewarding.

259
0:10:59.383,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the new wave of innovation

260
0:11:00.626,000 --> 0:11:02,000
which is beginning to sweep through industry

261
0:11:02.976,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is no different.

262
0:11:04.598,000 --> 0:11:06,000
In the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet

263
0:11:06.614,000 --> 0:11:09,000
could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent

264
0:11:10.554,000 --> 0:11:11,000
over the next 15 years,

265
0:11:12.246,000 --> 0:11:14,000
boosting growth to rates we haven't seen in a long time,

266
0:11:14.915,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and adding between 10 and 15 trillion dollars to global GDP.

267
0:11:18.859,000 --> 0:11:22,000
That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.

268
0:11:23.112,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But this is not a foregone conclusion.

269
0:11:25.623,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We are just at the beginning of this transformation,

270
0:11:27.618,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and there will be barriers to break,

271
0:11:29.474,000 --> 0:11:3,000
obstacles to overcome.

272
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We will need to invest in the new technologies.

273
0:11:33.701,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices.

274
0:11:37.41,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We will need a robust cybersecurity approach

275
0:11:40.304,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that protects sensitive information and intellectual property

276
0:11:44.047,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks.

277
0:11:47.287,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And the education system will need to evolve

278
0:11:49.524,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to ensure students are equipped with the right skills.

279
0:11:52.732,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's not going to be easy,

280
0:11:54.467,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but it is going to be worth it.

281
0:11:57.114,000 --> 0:12:,000
The economic challenges facing us are hard,

282
0:12:00.662,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but when I walk the factory floor,

283
0:12:02.758,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and I see how humans and brilliant machines

284
0:12:05.346,000 --> 0:12:06,000
are becoming interconnected,

285
0:12:07.064,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and I see the difference this makes

286
0:12:09.138,000 --> 0:12:11,000
in a hospital, in an airport,

287
0:12:11.704,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic,

288
0:12:14.385,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I'm enthusiastic.

289
0:12:15.993,000 --> 0:12:18,000
This new technological revolution is upon us.

290
0:12:19.447,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So think about the future — it will be here soon enough.

291
0:12:22.641,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thank you.

292
0:12:25.326,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Applause)

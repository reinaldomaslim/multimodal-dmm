1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Our lives depend

2
0:00:14.28,000 --> 0:00:15,000
on a world we can't see.

3
0:00:16.92,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Think about your week so far.

4
0:00:18.96,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Have you watched TV, used GPS,

5
0:00:22.2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
checked the weather or even ate a meal?

6
0:00:25.72,000 --> 0:00:27,000
These many things that enable our daily lives

7
0:00:28.44,000 --> 0:00:3,000
rely either directly or indirectly

8
0:00:31.32,000 --> 0:00:32,000
on satellites.

9
0:00:33.04,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And while we often take for granted

10
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the services that satellites provide us,

11
0:00:37.56,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the satellites themselves deserve our attention

12
0:00:40.4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
as they are leaving a lasting mark

13
0:00:42.4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
on the space they occupy.

14
0:00:44.72,000 --> 0:00:47,000
People around the world rely on satellite infrastructure every day

15
0:00:48.36,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for information, entertainment and to communicate.

16
0:00:52.44,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There's agricultural and environmental monitoring,

17
0:00:55.32,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Internet connectivity, navigation.

18
0:00:58.4,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Satellites even play a role

19
0:01:00.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in the operation of our financial and energy markets.

20
0:01:04.12,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But these satellites that we rely on

21
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
day in and day out

22
0:01:07.72,000 --> 0:01:08,000
have a finite life.

23
0:01:09.4,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They might run out of propellant,

24
0:01:11.32,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they could malfunction,

25
0:01:12.88,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or they may just naturally reach the end of their mission life.

26
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:2,000
At this point, these satellites effectively become space junk,

27
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
cluttering the orbital environment.

28
0:01:23.84,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So imagine you're driving down the highway on a beautiful, sunny day

29
0:01:27.48,000 --> 0:01:28,000
out running errands.

30
0:01:28.92,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You've got your music cranked,

31
0:01:30.6,000 --> 0:01:31,000
your windows rolled down,

32
0:01:32.08,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with the cool breeze blowing through your hair.

33
0:01:34.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Feels nice, right?

34
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Everything is going smoothly

35
0:01:39.04,000 --> 0:01:41,000
until suddenly your car stutters and stalls

36
0:01:41.72,000 --> 0:01:42,000
right in the middle of the highway.

37
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So now you have no choice but to abandon your car

38
0:01:47.48,000 --> 0:01:48,000
where it is on the highway.

39
0:01:50.2,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Maybe you were lucky enough

40
0:01:51.56,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to be able to move it out of the way and into a shoulder lane

41
0:01:54.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
so that it's out of the way of other traffic.

42
0:01:56.64,000 --> 0:01:57,000
A couple of hours ago,

43
0:01:57.92,000 --> 0:02:01,000
your car was a useful machine that you relied on in your everyday life.

44
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now, it's a useless hunk of metal

45
0:02:05.56,000 --> 0:02:08,000
taking up space in a valuable transportation network.

46
0:02:09.92,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And imagine international roadways all cluttered with broken down vehicles

47
0:02:14.12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that are just getting in the way of other traffic.

48
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And imagine the debris that would be strewn everywhere

49
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
if a collision actually happened,

50
0:02:22.4,000 --> 0:02:24,000
thousands of smaller pieces of debris

51
0:02:24.8,000 --> 0:02:25,000
becoming new obstacles.

52
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is the paradigm of the satellite industry.

53
0:02:31.28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Satellites that are no longer working

54
0:02:33.44,000 --> 0:02:36,000
are often left to deorbit over many, many years,

55
0:02:37.28,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or only moved out of the way as a temporary solution.

56
0:02:40.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And there are no international laws in space

57
0:02:43.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to enforce us to clean up after ourselves.

58
0:02:46.68,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,

59
0:02:48.96,000 --> 0:02:5,000
was launched in 1957,

60
0:02:51.24,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and in that year, there were only a total of three launch attempts.

61
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Decades later and dozens of countries from all around the world

62
0:02:59.08,000 --> 0:03:02,000
have launched thousands of more satellites into orbit,

63
0:03:02.48,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and the frequency of launches is only going to increase in the future,

64
0:03:06.24,000 --> 0:03:08,000
especially if you consider things like the possibility

65
0:03:08.84,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of 900-plus satellite constellations being launched.

66
0:03:13.56,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, we send satellites to different orbits

67
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:17,000
depending on what they're needed for.

68
0:03:17.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
One of the most common places we send satellites

69
0:03:20.08,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is the low Earth orbit,

70
0:03:21.68,000 --> 0:03:22,000
possibly to image the surface of Earth

71
0:03:23.68,000 --> 0:03:25,000
at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.

72
0:03:26.72,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Satellites there are naturally buffeted by Earth's atmosphere,

73
0:03:30.2,000 --> 0:03:31,000
so their orbits naturally decay,

74
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and they'll eventually burn up,

75
0:03:33.72,000 --> 0:03:34,000
probably within a couple of decades.

76
0:03:36.44,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Another common place we send satellites

77
0:03:38.56,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is the geostationary orbit

78
0:03:40.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.

79
0:03:43.32,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Satellites there remain in the same place above Earth as the Earth rotates,

80
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which enables things like communications or television broadcast, for example.

81
0:03:52.44,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Satellites in high orbits like these could remain there for centuries.

82
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
And then there's the orbit coined "the graveyard,"

83
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the ominous junk or disposal orbits,

84
0:04:03.8,000 --> 0:04:05,000
where some satellites are intentionally placed

85
0:04:06.68,000 --> 0:04:07,000
at the end of their life

86
0:04:07.92,000 --> 0:04:1,000
so that they're out of the way of common operational orbits.

87
0:04:12.8,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Of the nearly 7,000 satellites launched since the late 1950s,

88
0:04:17.4,000 --> 0:04:2,000
only about one in seven is currently operational,

89
0:04:21.36,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and in addition to the satellites that are no longer working,

90
0:04:24.28,000 --> 0:04:27,000
there's also hundreds of thousands of marble-sized debris

91
0:04:27.8,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and millions of paint chip-sized debris

92
0:04:30.24,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that are also orbiting around the Earth.

93
0:04:32.88,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Space debris is a major risk to space missions,

94
0:04:35.68,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but also to the satellites that we rely on each and every day.

95
0:04:40.52,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, because space debris and junk has become increasingly worrisome,

96
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:45,000
there have been some national and international efforts

97
0:04:46.6,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to develop technical standards

98
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to help us limit the generation of additional debris.

99
0:04:51.48,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So for example, there are recommendations

100
0:04:53.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft

101
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to be made to deorbit in under 25 years,

102
0:04:59.32,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but that's still a really long time,

103
0:05:01.44,000 --> 0:05:04,000
especially if a satellite hasn't been working for years.

104
0:05:05.32,000 --> 0:05:08,000
There's also mandates for those dead geostationary spacecraft

105
0:05:08.4,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to be moved into a graveyard orbit.

106
0:05:11.48,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But neither of these guidelines is binding under international law,

107
0:05:15.2,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and the understanding is that they will be implemented through national mechanisms.

108
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
These guidelines are also not long-term,

109
0:05:22.48,000 --> 0:05:23,000
they're not proactive,

110
0:05:23.92,000 --> 0:05:26,000
nor do they address the debris that's already up there.

111
0:05:27.28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They're only in place to limit the future creation of debris.

112
0:05:31.68,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Space junk is no one's responsibility.

113
0:05:35.68,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now, Mount Everest is actually an interesting comparison

114
0:05:38.56,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of a new approach to how we interact with our environments,

115
0:05:41.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
as it's often given the dubious honor

116
0:05:44.12,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of being the world's highest garbage dump.

117
0:05:48.04,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Decades after the first conquest of the world's highest peak,

118
0:05:51.32,000 --> 0:05:53,000
tons of rubbish left behind by climbers

119
0:05:53.6,000 --> 0:05:54,000
has started to raise concern,

120
0:05:55.56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and you may have read in the news that there's speculation

121
0:05:58.32,000 --> 0:06:,000
that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers

122
0:06:00.4,000 --> 0:06:03,000
with stricter enforcement of penalties and legal obligations.

123
0:06:04.6,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The goal, of course, is to persuade climbers

124
0:06:07.04,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to clean up after themselves,

125
0:06:09.24,000 --> 0:06:13,000
so maybe local not-for-profits will pay climbers who bring down extra waste,

126
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or expeditions might organize voluntary cleanup trips.

127
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And yet still many climbers feel

128
0:06:20.4,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that independent groups should police themselves.

129
0:06:24.12,000 --> 0:06:26,000
There's no simple or easy answer,

130
0:06:26.96,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and even well-intentioned efforts at conservation

131
0:06:30.04,000 --> 0:06:31,000
often run into problems.

132
0:06:32.32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do everything in our power

133
0:06:35.44,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to protect the environments that we rely and depend on,

134
0:06:39.44,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and like Everest, the remote location and inadequate infrastructure

135
0:06:43.48,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of the orbital environment

136
0:06:44.92,000 --> 0:06:46,000
make waste disposal a challenging problem.

137
0:06:47.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But we simply cannot reach new heights

138
0:06:50.48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and create an even higher garbage dump,

139
0:06:53.56,000 --> 0:06:55,000
one that's out of this world.

140
0:06:57.28,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The reality of space

141
0:06:58.52,000 --> 0:07:,000
is that if a component on a satellite breaks down,

142
0:07:01.12,000 --> 0:07:03,000
there really are limited opportunities for repairs,

143
0:07:04.04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and only at great cost.

144
0:07:06.76,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But what if we were smarter about how we designed satellites?

145
0:07:10.28,000 --> 0:07:11,000
What if all satellites,

146
0:07:11.6,000 --> 0:07:13,000
regardless of what country they were built in,

147
0:07:13.92,000 --> 0:07:14,000
had to be standardized in some way

148
0:07:15.84,000 --> 0:07:17,000
for recycling, servicing

149
0:07:18.4,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or active deorbiting?

150
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What if there actually were international laws with teeth

151
0:07:24.12,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that enforced end-of-life disposal of satellites

152
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:28,000
instead of moving them out of the way

153
0:07:29.08,000 --> 0:07:3,000
as a temporary solution?

154
0:07:31.56,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Or maybe satellite manufacturers need to be charged a deposit

155
0:07:34.52,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to even launch a satellite into orbit,

156
0:07:36.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and that deposit would only be returned

157
0:07:39.32,000 --> 0:07:41,000
if the satellite was disposed of properly

158
0:07:41.88,000 --> 0:07:43,000
or if they cleaned up some quota of debris.

159
0:07:45.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Or maybe a satellite needs to have technology on board

160
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to help accelerate deorbit.

161
0:07:50.72,000 --> 0:07:52,000
There are some encouraging signs.

162
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The UK's TechDemoSat-1, launched in 2014, for example,

163
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:07:58,000
was designed for end-of-life disposal

164
0:07:59.68,000 --> 0:08:,000
via a small drag sail.

165
0:08:01.64,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This works for the satellite because it's small,

166
0:08:04.24,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but satellites that are higher or in larger orbits

167
0:08:07.96,000 --> 0:08:09,000
or are larger altogether, like the size of school buses,

168
0:08:10.84,000 --> 0:08:12,000
will require other disposal options.

169
0:08:13.28,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So maybe you get into things like high-powered lasers

170
0:08:16.28,000 --> 0:08:17,000
or tugging using nets or tethers,

171
0:08:18.12,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as crazy as those sound in the short term.

172
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And then one really cool possibility

173
0:08:23.08,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is the idea of orbital tow trucks or space mechanics.

174
0:08:26.84,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Imagine if a robotic arm

175
0:08:28.48,000 --> 0:08:29,000
on some sort of space tow truck

176
0:08:30.36,000 --> 0:08:32,000
could fix the broken components on a satellite,

177
0:08:32.68,000 --> 0:08:33,000
making them usable again.

178
0:08:35.24,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Or what if that very same robotic arm

179
0:08:37.2,000 --> 0:08:39,000
could refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft

180
0:08:39.56,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that relies on chemical propulsion

181
0:08:41.56,000 --> 0:08:44,000
just like you or I would refuel the fuel tanks on our cars?

182
0:08:45.559,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Robotic repair and maintenance

183
0:08:47.24,000 --> 0:08:5,000
could extend the lives of hundreds of satellites orbiting around the Earth.

184
0:08:52.28,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Whatever the disposal or cleanup options we come up with,

185
0:08:55.2,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it's clearly not just a technical problem.

186
0:08:58.2,000 --> 0:09:03,000
There's also complex space laws and politics that we have to sort out.

187
0:09:03.28,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Simply put, we haven't found a way to use space sustainably yet.

188
0:09:08.72,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Exploring, innovating to change the way we live and work

189
0:09:11.64,000 --> 0:09:12,000
are what we as humans do,

190
0:09:13.64,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and in space exploration,

191
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we're literally moving beyond the boundaries of Earth.

192
0:09:18.44,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But as we push thresholds in the name of learning and innovation,

193
0:09:22.12,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we must remember that accountability for our environments never goes away.

194
0:09:28.52,000 --> 0:09:32,000
There is without doubt congestion in the low Earth and geostationary orbits,

195
0:09:32.72,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and we cannot keep launching new satellites

196
0:09:35.08,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to replace the ones that have broken down

197
0:09:37.4,000 --> 0:09:39,000
without doing something about them first,

198
0:09:39.48,000 --> 0:09:41,000
just like we would never leave a broken down car

199
0:09:41.96,000 --> 0:09:42,000
in the middle of the highway.

200
0:09:43.76,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Next time you use your phone,

201
0:09:45.36,000 --> 0:09:47,000
check the weather or use your GPS,

202
0:09:47.88,000 --> 0:09:51,000
think about the satellite technologies that make those activities possible.

203
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But also think about the very impact

204
0:09:54.04,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that the satellites have on the environment surrounding Earth,

205
0:09:57.36,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact.

206
0:10:02.08,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful

207
0:10:04.64,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and our gateway to exploration.

208
0:10:07.24,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's up to us to keep it that way.

209
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Thank you.

210
0:10:12.4,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.733,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Father Daniel Berrigan once said that "writing about prisoners

2
0:00:16.921,000 --> 0:00:18,000
is a little like writing about the dead."

3
0:00:19.72,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts.

4
0:00:22.934,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They're unseen and unheard.

5
0:00:25.681,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's easy to simply ignore them

6
0:00:27.341,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and it's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden.

7
0:00:31.754,000 --> 0:00:33,000
As a journalist, I think these stories

8
0:00:33.993,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of what people in power do when no one is watching,

9
0:00:37.065,000 --> 0:00:39,000
are precisely the stories that we need to tell.

10
0:00:40.058,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That's why I began investigating

11
0:00:41.621,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the most secretive and experimental prison units in the United States,

12
0:00:45.432,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for so-called "second-tier" terrorists.

13
0:00:49.322,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The government calls these units Communications Management Units or CMUs.

14
0:00:54.858,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Prisoners and guards call them "Little Guantanamo."

15
0:00:58.886,000 --> 0:01:,000
They are islands unto themselves.

16
0:01:01.203,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But unlike Gitmo they exist right here, at home,

17
0:01:05.574,000 --> 0:01:07,000
floating within larger federal prisons.

18
0:01:09.305,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There are 2 CMUs.

19
0:01:10.953,000 --> 0:01:13,000
One was opened inside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana,

20
0:01:14.097,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and the other is inside this prison, in Marion, Illinois.

21
0:01:18.669,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Neither of them underwent the formal review process

22
0:01:21.118,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that is required by law when they were opened.

23
0:01:25.232,000 --> 0:01:27,000
CMU prisoners have all been convicted of crimes.

24
0:01:28.053,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence.

25
0:01:33.11,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner.

26
0:01:36.388,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said,

27
0:01:39.947,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"When the prisons and gates slam shut,

28
0:01:42.428,000 --> 0:01:44,000
prisoners do not lose their human quality."

29
0:01:46.515,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Every prisoner I've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light

30
0:01:51.206,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in the darkness of prison:

31
0:01:53.664,000 --> 0:01:54,000
phone calls,

32
0:01:54.886,000 --> 0:01:55,000
letters

33
0:01:56.061,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and visits from family.

34
0:01:58.166,000 --> 0:02:01,000
CMUs aren't solitary confinement, but they radically restrict all of these

35
0:02:02.093,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States.

36
0:02:06.496,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Their phone calls can be limited to 45 minutes a month,

37
0:02:09.801,000 --> 0:02:12,000
compared to the 300 minutes other prisoners receive.

38
0:02:14.345,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Their letters can be limited to six pieces of paper.

39
0:02:17.516,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Their visits can be limited to four hours per month,

40
0:02:19.971,000 --> 0:02:24,000
compared to the 35 hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph

41
0:02:25.701,000 --> 0:02:26,000
receive in the supermax.

42
0:02:28.215,000 --> 0:02:32,000
On top of that, CMU visits are non-contact which means prisoners are not allowed

43
0:02:33.227,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to even hug their family.

44
0:02:36.093,000 --> 0:02:37,000
As one CMU prisoner said,

45
0:02:38.043,000 --> 0:02:41,000
"We're not being tortured here, except psychologically."

46
0:02:42.893,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The government won't say who is imprisoned here.

47
0:02:45.75,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But through court documents, open records requests

48
0:02:49.401,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and interviews with current and former prisoners,

49
0:02:51.983,000 --> 0:02:54,000
some small windows into the CMUs have opened.

50
0:02:56.005,000 --> 0:02:59,000
There's an estimated 60 to 70 prisoners here,

51
0:02:59.111,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and they're overwhelmingly Muslim.

52
0:03:01.825,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir,

53
0:03:05.017,000 --> 0:03:09,000
who violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by sending medical supplies

54
0:03:09.065,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for the children there.

55
0:03:11.967,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They've included people like Yassin Aref.

56
0:03:14.892,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Aref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.

57
0:03:20.094,000 --> 0:03:23,000
He was arrested in 2004 as part of an FBI sting.

58
0:03:24.784,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Aref is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan,

59
0:03:28.282,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which is a tradition in Islamic culture.

60
0:03:30.703,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist

61
0:03:34.543,000 --> 0:03:36,000
someone else in a fake attack.

62
0:03:37.452,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Aref didn't know.

63
0:03:39.561,000 --> 0:03:4,000
For that, he was convicted

64
0:03:40.855,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group.

65
0:03:46.309,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The CMUs also include some non-Muslim prisoners.

66
0:03:49.563,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The guards call them "balancers,"

67
0:03:52.39,000 --> 0:03:54,000
meaning they help balance out the racial numbers,

68
0:03:55.278,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in hopes of deflecting law suits.

69
0:03:58.223,000 --> 0:04:01,000
These balancers include animal rights and environmental activists

70
0:04:01.889,000 --> 0:04:02,000
like Daniel McGowan.

71
0:04:03.643,000 --> 0:04:05,000
McGowan was convicted of participating in two arsons

72
0:04:06.453,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the name of defending the environment

73
0:04:08.589,000 --> 0:04:1,000
as part of the Earth Liberation Front.

74
0:04:11.69,000 --> 0:04:13,000
During his sentencing, he was afraid that he would be sent

75
0:04:14.462,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to a rumored secret prison for terrorists.

76
0:04:17.56,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The judge dismissed all those fears,

77
0:04:19.448,000 --> 0:04:21,000
saying that they weren't supported by any facts.

78
0:04:22.606,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But that might be because the government hasn't fully explained

79
0:04:25.885,000 --> 0:04:27,000
why some prisoners end up in a CMU,

80
0:04:28.311,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and who is responsible for these decisions.

81
0:04:32.142,000 --> 0:04:34,000
When McGowan was transferred, he was told

82
0:04:34.201,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it's because he is a "domestic terrorist,"

83
0:04:37.627,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a term the FBI uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists.

84
0:04:42.978,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, keep in mind there are about 400 prisoners in US prisons

85
0:04:46.773,000 --> 0:04:47,000
who are classified as terrorists,

86
0:04:48.56,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and only a handful of them are in the CMUs.

87
0:04:51.169,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In McGowan's case, he was previously at a low-security prison

88
0:04:54.816,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and he had no communications violations.

89
0:04:59.354,000 --> 0:05:,000
So, why was he moved?

90
0:05:02.173,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Like other CMU prisoners,

91
0:05:03.534,000 --> 0:05:06,000
McGowan repeatedly asked for an answer, a hearing,

92
0:05:07.448,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or some opportunity for an appeal.

93
0:05:10.434,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed.

94
0:05:15.241,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Wants a transfer." "Told him no."

95
0:05:19.366,000 --> 0:05:22,000
At one point, the prison warden himself recommended McGowan's transfer

96
0:05:23.117,000 --> 0:05:26,000
out of the CMU citing his good behavior,

97
0:05:26.414,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but the warden was overruled

98
0:05:28.479,000 --> 0:05:31,000
by the Bureau of Prison's Counterterrorism Unit,

99
0:05:31.717,000 --> 0:05:33,000
working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI.

100
0:05:35.571,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Later I found out that McGowan was really sent to a CMU

101
0:05:38.211,000 --> 0:05:39,000
not because of what he did,

102
0:05:40.154,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but what he has said.

103
0:05:42.149,000 --> 0:05:47,000
A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit cited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs."

104
0:05:48.333,000 --> 0:05:51,000
While imprisoned, he continued writing about environmental issues,

105
0:05:51.868,000 --> 0:05:53,000
saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes

106
0:05:54.71,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and listen to each other.

107
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, in fairness, if you've spent any time at all in Washington, DC,

108
0:06:00.045,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you know this is really a radical concept for the government.

109
0:06:04.408,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:06.809,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU.

111
0:06:10.328,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I was approved.

112
0:06:12.46,000 --> 0:06:14,000
That came as quite a shock.

113
0:06:14.578,000 --> 0:06:19,000
First, because as I've discussed on this stage before,

114
0:06:19.603,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I learned that the FBI has been monitoring my work.

115
0:06:23.43,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Second, because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a CMU.

116
0:06:29.189,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I had even learned

117
0:06:30.371,000 --> 0:06:33,000
through the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit,

118
0:06:33.601,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs, like this one.

119
0:06:39.128,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So how could I possibly be approved to visit?

120
0:06:43.222,000 --> 0:06:47,000
A few days before I went out to the prison, I got an answer.

121
0:06:48.471,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I was allowed to visit McGowan as a friend, not a journalist.

122
0:06:52.86,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Journalists are not allowed here.

123
0:06:54.972,000 --> 0:06:57,000
McGowan was told by CMU officials that if I asked any questions

124
0:06:58.541,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or published any story,

125
0:07:00.484,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that he would be punished for my reporting.

126
0:07:04.308,000 --> 0:07:06,000
When I arrived for our visit, the guards reminded me

127
0:07:06.796,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that they knew who I was and knew about my work.

128
0:07:09.094,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And they said that if I attempted to interview McGowan,

129
0:07:11.698,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the visit would be terminated.

130
0:07:14.671,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs as "self-contained housing units."

131
0:07:20.515,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes.

132
0:07:24.805,000 --> 0:07:25,000
When you visit a CMU,

133
0:07:25.981,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect.

134
0:07:29.131,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But then the walk to the visitation room is silent.

135
0:07:33.756,000 --> 0:07:37,000
When a CMU prisoner has a visit, the rest of the prison is on lockdown.

136
0:07:39.112,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I was ushered into a small room,

137
0:07:40.962,000 --> 0:07:43,000
so small my outstretched arms could touch each wall.

138
0:07:44.761,000 --> 0:07:46,000
There was a grapefruit-sized orb in the ceiling

139
0:07:47.58,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for the visit to be live-monitored by the Counterterrorism Unit

140
0:07:50.779,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in West Virginia.

141
0:07:52.64,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The unit insists that all the visits have to be in English for CMU prisoners,

142
0:07:57.023,000 --> 0:08:,000
which is an additional hardship for many of the Muslim families.

143
0:08:00.634,000 --> 0:08:03,000
There is a thick sheet of foggy, bulletproof glass

144
0:08:04.04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and on the other side was Daniel McGowan.

145
0:08:08.104,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We spoke through these handsets attached to the wall

146
0:08:10.986,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and talked about books and movies.

147
0:08:13.334,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We did our best to find reasons to laugh.

148
0:08:16.554,000 --> 0:08:19,000
To fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU,

149
0:08:19.745,000 --> 0:08:23,000
McGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president

150
0:08:23.849,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC

151
0:08:27.844,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:29.836,000 --> 0:08:31,000
For the record, I'm not.

153
0:08:32.209,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:33.754,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward

155
0:08:37.376,000 --> 0:08:39,000
are terrorist code names.

156
0:08:39.546,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

157
0:08:42.073,000 --> 0:08:48,000
During our visit, McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily,

158
0:08:48.539,000 --> 0:08:54,000
his wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them,

159
0:08:54.687,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to never be able to hold their hands.

160
0:08:58.227,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Three months after our visit, McGowan was transferred out of the CMU

161
0:09:01.774,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and then, without warning, he was sent back again.

162
0:09:05.956,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I had published leaked CMU documents on my website

163
0:09:10.22,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife

164
0:09:13.465,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and asked her to mail them.

165
0:09:16.307,000 --> 0:09:18,000
He wanted to see what the government was saying about him,

166
0:09:19.064,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and for that he was sent back to the CMU.

167
0:09:21.982,000 --> 0:09:23,000
When he was finally released at the end of his sentence,

168
0:09:24.656,000 --> 0:09:26,000
his story got even more Kafkaesque.

169
0:09:27.434,000 --> 0:09:29,000
He wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined,

170
0:09:29.998,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech."

171
0:09:34.122,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech.

172
0:09:40.923,000 --> 0:09:42,000
His attorneys quickly secured his release,

173
0:09:42.98,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but the message was very clear:

174
0:09:45.602,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Don't talk about this place.

175
0:09:48.472,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Today, nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration,

176
0:09:53.089,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the government is codifying how and why CMUs were created.

177
0:09:57.706,000 --> 0:09:58,000
According to the Bureau of Prisons,

178
0:09:59.402,000 --> 0:10:02,000
they are for prisoners with "inspirational significance."

179
0:10:04.325,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I think that is very nice way of saying these are political prisons

180
0:10:08.553,000 --> 0:10:09,000
for political prisoners.

181
0:10:10.764,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Prisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race,

182
0:10:13.544,000 --> 0:10:15,000
their religion or their political beliefs.

183
0:10:16.77,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Now, if you think that characterization is too strong,

184
0:10:19.615,000 --> 0:10:21,000
just look at some of the government's own documents.

185
0:10:22.456,000 --> 0:10:26,000
When some of McGowan's mail was rejected by the CMU, the sender was told

186
0:10:26.996,000 --> 0:10:29,000
it's because the letters were intended "for political prisoners."

187
0:10:31.41,000 --> 0:10:34,000
When another prisoner, animal rights activist Andy Stepanian,

188
0:10:35.252,000 --> 0:10:4,000
was sent to a CMU, it was because of his anti-government and anti-corporate views.

189
0:10:41.722,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Now, I know all of this may be hard to believe,

190
0:10:44.716,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that it's happening right now, and in the United States.

191
0:10:49.159,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history

192
0:10:52.819,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs.

193
0:10:57.67,000 --> 0:11:01,000
In the 1960s, before Marion was home to the CMU,

194
0:11:02.14,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it was home to the notorious Control Unit.

195
0:11:05.574,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Prisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day.

196
0:11:10.24,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The warden said the unit was to "control revolutionary attitudes."

197
0:11:16.846,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In the 1980s, another experiment called the Lexington High Security Unit

198
0:11:21.817,000 --> 0:11:23,000
held women connected to the Weather Underground,

199
0:11:24.269,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Black Liberation and Puerto Rican independent struggles.

200
0:11:27.987,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation,

201
0:11:32.257,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and constant light for so-called "ideological conversion."

202
0:11:37.976,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Those prisons were eventually shut down, but only through the campaigning

203
0:11:43.092,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of religious groups and human rights advocates, like Amnesty International.

204
0:11:48.398,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Today, civil rights lawyers with the Center for Constitutional Rights

205
0:11:52.348,000 --> 0:11:54,000
are challenging CMUs in court

206
0:11:54.751,000 --> 0:11:56,000
for depriving prisoners of their due process rights

207
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and for retaliating against them

208
0:11:59.434,000 --> 0:12:02,000
for their protected political and religious speech.

209
0:12:03.296,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Many of these documents would have never come to light without this lawsuit.

210
0:12:08.398,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The message of these groups and my message for you today

211
0:12:13.053,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners.

212
0:12:16.833,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls.

213
0:12:22.339,000 --> 0:12:24,000
This story is not just about prisoners.

214
0:12:24.979,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It is about us.

215
0:12:27.027,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It is about our own commitment to human rights.

216
0:12:29.798,000 --> 0:12:33,000
It is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past.

217
0:12:35.077,000 --> 0:12:4,000
If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan described as the stories of the dead,

218
0:12:40.133,000 --> 0:12:42,000
they will soon become the stories of ourselves.

219
0:12:42.9,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Thank you.

220
0:12:44.074,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Applause)

221
0:12:51.437,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Applause ends)

222
0:12:53.849,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Tom Rielly: I have a couple questions.

223
0:12:55.708,000 --> 0:12:58,000
When I was in high school, I learned about the Bill of Rights,

224
0:12:59.66,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the Constitution, freedom of speech,

225
0:13:02.58,000 --> 0:13:06,000
due process and about 25 other laws and rights

226
0:13:07.137,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that seem to be violated by this.

227
0:13:09.706,000 --> 0:13:11,000
How could this possibly be happening?

228
0:13:12.434,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Will Potter: I think that's the number one question I get

229
0:13:15.149,000 --> 0:13:16,000
throughout all of my work,

230
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and the short answer is that people don't know.

231
0:13:20.809,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I think the solution to any of these types of situations, any rights abuses,

232
0:13:24.724,000 --> 0:13:25,000
are really dependent on two things.

233
0:13:26.441,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They're dependent on knowledge that it's actually happening

234
0:13:29.261,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and then a means and efficacy to actually make a change.

235
0:13:33.567,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And unfortunately with these prisoners,

236
0:13:35.988,000 --> 0:13:37,000
one, people don't know what's happening at all

237
0:13:38.587,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and then they're already disenfranchised populations

238
0:13:41.199,000 --> 0:13:45,000
who don't have access to attorneys, not native English speakers.

239
0:13:45.255,000 --> 0:13:48,000
In some of these cases, they have great representation that I mentioned,

240
0:13:48.689,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but there's just not a public awareness of what's happening.

241
0:13:51.775,000 --> 0:13:54,000
TR: Isn't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council

242
0:13:54.839,000 --> 0:13:55,000
or access to council?

243
0:13:56.404,000 --> 0:13:57,000
WP: There's a tendency in our culture

244
0:13:58.21,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to see when people have been convicted of a crime,

245
0:14:01.344,000 --> 0:14:03,000
no matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate,

246
0:14:03.726,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that whatever happens to them after that is warranted.

247
0:14:06.716,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have,

248
0:14:10.234,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that allows these types of things to happen,

249
0:14:12.718,000 --> 0:14:15,000
as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it.

250
0:14:16.145,000 --> 0:14:2,000
TR: All those documents on screen were all real documents, word for word,

251
0:14:21.105,000 --> 0:14:23,000
unchanged at all, right?

252
0:14:23.178,000 --> 0:14:26,000
WP: Absolutely. I've actually uploaded all of them to my website.

253
0:14:26.538,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It's willpotter.com/CMU and it's a footnoted version of the talk,

254
0:14:31.439,000 --> 0:14:34,000
so you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets.

255
0:14:34.781,000 --> 0:14:35,000
You can see the full version.

256
0:14:36.193,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents

257
0:14:39.162,000 --> 0:14:42,000
or on primary interviews with former and current prisoners,

258
0:14:42.502,000 --> 0:14:44,000
with people that are dealing with this situation every day.

259
0:14:45.312,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And like I said, I've been there myself, as well.

260
0:14:47.654,000 --> 0:14:48,000
TR: You're doing courageous work.

261
0:14:49.384,000 --> 0:14:51,000
WP: Thank you very much. Thank you all.

262
0:14:51.564,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Applause)

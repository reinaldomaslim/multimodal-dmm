1
0:00:13.098,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The story that I'm going to tell you today,

2
0:00:15.123,000 --> 0:00:16,000
for me, began back in 2006.

3
0:00:17.422,000 --> 0:00:2,000
That was when I first heard about an outbreak of mysterious illness

4
0:00:21.154,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that was happening in the Amazon rainforest of Peru.

5
0:00:24.947,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The people that were getting sick from this illness,

6
0:00:27.4,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they had horrifying symptoms, nightmarish.

7
0:00:29.969,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They had unbelievable headaches,

8
0:00:31.523,000 --> 0:00:32,000
they couldn't eat or drink.

9
0:00:33.147,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Some of them were even hallucinating --

10
0:00:35.091,000 --> 0:00:36,000
confused and aggressive.

11
0:00:36.953,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The most tragic part of all

12
0:00:39.232,000 --> 0:00:41,000
was that many of the victims were children.

13
0:00:41.436,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And of all of those that got sick,

14
0:00:43.705,000 --> 0:00:44,000
none survived.

15
0:00:46.587,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It turned out that what was killing people was a virus,

16
0:00:49.383,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but it wasn't Ebola, it wasn't Zika,

17
0:00:51.612,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it wasn't even some new virus never before seen by science.

18
0:00:55.848,000 --> 0:00:57,000
These people were dying of an ancient killer,

19
0:00:57.999,000 --> 0:00:59,000
one that we've known about for centuries.

20
0:01:00.492,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They were dying of rabies.

21
0:01:02.807,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And what all of them had in common was that as they slept,

22
0:01:06.361,000 --> 0:01:1,000
they'd all been bitten by the only mammal that lives exclusively on a diet of blood:

23
0:01:10.606,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the vampire bat.

24
0:01:13.073,000 --> 0:01:16,000
These sorts of outbreaks that jump from bats into people,

25
0:01:16.275,000 --> 0:01:19,000
they've become more and more common in the last couple of decades.

26
0:01:19.433,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In 2003, it was SARS.

27
0:01:20.977,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It showed up in Chinese animal markets and spread globally.

28
0:01:24.462,000 --> 0:01:28,000
That virus, like the one from Peru, was eventually traced back to bats,

29
0:01:28.551,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which have probably harbored it, undetected, for centuries.

30
0:01:32.249,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Then, 10 years later, we see Ebola showing up in West Africa,

31
0:01:36.587,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and that surprised just about everybody

32
0:01:38.536,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because, according to the science at the time,

33
0:01:40.727,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Ebola wasn't really supposed to be in West Africa.

34
0:01:44.115,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That ended up causing the largest and most widespread Ebola outbreak

35
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in history.

36
0:01:49.697,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So there's a disturbing trend here, right?

37
0:01:52.169,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Deadly viruses are appearing in places where we can't really expect them,

38
0:01:56.271,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and as a global health community,

39
0:01:57.888,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we're caught on our heels.

40
0:01:59.428,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We're constantly chasing after the next viral emergency

41
0:02:02.105,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in this perpetual cycle,

42
0:02:04.355,000 --> 0:02:07,000
always trying to extinguish epidemics after they've already started.

43
0:02:08.36,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So with new diseases appearing every year,

44
0:02:11.241,000 --> 0:02:12,000
now is really the time

45
0:02:13.073,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that we need to start thinking about what we can do about it.

46
0:02:15.981,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If we just wait for the next Ebola to happen,

47
0:02:18.134,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we might not be so lucky next time.

48
0:02:20.427,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We might face a different virus,

49
0:02:22.097,000 --> 0:02:23,000
one that's more deadly,

50
0:02:23.5,000 --> 0:02:25,000
one that spreads better among people,

51
0:02:26.053,000 --> 0:02:29,000
or maybe one that just completely outwits our vaccines,

52
0:02:29.237,000 --> 0:02:3,000
leaving us defenseless.

53
0:02:31.706,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So can we anticipate pandemics?

54
0:02:34.683,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Can we stop them?

55
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Those are really hard questions to answer,

56
0:02:39.626,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and the reason is that the pandemics --

57
0:02:42.209,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the ones that spread globally,

58
0:02:44.004,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the ones that we really want to anticipate --

59
0:02:46.183,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they're actually really rare events.

60
0:02:48.266,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And for us as a species that is a good thing --

61
0:02:50.678,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that's why we're all here.

62
0:02:53.241,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But from a scientific standpoint, it's a little bit of a problem.

63
0:02:58.783,000 --> 0:03:,000
That's because if something happens just once or twice,

64
0:03:01.417,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that's really not enough to find any patterns.

65
0:03:03.599,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Patterns that could tell us when or where the next pandemic might strike.

66
0:03:08.131,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So what do we do?

67
0:03:10.186,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Well, I think one of the solutions we may have is to study some viruses

68
0:03:14.897,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that routinely jump from wild animals into people,

69
0:03:18.501,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or into our pets, or our livestock,

70
0:03:21.519,000 --> 0:03:23,000
even if they're not the same viruses

71
0:03:23.643,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that we think are going to cause pandemics.

72
0:03:26.449,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If we can use those everyday killer viruses

73
0:03:28.891,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to work out some of the patterns

74
0:03:30.507,000 --> 0:03:33,000
of what drives that initial, crucial jump from one species to the next,

75
0:03:34.466,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and, potentially, how we might stop it,

76
0:03:36.734,000 --> 0:03:38,000
then we're going to end up better prepared

77
0:03:38.78,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for those viruses that jump between species more rarely

78
0:03:41.655,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but pose a greater threat of pandemics.

79
0:03:44.486,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now, rabies, as terrible as it is,

80
0:03:47.429,000 --> 0:03:5,000
turns out to be a pretty nice virus in this case.

81
0:03:52.034,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You see, rabies is a scary, deadly virus.

82
0:03:55.85,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It has 100 percent fatality.

83
0:03:57.369,000 --> 0:04:,000
That means if you get infected with rabies and you don't get treated early,

84
0:04:01.125,000 --> 0:04:02,000
there's nothing that can be done.

85
0:04:02.877,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There is no cure.

86
0:04:04.052,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You will die.

87
0:04:06.801,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And rabies is not just a problem of the past either.

88
0:04:10.821,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Even today, rabies still kills 50 to 60,000 people every year.

89
0:04:16.481,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Just put that number in some perspective.

90
0:04:19.188,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Imagine the whole West African Ebola outbreak --

91
0:04:21.973,000 --> 0:04:22,000
about two-and-a-half years;

92
0:04:23.604,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you condense all the people that died in that outbreak

93
0:04:26.181,000 --> 0:04:27,000
into just a single year.

94
0:04:27.493,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That's pretty bad.

95
0:04:28.668,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But then, you multiply it by four,

96
0:04:30.621,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and that's what happens with rabies every single year.

97
0:04:35.835,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So what sets rabies apart from a virus like Ebola

98
0:04:40.291,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is that when people get it,

99
0:04:42.078,000 --> 0:04:43,000
they tend not to spread it onward.

100
0:04:44.965,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That means that every single time a person gets rabies,

101
0:04:48.987,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it's because they were bitten by a rabid animal,

102
0:04:51.295,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and usually, that's a dog or a bat.

103
0:04:53.354,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But it also means that those jumps between species,

104
0:04:56.564,000 --> 0:05:,000
which are so important to understand, but so rare for most viruses,

105
0:05:00.89,000 --> 0:05:02,000
for rabies, they're actually happening by the thousands.

106
0:05:04.527,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So in a way, rabies is almost like the fruit fly

107
0:05:08.196,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or the lab mouse of deadly viruses.

108
0:05:11.168,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is a virus that we can use and study to find patterns

109
0:05:15.261,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and potentially test out new solutions.

110
0:05:17.97,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so, when I first heard about that outbreak of rabies

111
0:05:20.797,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in the Peruvian Amazon,

112
0:05:22.178,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it struck me as something potentially powerful

113
0:05:24.4,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because this was a virus that was jumping from bats into other animals

114
0:05:27.782,000 --> 0:05:3,000
often enough that we might be able to anticipate it ...

115
0:05:31.267,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Maybe even stop it.

116
0:05:33.354,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So as a first-year graduate student

117
0:05:35.762,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with a vague memory of my high school Spanish class,

118
0:05:38.481,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I jumped onto a plane and flew off to Peru,

119
0:05:41.125,000 --> 0:05:42,000
looking for vampire bats.

120
0:05:42.972,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the first couple of years of this project were really tough.

121
0:05:48.125,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I had no shortage of ambitious plans to rid Latin America of rabies,

122
0:05:52.084,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but at the same time,

123
0:05:53.67,000 --> 0:05:56,000
there seemed to be an equally endless supply of mudslides and flat tires,

124
0:05:57.415,000 --> 0:06:,000
power outages, stomach bugs all stopping me.

125
0:06:01.262,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But that was kind of par for the course,

126
0:06:03.504,000 --> 0:06:04,000
working in South America,

127
0:06:04.981,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and to me, it was part of the adventure.

128
0:06:08.044,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But what kept me going

129
0:06:10.709,000 --> 0:06:12,000
was the knowledge that for the first time,

130
0:06:12.733,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the work that I was doing might actually have some real impact

131
0:06:15.664,000 --> 0:06:16,000
on people's lives in the short term.

132
0:06:17.454,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And that struck me the most

133
0:06:18.832,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when we actually went out to the Amazon

134
0:06:21.056,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and were trying to catch vampire bats.

135
0:06:23.68,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You see, all we had to do was show up at a village and ask around.

136
0:06:27.279,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"Who's been getting bitten by a bat lately?"

137
0:06:29.677,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And people raised their hands,

138
0:06:31.921,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because in these communities,

139
0:06:34.363,000 --> 0:06:36,000
getting bitten by a bat is an everyday occurrence,

140
0:06:36.722,000 --> 0:06:37,000
happens every day.

141
0:06:38.53,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And so all we had to do was go to the right house,

142
0:06:41.699,000 --> 0:06:42,000
open up a net

143
0:06:43.197,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and show up at night,

144
0:06:44.372,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and wait until the bats tried to fly in and feed on human blood.

145
0:06:49.05,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So to me, seeing a child with a bite wound on his head or blood stains on his sheets,

146
0:06:54.755,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that was more than enough motivation

147
0:06:56.695,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to get past whatever logistical or physical headache

148
0:06:59.189,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I happened to be feeling on that day.

149
0:07:02.896,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Since we were working all night long, though,

150
0:07:05.076,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I had plenty of time to think about how I might actually solve this problem,

151
0:07:08.682,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and it stood out to me that there were two burning questions.

152
0:07:11.783,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The first was that we know that people are bitten all the time,

153
0:07:15.713,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but rabies outbreaks aren't happening all the time --

154
0:07:18.215,000 --> 0:07:2,000
every couple of years, maybe even every decade,

155
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you get a rabies outbreak.

156
0:07:22.36,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So if we could somehow anticipate when and where the next outbreak would be,

157
0:07:26.347,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that would be a real opportunity,

158
0:07:27.967,000 --> 0:07:29,000
meaning we could vaccinate people ahead of time,

159
0:07:30.252,000 --> 0:07:31,000
before anybody starts dying.

160
0:07:32.181,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But the other side of that coin

161
0:07:34.641,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is that vaccination is really just a Band-Aid.

162
0:07:38.303,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's kind of a strategy of damage control.

163
0:07:40.389,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Of course it's lifesaving and important and we have to do it,

164
0:07:43.279,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but at the end of the day,

165
0:07:44.584,000 --> 0:07:46,000
no matter how many cows, how many people we vaccinate,

166
0:07:47.203,000 --> 0:07:5,000
we're still going to have exactly the same amount of rabies up there in the bats.

167
0:07:51.124,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The actual risk of getting bitten hasn't changed at all.

168
0:07:53.769,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So my second question was this:

169
0:07:55.418,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Could we somehow cut the virus off at its source?

170
0:07:59.179,000 --> 0:08:02,000
If we could somehow reduce the amount of rabies in the bats themselves,

171
0:08:02.568,000 --> 0:08:04,000
then that would be a real game changer.

172
0:08:04.635,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We'd been talking about shifting

173
0:08:06.436,000 --> 0:08:09,000
from a strategy of damage control to one based on prevention.

174
0:08:10.687,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So, how do we begin to do that?

175
0:08:13.36,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Well, the first thing we needed to understand

176
0:08:15.503,000 --> 0:08:17,000
was how this virus actually works in its natural host --

177
0:08:18.161,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in the bats.

178
0:08:19.351,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And that is a tall order for any infectious disease,

179
0:08:21.824,000 --> 0:08:24,000
particularly one in a reclusive species like bats,

180
0:08:25.731,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but we had to start somewhere.

181
0:08:28.368,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So the way we started was looking at some historical data.

182
0:08:31.691,000 --> 0:08:33,000
When and where had these outbreaks happened in the past?

183
0:08:35.154,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And it became clear that rabies was a virus

184
0:08:37.954,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that just had to be on the move.

185
0:08:39.514,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It couldn't sit still.

186
0:08:41.449,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The virus might circulate in one area for a year, maybe two,

187
0:08:44.352,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but unless it found a new group of bats to infect somewhere else,

188
0:08:47.477,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it was pretty much bound to go extinct.

189
0:08:50.359,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So with that, we solved one key part of the rabies transmission challenge.

190
0:08:55.898,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We knew we were dealing with a virus on the move,

191
0:08:58.208,000 --> 0:09:,000
but we still couldn't say where it was going.

192
0:09:01.284,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Essentially, what I wanted was more of a Google Maps-style prediction,

193
0:09:05.365,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which is, "What's the destination of the virus?

194
0:09:07.749,000 --> 0:09:09,000
What's the route it's going to take to get there?

195
0:09:10.11,000 --> 0:09:11,000
How fast will it move?"

196
0:09:13.291,000 --> 0:09:16,000
To do that, I turned to the genomes of rabies.

197
0:09:17.278,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You see, rabies, like many other viruses, has a tiny little genome,

198
0:09:21.393,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but one that evolves really, really quickly.

199
0:09:23.903,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So quickly that by the time the virus has moved from one point to the next,

200
0:09:28.324,000 --> 0:09:3,000
it's going to have picked up a couple of new mutations.

201
0:09:31.077,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And so all we have to do is kind of connect the dots

202
0:09:33.857,000 --> 0:09:34,000
across an evolutionary tree,

203
0:09:35.642,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and that's going to tell us where the virus has been in the past

204
0:09:38.667,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and how it spread across the landscape.

205
0:09:40.989,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So, I went out and I collected cow brains,

206
0:09:44.171,000 --> 0:09:46,000
because that's where you get rabies viruses.

207
0:09:47.088,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And from genome sequences that we got from the viruses in those cow brains,

208
0:09:52.028,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I was able to work out

209
0:09:53.203,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that this is a virus that spreads between 10 and 20 miles each year.

210
0:09:57.147,000 --> 0:10:,000
OK, so that means we do now have the speed limit of the virus,

211
0:10:01.128,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but still missing that other key part of where is it going in the first place.

212
0:10:06.362,000 --> 0:10:1,000
For that, I needed to think a little bit more like a bat,

213
0:10:10.754,000 --> 0:10:11,000
because rabies is a virus --

214
0:10:12.112,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it doesn't move by itself,

215
0:10:13.375,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it has to be moved around by its bat host,

216
0:10:16.471,000 --> 0:10:19,000
so I needed to think about how far to fly and how often to fly.

217
0:10:20.474,000 --> 0:10:22,000
My imagination didn't get me all that far with this

218
0:10:23.345,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and neither did little digital trackers that we first tried putting on bats.

219
0:10:26.973,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We just couldn't get the information we needed.

220
0:10:29.331,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So instead, we turned to the mating patterns of bats.

221
0:10:32.006,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We could look at certain parts of the bat genome,

222
0:10:34.348,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and they were telling us that some groups of bats were mating with each other

223
0:10:37.992,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and others were more isolated.

224
0:10:39.451,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And the virus was basically following the trail laid out by the bat genomes.

225
0:10:44.884,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Yet one of those trails stood out as being a little bit surprising --

226
0:10:48.311,000 --> 0:10:49,000
hard to believe.

227
0:10:50.176,000 --> 0:10:53,000
That was one that seemed to cross straight over the Peruvian Andes,

228
0:10:53.999,000 --> 0:10:55,000
crossing from the Amazon to the Pacific coast,

229
0:10:56.318,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and that was kind of hard to believe,

230
0:10:58.759,000 --> 0:11:,000
as I said,

231
0:11:01.013,000 --> 0:11:04,000
because the Andes are really tall -- about 22,000 feet,

232
0:11:04.259,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and that's way too high for a vampire to fly.

233
0:11:08.136,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Yet --

234
0:11:09.31,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:10.406,000 --> 0:11:11,000
when we looked more closely,

236
0:11:11.784,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we saw, in the northern part of Peru,

237
0:11:13.611,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a network of valley systems that was not quite too tall

238
0:11:17.242,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for the bats on either side to be mating with each other.

239
0:11:20.022,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And we looked a little bit more closely --

240
0:11:22.046,000 --> 0:11:24,000
sure enough, there's rabies spreading through those valleys,

241
0:11:24.88,000 --> 0:11:25,000
just about 10 miles each year.

242
0:11:26.569,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Basically, exactly as our evolutionary models had predicated it would be.

243
0:11:30.531,000 --> 0:11:31,000
What I didn't tell you

244
0:11:31.729,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is that that's actually kind of an important thing

245
0:11:34.157,000 --> 0:11:37,000
because rabies had never been seen before on the western slopes of the Andes,

246
0:11:37.882,000 --> 0:11:39,000
or on the whole Pacific coast of South America,

247
0:11:40.695,000 --> 0:11:44,000
so we were actually witnessing, in real time, a historical first invasion

248
0:11:44.745,000 --> 0:11:46,000
into a pretty big part of South America,

249
0:11:47.72,000 --> 0:11:48,000
which raises the key question:

250
0:11:49.173,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"What are we going to do about that?"

251
0:11:51.719,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Well, the obvious short-term thing we can do is tell people:

252
0:11:55.049,000 --> 0:11:57,000
you need to vaccinate yourselves, vaccinate your animals;

253
0:11:57.743,000 --> 0:11:58,000
rabies is coming.

254
0:11:59.507,000 --> 0:12:,000
But in the longer term,

255
0:12:00.928,000 --> 0:12:03,000
it would be even more powerful if we could use that new information

256
0:12:04.182,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to stop the virus from arriving altogether.

257
0:12:07.847,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Of course, we can't just tell bats, "Don't fly today,"

258
0:12:11.058,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but maybe we could stop the virus from hitching a ride along with the bat.

259
0:12:16.347,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And that brings us to the key lesson that we have learned

260
0:12:19.5,000 --> 0:12:21,000
from rabies-management programs all around the world,

261
0:12:22.354,000 --> 0:12:26,000
whether it's dogs, foxes, skunks, raccoons,

262
0:12:26.768,000 --> 0:12:28,000
North America, Africa, Europe.

263
0:12:29.581,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It's that vaccinating the animal source is the only thing that stops rabies.

264
0:12:34.204,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So, can we vaccinate bats?

265
0:12:38.597,000 --> 0:12:4,000
You hear about vaccinating dogs and cats all the time,

266
0:12:41.146,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but you don't hear too much about vaccinating bats.

267
0:12:44.597,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It might sound like a crazy question,

268
0:12:46.671,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but the good news is that we actually already have edible rabies vaccines

269
0:12:51.869,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that are specially designed for bats.

270
0:12:54.351,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And what's even better

271
0:12:55.998,000 --> 0:12:58,000
is that these vaccines can actually spread from bat to bat.

272
0:13:00.499,000 --> 0:13:02,000
All you have to do is smear it on one

273
0:13:02.99,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and let the bats' habit of grooming each other

274
0:13:05.212,000 --> 0:13:07,000
take care of the rest of the work for you.

275
0:13:07.241,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So that means, at the very least,

276
0:13:09.508,000 --> 0:13:12,000
we don't have to be out there vaccinating millions of bats one by one

277
0:13:12.771,000 --> 0:13:13,000
with tiny little syringes.

278
0:13:14.296,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter)

279
0:13:15.909,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But just because we have that tool doesn't mean we know how to use it.

280
0:13:19.442,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Now we have a whole laundry list of questions.

281
0:13:21.821,000 --> 0:13:23,000
How many bats do we need to vaccinate?

282
0:13:23.941,000 --> 0:13:25,000
What time of the year do we need to be vaccinating?

283
0:13:26.392,000 --> 0:13:28,000
How many times a year do we need to be vaccinating?

284
0:13:30.067,000 --> 0:13:32,000
All of these are questions that are really fundamental

285
0:13:32.633,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to rolling out any sort of vaccination campaign,

286
0:13:34.9,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but they're questions that we can't answer in the laboratory.

287
0:13:37.782,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So instead, we're taking a slightly more colorful approach.

288
0:13:41.25,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We're using real wild bats, but fake vaccines.

289
0:13:45.795,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We use edible gels that make bat hair glow

290
0:13:48.235,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and UV powders that spread between bats when they bump into each other,

291
0:13:51.862,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and that's letting us study how well a real vaccine might spread

292
0:13:54.925,000 --> 0:13:56,000
in these wild colonies of bats.

293
0:13:57.908,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We're still in the earliest phases of this work,

294
0:14:00.275,000 --> 0:14:02,000
but our results so far are incredibly encouraging.

295
0:14:03.31,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They're suggesting that using the vaccines that we already have,

296
0:14:06.43,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we could potentially drastically reduce the size of rabies outbreaks.

297
0:14:10.637,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And that matters, because as you remember,

298
0:14:13.463,000 --> 0:14:15,000
rabies is a virus that always has to be on the move,

299
0:14:16.267,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and so every time we reduce the size of an outbreak,

300
0:14:19.406,000 --> 0:14:2,000
we're also reducing the chance

301
0:14:20.891,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that the virus makes it onto the next colony.

302
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We're breaking a link in the chain of transmission.

303
0:14:26.289,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And so every time we do that,

304
0:14:27.905,000 --> 0:14:29,000
we're bringing the virus one step closer to extinction.

305
0:14:30.806,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And so the thought, for me, of a world in the not-too-distant future

306
0:14:35.542,000 --> 0:14:38,000
where we're actually talking about getting rid of rabies altogether,

307
0:14:38.837,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that is incredibly encouraging and exciting.

308
0:14:41.631,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So let me return to the original question.

309
0:14:43.819,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Can we prevent pandemics?

310
0:14:46.119,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Well, there is no silver-bullet solution to this problem,

311
0:14:50.243,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but my experiences with rabies have left me pretty optimistic about it.

312
0:14:54.282,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I think we're not too far from a future

313
0:14:56.299,000 --> 0:14:59,000
where we're going to have genomics to forecast outbreaks

314
0:14:59.966,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and we're going to have clever new technologies,

315
0:15:02.395,000 --> 0:15:04,000
like edible, self-spreading vaccines,

316
0:15:05.323,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that can get rid of these viruses at their source

317
0:15:07.636,000 --> 0:15:09,000
before they have a chance to jump into people.

318
0:15:10.926,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So when it comes to fighting pandemics,

319
0:15:13.087,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the holy grail is just to get one step ahead.

320
0:15:16.202,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And if you ask me,

321
0:15:17.376,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I think one of the ways that we can do that

322
0:15:19.4,000 --> 0:15:21,000
is using some of the problems that we already have now,

323
0:15:22.007,000 --> 0:15:23,000
like rabies --

324
0:15:23.263,000 --> 0:15:25,000
sort of the way an astronaut might use a flight simulator,

325
0:15:26.048,000 --> 0:15:27,000
figuring out what works and what doesn't,

326
0:15:28.04,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and building up our tool set

327
0:15:29.589,000 --> 0:15:3,000
so that when the stakes are high,

328
0:15:31.211,000 --> 0:15:32,000
we're not flying blind.

329
0:15:32.884,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Thank you.

330
0:15:34.059,000 --> 0:15:37,000

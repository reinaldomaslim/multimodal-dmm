1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I started my journey 30 years ago.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And I worked in mines. And I realized that

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
this was a world unseen.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I wanted, through color and large format cameras

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and very large prints,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to make a body of work that somehow

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
became symbols of our

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
use of the landscape,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
how we use the land.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And to me this was

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which allows us to contemplate these landscapes,

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that I thought photography was perfectly suited

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to doing this type of work.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it occurred to me that

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
oil is underpinning the scale and speed.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Because that is what has changed,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is the speed at which we're taking all our resources.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And so then I went out to develop a whole series

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on the landscape of oil.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
refinement. And that's one chapter.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The other chapter that I wanted to look at was

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
how we use it -- our cities,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
our cars, our motorcultures,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
where people gather around the vehicle

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as a celebration.

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil,

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
this entropic end,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
where all of our parts of cars, our tires,

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
oil filters,

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
helicopters, planes --

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And to me, again, photography was

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a way in which I could explore and research the world,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and find those places.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And another idea that I had as well,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that was brought forward by an ecologist --

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
he basically did a calculation where

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
he took one liter of gas and said,

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It was 23 metric tons for one liter.

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So whenever I fill up my gas,

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I think of that liter, and how much carbon.

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton,

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but he did the calculations for our Earth

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
From the photosynthetic growth,

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it would take 500 years of that growth

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And that also brought me to the fact that

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
this poses such a risk to our society.

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Looking at 30 billion per year,

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we look at our two largest suppliers,

57
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And together they only form about 15 years of supply.

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves,

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
only gives us about 45 years.

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
peak oil will come upon us.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So, to me, using photography --

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
take the task of using our talents,

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
our ways of thinking,

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to begin to deal with what I think is probably

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
one of the most challenging issues of our time,

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
how to deal with our energy crisis.

70
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I would like to say that, on the other side of it,

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
30, 40 years from now, the children that I have,

72
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I can look at them and say, "We did everything

73
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
we possibly, humanly could do,

74
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to begin to mitigate this,

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
what I feel is one of the most important and critical

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
moments in our time. Thank you.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

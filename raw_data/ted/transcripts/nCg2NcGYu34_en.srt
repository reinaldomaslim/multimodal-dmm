2
0:00:15.776,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.

3
0:00:19.883,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you

4
0:00:22.387,000 --> 0:00:23,000
suffer from it as well.

5
0:00:24.307,000 --> 0:00:26,000
When I'm walking around an art gallery,

6
0:00:26.404,000 --> 0:00:28,000
rooms and rooms full of paintings,

7
0:00:28.507,000 --> 0:00:32,000
after about 15 or 20 minutes,

8
0:00:33.024,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.

9
0:00:34.915,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm not connecting to them.

10
0:00:36.523,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee

11
0:00:39.027,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I desperately need to wake me up.

12
0:00:42.027,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.

13
0:00:45.211,000 --> 0:00:47,000
How many of you out there suffer from --

14
0:00:47.587,000 --> 0:00:49,000
yes. Ha ha, ha ha!

15
0:00:49.592,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, sometimes you might last longer

16
0:00:51.742,000 --> 0:00:53,000
than 20 minutes, or even shorter,

17
0:00:53.836,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have

18
0:00:56.05,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the accompanying guilt?

19
0:00:58.131,000 --> 0:01:,000
For me, I look at the paintings on the wall

20
0:01:01.118,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I think, somebody has decided to put them there,

21
0:01:04.133,000 --> 0:01:06,000
thinks they're good enough to be on that wall,

22
0:01:06.661,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but I don't always see it.

23
0:01:08.019,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In fact, most of the time I don't see it.

24
0:01:10.683,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I leave feeling actually unhappy.

25
0:01:14.457,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I feel guilty and unhappy with myself,

26
0:01:17.924,000 --> 0:01:19,000
rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting,

27
0:01:19.987,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I think there's something wrong with me.

28
0:01:21.444,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.

29
0:01:24.352,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:25.623,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.

31
0:01:27.932,000 --> 0:01:29,000
If you think about going into a restaurant,

32
0:01:30.392,000 --> 0:01:33,000
when you look at the menu, are you expected to order

33
0:01:34.079,000 --> 0:01:36,000
every single thing on the menu?

34
0:01:36.262,000 --> 0:01:37,000
No! You select.

35
0:01:38.144,000 --> 0:01:41,000
If you go into a department store to buy a shirt,

36
0:01:41.319,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are you going to try on every single shirt

37
0:01:44.296,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and want every single shirt?

38
0:01:45.624,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected.

39
0:01:49.751,000 --> 0:01:51,000
How come, then, it's not so expected

40
0:01:52.372,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to be selective when we go to an art gallery?

41
0:01:54.945,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?

42
0:01:58.24,000 --> 0:02:,000
Well I'm trying to take a different approach.

43
0:02:00.944,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And there's two things I do:

44
0:02:02.562,000 --> 0:02:06,000
When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast,

45
0:02:07.056,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones

46
0:02:11.291,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that make me slow down for some reason or other.

47
0:02:14.345,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something

48
0:02:17.146,000 --> 0:02:19,000
pulls me like a magnet

49
0:02:19.203,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.

50
0:02:22.321,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.

51
0:02:24.785,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.

52
0:02:28.081,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting,

53
0:02:31.771,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I tell myself a story about it.

54
0:02:34.848,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Why a story? Well, I think that we are wired,

55
0:02:38.446,000 --> 0:02:41,000
our DNA tells us to tell stories.

56
0:02:42.337,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We tell stories all the time about everything,

57
0:02:44.706,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place,

58
0:02:49.817,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit,

59
0:02:53.768,000 --> 0:02:55,000
trying to bring some order to it.

60
0:02:55.937,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?

61
0:02:59.928,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So I now have this sort of restaurant menu

62
0:03:03.643,000 --> 0:03:06,000
visiting of art galleries.

63
0:03:06.866,000 --> 0:03:09,000
There are three paintings I'm going to show you now

64
0:03:10.074,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks

65
0:03:13.138,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and want to tell stories about them.

66
0:03:15.684,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The first one needs little introduction --

67
0:03:19.235,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer,

68
0:03:22.266,000 --> 0:03:24,000
17th-century Dutch painter.

69
0:03:24.422,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This is the most glorious painting.

70
0:03:26.922,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I first saw it when I was 19,

71
0:03:29.066,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I immediately went out and got a poster of it,

72
0:03:31.346,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.

73
0:03:35.503,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone,

74
0:03:38.653,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I never tire of looking at her.

75
0:03:40.997,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with

76
0:03:44.776,000 --> 0:03:46,000
was just the gorgeous colors he uses

77
0:03:47.333,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and the light falling on her face.

78
0:03:49.277,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But I think what's kept me still coming back

79
0:03:52.061,000 --> 0:03:55,000
year after year is another thing, and that is

80
0:03:55.117,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.

81
0:03:58.811,000 --> 0:04:,000
I can't tell if she's happy or sad,

82
0:04:01.229,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and I change my mind all the time.

83
0:04:04.196,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So that keeps me coming back.

84
0:04:07.795,000 --> 0:04:11,000
One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall,

85
0:04:11.804,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I lay in bed and looked at her,

86
0:04:14.486,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and I suddenly thought, I wonder what

87
0:04:17.065,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the painter did to her to make her look like that.

88
0:04:20.983,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And it was the first time I'd ever thought that

89
0:04:23.927,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the expression on her face is actually reflecting

90
0:04:26.727,000 --> 0:04:28,000
how she feels about him.

91
0:04:28.866,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.

92
0:04:32.022,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.

93
0:04:36.791,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I thought, well, what is that relationship?

94
0:04:39.623,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered,

95
0:04:42.831,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we have no idea who she is.

96
0:04:45.156,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In fact, we don't know who any of the models

97
0:04:47.503,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in any of Vermeer's paintings are,

98
0:04:49.863,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and we know very little about Vermeer himself.

99
0:04:51.99,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Which made me go, "Yippee!"

100
0:04:54.764,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.

101
0:04:59.423,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So here's how I came up with the story.

102
0:05:02.019,000 --> 0:05:03,000
First of all, I thought,

103
0:05:03.896,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I've got to get her into the house.

104
0:05:05.988,000 --> 0:05:07,000
How does Vermeer know her?

105
0:05:08.476,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, there've been suggestions that

106
0:05:10.02,000 --> 0:05:14,000
she is his 12-year-old daughter.

107
0:05:14.443,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.

108
0:05:16.668,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,

109
0:05:19.364,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.

110
0:05:21.548,000 --> 0:05:22,000
For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time,

111
0:05:23.388,000 --> 0:05:26,000
if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.

112
0:05:26.98,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer

113
0:05:28.868,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to paint his daughter like that.

114
0:05:30.764,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody

115
0:05:32.644,000 --> 0:05:34,000
close to him, physically close to him.

116
0:05:34.894,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well, who else would be in the house?

117
0:05:37.158,000 --> 0:05:4,000
A servant, a lovely servant.

118
0:05:40.541,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So, she's in the house.

119
0:05:42.102,000 --> 0:05:44,000
How do we get her into the studio?

120
0:05:44.763,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We don't know very much about Vermeer,

121
0:05:46.897,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know

122
0:05:49.036,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother

123
0:05:52.027,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in a house where he had his own room

124
0:05:54.3,000 --> 0:05:58,000
where he -- his studio. He also had 11 children.

125
0:05:58.583,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.

126
0:06:01.66,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before,

127
0:06:04.604,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.

128
0:06:08.468,000 --> 0:06:11,000
How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?

129
0:06:12.364,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Well, he compartmentalizes his life.

130
0:06:14.66,000 --> 0:06:17,000
He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.

131
0:06:18.34,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."

132
0:06:23.068,000 --> 0:06:3,000
She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.

133
0:06:30.119,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And he decides to paint her.

134
0:06:32.199,000 --> 0:06:34,000
He has her wear very plain clothes.

135
0:06:34.467,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings

136
0:06:37.838,000 --> 0:06:42,000
wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.

137
0:06:43.804,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain

138
0:06:46.324,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is her pearl earring.

139
0:06:48.364,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford

140
0:06:51.811,000 --> 0:06:53,000
a pair of pearl earrings.

141
0:06:54.018,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?

142
0:06:57.28,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.

143
0:07:02.321,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur,

144
0:07:05.937,000 --> 0:07:06,000
a yellow and black bodice,

145
0:07:07.684,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings,

146
0:07:11.378,000 --> 0:07:14,000
different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.

147
0:07:14.492,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.

148
0:07:18.97,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's not such a leap of faith to take

149
0:07:21.489,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.

150
0:07:25.073,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So we've got all the elements for our story.

151
0:07:28.25,000 --> 0:07:3,000
She's in the studio with him for a long time.

152
0:07:30.68,000 --> 0:07:32,000
These paintings took a long time to make.

153
0:07:32.723,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They would have spent the time alone, all that time.

154
0:07:35.594,000 --> 0:07:37,000
She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.

155
0:07:37.594,000 --> 0:07:39,000
She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.

156
0:07:40.409,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And does the wife know? Maybe not.

157
0:07:43.201,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And if she doesn't, well --

158
0:07:46.579,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that's the story.

159
0:07:48.434,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:50.611,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The next painting I'm going to talk about

161
0:07:53.201,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.

162
0:07:56.448,000 --> 0:08:,000
He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes,

163
0:08:00.824,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but he did occasionally paint people.

164
0:08:03.417,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting,

165
0:08:07.384,000 --> 0:08:1,000
different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.

166
0:08:11.344,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I like this version the best, because some of the boys

167
0:08:14.808,000 --> 0:08:17,000
are older and some are younger, and to me, this one,

168
0:08:18.201,000 --> 0:08:2,000
like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.

169
0:08:21.153,000 --> 0:08:24,000
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.

170
0:08:25.144,000 --> 0:08:29,000
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,

171
0:08:29.937,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.

172
0:08:34.42,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.

173
0:08:38.137,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed

174
0:08:40.76,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting,

175
0:08:42.984,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it,

176
0:08:45.996,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I was standing there going,

177
0:08:47.203,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"Look at me. Please look at me."

178
0:08:50.156,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards,

179
0:08:52.892,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is,

180
0:08:55.644,000 --> 0:08:59,000
he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.

181
0:09:00.134,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece,

182
0:09:04.027,000 --> 0:09:07,000
of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.

183
0:09:08.004,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He's never going to look at me.

184
0:09:09.525,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So I was thinking of a story where,

185
0:09:11.204,000 --> 0:09:14,000
if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?

186
0:09:14.42,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.

187
0:09:16.622,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I'm thinking of an older version of himself.

188
0:09:19.148,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant,

189
0:09:25.093,000 --> 0:09:27,000
saying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about

190
0:09:27.564,000 --> 0:09:29,000
what you're about to go through. Please look at me."

191
0:09:30.014,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And he never does.

192
0:09:31.54,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" --

193
0:09:35.343,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we don't know if she's happy or sad.

194
0:09:37.387,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I've written an entire novel about her,

195
0:09:39.036,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.

196
0:09:41.036,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Again and again, back to the painting,

197
0:09:43.14,000 --> 0:09:47,000
looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.

198
0:09:47.821,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily,

199
0:09:51.268,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but not really, and we come back again and again.

200
0:09:57.083,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The last painting I'm going to talk about

201
0:09:59.621,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is called "Anonymous" by anonymous. (Laughter)

202
0:10:04.485,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.

203
0:10:07.536,000 --> 0:10:09,000
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,

204
0:10:10.149,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and then they discovered that it wasn't him,

205
0:10:12.813,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and they have no idea who it is.

206
0:10:14.413,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery,

207
0:10:16.556,000 --> 0:10:17,000
if you don't know the biography of the painting,

208
0:10:18.325,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it's kind of useless to you.

209
0:10:19.949,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.

210
0:10:22.373,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage,

211
0:10:27.277,000 --> 0:10:29,000
along with quite a number of other orphans,

212
0:10:29.421,000 --> 0:10:31,000
some of them some beautiful paintings.

213
0:10:31.932,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons:

214
0:10:36.935,000 --> 0:10:38,000
One is the disconnection between his mouth

215
0:10:39.812,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.

216
0:10:42.517,000 --> 0:10:45,000
He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?

217
0:10:45.524,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The second thing that really attracted me

218
0:10:49.241,000 --> 0:10:5,000
were his bright red cheeks.

219
0:10:50.957,000 --> 0:10:53,000
He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!

220
0:10:54.564,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This must be a guy who blushes all the time.

221
0:10:57.598,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What is he thinking about that's making him blush?

222
0:10:59.74,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The third thing that made me stop in my tracks

223
0:11:03.516,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.

224
0:11:06.316,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.

225
0:11:09.884,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And you know what it makes me think of,

226
0:11:11.516,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.

227
0:11:16.308,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks,

228
0:11:18.964,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him,

229
0:11:21.724,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?

230
0:11:24.332,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And I thought, if I'm going to make a story,

231
0:11:26.604,000 --> 0:11:27,000
what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?

232
0:11:28.588,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?

233
0:11:32.218,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.

234
0:11:34.148,000 --> 0:11:38,000
He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.

235
0:11:38.292,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?

236
0:11:41.941,000 --> 0:11:44,000
You put all those together, and you've got your story

237
0:11:45.821,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.

238
0:11:49.175,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now, here's the story.

239
0:11:53.896,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's short.

240
0:11:56.826,000 --> 0:11:58,000
"Rosy"

241
0:11:59.557,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.

242
0:12:03.607,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves

243
0:12:07.918,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread,

244
0:12:11.094,000 --> 0:12:13,000
set close together so that the fit is snug.

245
0:12:14.02,000 --> 0:12:17,000
The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.

246
0:12:17.583,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Perhaps that was the intention.

247
0:12:21.333,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.

248
0:12:26.251,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I knew even before I stood up to speak

249
0:12:28.077,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that my cheeks were inflamed.

250
0:12:30.646,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion,

251
0:12:34.347,000 --> 0:12:36,000
from wine, from high emotion.

252
0:12:36.702,000 --> 0:12:4,000
As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys,

253
0:12:41.167,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but not by George.

254
0:12:43.614,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Only George could call me Rosy.

255
0:12:46.688,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I would not allow anyone else.

256
0:12:48.847,000 --> 0:12:52,000
He managed to make the word tender.

257
0:12:53.071,000 --> 0:12:55,000
When I made the announcement, George did not

258
0:12:55.87,000 --> 0:12:58,000
turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.

259
0:12:58.934,000 --> 0:12:59,000
He should not have been surprised.

260
0:13:00.838,000 --> 0:13:01,000
It has been a common assumption

261
0:13:02.51,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that I would one day marry his cousin.

262
0:13:06.358,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.

263
0:13:08.942,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I know, I could barely utter them.

264
0:13:12.243,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.

265
0:13:16.645,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.

266
0:13:21.902,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.

267
0:13:26.127,000 --> 0:13:28,000
"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked.

268
0:13:28.389,000 --> 0:13:33,000
He glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you."

269
0:13:33.833,000 --> 0:13:35,000
"We will still see each other," I insisted.

270
0:13:35.837,000 --> 0:13:38,000
"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.

271
0:13:39.125,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Nothing need change."

272
0:13:40.861,000 --> 0:13:43,000
George did not speak.

273
0:13:44.578,000 --> 0:13:47,000
"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry

274
0:13:47.972,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and produce an heir. It is expected of me."

275
0:13:52.077,000 --> 0:13:55,000
George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.

276
0:13:55.658,000 --> 0:13:59,000
"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.

277
0:13:59.741,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I'm sure you'll be content together."

278
0:14:04.577,000 --> 0:14:07,000
He never used my nickname again.

279
0:14:07.894,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Thank you.

280
0:14:09.653,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

281
0:14:13.035,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Thank you.

282
0:14:14.217,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Applause)

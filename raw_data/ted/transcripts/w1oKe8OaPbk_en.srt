1
0:00:13.157,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time

2
0:00:16.532,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with only one suitcase of clothes.

3
0:00:18.892,000 --> 0:00:2,000
One day, I was invited to an important event,

4
0:00:21.075,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I wanted to wear something special and new for it.

5
0:00:24.14,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear.

6
0:00:28.133,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day,

7
0:00:31.087,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I had access to 3D printers.

8
0:00:33.705,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer,

9
0:00:35.966,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I loaded the file on the printer.

10
0:00:38.135,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It just printed the pieces overnight.

11
0:00:40.629,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The next morning, I just took all the pieces,

12
0:00:42.783,000 --> 0:00:43,000
assembled them together in my hotel room,

13
0:00:44.774,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now.

14
0:00:47.754,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:51.678,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes.

16
0:00:54.485,000 --> 0:00:56,000
For my senior collection at fashion design school,

17
0:00:56.874,000 --> 0:01:,000
I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home.

18
0:01:01.755,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing,

19
0:01:05.236,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks.

20
0:01:11.158,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I always felt most creative when I worked from home.

21
0:01:13.956,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I loved experimenting with new materials,

22
0:01:16.368,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I always tried to develop new techniques

23
0:01:18.601,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects.

24
0:01:22.509,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I loved going to old factories and weird stores

25
0:01:25.129,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials,

26
0:01:29.843,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and then bring them home to experiment on.

27
0:01:32.59,000 --> 0:01:33,000
As you can probably imagine,

28
0:01:34.097,000 --> 0:01:36,000
my roommates didn't like that at all.

29
0:01:36.136,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:37.165,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So I decided to move on to working with big machines,

31
0:01:41.302,000 --> 0:01:43,000
ones that didn't fit in my living room.

32
0:01:43.419,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I love the exact and the custom work I can do

33
0:01:45.57,000 --> 0:01:47,000
with all kinds of fashion technologies,

34
0:01:47.74,000 --> 0:01:5,000
like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing.

35
0:01:52.498,000 --> 0:01:55,000
One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship

36
0:01:55.697,000 --> 0:01:57,000
at a fashion house in Chinatown.

37
0:01:58.071,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed.

38
0:02:02.598,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They were amazing -- like you can see here.

39
0:02:05.504,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But I had a few issues with them.

40
0:02:07.448,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable.

41
0:02:11.897,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The models couldn't sit in them,

42
0:02:13.458,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms.

43
0:02:17.444,000 --> 0:02:2,000
With 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom

44
0:02:20.479,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted,

45
0:02:23.785,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers

46
0:02:29.402,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that were located in a lab far from their studio.

47
0:02:33.451,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Later that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace,

48
0:02:36.913,000 --> 0:02:38,000
printed using a home printer.

49
0:02:39.072,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I knew that these printers were much cheaper

50
0:02:41.242,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship.

51
0:02:44.984,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So I looked at the necklace,

52
0:02:46.414,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home,

53
0:02:49.901,000 --> 0:02:51,000
why not print my clothes from home, too?"

54
0:02:53.108,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market

55
0:02:56.169,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell --

56
0:02:58.817,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I could just design them and print them directly from home.

57
0:03:04.184,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I found a small makerspace,

58
0:03:06.075,000 --> 0:03:08,000
where I learned everything I know about 3D printing.

59
0:03:09.036,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Right away, they literally gave me the key to the lab,

60
0:03:11.655,000 --> 0:03:14,000
so I could experiment into the night, every night.

61
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with.

62
0:03:19.182,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So what is a filament?

63
0:03:20.362,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Filament is the material you feed the printer with.

64
0:03:22.818,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA,

65
0:03:25.744,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which is a hard and scratchy, breakable material.

66
0:03:29.632,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex,

67
0:03:32.339,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which is a new kind of filament.

68
0:03:33.905,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's strong, yet very flexible.

69
0:03:36.269,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And with it, I was able to print the first garment,

70
0:03:40.127,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the red jacket that had the word "Liberté" --

71
0:03:43.599,000 --> 0:03:44,000
"freedom" in French --

72
0:03:44.818,000 --> 0:03:45,000
embedded into it.

73
0:03:46.355,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free

74
0:03:49.172,000 --> 0:03:51,000
when I could just design a garment from my home

75
0:03:51.499,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and then print it by myself.

76
0:03:54.328,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And actually, you can easily download this jacket,

77
0:03:57.766,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and easily change the word to something else.

78
0:04:00.418,000 --> 0:04:02,000
For example, your name or your sweetheart's name.

79
0:04:03.507,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:05.04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So the printer plates are small,

81
0:04:06.79,000 --> 0:04:1,000
so I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle.

82
0:04:12.238,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And I wanted to solve another challenge.

83
0:04:14.513,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I wanted to print textiles

84
0:04:16.082,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that I would use just like regular fabrics.

85
0:04:18.611,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That's when I found an open-source file

86
0:04:20.569,000 --> 0:04:22,000
from an architect who designed a pattern that I love.

87
0:04:23.182,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile

88
0:04:25.925,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that I would use just like a regular fabric.

89
0:04:29.167,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And it actually even looks a little bit like lace.

90
0:04:33.247,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it --

91
0:04:36.661,000 --> 0:04:38,000
many kinds of versions out of it.

92
0:04:39.654,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours

93
0:04:43.862,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to complete printing my collection.

94
0:04:46.813,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7.

95
0:04:51.176,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And this is actually a really slow process,

96
0:04:53.72,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago,

97
0:04:58.087,000 --> 0:05:,000
so 3D printing will also accelerate

98
0:05:00.436,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home

99
0:05:03.443,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in just a couple of hours, or even minutes.

100
0:05:06.826,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So you guys, you want to see what it looks like?

101
0:05:09.17,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Audience: Yeah!

102
0:05:10.495,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:14.293,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits.

104
0:05:17.833,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Almost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home.

105
0:05:23.079,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Even her shoes are printed.

106
0:05:25.354,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Audience: Wow!

107
0:05:26.53,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Audience: Cool!

108
0:05:29.766,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

109
0:05:31.545,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.

110
0:05:33.706,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(To audience) Thank you, guys.

111
0:05:36.848,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So I think in the future, materials will evolve,

112
0:05:39.389,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today,

113
0:05:42.594,000 --> 0:05:43,000
like cotton or silk.

114
0:05:45.349,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements.

115
0:05:51.537,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Music was once a very physical thing.

116
0:05:53.538,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs,

117
0:05:56.586,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but now you can just download the music --

118
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
digital music --

119
0:06:00.443,000 --> 0:06:01,000
directly to your phone.

120
0:06:02.505,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Fashion is also a very physical thing.

121
0:06:05.3,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And I wonder what our world will look like

122
0:06:08.206,000 --> 0:06:11,000
when our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is.

123
0:06:12.056,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Thank you so much.

124
0:06:13.453,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

125
0:06:14.677,000 --> 0:06:15,000
[Thank You]

126
0:06:15.851,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Applause)

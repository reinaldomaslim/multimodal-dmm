The sound is a really big part, I think, of the experience of using a pencil,

3
0:00:15.588,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and it has this really audible scratchiness.

[Caroline Weaver on the Pencil]

7
0:00:28.556,000 --> 0:00:3,000
The pencil is a very simple object.

8
0:00:30.95,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's made of wood with some layers of paint

9
0:00:33.459,000 --> 0:00:34,000
an eraser and a core,

10
0:00:34.999,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which is made out of graphite, clay and water.

11
0:00:37.419,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Yeah, it took hundreds of people over centuries

12
0:00:39.975,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to come to this design.

13
0:00:41.675,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And it's that long history of collaboration

14
0:00:44.98,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that, to me, makes it a very perfect object.

15
0:00:48.075,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The story of the pencil starts with graphite.

16
0:00:50.373,000 --> 0:00:52,000
People started finding really useful applications

17
0:00:53.314,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for this new substance.

18
0:00:54.949,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They cut it into small sticks

19
0:00:57.131,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and wrapped it in string or sheepskin or paper

20
0:00:59.623,000 --> 0:01:,000
and sold it on the streets of London

21
0:01:01.641,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to be used for writing or for drawing

22
0:01:03.821,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or, a lot of times, by farmers and shepherds,

23
0:01:06.337,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who used it to mark their animals.

24
0:01:08.02,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Over in France,

25
0:01:09.287,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Nicolas-Jacques Conté figured out a method of grinding the graphite,

26
0:01:13.465,000 --> 0:01:16,000
mixing it with powdered clay and water to make a paste.

27
0:01:16.608,000 --> 0:01:19,000
From there, this paste was filled into a mold and fired in a kiln,

28
0:01:19.801,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and the result was a really strong graphite core

29
0:01:22.775,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that wasn't breakable, that was smooth, usable --

30
0:01:25.918,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it was so much better than anything else that existed at the time,

31
0:01:29.038,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and to this day, that's the method that's still used in making pencils.

32
0:01:33.461,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Meanwhile, over in America, in Concord, Massachusetts,

33
0:01:36.612,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it was Henry David Thoreau who came up with the grading scale

34
0:01:39.684,000 --> 0:01:41,000
for different hardnesses of pencil.

35
0:01:41.794,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It was graded one through four,

36
0:01:43.741,000 --> 0:01:46,000
number two being the ideal hardness for general use.

37
0:01:47.416,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The softer the pencil, the more graphite it had in it,

38
0:01:49.99,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and the darker and smoother the line will be.

39
0:01:53.495,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The firmer the pencil, the more clay it had in it

40
0:01:55.806,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the lighter and finer it will be.

41
0:01:58.607,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Originally, when pencils were handmade, they were made round.

42
0:02:01.798,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There was no easy way to make them,

43
0:02:03.496,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and it was the Americans who really mechanized the craft.

44
0:02:06.782,000 --> 0:02:07,000
A lot of people credit Joseph Dixon

45
0:02:08.752,000 --> 0:02:11,000
for being one of the first people to start developing actual machines

46
0:02:12.464,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to do things like cut wood slats, cut grooves into the wood,

47
0:02:16.395,000 --> 0:02:17,000
apply glue to them ...

48
0:02:17.628,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And they figured out it was easier and less wasteful

49
0:02:20.463,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to do a hexagonal pencil,

50
0:02:22.115,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and so that became the standard.

51
0:02:24.558,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Since the early days of pencils,

52
0:02:26.145,000 --> 0:02:28,000
people have loved that they can be erased.

53
0:02:29.942,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Originally, it was bread crumbs

54
0:02:31.534,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that were used to scratch away pencil marks

55
0:02:33.641,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and later, rubber and pumice.

56
0:02:35.675,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The attached eraser happened in 1858,

57
0:02:38.991,000 --> 0:02:41,000
when American stationer Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil

58
0:02:42.972,000 --> 0:02:43,000
with an attached eraser,

59
0:02:44.378,000 --> 0:02:45,000
which really changed the pencil game.

60
0:02:46.965,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The world's first yellow pencil was the KOH-I-NOOR 1500.

61
0:02:50.383,000 --> 0:02:51,000
KOH-I-NOOR did this crazy thing

62
0:02:51.912,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where they painted this pencil with 14 coats of yellow paint

63
0:02:54.849,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and dipped the end in 14-carat gold.

64
0:02:57.442,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There is a pencil for everyone,

65
0:02:59.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and every pencil has a story.

66
0:03:02.046,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The Blackwing 602 is famous for being used by a lot of writers,

67
0:03:06.449,000 --> 0:03:08,000
especially John Steinbeck and Vladimir Nabokov.

68
0:03:09.433,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And then, you have the Dixon pencil company.

69
0:03:12.061,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They're responsible for the Dixon Ticonderoga.

70
0:03:15.022,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's an icon,

71
0:03:16.197,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it's what people think of when they think of a pencil

72
0:03:18.748,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and what they think of when they think of school.

73
0:03:21.195,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And the pencil's really a thing that, I think,

74
0:03:23.433,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the average user has never thought twice about,

75
0:03:25.934,000 --> 0:03:27,000
how it's made or why it's made the way it is,

76
0:03:28.103,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because it's just always been that way.

77
0:03:31.05,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In my opinion, there's nothing that can be done

78
0:03:33.308,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to make the pencil better than it is.

79
0:03:36.267,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's perfect.

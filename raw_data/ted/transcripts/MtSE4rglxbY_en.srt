1
0:00:12.771,000 --> 0:00:14,000
For me they normally happen, these career crises,

2
0:00:15.168,000 --> 0:00:17,000
often, actually, on a Sunday evening,

3
0:00:17.739,000 --> 0:00:18,000
just as the sun is starting to set,

4
0:00:19.636,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life

5
0:00:24.318,000 --> 0:00:25,000
starts to diverge so painfully

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that I normally end up weeping into a pillow.

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm mentioning all this --

8
0:00:30.689,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem;

9
0:00:34.396,000 --> 0:00:35,000
you may think I'm wrong in this,

10
0:00:35.956,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated

11
0:00:39.563,000 --> 0:00:42,000
by career crises, by moments when what we thought we knew --

12
0:00:42.729,000 --> 0:00:43,000
about our lives, about our careers --

13
0:00:44.563,000 --> 0:00:47,000
comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality.

14
0:00:48.016,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living.

15
0:00:51.793,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's perhaps harder than ever before

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
I want to look now, if I may, at some of the reasons

18
0:01:00.573,000 --> 0:01:03,000
why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers.

19
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Why we might be victims of these career crises,

20
0:01:06.423,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as we're weeping softly into our pillows.

21
0:01:10.393,000 --> 0:01:12,000
One of the reasons why we might be suffering

22
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is that we are surrounded by snobs.

23
0:01:15.742,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In a way, I've got some bad news,

24
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
particularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad.

25
0:01:20.946,000 --> 0:01:21,000
There's a real problem with snobbery,

26
0:01:22.748,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because sometimes people from outside the U.K.

27
0:01:24.938,000 --> 0:01:26,000
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,

28
0:01:27.669,000 --> 0:01:29,000
fixated on country houses and titles.

29
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The bad news is that's not true.

30
0:01:31.848,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Snobbery is a global phenomenon; we are a global organization,

31
0:01:34.848,000 --> 0:01:35,000
this is a global phenomenon.

32
0:01:36.229,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What is a snob?

33
0:01:37.888,000 --> 0:01:4,000
A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you,

34
0:01:41.221,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.

35
0:01:44.61,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That is snobbery.

36
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery.

37
0:01:50.509,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You encounter it within minutes at a party, when you get asked

38
0:01:53.78,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that famous iconic question of the early 21st century,

39
0:01:56.971,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"What do you do?"

40
0:01:58.168,000 --> 0:02:,000
According to how you answer that question,

41
0:02:00.193,000 --> 0:02:02,000
people are either incredibly delighted to see you,

42
0:02:02.551,000 --> 0:02:04,000
or look at their watch and make their excuses.

43
0:02:04.757,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:05.797,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, the opposite of a snob is your mother.

45
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Not necessarily your mother, or indeed mine,

47
0:02:13.161,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but, as it were, the ideal mother,

48
0:02:14.82,000 --> 0:02:16,000
somebody who doesn't care about your achievements.

49
0:02:17.192,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Unfortunately, most people are not our mothers.

50
0:02:19.414,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Most people make a strict correlation between how much time,

51
0:02:22.256,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and if you like, love --

52
0:02:23.673,000 --> 0:02:25,000
not romantic love, though that may be something --

53
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but love in general, respect -- they are willing to accord us,

54
0:02:29.479,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy.

55
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers

56
0:02:36.423,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and indeed start caring so much about material goods.

57
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times,

58
0:02:43.423,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that we're all greedy people.

59
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I don't think we are particularly materialistic.

60
0:02:47.47,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards

61
0:02:51.922,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to the acquisition of material goods.

62
0:02:54.158,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want.

63
0:02:57.112,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.

64
0:02:59.144,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think,

65
0:03:02.129,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"This is somebody who's greedy."

66
0:03:03.977,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Think, "This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love."

67
0:03:07.719,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Feel sympathy, rather than contempt.

69
0:03:13.587,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There are other reasons --

70
0:03:15.119,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
There are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before.

72
0:03:20.106,000 --> 0:03:21,000
One of these, and it's paradoxical,

73
0:03:21.806,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because it's linked to something that's rather nice,

74
0:03:24.34,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is the hope we all have for our careers.

75
0:03:26.41,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Never before have expectations been so high

76
0:03:28.532,000 --> 0:03:3,000
about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan.

77
0:03:31.279,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything.

78
0:03:34.332,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We've done away with the caste system,

79
0:03:36.239,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please.

80
0:03:39.954,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And it's a beautiful idea.

81
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality;

82
0:03:44.637,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we're all basically equal.

83
0:03:46.018,000 --> 0:03:5,000
There are no strictly defined hierarchies.

84
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There is one really big problem with this,

85
0:03:52.646,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and that problem is envy.

86
0:03:54.679,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,

87
0:03:56.966,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy.

88
0:04:00.47,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And it's linked to the spirit of equality.

89
0:04:03.161,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Let me explain.

90
0:04:04.336,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I think it would be very unusual for anyone here, or anyone watching,

91
0:04:07.621,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to be envious of the Queen of England.

92
0:04:09.517,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Even though she is much richer than any of you are,

93
0:04:12.778,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and she's got a very large house,

94
0:04:15.064,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird.

95
0:04:18.746,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:19.778,000 --> 0:04:2,000
She's simply too strange.

97
0:04:21.159,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We can't relate to her, she speaks in a funny way,

98
0:04:23.564,000 --> 0:04:24,000
she comes from an odd place.

99
0:04:24.961,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So we can't relate to her,

100
0:04:26.358,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and when you can't relate to somebody, you don't envy them.

101
0:04:29.28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The closer two people are -- in age, in background,

102
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in the process of identification -- the more there's a danger of envy,

103
0:04:35.502,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion,

104
0:04:39.001,000 --> 0:04:43,000
because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with.

105
0:04:43.124,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school.

106
0:04:46.686,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Everybody's wearing jeans, everybody's the same.

107
0:04:48.98,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And yet, they're not.

108
0:04:50.159,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality,

109
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
which can make for a very stressful situation.

110
0:04:55.875,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays

111
0:04:58.224,000 --> 0:04:59,000
become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,

112
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
as it was unlikely in the 17th century

113
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy.

114
0:05:05.426,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But the point is, it doesn't feel that way.

115
0:05:07.498,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets,

116
0:05:10.588,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that if you've got energy, a few bright ideas about technology, a garage --

117
0:05:14.468,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you, too, could start a major thing.

118
0:05:16.923,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:18.302,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops.

120
0:05:21.565,000 --> 0:05:24,000
When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections,

121
0:05:24.78,000 --> 0:05:25,000
as I sometimes do --

122
0:05:25.984,000 --> 0:05:28,000
if you analyze self-help books produced in the world today,

123
0:05:29.094,000 --> 0:05:3,000
there are basically two kinds.

124
0:05:30.565,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The first kind tells you, "You can do it! You can make it! Anything's possible!"

125
0:05:34.375,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call "low self-esteem,"

126
0:05:38.995,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or impolitely call, "feeling very bad about yourself."

127
0:05:41.646,000 --> 0:05:42,000
There's a real correlation

128
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
between a society that tells people that they can do anything,

129
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and the existence of low self-esteem.

130
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So that's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback.

131
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious --

132
0:05:56.509,000 --> 0:05:59,000
about our careers, about our status in the world today, than ever before.

133
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And it's, again, linked to something nice.

134
0:06:02.232,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And that nice thing is called meritocracy.

135
0:06:04.954,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Everybody, all politicians on Left and Right,

136
0:06:07.28,000 --> 0:06:09,000
agree that meritocracy is a great thing,

137
0:06:09.521,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and we should all be trying to make our societies really, really meritocratic.

138
0:06:13.691,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In other words -- what is a meritocratic society?

139
0:06:17.034,000 --> 0:06:21,000
A meritocratic society is one in which, if you've got talent and energy and skill,

140
0:06:21.184,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you will get to the top, nothing should hold you back.

141
0:06:23.78,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's a beautiful idea.

142
0:06:24.966,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The problem is, if you really believe in a society

143
0:06:28.314,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where those who merit to get to the top, get to the top,

144
0:06:31.006,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you'll also, by implication, and in a far more nasty way,

145
0:06:34.035,000 --> 0:06:37,000
believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom

146
0:06:37.756,000 --> 0:06:39,000
also get to the bottom and stay there.

147
0:06:40.003,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental,

148
0:06:43.375,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but merited and deserved.

149
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that makes failure seem much more crushing.

150
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You know, in the Middle Ages, in England,

151
0:06:50.562,000 --> 0:06:51,000
when you met a very poor person,

152
0:06:52.458,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that person would be described as an "unfortunate" --

153
0:06:55.346,000 --> 0:06:58,000
literally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.

154
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Nowadays, particularly in the United States,

155
0:07:01.28,000 --> 0:07:03,000
if you meet someone at the bottom of society,

156
0:07:03.447,000 --> 0:07:05,000
they may unkindly be described as a "loser."

157
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser,

158
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and that shows 400 years of evolution in society

159
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and our belief in who is responsible for our lives.

160
0:07:15.281,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's no longer the gods, it's us. We're in the driving seat.

161
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
That's exhilarating if you're doing well,

162
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and very crushing if you're not.

163
0:07:22.036,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It leads, in the worst cases --

164
0:07:23.602,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim --

165
0:07:26.593,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it leads to increased rates of suicide.

166
0:07:28.924,000 --> 0:07:31,000
There are more suicides in developed, individualistic countries

167
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
than in any other part of the world.

168
0:07:33.925,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And some of the reason for that

169
0:07:35.523,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is that people take what happens to them extremely personally --

170
0:07:38.616,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they own their success, but they also own their failure.

171
0:07:42.159,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Is there any relief from some of these pressures

172
0:07:44.47,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that I've been outlining?

173
0:07:45.831,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I think there is.

174
0:07:47.014,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I just want to turn to a few of them.

175
0:07:48.804,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Let's take meritocracy.

176
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to,

177
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.

178
0:07:55.992,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I will support any politician of Left and Right,

179
0:07:58.268,000 --> 0:08:,000
with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;

180
0:08:00.586,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I am a meritocrat in that sense.

181
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But I think it's insane to believe

182
0:08:03.856,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic;

183
0:08:07.337,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it's an impossible dream.

184
0:08:08.595,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded,

185
0:08:12.08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the good at the top, bad at the bottom,

186
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:16,000
exactly done as it should be, is impossible.

187
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
There are simply too many random factors:

188
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
accidents, accidents of birth,

189
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
accidents of things dropping on people's heads, illnesses, etc.

190
0:08:23.184,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We will never get to grade them,

191
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
never get to grade people as they should.

192
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I'm drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"

193
0:08:30.327,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where he says, "It's a sin to judge any man by his post."

194
0:08:34.764,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In modern English that would mean

195
0:08:36.43,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to,

196
0:08:39.178,000 --> 0:08:4,000
dependent on their business card.

197
0:08:40.785,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's not the post that should count.

198
0:08:42.56,000 --> 0:08:45,000
According to St. Augustine, only God can really put everybody in their place;

199
0:08:46.364,000 --> 0:08:48,000
he's going to do that on the Day of Judgment,

200
0:08:48.523,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with angels and trumpets, and the skies will open.

201
0:08:50.929,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Insane idea, if you're a secularist person, like me.

202
0:08:53.46,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But something very valuable in that idea, nevertheless.

203
0:08:56.104,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In other words, hold your horses when you're coming to judge people.

204
0:08:59.46,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is.

205
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That is an unknown part of them,

206
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we shouldn't behave as though it is known.

207
0:09:07.379,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this.

208
0:09:10.204,000 --> 0:09:13,000
When we think about failing in life, when we think about failure,

209
0:09:13.353,000 --> 0:09:14,000
one of the reasons why we fear failing

210
0:09:15.219,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is not just a loss of income, a loss of status.

211
0:09:17.518,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others.

212
0:09:20.285,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And it exists.

213
0:09:21.462,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The number one organ of ridicule, nowadays, is the newspaper.

214
0:09:25.042,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If you open the newspaper any day of the week,

215
0:09:27.255,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it's full of people who've messed up their lives.

216
0:09:29.595,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They've slept with the wrong person, taken the wrong substance,

217
0:09:32.612,000 --> 0:09:34,000
passed the wrong piece of legislation --

218
0:09:34.658,000 --> 0:09:36,000
whatever it is, and then are fit for ridicule.

219
0:09:36.85,000 --> 0:09:39,000
In other words, they have failed. And they are described as "losers."

220
0:09:40.159,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now, is there any alternative to this?

221
0:09:42.011,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative, which is tragedy.

222
0:09:46.631,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Tragic art, as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece,

223
0:09:49.877,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in the fifth century B.C., was essentially an art form

224
0:09:52.671,000 --> 0:09:54,000
devoted to tracing how people fail,

225
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and also according them a level of sympathy,

226
0:09:59.567,000 --> 0:10:02,000
which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them.

227
0:10:02.867,000 --> 0:10:04,000
A few years ago, I was thinking about this,

228
0:10:04.931,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and I went to "The Sunday Sport,"

229
0:10:06.55,000 --> 0:10:08,000
a tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading

230
0:10:09.184,000 --> 0:10:1,000
if you're not familiar with it already.

231
0:10:11.105,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:12.137,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And I went to talk to them

233
0:10:13.403,000 --> 0:10:15,000
about certain of the great tragedies of Western art.

234
0:10:16.168,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories,

235
0:10:19.777,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.

236
0:10:23.761,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I mentioned Othello; they'd not heard of it but were fascinated.

237
0:10:26.909,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:27.941,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I asked them to write a headline for the story.

239
0:10:30.267,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They came up with "Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."

240
0:10:33.73,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Splashed across the headline.

241
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.

242
0:10:37.184,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Again, a book they were enchanted to discover.

243
0:10:39.399,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."

244
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:45.2,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And then my favorite --

246
0:10:46.407,000 --> 0:10:49,000
they really do have a kind of genius of their own, these guys --

247
0:10:49.51,000 --> 0:10:51,000
my favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King:

248
0:10:51.628,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."

249
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

250
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Applause)

251
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
In a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy,

252
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
you've got the tabloid newspaper.

253
0:11:03.977,000 --> 0:11:06,000
At the other end of the spectrum, you've got tragedy and tragic art.

254
0:11:07.192,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit

255
0:11:09.99,000 --> 0:11:1,000
about what's happening in tragic art.

256
0:11:11.8,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.

257
0:11:14.522,000 --> 0:11:16,000
He is not a loser, though he has lost.

258
0:11:16.857,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And I think that is the message of tragedy to us,

259
0:11:19.518,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and why it's so very, very important, I think.

260
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety,

261
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human.

262
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We are the first society to be living in a world

263
0:11:31.772,000 --> 0:11:33,000
where we don't worship anything other than ourselves.

264
0:11:34.288,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We think very highly of ourselves, and so we should;

265
0:11:36.757,000 --> 0:11:39,000
we've put people on the Moon, done all sorts of extraordinary things.

266
0:11:40.074,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And so we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes.

267
0:11:43.391,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That's a very new situation.

268
0:11:44.978,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Most other societies have had, right at their center,

269
0:11:47.509,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the worship of something transcendent: a god, a spirit, a natural force,

270
0:11:50.954,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the universe, whatever it is -- something else that is being worshiped.

271
0:11:54.328,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We've slightly lost the habit of doing that,

272
0:11:56.424,000 --> 0:11:58,000
which is, I think, why we're particularly drawn to nature.

273
0:11:59.216,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Not for the sake of our health, though it's often presented that way,

274
0:12:02.496,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but because it's an escape from the human anthill.

275
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's an escape from our own competition,

276
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and our own dramas.

277
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans,

278
0:12:11.804,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters, etc.

279
0:12:15.779,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We like to feel in contact with something that is non-human,

280
0:12:19.382,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and that is so deeply important to us.

281
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
What I think I've been talking about really is success and failure.

282
0:12:26.375,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And one of the interesting things about success

283
0:12:28.828,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is that we think we know what it means.

284
0:12:30.836,000 --> 0:12:33,000
If I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful,

285
0:12:34.257,000 --> 0:12:36,000
certain ideas would immediately come to mind.

286
0:12:36.658,000 --> 0:12:38,000
You'd think that person might have made a lot of money,

287
0:12:39.332,000 --> 0:12:4,000
achieved renown in some field.

288
0:12:41.264,000 --> 0:12:42,000
My own theory of success --

289
0:12:42.617,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I'm somebody who's very interested in success,

290
0:12:44.8,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I really want to be successful,

291
0:12:46.305,000 --> 0:12:48,000
always thinking, how can I be more successful?

292
0:12:48.511,000 --> 0:12:51,000
But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced about what that word "success" might mean.

293
0:12:52.865,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Here's an insight that I've had about success:

294
0:12:55.103,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You can't be successful at everything.

295
0:12:57.008,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance.

296
0:12:59.295,000 --> 0:13:,000
Nonsense.

297
0:13:00.47,000 --> 0:13:01,000
You can't have it all. You can't.

298
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on,

299
0:13:06.659,000 --> 0:13:07,000
where the element of loss is.

300
0:13:08.36,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And I think any wise life will accept,

301
0:13:10.908,000 --> 0:13:13,000
as I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding.

302
0:13:14.708,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time,

303
0:13:17.74,000 --> 0:13:2,000
our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own.

304
0:13:21.654,000 --> 0:13:22,000
They're sucked in from other people;

305
0:13:23.393,000 --> 0:13:26,000
chiefly, if you're a man, your father, and if you're a woman, your mother.

306
0:13:27.021,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years.

307
0:13:30.41,000 --> 0:13:33,000
No one's quite listening hard enough, but I very much believe it's true.

308
0:13:33.941,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And we also suck in messages from everything from the television,

309
0:13:37.083,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to advertising, to marketing, etc.

310
0:13:38.893,000 --> 0:13:4,000
These are hugely powerful forces

311
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that define what we want and how we view ourselves.

312
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession,

313
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
a lot of us want to go into banking.

314
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
When banking is no longer so respectable, we lose interest in banking.

315
0:13:53.518,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We are highly open to suggestion.

316
0:13:56.6,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up

317
0:13:59.521,000 --> 0:14:,000
on our ideas of success,

318
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but we should make sure that they are our own.

319
0:14:03.375,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We should focus in on our ideas,

320
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and make sure that we own them;

321
0:14:07.915,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions.

322
0:14:10.36,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Because it's bad enough not getting what you want,

323
0:14:13.185,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want,

324
0:14:16.296,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and find out, at the end of the journey,

325
0:14:18.36,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along.

326
0:14:21.548,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So, I'm going to end it there.

327
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
But what I really want to stress is: by all means, success, yes.

328
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas.

329
0:14:30.756,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Let's probe away at our notions of success.

330
0:14:33.525,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own.

331
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Thank you very much.

332
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Applause)

333
0:14:54.858,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Chris Anderson: That was fascinating.

334
0:14:56.699,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But how do you reconcile this idea

335
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
of it being bad to think of someone as a "loser,"

336
0:15:04.954,000 --> 0:15:08,000
with the idea that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life,

337
0:15:09.816,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and that a society that encourages that,

338
0:15:12.745,000 --> 0:15:14,000
perhaps has to have some winners and losers?

339
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Alain De Botton: Yes, I think it's merely the randomness

340
0:15:17.835,000 --> 0:15:19,000
of the winning and losing process that I want to stress,

341
0:15:20.525,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything,

342
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and politicians always talk about justice.

343
0:15:26.185,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Now I'm a firm believer in justice, I just think that it's impossible.

344
0:15:29.617,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So we should do everything we can to pursue it,

345
0:15:33.244,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but we should always remember that whoever is facing us,

346
0:15:36.704,000 --> 0:15:38,000
whatever has happened in their lives,

347
0:15:38.871,000 --> 0:15:4,000
there will be a strong element of the haphazard.

348
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
That's what I'm trying to leave room for;

349
0:15:43.4,000 --> 0:15:45,000
otherwise, it can get quite claustrophobic.

350
0:15:45.49,000 --> 0:15:47,000
CA: I mean, do you believe that you can combine

351
0:15:47.739,000 --> 0:15:49,000
your kind of kinder, gentler philosophy of work

352
0:15:50.048,000 --> 0:15:53,000
with a successful economy?

353
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Or do you think that you can't,

354
0:15:54.966,000 --> 0:15:57,000
but it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that?

355
0:15:58.664,000 --> 0:15:59,000
AB: The nightmare thought

356
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them,

357
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and that somehow the crueler the environment,

358
0:16:07.596,000 --> 0:16:09,000
the more people will rise to the challenge.

359
0:16:09.985,000 --> 0:16:11,000
You want to think, who would you like as your ideal dad?

360
0:16:12.954,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle.

361
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And it's a very hard line to make.

362
0:16:18.397,000 --> 0:16:21,000
We need fathers, as it were, the exemplary father figures in society,

363
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
avoiding the two extremes,

364
0:16:24.607,000 --> 0:16:27,000
which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand,

365
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and on the other, the lax, no-rules option.

366
0:16:32.985,000 --> 0:16:33,000
CA: Alain De Botton.

367
0:16:34.382,000 --> 0:16:35,000
AB: Thank you very much.

368
0:16:36.161,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Applause)

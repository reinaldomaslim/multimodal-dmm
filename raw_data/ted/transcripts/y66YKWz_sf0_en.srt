0:00:16.521,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Five years ago, I experienced a bit

3
0:00:19.043,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.

4
0:00:22.379,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,

5
0:00:25.042,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to teach a communications class for engineering students.

6
0:00:28.382,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I was scared. (Laughter)

7
0:00:30.988,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains

8
0:00:34.659,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.

9
0:00:38.366,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But as these conversations unfolded,

10
0:00:41.571,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I experienced what Alice must have when she went down

11
0:00:44.479,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.

12
0:00:48.656,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations

13
0:00:51.267,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with the students. I was amazed at the ideas

14
0:00:54.016,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.

15
0:00:58.982,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I believe the key to opening that door

16
0:01:01.613,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is great communication.

17
0:01:02.903,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We desperately need great communication from our

18
0:01:05.787,000 --> 0:01:08,000
scientists and engineers in order to change the world.

19
0:01:08.846,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Our scientists and engineers are the ones

20
0:01:11.736,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy

21
0:01:14.902,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to environment to health care, among others,

22
0:01:17.907,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and if we don't know about it and understand it,

23
0:01:21.069,000 --> 0:01:24,000
then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility

24
0:01:24.077,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as non-scientists to have these interactions.

25
0:01:27.028,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists

26
0:01:30.188,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.

27
0:01:33.422,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.

28
0:01:38.901,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that

29
0:01:41.388,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy

30
0:01:45.463,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and that your engineering is engaging.

31
0:01:48.063,000 --> 0:01:51,000
First question to answer for us: so what?

32
0:01:51.796,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.

33
0:01:55.751,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,

34
0:01:58.381,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones

35
0:02:02.278,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.

36
0:02:06.891,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.

37
0:02:11.397,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.

38
0:02:15.273,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say

39
0:02:18.349,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?

40
0:02:21.775,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.

41
0:02:26.923,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything

42
0:02:29.7,000 --> 0:02:32,000
as simple as possible, but no simpler.

43
0:02:33.134,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You can clearly communicate your science

44
0:02:35.907,000 --> 0:02:37,000
without compromising the ideas.

45
0:02:38.594,000 --> 0:02:41,000
A few things to consider are having examples, stories

46
0:02:42.539,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and analogies. Those are ways to engage

47
0:02:44.244,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and excite us about your content.

48
0:02:46.426,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.

49
0:02:52.739,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)

50
0:02:56.592,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What do bullets do? Bullets kill,

51
0:02:58.96,000 --> 0:03:,000
and they will kill your presentation.

52
0:03:01.272,000 --> 0:03:05,000
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much

53
0:03:05.451,000 --> 0:03:08,000
on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.

54
0:03:09.178,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is

55
0:03:13.082,000 --> 0:03:15,000
much more effective. It's showing that the special structure

56
0:03:15.964,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired

57
0:03:19.628,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.

58
0:03:22.483,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence

59
0:03:26.163,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,

60
0:03:29.215,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses

61
0:03:32.493,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and create a deeper sense of understanding

62
0:03:34.907,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of what's being described.

63
0:03:36.546,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So I think these are just a few keys that can help

64
0:03:39.396,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland

65
0:03:42.918,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that is science and engineering.

66
0:03:45.134,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And because the engineers that I've worked with have

67
0:03:47.583,000 --> 0:03:5,000
taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,

68
0:03:51.383,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)

69
0:03:54.336,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Take your science, subtract your bullet points

70
0:03:58.581,000 --> 0:04:,000
and your jargon, divide by relevance,

71
0:04:01.359,000 --> 0:04:03,000
meaning share what's relevant to the audience,

72
0:04:03.806,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and multiply it by the passion that you have for

73
0:04:06.597,000 --> 0:04:08,000
this incredible work that you're doing,

74
0:04:08.82,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and that is going to equal incredible interactions

75
0:04:11.598,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that are full of understanding.

76
0:04:14.072,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved

77
0:04:17.534,000 --> 0:04:22,000
this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)

78
0:04:22.63,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Thank you. (Applause)

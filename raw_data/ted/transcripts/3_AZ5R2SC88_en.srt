1
0:00:12.903,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When I was growing up, I really liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.

2
0:00:18.383,000 --> 0:00:22,000
One time, though, I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot,

3
0:00:22.492,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I fell and broke my arm.

4
0:00:25.395,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso.

5
0:00:30.178,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It was taken off six weeks later, but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,

6
0:00:34.323,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it,

7
0:00:37.376,000 --> 0:00:39,000
100 times per day, seven days per week.

8
0:00:41.021,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I barely did it, because I found it boring and painful,

9
0:00:44.063,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and as a result, it took me another six weeks to get better.

10
0:00:48.684,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Many years later, my mom developed frozen shoulder,

11
0:00:51.548,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder.

12
0:00:56.044,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers

13
0:00:59.155,000 --> 0:01:02,000
suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food.

14
0:01:03.474,000 --> 0:01:05,000
She went each week to physical therapy, but just like me,

15
0:01:06.283,000 --> 0:01:07,000
she barely followed the home treatment,

16
0:01:08.187,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it took her over five months to feel better.

17
0:01:11.848,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Both my mom and I required physical therapy,

18
0:01:14.503,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises

19
0:01:17.266,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury.

20
0:01:21.794,000 --> 0:01:23,000
At first, a physical therapist works with patients,

21
0:01:24.171,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but then it's up to the patients to do their exercises at home.

22
0:01:27.134,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But patients find physical therapy boring, frustrating, confusing

23
0:01:30.923,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and lengthy before seeing results.

24
0:01:33.844,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Sadly, patient noncompliance can be as high as 70 percent.

25
0:01:38.837,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This means the majority of patients don't do their exercises

26
0:01:42.226,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and therefore take a lot longer to get better.

27
0:01:46.011,000 --> 0:01:48,000
All physical therapists agree that special exercises

28
0:01:48.797,000 --> 0:01:5,000
reduce the time needed for recovery,

29
0:01:50.957,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but patients lack the motivation to do them.

30
0:01:54.393,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So together with three friends, all of us software geeks,

31
0:01:58.898,000 --> 0:02:,000
we asked ourselves,

32
0:02:00.987,000 --> 0:02:04,000
wouldn't it be interesting if patients could play their way to recovery?

33
0:02:05.585,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We started building MIRA, A P.C. software platform

34
0:02:08.441,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that uses this Kinect device, a motion capture camera,

35
0:02:11.339,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to transform traditional exercises into video games.

36
0:02:15.702,000 --> 0:02:19,000
My physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy.

37
0:02:20.364,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Let's see how this looks.

38
0:02:25.867,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The first game asks me to fly a bee up and down

39
0:02:28.746,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to gather pollen to deposit in beehives,

40
0:02:31.277,000 --> 0:02:33,000
all while avoiding the other bugs.

41
0:02:33.738,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion,

42
0:02:36.964,000 --> 0:02:39,000
just like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off.

43
0:02:41.865,000 --> 0:02:44,000
When designing a game, we speak to physical therapists at first

44
0:02:44.929,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to understand what movement patients need to do.

45
0:02:47.856,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We then make that a video game

46
0:02:49.527,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to give patients simple, motivating objectives to follow.

47
0:02:53.312,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But the software is very customizable,

48
0:02:55.239,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and physical therapists can also create their own exercises.

49
0:02:59.192,000 --> 0:03:,000
Using the software, my physical therapist

50
0:03:01.183,000 --> 0:03:03,000
recorded herself performing a shoulder abduction,

51
0:03:03.471,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which is one of the movements my mom had to do

52
0:03:05.664,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when she had frozen shoulder.

53
0:03:07.361,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I can follow my therapist's example on the left side of the screen,

54
0:03:10.819,000 --> 0:03:13,000
while on the right, I see myself doing the recommended movement.

55
0:03:14.511,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I feel more engaged and confident,

56
0:03:16.554,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as I'm exercising alongside my therapist

57
0:03:19.015,000 --> 0:03:22,000
with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me.

58
0:03:22.87,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This basically extends the application for physical therapists

59
0:03:25.795,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to create whatever exercises they think are best.

60
0:03:30.323,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is an auction house game for preventing falls,

61
0:03:33.574,000 --> 0:03:35,000
designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance.

62
0:03:36.569,000 --> 0:03:38,000
As a patient, I need to do sit and stand movements,

63
0:03:39.564,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and when I stand up,

64
0:03:41.422,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I bid for the items I want to buy.

65
0:03:43.767,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:47,000
In two days, my grandmother will be 82 years old,

67
0:03:48.875,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and there's a 50 percent chance for people over 80

68
0:03:51.29,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to fall at least once per year,

69
0:03:53.171,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which could lead to a broken hip or even worse.

70
0:03:56.259,000 --> 0:04:,000
Poor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls,

71
0:04:00.415,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so reversing these problems through targeted exercise

72
0:04:03.526,000 --> 0:04:05,000
will help keep older people like my grandmother

73
0:04:06.196,000 --> 0:04:08,000
safer and independent for longer.

74
0:04:09.029,000 --> 0:04:11,000
When my schedule ends, MIRA briefly shows me

75
0:04:11.514,000 --> 0:04:14,000
how I progressed throughout my session.

76
0:04:15.553,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I have just shown you three different games

77
0:04:17.62,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for kids, adults and seniors.

78
0:04:20.113,000 --> 0:04:22,000
These can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients,

79
0:04:22.942,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but we'll soon have options for children with autism,

80
0:04:25.886,000 --> 0:04:27,000
mental health or speech therapy.

81
0:04:28.661,000 --> 0:04:3,000
My physical therapist can go back to my profile

82
0:04:30.999,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and see the data gathered during my sessions.

83
0:04:33.99,000 --> 0:04:35,000
She can see how much I moved, how many points I scored,

84
0:04:36.66,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with what speed I moved my joints,

85
0:04:38.61,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and so on.

86
0:04:39.841,000 --> 0:04:42,000
My physical therapist can use all of this to adapt my treatment.

87
0:04:43.881,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I'm so pleased this version is now in use

88
0:04:45.947,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in over 10 clinics across Europe and the U.S.,

89
0:04:49.244,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we're working on the home version.

90
0:04:51.197,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment

91
0:04:55.67,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and help patients play their way to recovery at home.

92
0:05:00.03,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy,

93
0:05:03.473,000 --> 0:05:06,000
then we would have been more successful following the treatment,

94
0:05:06.519,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner.

95
0:05:10.049,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Thank you.

96
0:05:11.651,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Applause)

97
0:05:14.031,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me what hardware is this

98
0:05:17.607,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that they're rapidly putting away?

99
0:05:19.47,000 --> 0:05:21,000
What is that made of, and how much does it cost?

100
0:05:21.71,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Cosmin Milhau: So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,

101
0:05:24.789,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but you just need a computer and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars.

102
0:05:28.534,000 --> 0:05:31,000
TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing that people use for their Xboxes

103
0:05:31.981,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to do 3D games, right?

104
0:05:33.052,000 --> 0:05:36,000
CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox, you only need a camera.

105
0:05:36.113,000 --> 0:05:38,000
TR: Right, so this is less than a $1,000 solution.

106
0:05:38.875,000 --> 0:05:4,000
CM: Definitely, 400 dollars, you can definitely use it.

107
0:05:41.458,000 --> 0:05:43,000
TR: So right now, you're doing clinical trials in clinics.

108
0:05:44.254,000 --> 0:05:44,000
CM: Yes.

109
0:05:44.993,000 --> 0:05:46,000
TR: And then the hope is to get it so it's a home version

110
0:05:47.713,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I can do my exercise remotely,

111
0:05:49.392,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and the therapist at the clinic can see how I'm doing and stuff like that.

112
0:05:52.922,000 --> 0:05:53,000
CM: Exactly.

113
0:05:53.989,000 --> 0:05:54,000
TR: Cool. Thanks so much. CM: Thank you.

114
0:05:55.843,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Applause)

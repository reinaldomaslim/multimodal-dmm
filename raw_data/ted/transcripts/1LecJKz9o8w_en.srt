1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm going to read a few strips.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
These are, most of these are

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
from a monthly page I do

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in and architecture and design magazine

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
called Metropolis.

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And the first story is called

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"The Faulty Switch."

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Another beautifully designed new building

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.

10
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's fine during the day

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But at dusk

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
everything changes.

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The architect spent hundreds of hours

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
designing the burnished brass switchplates

16
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for his new office tower.

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And then left it to a contractor

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to install these 79-cent switches behind them.

19
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We know instinctively where to reach

20
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
when we enter a dark room.

21
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But the sound we are greeted with,

23
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as the room is bathed in the simulated glow

24
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of late-afternoon light,

25
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
recalls to mind

26
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a dirty men's room

27
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the rear of a Greek coffee shop.

28
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This sound colors our first impression of any room;

30
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it can't be helped.

31
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But where does this sound,

32
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
commonly described as a click, come from?

33
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Is it simply the byproduct of a

34
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
crude mechanical action?

35
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Or is it an imitation

36
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
of one half the set of sounds we make

37
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to express disappointment?

38
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The often dental consonant

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of no Indo-European language.

40
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Or is it the amplified sound

41
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of a synapse firing

42
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in the brain of a cockroach?

43
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In the 1950s they tried their best

44
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to muffle this sound

45
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
with mercury switches

46
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and silent knob controls.

47
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But today these improvements

48
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
seem somehow inauthentic.

49
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The click is the modern

50
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
triumphal clarion

51
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
proceeding us through life,

52
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
announcing our entry into every lightless room.

53
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The sound made flicking a wall switch off

54
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is of a completely different nature.

55
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It has a deep melancholy ring.

56
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Children don't like it.

57
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter)

58
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Adults find it comforting.

59
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But wouldn't it be an easy matter

60
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to wire a wall switch

61
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?

62
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster?

63
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Or the distant peel of thunder?

64
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Thomas Edison went through

65
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
thousands of unlikely substances

66
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
before he came upon the right one

67
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for the filament of his electric light bulb.

68
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Why have we settled so quickly

69
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for the sound of its switch?

70
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
That's the end of that.

71
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Applause)

72
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The next story is called

73
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"In Praise of the Taxpayer."

74
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers

75
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
have survived yet another commercial building boom,

76
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is cause for celebration.

77
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
These one or two story structures,

78
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
designed to yield only enough income

79
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to cover the taxes on the land

80
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
on which they stand,

81
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
were not meant to be permanent buildings.

82
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Yet for one reason or another

83
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
they have confounded the efforts of developers

84
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to be combined into lots

85
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
suitable for high-rise construction.

86
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Although they make no claim to architectural beauty,

87
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
they are, in their perfect temporariness,

88
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
a delightful alternative

89
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to the large-scale structures

90
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that might someday take their place.

91
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The most perfect examples

92
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
occupy corner lots.

93
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They offer a pleasant respite

94
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from the high-density development around them.

95
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
A break of light and air,

96
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
an architectural biding of time.

97
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So buried in signage

98
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
are these structures,

99
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that it often takes a moment

100
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to distinguish the modern

101
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
specially constructed taxpayer

102
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
from its neighbor:

103
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the small commercial building

104
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
from an earlier century,

105
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
whose upper floors have been sealed,

106
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and whose groundfloor space

107
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
now functions as a taxpayer.

108
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The few surfaces not covered by signs

109
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
are often clad in a distinctive, dark

110
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
green-gray, striated aluminum siding.

111
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Take-out sandwich shops,

112
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
film processing drop-offs,

113
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
peep-shows and necktie stores.

114
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now these provisional structures have,

115
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in some cases,

116
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
remained standing

117
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
for the better part of a human lifetime.

118
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The temporary building

119
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
is a triumph of modern industrial organization,

120
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
a healthy sublimation

121
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of the urge to build,

122
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and proof that not every

123
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
architectural idea

124
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
need be set in stone.

125
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That's the end.

126
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And the next story is called, "On the Human Lap."

128
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
For the ancient Egyptians

129
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the lap was a platform

130
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
upon which to place

131
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the earthly possessions of the dead --

132
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
30 cubits from foot to knee.

133
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It was not until the 14th century

134
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that an Italian painter

135
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
recognized the lap

136
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
as a Grecian temple,

137
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
upholstered in flesh and cloth.

138
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Over the next 200 years

139
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we see the infant Christ

140
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
go from a sitting to a standing position

141
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
on the Virgin's lap,

142
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and then back again.

143
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Every child recapitulates this ascension,

144
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
straddling one or both legs,

145
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
sitting sideways,

146
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or leaning against the body.

147
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
From there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy,

148
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is but a brief moment in history.

149
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You were late for school again this morning.

150
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The ventriloquist must first make us believe

151
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that a small boy is sitting on his lap.

152
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The illusion of speech follows incidentally.

153
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?

154
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
As adults we admire the lap

155
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
from a nostalgic distance.

156
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We have fading memories

157
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of that provisional temple,

158
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
erected each time an adult sat down.

159
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.

160
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It is children and teenage girls

161
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who are most keenly aware

162
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
of its architectural beauty.

163
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They understand the structural integrity

164
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of a deep avuncular lap,

165
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
as compared to the shaky arrangement

166
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
of a neurotic niece in high heels.

167
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The relationship between the lap and its owner

168
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is direct and intimate.

169
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I envision a 36-story,

170
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
450-unit residential high-rise --

171
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a reason to consider the mental health

172
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of any architect before granting

173
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
an important commission.

174
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The bathrooms and kitchens will,

175
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
of course, have no windows.

176
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The lap of luxury

177
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is an architectural construct of childhood,

178
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
which we seek, in vain,

179
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
as adults, to employ.

180
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
That's the end.

181
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection"

183
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
A nondescript warehouse,

184
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
visible for a moment

185
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway,

186
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
serves as the temporary resting place

187
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
for the Haverpiece collection

188
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
of European dried fruit.

189
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The profound convolutions

190
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
on the surface of a dried cherry.

191
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.

192
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Do you remember wandering as a child

193
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
through those dark wooden

194
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
storefront galleries?

195
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Where everything was displayed

196
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in poorly labeled roach-proof bins.

197
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Pears dried in the form

198
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
of genital organs.

199
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Apricot halves

200
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
like the ears of cherubim.

201
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
In 1962 the unsold stock

202
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece,

203
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a wealthy prune juice bottler,

204
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and consolidated to form the core collection.

205
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
As an art form it lies somewhere between

206
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
still-life painting and plumbing.

207
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Upon his death in 1967,

208
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a quarter of the items were sold off for compote

209
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to a high-class hotel restaurant.

210
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

211
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Unsuspecting guests were served

212
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
stewed turn-of-the-century

213
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Turkish figs for breakfast.

214
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The rest of the collection remains here,

216
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
stored in plain brown paper bags

217
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
until funds can be raised

218
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
to build a permanent museum

219
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and study center.

220
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
A shoe made of apricot leather

221
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
for the daughter of a czar.

222
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That's the end. Thank you.

223
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Applause)

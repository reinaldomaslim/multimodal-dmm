1
0:00:12.62,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I've spent nearly two decades

2
0:00:15.159,000 --> 0:00:18,000
observing what makes people luckier than others

3
0:00:18.736,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and trying to help people increase their luck.

4
0:00:22.855,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

5
0:00:25.771,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and we all know that most new ventures fail,

6
0:00:29.344,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.

7
0:00:34.026,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So what is luck?

8
0:00:35.34,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.

9
0:00:42.475,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Apparently.

10
0:00:43.866,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's the operative word.

11
0:00:46.533,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It looks like it's chance

12
0:00:48.566,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.

13
0:00:53.748,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But I've realized, by watching so long,

14
0:00:56.765,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

15
0:01:00.122,000 --> 0:01:01,000
isolated and dramatic.

16
0:01:02.429,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's much more like the wind,

17
0:01:04.839,000 --> 0:01:05,000
blowing constantly.

18
0:01:06.429,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Sometimes it's calm,

19
0:01:08.022,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and sometimes it blows in gusts,

20
0:01:10.147,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.

21
0:01:14.396,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So how do you catch the winds of luck?

22
0:01:17.796,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's easy, but it's not obvious.

23
0:01:20.845,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I'm going to share three things with you

24
0:01:23.819,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that you can do to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.

25
0:01:29.831,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The first thing you want to do

26
0:01:31.61,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is to change your relationship with yourself.

27
0:01:34.139,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

28
0:01:38.275,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.

29
0:01:42.639,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk or talk

30
0:01:45.902,000 --> 0:01:46,000
or ride a bike

31
0:01:47.084,000 --> 0:01:48,000
or even quantum mechanics. Right?

32
0:01:49.052,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike

33
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to, next week, someone who does.

34
0:01:53.807,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone

35
0:01:56.385,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and take some risks.

36
0:01:58.212,000 --> 0:02:,000
The problem is, as we get older,

37
0:02:00.355,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we rarely do this.

38
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We sort of lock down the sense of who we are

39
0:02:04.531,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and don't stretch anymore.

40
0:02:06.353,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, with my students,

41
0:02:07.975,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement

42
0:02:10.855,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.

43
0:02:13.967,000 --> 0:02:14,000
How do I do this?

44
0:02:15.156,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.

45
0:02:19.052,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class

46
0:02:21.856,000 --> 0:02:24,000
where they map out what risks they're willing to take.

47
0:02:24.91,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it becomes clear very quickly to them

48
0:02:27.838,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that risk-taking is not binary.

49
0:02:30.422,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There are intellectual risks and physical risks and financial risks

50
0:02:34.097,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.

51
0:02:38.109,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,

52
0:02:41.918,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they quickly realize that they're all really different.

53
0:02:46.186,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I then encourage them to stretch,

54
0:02:48.766,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.

55
0:02:51.679,000 --> 0:02:54,000
For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk

56
0:02:55.058,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;

57
0:02:58.146,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;

58
0:03:02.669,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or an emotional risk,

59
0:03:04.424,000 --> 0:03:06,000
maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.

60
0:03:08.486,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I do this myself all the time.

61
0:03:11.466,000 --> 0:03:13,000
About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane,

62
0:03:13.895,000 --> 0:03:15,000
early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.

63
0:03:16.68,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And normally, I would just put on my headphones

64
0:03:22.426,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,

65
0:03:24.381,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but I decided to take a little risk,

66
0:03:26.164,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.

67
0:03:29.046,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I introduced myself, and I learned that he was a publisher.

68
0:03:33.875,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Interesting.

69
0:03:35.06,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We ended up having a fascinating conversation.

70
0:03:37.332,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.

71
0:03:40.149,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So about three quarters of the way through the flight,

72
0:03:43.364,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I decided to take another risk,

73
0:03:45.169,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and I opened up my laptop and I shared with him a book proposal

74
0:03:49.153,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I put together for something I was doing in my class.

75
0:03:53.153,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And he was very polite, he read it,

76
0:03:54.901,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and he said, "You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,

77
0:03:57.687,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but thank you so much for sharing."

78
0:03:59.378,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's OK. That risk didn't work out.

79
0:04:01.925,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I shut my laptop.

80
0:04:03.225,000 --> 0:04:06,000
At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.

81
0:04:07.774,000 --> 0:04:09,000
A couple of months later, I reached out to him,

82
0:04:10.21,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?

83
0:04:12.876,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I'm doing a project on reinventing the book,

84
0:04:15.654,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the future of publishing."

85
0:04:16.987,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."

86
0:04:18.869,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So he came to my class. We had a great experience.

87
0:04:21.228,000 --> 0:04:23,000
A few months later, I wrote to him again.

88
0:04:23.351,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips

89
0:04:26.041,000 --> 0:04:28,000
from another project my students had done.

90
0:04:29.128,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He was so intrigued

91
0:04:31.718,000 --> 0:04:33,000
by one of the projects the students had done,

92
0:04:33.924,000 --> 0:04:34,000
he thought there might be a book in it,

93
0:04:35.922,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and he wanted to meet those students.

94
0:04:38.404,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.

95
0:04:40.611,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:41.636,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me,

97
0:04:44.685,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but OK, it's all right.

98
0:04:45.86,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford

99
0:04:49.391,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.

100
0:04:53.667,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And one of his editors said to me,

101
0:04:55.487,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"

102
0:04:59.098,000 --> 0:05:,000
I said, "Funny you should ask."

103
0:05:00.939,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I pulled out the exact same proposal

104
0:05:04.058,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that I had showed his boss a year earlier.

105
0:05:07.446,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Within two weeks, I had a contract,

106
0:05:09.89,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.

107
0:05:14.295,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Applause)

108
0:05:16.405,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, you might say,

109
0:05:18.461,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Oh, you're so lucky."

110
0:05:19.834,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But of course I was lucky,

111
0:05:21.129,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,

112
0:05:25.477,000 --> 0:05:27,000
starting with saying hello.

113
0:05:27.771,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And anyone can do this,

114
0:05:30.184,000 --> 0:05:31,000
no matter where you are in your life,

115
0:05:31.971,000 --> 0:05:32,000
no matter where you are in the world --

116
0:05:33.855,000 --> 0:05:36,000
even if you think you're the most unlucky person,

117
0:05:37.165,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

118
0:05:41.478,000 --> 0:05:43,000
You start building a sail to capture luck.

119
0:05:44.785,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The second thing you want to do

120
0:05:46.552,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is to change your relationship with other people.

121
0:05:49.285,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You need to understand that everyone who helps you on your journey

122
0:05:54.675,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.

123
0:05:58.58,000 --> 0:06:,000
And if you don't show appreciation,

124
0:06:01.215,000 --> 0:06:03,000
not only are you not closing the loop,

125
0:06:03.524,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but you're missing an opportunity.

126
0:06:06.572,000 --> 0:06:08,000
When someone does something for you,

127
0:06:08.628,000 --> 0:06:09,000
they're taking that time

128
0:06:09.914,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that they could be spending on themselves or someone else,

129
0:06:13.138,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.

130
0:06:16.672,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,

131
0:06:20.965,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and they are very competitive to get into,

132
0:06:23.086,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and when I send out the letters to those students who don't get in,

133
0:06:26.351,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I always know there are going to be people who are disappointed.

134
0:06:29.376,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Some of the people who are disappointed send me notes, complaining.

135
0:06:32.58,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Some of them send notes

136
0:06:34.207,000 --> 0:06:37,000
saying what could I do to make myself more successful next time around?

137
0:06:37.679,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And every once in a while,

138
0:06:39.014,000 --> 0:06:42,000
someone sends me a note thanking me for the opportunity.

139
0:06:43.06,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This happened about seven years ago.

140
0:06:44.8,000 --> 0:06:46,000
A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying,

141
0:06:47.553,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"I know I've been rejected from this program twice,

142
0:06:50.832,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but I want to thank you for the opportunity.

143
0:06:52.956,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I learned so much through the process of applying."

144
0:06:56.385,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I was so taken by the graciousness of his message

145
0:07:00.284,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that I invited him to come and meet me.

146
0:07:02.394,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And we spent some time chatting and cooked up an idea

147
0:07:05.205,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for an independent study project together.

148
0:07:08.252,000 --> 0:07:09,000
He was on the football team at Stanford,

149
0:07:10.245,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and he decided to do a project on looking at leadership in that context.

150
0:07:14.546,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We got to know each other incredibly well through that quarter,

151
0:07:18.189,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and he took the project that he started working on

152
0:07:20.618,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in the independent study

153
0:07:21.952,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and turned it, ultimately, into a company called Play for Tomorrow,

154
0:07:26.456,000 --> 0:07:28,000
where he teaches kids from disadvantaged backgrounds

155
0:07:29.451,000 --> 0:07:31,000
how to, essentially, craft the lives they dream to live.

156
0:07:33.329,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, the important thing about this story

157
0:07:36.202,000 --> 0:07:39,000
is that we both ended up catching the winds of luck

158
0:07:39.346,000 --> 0:07:41,000
as a result of his thank-you note.

159
0:07:41.582,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But it was the winds that we didn't expect in the first place.

160
0:07:46.325,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Over the course of the last couple of years,

161
0:07:48.398,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I've come up with some tactics for my own life

162
0:07:51.43,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to help me really foster appreciation.

163
0:07:54.287,000 --> 0:07:57,000
My favorite is that at the end of every single day,

164
0:07:57.859,000 --> 0:08:,000
I look at my calendar and I review all the people I met with,

165
0:08:01.629,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and I send thank-you notes to every single person.

166
0:08:04.709,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It only takes a few minutes,

167
0:08:06.907,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but at the end of every day,

168
0:08:08.71,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I feel incredibly grateful and appreciative,

169
0:08:12.003,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and I promise you it has increased my luck.

170
0:08:15.387,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So first, you need to take some risks and get out of your comfort zone.

171
0:08:19.01,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Second, you need to show appreciation.

172
0:08:21.5,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.

173
0:08:26.39,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Most people look at new ideas that come there way and they judge them.

174
0:08:29.722,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea."

175
0:08:32.502,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But it's actually much more nuanced.

176
0:08:36.211,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Ideas are neither good or bad.

177
0:08:38.082,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas are often something truly remarkable.

178
0:08:44.219,000 --> 0:08:47,000
One of my favorite exercises in my classes on creativity

179
0:08:47.442,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is to help students foster an attitude of looking at terrible ideas

180
0:08:51.528,000 --> 0:08:54,000
through the lens of possibilities.

181
0:08:55.337,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So I give them a challenge:

182
0:08:57.498,000 --> 0:09:,000
to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.

183
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They have to come up with the best ideas for a new restaurant

184
0:09:04.198,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.

185
0:09:06.791,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So the best ideas are things like a restaurant on a mountaintop

186
0:09:10.274,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with a beautiful sunset,

187
0:09:11.833,000 --> 0:09:13,000
or a restaurant on a boat with a gorgeous view.

188
0:09:14.753,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And the terrible ideas are things like a restaurant in a garbage dump,

189
0:09:19.563,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or a restaurant with terrible service that's really dirty,

190
0:09:23.831,000 --> 0:09:26,000
or a restaurant that serves cockroach sushi.

191
0:09:27.277,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:28.625,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So they hand all the ideas to me,

193
0:09:30.769,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I read the great ideas out loud,

194
0:09:33.036,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and then I rip them up and throw them away.

195
0:09:36.593,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I then take the horrible ideas and redistribute them.

196
0:09:40.339,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible,

197
0:09:44.926,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant.

198
0:09:49.164,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Here's what happens.

199
0:09:51.084,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Within about 10 seconds, someone says, "This is a fabulous idea."

200
0:09:56.016,000 --> 0:10:,000
And they have about three minutes before they pitch the idea to the class.

201
0:10:00.682,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So the restaurant in the garbage dump? What does that turn into?

202
0:10:03.993,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Well, they collect all the extra food from Michelin star restaurants

203
0:10:08.177,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that was going to get thrown out,

204
0:10:10.505,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and they have another restaurant at a much lower price,

205
0:10:13.109,000 --> 0:10:14,000
with all the leftovers.

206
0:10:14.284,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Pretty cool?

207
0:10:15.465,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Or the restaurant that's dirty with terrible service?

208
0:10:18.869,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Well, that turns into a restaurant that's a training ground

209
0:10:22.612,000 --> 0:10:26,000
for future restauranteurs to figure out how to avoid all the pitfalls.

210
0:10:27.541,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?

211
0:10:29.502,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It turns into a sushi bar

212
0:10:31.656,000 --> 0:10:34,000
with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients.

213
0:10:36.102,000 --> 0:10:39,000
If you look around at the companies,

214
0:10:39.214,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the ventures that are really innovative around you,

215
0:10:42.285,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the ones that we now take for granted that have changed our life,

216
0:10:45.935,000 --> 0:10:46,000
well, you know what?

217
0:10:47.229,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They all started out as crazy ideas.

218
0:10:50.134,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They started ideas that when they pitched to other people,

219
0:10:52.887,000 --> 0:10:55,000
most people said, "That's crazy, it will never work."

220
0:10:58.275,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So, yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances,

221
0:11:04.067,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt

222
0:11:06.376,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible.

223
0:11:10.288,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But the winds of luck are always there,

224
0:11:14.264,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and if you're willing to take some risks,

225
0:11:17.343,000 --> 0:11:2,000
if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation

226
0:11:20.875,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy,

227
0:11:25.32,000 --> 0:11:26,000
through the lens of possibilities,

228
0:11:27.113,000 --> 0:11:31,000
you can build a bigger and bigger sail to catch the winds of luck.

229
0:11:31.872,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Thank you.

230
0:11:33.047,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
sharing some of the problems.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and making it kind of an annual thing.

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because I think there are some very important problems

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that don't get worked on naturally.

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,

10
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the communicators, the thinkers, the governments

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to do the right things.

12
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And only by paying attention to these things

13
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in

14
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
can we make as much progress as we need to.

15
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and talk about where they stand.

17
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.

18
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.

19
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.

20
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.

21
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,

22
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is to look at childhood deaths.

23
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,

24
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and 20 million of those died before the age of five.

25
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --

26
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.

27
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.

28
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's a phenomenal thing.

29
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Each one of those lives matters a lot.

30
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes

31
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but also a few key breakthroughs:

32
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
vaccines that were used more widely.

33
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
For example, measles was four million of the deaths

34
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
back as recently as 1990

35
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and now is under 400,000.

36
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So we really can make changes.

37
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.

38
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.

39
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Why? Well there's only a few diseases

40
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that account for the vast majority of those deaths:

41
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.

42
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,

43
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?

44
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Well, what's the history of this disease?

45
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.

46
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In fact, if we look at the genetic code,

47
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
it's the only disease we can see

48
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that people who lived in Africa

49
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.

50
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.

51
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So it was absolutely gigantic.

52
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And the disease was all over the world.

53
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.

54
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,

55
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.

56
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So it was everywhere.

57
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.

58
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.

59
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.

60
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And so that's why the death rate did come down.

61
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, ironically, what happened was

62
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,

63
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which is where the rich countries are.

64
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.

65
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
1945, it's still most places.

66
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.

67
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.

68
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.

69
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And so this leads to the paradox that

70
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because the disease is only in the poorer countries,

71
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it doesn't get much investment.

72
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs

73
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
than are put into malaria.

74
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.

75
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And rich men are afflicted.

77
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And so that's why that priority has been set.

78
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But, malaria --

79
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
even the million deaths a year caused by malaria

80
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
greatly understate its impact.

81
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.

82
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going

83
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because it just holds things back so much.

84
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.

85
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.

86
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.

87
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.

89
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

90
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Those mosquitos are not infected.

91
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.

92
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And bed nets are a great tool.

93
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,

94
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.

95
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT

96
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and those nets

97
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.

98
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And that's happened now in a number of countries.

99
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's great to see.

100
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But we have to be careful because malaria --

101
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.

102
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.

103
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And so you end up with two choices.

104
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,

105
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
you do it vigorously,

106
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you can actually get a local eradication.

107
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.

108
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,

109
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,

110
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but eventually those tools will become ineffective,

111
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and the death rate will soar back up again.

112
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.

113
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now we're on the upswing.

114
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Bed net funding is up.

115
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There's new drug discovery going on.

116
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial

117
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that starts in a couple months.

118
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.

119
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So we're going to have these new tools.

120
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But that alone doesn't give us the road map.

121
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Because the road map to get rid of this disease

122
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
involves many things.

123
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It involves communicators to keep the funding high,

124
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to keep the visibility high,

125
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to tell the success stories.

126
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It involves social scientists,

127
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,

128
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but 90 percent.

129
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,

130
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.

131
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.

132
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.

133
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And so as these elements come together,

134
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I'm quite optimistic

135
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that we will be able to eradicate malaria.

136
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now let me turn to a second question,

137
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.

138
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?

139
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,

140
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we'd understand very well.

141
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And the answer is, really, that we don't.

142
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Let's start with why this is important.

143
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.

144
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We all had a wonderful education.

145
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That's part of the reason we're here today,

146
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
part of the reason we're successful.

147
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.

148
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I had great teachers.

149
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.

150
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.

151
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.

152
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,

153
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.

154
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology

155
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and keep the U.S. at the forefront.

156
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent

157
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is starting to fade on a relative basis,

158
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.

159
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.

160
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now

161
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to people with a better education.

162
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we have to change this.

163
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.

164
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We have to change it so that the country is strong

165
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and stays at the forefront

166
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of things that are driven by advanced education,

167
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
like science and mathematics.

168
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
When I first learned the statistics,

169
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.

170
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.

171
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And that had been covered up for a long time

172
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because they always took the dropout rate as the number

173
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.

174
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.

175
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.

176
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They had to raise the stated dropout rate

177
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
as soon as that tracking was done

178
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to over 30 percent.

179
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.

180
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And even if you graduate from high school,

181
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
if you're low-income,

182
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.

183
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
If you're low-income in the United States,

184
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
you have a higher chance of going to jail

185
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
than you do of getting a four-year degree.

186
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.

187
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So, how do you make education better?

188
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.

189
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There's many people working on it.

190
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We've worked on small schools,

191
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we've funded scholarships,

192
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
we've done things in libraries.

193
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
A lot of these things had a good effect.

194
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers

195
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
was the very key thing.

196
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And we hooked up with some people studying

197
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
how much variation is there between teachers,

198
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --

199
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and the bottom quartile.

200
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?

201
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.

202
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --

203
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
based on test scores --

204
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
by over 10 percent in a single year.

205
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
What does that mean?

206
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,

207
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
had top quartile teachers,

208
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.

209
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.

210
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.

211
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.

212
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We should retain those people.

213
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."

214
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.

215
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
What are the characteristics of this top quartile?

216
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
What do they look like?

217
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You might think these must be very senior teachers.

218
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And the answer is no.

219
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Once somebody has taught for three years

220
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
their teaching quality does not change thereafter.

221
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The variation is very, very small.

222
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
You might think these are people with master's degrees.

223
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.

224
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This chart takes four different factors

225
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and says how much do they explain teaching quality.

226
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,

227
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is a master's degree.

228
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.

229
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
One is seniority.

230
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.

231
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.

232
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.

233
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Teach for America: slight effect.

234
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.

235
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.

236
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There are some people who are very good at this.

237
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And we've done almost nothing

238
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to study what that is

239
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and to draw it in and to replicate it,

240
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to raise the average capability --

241
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.

242
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"

243
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.

244
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And it's a system with very high turnover.

245
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.

246
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.

247
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.

248
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It's an unbelievable thing.

249
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --

250
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and what goes on is great teaching.

251
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
They take the poorest kids,

252
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.

253
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools

254
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
is very different than in the normal public schools.

255
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.

256
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
They're taking data, the test scores,

257
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."

258
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.

259
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,

260
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
at first it's very bizarre.

261
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"

262
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.

263
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.

264
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
What's going on?"

265
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,

266
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
which kids were bored,

267
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.

268
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It was a very dynamic environment,

269
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --

270
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
keeping people engaged and setting the tone

271
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,

272
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.

273
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Everybody needs to be involved.

274
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And so KIPP is doing it.

275
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
How does that compare to a normal school?

276
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.

277
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The data isn't gathered.

278
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
In the teacher's contract,

279
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --

280
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
sometimes to once per year.

281
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And they need advanced notice to do that.

282
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,

283
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
some of them just making crap

284
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,

285
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,

286
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."

287
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.

288
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
They don't have the test scores,

289
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.

290
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
For example, New York passed a law

291
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used

292
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
in the tenure decision for the teachers.

293
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.

294
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But I'm optimistic about this,

295
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I think there are some clear things we can do.

296
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,

297
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and that's given us the picture of where we are.

298
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,

299
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.

300
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
Of course, digital video is cheap now.

301
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Putting a few cameras in the classroom

302
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis

303
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
is very practical in all public schools.

304
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down

305
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.

306
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.

307
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"

308
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.

309
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,

310
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.

311
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
You can take those great courses and make them available

312
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.

313
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
If you have a kid who's behind,

314
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.

315
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,

316
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,

317
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.

318
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,

319
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
we can do it much better.

320
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --

321
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
the place that this is going on --

322
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."

323
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And I thought it was so fantastic.

324
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.

325
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.

326
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
(Applause)

327
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Now, we put a lot of money into education,

328
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right

329
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.

330
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --

331
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,

332
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and it was taken out in the Senate

333
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
because there are people who are threatened by these things.

334
0:18:56.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
But I -- I'm optimistic.

335
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,

336
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.

337
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
I only had time to frame those two problems.

338
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
There's a lot more problems like that --

339
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,

340
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
just at the very name of these things.

341
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.

342
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.

343
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.

344
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.

345
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
So it's going to take brilliant people like you

346
0:19:41.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
to study these things, get other people involved --

347
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
and you're helping to come up with solutions.

348
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.

349
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Thank you.

350
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
(Applause)
